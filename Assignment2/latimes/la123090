WHAT THEY AREN'T READING ON THE OTHER SIDE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the cramped stockroom of a tiny bookstore two blocks off Unter den Linden, 
East Berlin's wide and elegant east-west avenue, the young bookseller shrugged 
her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier, East Germany was a 'Land of Readers,' a country proud of its poets 
and playwrights," she said. "Everyone read, whenever there was time, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, it's not the same. People have other things to do." 
</P>
<P>
This was not an answer anyone might have expected. Before the wall dividing the 
two Germanys collapsed in late 1989, East German readers had to content 
themselves with those books both allowed by government censor and physically 
available -- Russian history and literature, German classics, carefully 
constructed studies of European history and the occasional translation of a 
Bellow or a P. D. James. All else -- from Nietzsche to Stephen King -- was 
simply not to be had. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the German Democratic Republic has ceased to exist and readers can 
select their own books for the first time in decades, one might be tempted to 
conclude that bookstores could not stock their shelves fast enough to meet the 
surging demand. The old East German hardbacks, with pages the color and 
consistency of a paper towel, would now serve as doorstops or, when stacked, as 
inexpensive and durable supports for outdoor remainder displays. The handsome 
Western editions, representing an entire world of fresh ideas, would meanwhile 
be finding their way into the most remote Saxon farmhouse. In other words, a 
reader's and a bookseller's dream. And yet -- as one can infer from 22-year-old 
bookseller Martina Nagora's lament -- it's closer to a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Across the former Communist state, book sales have dropped considerably since 
the government's demise. According to Bernhard Wosnitzka, manager of East 
Berlin's Das Internationale Buch, the largest bookstore in East Germany, his 
sales have fallen 20% in the last year. Buchhandlung am Bahnhof 
Friedrichstrasse, the much smaller store managed by Nagora, has experienced a 
50% reduction in sales. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly not want of books or service that's causing the drought. Das 
Internationale Buch, for instance, boasts an impressive selection of titles, 
from highly technical computer literature to the most sophisticated 
contemporary fiction. Only the better American bookstores offer as varied a 
menu. Eager to assist and advise, clerks stand almost at attention at 15-foot 
intervals -- perhaps a faint taste of old Prussia. The furnishings are plain 
with bare floors below and exposed wires overhead, but still attractive by East 
German standards. 
</P>
<P>
When customers do decide to buy books, they are taking home travel books, 
cookbooks, how-to books, children's books and foreign-language dictionaries and 
cassettes. Books representing 40 years' worth of previously unavailable 
history, science, literature and theology are, for the most part, collecting 
dust. In a land that can claim one of the world's most brilliant intellectual 
traditions, Walt Disney is preferred to Walter Benjamin, hot-pasta recipes to 
Cold War studies. 
</P>
<P>
In Nagora's shop, the top three categories of books sold are how-to books, such 
as the hugely popular "1,000 Completely Legal Ways to Reduce Your Taxes"; 
foreign-language dictionaries, especially German-English, and paperbacks of 
popular fiction by authors such as King, Danielle Steel, James Clavell and 
Ephraim Kishon, a Hungarian-born satirist somewhere between Woody Allen and 
Lewis Grizzard. Also in demand are travel books to all points beyond the German 
border, and colorful hardcover children's books: "Snow White," "Alice in 
Wonderland" and a whole series on "Alf." 
</P>
<P>
Among the more serious American authors now read are Salinger, Updike, Irving, 
Kerouac and Bukowski. Irving's "Garp" ranks third on the best-seller list at 
Das Internationale Buch. Asked why these specific authors -- whose best-known 
work dates from several years back -- are now of interest, Nagora said: "In the 
West, they are always waiting for new writers, the latest from Latin America, 
for example. Over here, they first have to read what they could not get 
earlier." 
</P>
<P>
One needn't probe too deeply to uncover possible explanations for the buying 
trends and slow sales. In the first place, East Germans don't have much money. 
The unemployment rate is soaring, and the salaries of those who do have jobs 
have not kept pace with sudden increases in the price of consumer goods, such 
as books. As recently as 14 months ago, a paperback could be had for the 
equivalent of $1; today, most cost about $6. Hardbacks sold for $8 then; now 
they start at $25. 
</P>
<P>
A second reason is that many of those people who earlier bought books are now 
vacationing in Venice, watching the 20 new channels on their new TVs and 
spending their money on videocassettes, bananas and pornography. A recent 
article in Die Zeit, a weekly West German newspaper, described the enormous 
success of Leipzig's first porn shop on its opening day of business. The shop 
took in enough money after 97 seconds of operation to pay its rent for the next 
month; by the end of the day, it had done about $13,000 worth of business. 
</P>
<P>
A third, perhaps related reason for waning book interest is the possibility 
that East Germans no longer need the written word to escape from the drudgery 
of life in a Communist state. Earlier, they swarmed to bookstores, libraries, 
cinemas and museums to rescue themselves from the cultural and spiritual vacuum 
that was the former East Germany. Today, there are other outlets for their 
frustrations and other merchandise for their marks. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in a country just awakening from a 40-year slumber, there must be 
little time for reading anything other than the most practical books. Feeding 
the family or heating a drafty apartment are more pressing matters these days. 
</P>
<P>
As uninviting as the bookselling climate may seem for the two East Berlin 
stores, they are actually the fortunate ones. Owned by a West German chain 
based in Bonn, they have enjoyed all the advantages of Western book-business 
know-how as well as financial backing to weather slower buying periods. A few 
subway stops in any direction from the city center lie bookstores whose homely 
interiors and meager offerings more accurately mirror the depressed economy. 
</P>
<P>
Wosnitzka and Nagora believe many of the country's 80-odd bookstores are on the 
verge of extinction. That is sad news indeed, especially for the cultural 
health of a country seeking to articulate a new identity. Books enrich as well 
as inform and entertain; unfortunately, they also cost money.

RICHARD EDER: AN AFTERTASTE OF IBERIAN UNREALITY; 
</P>
<P>
THE YEAR OF THE DEATH OF RICARDO REIS BY JOSE SARAMAGO TRANSLATED FROM 
PORTUGUESE BY GIOVANNI PONTIERO (HARCOURT BRACE JOVANOVICH: $21.95; 335 PP.) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The circumstantial fog that surrounds so many modern facts, the literary fog 
with which some modern authors choose to write about them, the actual fog that 
blurs and softens the Baroque architecture of Lisbon: How well, on the whole, 
these come together in "The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis." 
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, author of the enchanting historical 
fantasy "Baltasar and Blimunda," has created an utterly indeterminate 
protagonist. He is a middle-aged doctor and poet who returns to Lisbon in the 
mid-1930s after living for 16 years in Brazil. He dies a year after his 
arrival. On the other hand, he may have been dead from the start. Or he may be 
a literary invention of the real and historical Portuguese poet, Fernando de 
Pessoa. 
</P>
<P>
Indeterminacy is in literary fashion right now, with its deconstructionist 
rupture between words and the reality they ostensibly represent. But it has 
long roots, particularly in the literature of the Iberian Peninsula. There was 
the Spanish writer Miguel de Unamuno; but chiefly, of course, there was 
Calderon's "Life Is a Dream." Iberian unreality has ancestors and family 
photographs; it has veins, warmth and melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
Existent or not -- he argues for the possibility and does not always win -- Dr. 
Ricardo Reis displays a great deal of life in the aimless interval that he 
spends between his arrival on the first page and his "death" on the last. 
Indecisive, languid and pedantic, he haunts us, nonetheless; just as throughout 
the book, he is himself haunted by the sardonic and talkative ghost of Pessoa, 
who comes regularly to visit. 
</P>
<P>
A little narrative is in order. Reis lands in Lisbon, where it is raining, and 
where it continues to rain virtually nonstop. He has no friends or connections; 
he puts up in a comfortable hotel, works for a while as a substitute for 
another doctor, makes vague plans to open a practice of his own and, with much 
procrastination, moves to a somber and massively furnished apartment 
overlooking the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
History tosses and turns like an insomniac in the next room, without ever quite 
breaking in on his daze. Reis' hotel is full of right-wing Spaniards plotting 
the uprising that will become the Civil War. He himself is an object of 
suspicion to the Portuguese government, led by the professorial dictator, 
Salazar, and sympathetic to the Spanish Right. He is interrogated by the 
police, inconclusively; a ghostly policeman shadows him, his presence 
invariably announced by the odor of onions. 
</P>
<P>
Reis' own past is no more definite than his existence. As a youth, he was part 
of a liberal intellectual circle that included Pessoa; his departure for Brazil 
followed an abortive coup. His return follows an abortive leftist coup in 
Brazil: hence, the police surveillance. In the rambling musings that form a 
considerable part of the book, he appears aimlessly indecisive: unhappy with 
the Spanish Republic, and unhappy with Franco. Among all our doubts as to who 
he is, it is clear that he is Saramago's image of the futile artist and 
intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
The futility is played out with comic allure that deepens into sadness in two 
love affairs that Reis bonelessly carries along. One is with Marcenda, whom he 
spots dining at the hotel with her father. She is slender and virginal, and has 
a crippled left hand. Father and daughter come down from Coimbra once a month, 
ostensibly so that specialists can examine her, and also so that her bourgeois 
father can visit his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
Marcenda and Reis exchange glances, and she contrives a decorous meeting in the 
hotel lounge so that he can examine her hand. The hand is incurable, he tells 
her, but she should continue the monthly visits. It will give her father an 
alibi for his escapades, and it will give her an alibi for hope. 
</P>
<P>
It will also allow her to visit him in his apartment. All that happens is a 
passionate monthly kiss, which Saramago makes more arousing than any 10 bedroom 
scenes. Finally Marcenda refuses an offer of marriage, and breaks off. Reis is 
too immaterial to hold her. 
</P>
<P>
Marcenda is a splendid character, outspoken, inhibited and as much a fantasist 
as Reis. Lydia, the chambermaid with whom Reis conducts a much more fleshly 
affair, is even more memorable. She belongs to the oppressed classes -- the 
hotel, with its hierarchies, stands for society -- but her passion flames 
through her timidity. 
</P>
<P>
Reis holds her hand for a moment one morning when she brings him breakfast and 
tells her she's pretty. She flees, but when he returns to his room in the 
evening, he sees that she has put out two pillows instead of one, and has 
turned down both sides of the bed sheets. Saramago's comedy is delicately and 
intimately entwined with his bleak puzzles; these, in turn, are tangled in 
something close to tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia is whole-hearted, sensual and devoted. She creeps down the hotel's cold 
corridors each night from her garret. When Reis moves out, she comes once a 
week to remedy his domestic incompetence, "to tidy up this chaos, this resigned 
sorrow of things badly arranged." Afterwards, she washes, and they make love. 
They also argue about politics. She is a woman of the people; her brother is a 
naval seaman and a Communist. At the end, he is killed in an abortive left-wing 
mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Reis -- artistic dilettante and poet's figment -- is as muffled 
against life, love and humanity as if he, like the regularly visiting Pessoa, 
were a ghost or the poet-ghost's poetic invention. 
</P>
<P>
He is a voyeur and an insatiable ruminator. Like Leopold Bloom canvassing 
Dublin, he walks endlessly through the streets, reads all the trivia in the 
newspapers, and rarely slows his stream of disconnected musings. He cannot find 
reality, so he hurls speculation at it, like 40 chimpanzees set to pounding 40 
typewriters in the hope that by chance they might write "Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
Reis' musing and peregrinating can be comically absurd. The first morning in 
the hotel, he hears the maid -- it turns out to be Lydia -- at the door with 
his breakfast: Surely, she is using both hands to carry the loaded tray. How 
does she manage to knock? Does she have three hands? Surely, "we would be in a 
sorry state if we had to hire only servants who possess three hands or more." 
In their sheer volume, the musings can be wearying, as well. It is not always 
easy to pay attention to Reis' ghostly meanderings. 
</P>
<P>
Yet ultimately, the doctor-poet holds us and moves us. His struggle to be real 
makes him real. Saramago, unlike some modern writers, seems to know that it 
takes a real character to make one who is meaningless. It takes someone serious 
to be absurd.

AROUND THE BLOCK A FEW TIMES; 
</P>
<P>
WRITER'S BLOCK BY ZACHARY LEADER (THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS: $26.95; 
313 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judith Gingold, Gingold is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he was a graduate student sweating out his dissertation on Blake, Zachary 
Leader got the idea for this multidisciplinary exploration of writer's block. 
This dread literary ailment afflicts lowly Ph.D. candidates no less than great 
authors, often driving victims crazy or to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Coleridge took opium. Hemingway shot himself. Leader took himself in hand and 
wrote what may be the first book on the subject that doesn't attempt to be 
helpful; it is a theoretical and historical account, bristling with footnotes 
and erudition, none of it intended to increase your productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Leader, a lecturer in English at London's Roehampton Institute, raises 
a series of questions about writer's block: "At what point -- and why -- did 
the term come into existence, and what were the terms it replaced? How was it 
to be distinguished from the sorts of difficulties most writers encounter in 
the act of composition? When, in other words, did a problem with writing become 
a block?" 
</P>
<P>
Leader looks for answers in psychology and literary history, "but also in a 
long philosophical tradition of distrust of the written word as well as in more 
general social and cultural speculation." He covers a great deal of very rugged 
ground, quoting an eclectic assortment of thinkers, ranging from Plato and 
Melville to Mark Twain and Julia Kristeva. 
</P>
<P>
The term "writers block" was coined in 1947 by Dr. Edmund Bergler, a largely 
ignored but extremely prolific psychoanalyst who published 25 books and more 
than 300 articles before his death in 1962. By then the phrase had entered the 
language, spread by word of mouth, a sign of a time in America of intense faith 
in psychoanalysis and intense psychoanalytic interest in creativity. These 
origins explain "the air of medical substance, of a treatable condition, 
assumed by writer's block; hence also the suspicion of something bogus or 
unearned about its claims." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its connection to a particular place and time, a writer like Philip 
Roth might think of himself as blocked, while Philip Larkin, who wrote no more 
than four poems a year, simply considered himself unprolific. Earlier writers 
"dried up" or "froze" or were "stuck in a rut," metaphors that imply internal 
deficiency, rather than external impediment, as the source of the trouble. 
Locating this outside the individual shifts responsibility away from the self. 
No doubt this is one reason "writer's block" caught on. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you call it block, desiccation, frigidity or stasis, it's hell on 
Earth. The complaint entered literary history in the 18th Century, according to 
one theory, when modern technology -- paper and the press -- inundated writers 
with the work of their betters. Since Shakespeare and Milton are tough acts to 
follow, Romantic poets suffered from "the remorseless deepening of 
self-consciousness before the rich and intimidating legacy of the past." They 
lost the power to write, and made that a subject of literature. When truly 
stuck, they invented the fragment as a poetic form. 
</P>
<P>
The new self-consciousness of the mid-18th Century also may be interpreted as 
just one episode in the recurring history of writerly difficulty, which goes 
back at least to the acedia suffered by medieval authors. Then as now, it was 
considered a sin, although an unenjoyable one. 
</P>
<P>
The book also focuses on various psychoanalytic explanations of creative 
inhibition, emphasizing Freud, several post-Freudians and especially the 
British Object-Relations school, which explains blockage in terms of unresolved 
conflict between the primitive internal forces involved in 
self-differentiation. 
</P>
<P>
Leader stresses the affinities between post-Kleinian theory and the testimony 
of Wordsworth and Coleridge, the great bards of blockage. He analyzes a number 
of Wordsworth texts -- including the first 285 lines of the "Prelude," which 
are explicitly about being unable to write -- and details the extravagant 
agonies that led Coleridge to plagiarism and worse. Coleridge's poetry, 
particularly "Dejection: An Ode," documents his struggles, as do his notebooks 
and letters. In one of many tormented moments, the poet wrote a friend, "I wish 
I had been a tanner." 
</P>
<P>
After his consideration of these psychological, historical, and literary 
aspects of his subject, Leader adds a sociological dimension with a discussion 
of the cultural taboos that may produce blockage, devoting a chapter to women 
writers and theories about them. 
</P>
<P>
This approach is coherent but arbitrary, since the themes that emerge are 
dictated by the author's choices. These reflect his interests and a 
predilection for complexity, as when he summarily dismisses non-psychoanalytic 
psychology as "theoretically threadbare." 
</P>
<P>
This book is knotty as a Persian rug, and will be of interest primarily to 
scholars of psychoanalysis and literature. Writers avoiding the blank page 
might be better off with Mozart, though Leader's analysis is finally 
encouraging. Creative impairment "can be a necessary precursor to health," he 
concludes. "Blockage itself can bring insight, and with it the power to write."

LITHUANIA by Joe Ashby Porter (The John Hopkins University Press: $26; 144 
pp.). Joe Ashby Porter has an unquestionable ability to turn a phrase and to 
create a setting, both of which he does in fine style in this collection of 11 
short stories. 
</P>
<P>
His earlier collection, "The Kentucky Stories," was a Pulitzer Prize nominee. 
The stories in "Lithuania" (the meaning of the title seems to be lifted from 
one of the "Jeopardy" game show's categories) range, geographically, all over 
the landscape -- from Tunis to Nashville, from Baltimore to Quebec -- and the 
smells, sounds and backgrounds are right on target. However, Porter dangles, 
dances around and skips over both plot and character development in a most 
maddening way. In the story "Retrieval," the protagonist and a friend go 
fishing in a lake on the Tennessee-Kentucky border. The friend rambles on, 
touching on the computer business, country music singers and geography, and 
concludes: "Country changes, but no invasion'll ever vanquish it. Country 
assimilates, know what I mean, Rob?" At which point Rob confesses to the 
reader: "I wasn't sure I did so I asked what kind of fish we were likely to 
get." The reader, I fear, is in the same boat with the baffled Rob all too 
often. Don G. Campbell

IN THE COMPANY OF WRITERS: A Life in Publishing by Charles Scribner Jr. 
</P>
<P>
(Scribner's Sons: $22.50; 157 pp.). There was a time when the Scribner name 
carried prestige in the publishing world, back when Maxwell Perkins edited 
Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe. That's not true today, however, as hard 
as Charles Scribner Jr. tries in these bland, overpriced memoirs to put a 
positive spin on the house's decline. Scribner, who ran the company from 1952 
to 1986, does offer, however, a few nice recollections of well-known writers, 
one a classic -- the letter of condolence the author received from Hemingway 
when his father died: "Since he had to die at least he has gotten it over 
with." Chris Goodrich

As nothing is more bizarre than the ordinary artifact closely observed, this 
full-color catalogue of 201 paintings by amateurs and hobbyists shoots to the 
top of the charts of estimably odd coffee-table art books. Conceived and 
designed by artist Jim Shaw and published by artist Edward Ruscha, the riveting 
volume is all pictures, no text -- save for the purely descriptive titles given 
to the paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"Indian Maidens Frolic in Bikinis," "Man and Woman Emerge From Egg in Seascape" 
and the ever-popular "Wolves Attacking Steer Carcass on Snowy Night" are among 
the subjects these vernacular artists felt they simply had to paint; these 
pictures were then snapped up by Shaw and other collectors at the salon des 
refuses of suburban American culture -- the neighborhood thrift store. And you 
thought modern art was strange. Christopher Knight

<P>
now feels celestial, feels like nothing 
</P>
<P>
but what six or seven stars imply. 
</P>
<P>
So peaceful to lie down and not be afraid 
</P>
<P>
of all the degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
So good to forget trudging through the blizzard 
</P>
<P>
that erased everything once familiar to her. 
</P>
<P>
Now that she's over the hill 
</P>
<P>
she's becoming part of it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back in the house my thoughts empty out, 
</P>
<P>
they drift from room to room. 
</P>
<P>
From next door comes a fuzzy piano: 
</P>
<P>
music to be ninety by, broken hip music, 
</P>
<P>
music of the wispy hair, and a cloud 
</P>
<P>
that inches from eye to eye. I love this 
</P>
<P>
largo movement somebody's put on 
</P>
<P>
an ancient phonograph. Even with the eyes closed 
</P>
<P>
it doesn't sound like a dirge at all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And instead of the woeful moon rising, 
</P>
<P>
I see a good woman sneaking under a dirty apron 
</P>
<P>
ice cream for her punished grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
She sports a puckered grin toothless as an infant's 
</P>
<P>
that a prankster of a son is making fun of, but lovingly, 
</P>
<P>
and the horned fist quick to curse him, but lovingly. 
</P>
<P>
I can hear the cracked dinner bell of a voice 
</P>
<P>
calling out for the last time, and the small bird 
</P>
<P>
that survived a paralyzing storm 
</P>
<P>
to roost in an old woman's throat, to nest 
</P>
<P>
in her wordlessness through every kind of bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And now I hear that high-pitched hoot of hers 
</P>
<P>
ringing in the new year. A laugh that always was 
</P>
<P>
a slap in the face of gloom. 
</P>

SAM WALTON: The Inside Story of America's Richest Man by Vance H. Trimble (E.P. 
Dutton: $19.95; 319 pp.). Sam Walton, billionaire head of the Arkansas-based 
Wal-Mart retailing chain, readily admits to being aided by good luck -- a luck 
that extends, it turns out, to his first biographer, who has written a virtual 
hagiography. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam Walton," by fellow Arkansan Vance Trimble, is unauthorized in name only: 
The real-life Walton no doubt resembles the inspiring, hard-working, just-folks 
executive depicted here, but the author's rose-colored perspective is a bit 
hard to take. Trimble, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, often places 
problematic details in a positive light. He is little troubled, for example, by 
the tendency of new Wal-Marts to drive existing mom-and-pop stores out of 
business. It should be noted, too, that Walton never was America's richest man, 
Forbes magazine having failed for years to separate Sam's fortune from that of 
his family -- a fact this book's publisher conveniently glosses over. Chris 
Goodrich

FLAUBERT'S PARROT by Julian Barnes (Vintage: $8.95). In this extraordinary work 
of literary legerdemain, Julian Barnes combines a novel with a rumination on 
the life and work of the 19th-Century novelist Gustave Flaubert. 
</P>
<P>
A quest to determine authenticity of two rival museums that claim to display 
the stuffed parrot Flaubert used as a model for Loulou in the story "A Simple 
Heart" takes amateur scholar Geoffrey Braithwaite down curious paths of 
historical research and self-examination. The story of Braithwaite's dreary 
life and failed marriage emerge from his discussions of Flaubert's work, 
especially "Madame Bovary," much the way the story of Charles Kinbote and John 
Shade does from the notes in Nabokov's "Pale Fire." "Flaubert's Parrot" 
suggests the prose equivalent of a Cubist portrait, with the artist examining a 
single facet of his subject from a constantly shifting point of view and 
creating a startlingly realistic image from a seemingly unrelated details. 
Fascinating. Charles Solomon

ERNIE'S AMERICA: The Best of Ernie Pyle's 1930s Travel Dispatches, edited by 
David Nichols (Vintage: $14.95). Forty-five years after his death on Ie Shima, 
an island near Okinawa, Ernie Pyle is remembered primarily for his World War II 
reportage, but his columns about America had made him one of the most famous 
journalists in the country during the previous decade: His influence can be 
seen in the work of many contemporary reporters, including Charles Hillinger 
and Charles Kuralt. 
</P>
<P>
Pyle's clear, unaffected prose captures the voices of an improbable assortment 
of characters without ever seeming patronizing, whether he's profiling a 
die-hard Prohibitionist, a dedicated teacher at an impoverished Appalachian 
school or the former star of a Yukon dance hall. Pyle also loved the American 
land, and many of his essays glow with the delight he took in the woods and 
mountains. This delight gives his appalled descriptions of the Dust Bowl an 
added power. Charles Solomon

GREAT INVENTIONS/GOOD INTENTIONS: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF AMERICAN PATENT

<P>
Although highly entertaining, "Great Inventions" is just a portfolio of patent 
drawings from the '30s and '40s, rather than a history of design. 
</P>
<P>
The influence of Modernism can be seen in the emphasis on streamlining and the 
illusion of speed in these drawings: Even the ashtrays have had their corners 
smoothed away until they resemble sleek dirigibles. A surprising number of 
these drawings look like something else: A radio becomes a miniature grand 
piano, and a hilarious design for an Americana restaurant combines a log cabin 
with a covered wagon. Only a few of these projects were ever realized -- and no 
wonder. Charles Solomon

THE HOBBIT by J. R. R. Tolkien, illustrated by David Wenzel, adapted by Charles 
Dixon with Sean Deming (Eclipse: $12.95). "The Hobbit" remains both the 
simplest and most problematic of J. R. R. Tolkien's works. 
</P>
<P>
Although it serves as a prelude to "The Lord of the Rings," "The Hobbit" 
remains a children's story that lacks the epic sweep of the later trilogy. 
David Wenzel, Charles Dixon and Sean Deming turn this charming tale into a 
rather stodgy Classics Comic, peopled with wooden figures. Elrond and Gandalf 
lack the requisite otherwordly majesty; Thranduil, the king of Wood-Elves, 
looks like a podgy bishop in a bad historic film, and their red-nosed version 
of Bilbo Baggins fails to convey the proper aura of British coziness. None of 
the characters emerge as individuals: Gandalf and all the Dwarfs are drawn with 
similar beards and costumes, so it's difficult to tell them apart. There have 
been numerous attempts to depict Middle Earth, including the calendars of the 
Hildebrandts and the regrettable films of Ralph Bakshi and Rankin-Bass. They've 
all failed because Tolkien's prose isn't visually oriented: It should be read 
-- or better yet, chanted -- around a campfire, like the medieval sagas that 
inspired it. Charles Solomon

ON THE RECORD: COUNTDOWN TO '91: MOZART AT THE PIANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mozart on period pianos is very much the recorded thing as we approach the 1991 
Mozart Bicentennial, and Singapore-born Melvyn Tan proves himself a true 
thinker among antiquarians in his program of solo piano music (EMI/Angel 
54021). Included are a pair of staples, the Sonatas in A minor, K. 310, and in 
D, K. 576. 
</P>
<P>
Most welcome, however, are Tan's probing, rhythmically free readings of 
relative rarities: the Fantasia in C minor, K. 396 -- of which Mozart wrote 
only the first 20-odd measures but whose completion by the Abbe Stadler makes 
it perhaps the one totally convincing Mozart-like composition in existence; the 
hardly less dark and complex Fantasia in D minor, K. 397 (with its nods in the 
directions of both J.S. and C.P.E. Bach) and the bravura Variations on "Je suis 
Lindor." 
</P>
<P>
Where Tan digs deeply, American pianist Anthony Newman uses a pair of early 
pianos (Tan's is a modern reconstruction) to show off both the instruments' and 
his own brilliance in four separate CDs (Newport Classic 60121-60124) offering 
all 18 of the composer's solo sonatas. 
</P>
<P>
Newman's energy and flashing technique are welcome in the lightweight sonatas, 
K. 279-K.284. More repose, more contrast, less speed for its own sake would, 
however, have enhanced his readings of such multihued marvels as the Sonatas, 
K. 330 and K. 332 -- where the omission of repeats is particularly regrettable 
-- and the dark-as-night K. 457. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart sonatas have been integral to the repertory of Alicia de Larrocha since 
long before the onset of Mozart mania. To these ears, however, her 
interpretations have always been too soft-edged in tone and temperament, too 
much like the Schumann and Chopin she plays with such idiomatic flair. 
</P>
<P>
Larrocha begins her projected cycle of all the sonatas with typically 
easygoing, polished readings of three core sonatas -- K. 330, 331 and 333 -- as 
well as the less imposing K. 283 (RCA Victor 60407). 
</P>
<P>
Gyorgy Solti first attracted attention as a bright young piano pupil of Erno 
Dohnanyi at the Budapest Liszt Academy in the early 1930s. Since becoming Sir 
Georg Solti and one of our most celebrated conductors, he has returned to his 
pianistic roots via several recordings made during the past decade. He does so 
again in a Mozart program (London 430 232) whose star appeal is heightened by 
the presence of pianists Daniel Barenboim and Andras Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
Barenboim and Solti deliver a lively, neatly integrated performance of the very 
grand Concerto in C, K. 365. Schiff joins them for the pleasant but paltry 
Triple Concerto in E-flat, K. 242. Solti assumes the solo duties of the 
Concerto in D minor, K. 466, and directs the English Chamber Orchestra from the 
keyboard in all three. 
</P>
<P>
The extrovert conductor proves a surprisingly neutral, even timid soloist in K. 
466 while providing an orchestral accompaniment notable neither for 
incisiveness nor neatness. 
</P>
<P>
Appealingly burly energy and unexaggerated lyric warmth distinguish a reissue 
of early-1970s Mozart from the Marlboro Festival (Sony Classics 46255, 
mid-price). The pianists are the Serkins, father Rudolf and son Peter, applying 
themselves joyously to K. 365, while Serkin senior offers an account of the 
Concerto in A, K. 414, that is blithe and muscular by turns -- the latter 
adjective applying as well to the conducting of Alexander Schneider in both. 
The third item on the program, the Piano Trio in G, K. 502, has the treacly 
violin of Jaime Laredo and labored cello playing by Madeleine Foley to offset, 
if not quite negate, Rudolf Serkin's forthrightness. 
</P>
<P>
The name of Sviatoslav Richter does not readily come to mind in conjunction 
with Mozart. It should. His 1975, live-performance recording with the late Oleg 
Kagaan of two major sonatas for piano and violin, K. 306 and K. 378, as well as 
some interesting fragments, has surfaced in EMI/Angel's budget-priced "Mozart 
91" series (67016) and is warmly recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Kagaan's wide vibrato and occasionally weepy tone fail to dampen Richter's 
bounding energy -- and the pianist's dominance is, after all, dictated by the 
composer. As evidenced again here, Richter is the one keyboard giant of modern 
times able to scale his massive gifts and personality down to the requirements 
of chamber music without losing the distinctiveness of his artistry in the 
process.

ENRICO CARUSO: A MAN FOR MODERN TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER PRICE, Walter Price writes about music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Complete Caruso: Enrico Caruso, various singers, pianists, orchestras; BMG 
60495-2-RG (12 compact discs). 
</P>
<P>
The Caruso legend grows unabated with this release on CD of all the commercial 
recordings made by the great tenor during his 18-year career in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
The singer has been called the first "modern" tenor in that his singing 
encompassed not only Verdi and Donizetti but also embraced the emerging verismo 
school of Leoncavallo, Mascagni, Giordano and Puccini. Much of the music he 
sang was contemporary. Essentially, his style from that period remains the one 
used (or imitated) by the generations of tenors that followed him. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of these recordings was made for the Victor Talking Machine Co. 
Despite antiquated recording techniques, the sound comes through remarkably to 
show a voice that was above all beautiful, equal throughout a range that 
spanned almost baritonal low notes and a solid, never strident top. From the 
beginning he took to the recording horn, as it obviously took to him. He always 
sounded theatrical in the music, something that could not be said for some of 
his colleagues. In his 1902 "Celeste Aida" (he recorded the aria six times), he 
takes the climactic B-flat falsetto. Thereafter he belted it out from the 
chest. Although he was generally afraid of a Top C ("Che gelida manina" is 
transposed down a half-tone), there is one beauty here, at the climax of 
"Salut, demeure." 
</P>
<P>
He recorded the "Rigoletto" quartet and "Lucia" sextet four times each, and in 
all one discerns subtle inflections not heard before. He could throw in 
unwritten high notes, as in the "Miserere," but at no time did he ever falsify 
the musical line. 
</P>
<P>
Among his colleagues, the men generally contribute most, especially Ruffo and 
Amato, in duets from "Otello" and "Forza" respectively. The timbre of the 
women, particularly sopranos, is captured less well (Melba and Sembrich sound 
pretty much alike, as do Galli-Curci and Tetrazzini), although Farrar and, 
surprisingly Gadski (in "O terra, addio"), make strong impressions. Louise 
Homer couldn't have been this bland ("Aida" and "Trovatore" excerpts) in the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
The common denominator throughout Caruso's work is commitment. There is not one 
number that is sloughed off or touched by routine. He was dedicated to the 
seriousness of his art as no tenor seems to be today. Perhaps that is why we 
continue to listen with such pleasure.

Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti In Concert: Arias and songs. 
Orchestras of the Florence May Festival and Rome Opera, Zubin Mehta, 
conducting. 
</P>
<P>
London 430 433-2 (compact disc). In July, three of the most famous tenors in 
the world, along with a well-known conductor, participated in one of the most 
extravagant vocal three-ring circuses in memory. This recording is taken from 
that evening and has not one shred of interest for a serious collector. Chief 
curiosity is the state of Carreras' voice after his long battle with leukemia. 
The sound is fresh and youthful, if there are hints of a wobble in high, 
fortissimo passages. Domingo's singing is about as usual, which means generally 
beautiful, if unvarying in color or expressivity. It is left to Pavarotti to 
provide the one instance of distinguished singing in a Crescenzo song, "Rondine 
al Nido." As always, he projects the Italian language with a mastery few 
singers can match. The final medley of war horses reaches its height of 
vulgarity with a unison "Vincero" at the close of "Nessun dorma." Why a serious 
musician like Mehta would lend his name to this travesty is an open 
question.WALTER PRICE

RENEE ROSNES "FOR THE MOMENT" BLUE NOTE * * *

<TEXT>
<P>
The results of pianist Rosnes' follow-up to her Blue Note debut, are generally 
felicitous. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by her regular trio members -- bassist Ira Coleman and drummer Billy 
Drummond -- she scores on pieces like "Summer Night" and "Malaga Moon," which 
abundantly illustrate the Bill Evans influences of her piano playing. 
</P>
<P>
The precise, understated style of the trio is less effective in support of 
tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson, who appears on most of the tracks. Too often 
Henderson's efforts to expand the musical envelope are hampered by the failure 
of Rosnes, Coleman and Drummond to generate a comparable flow of musical 
energy. Saxophonist Steve Wilson is also featured. Don Heckman

DEAR RESTAURANT CRITIC; 
</P>

WHO HAS GOOD, CHEAP ITALIAN FOOD? WHAT ABOUT GOOD FISH? EVERYONE DINES OUT THIS 
TIME OF YEAR, AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I don't have to look outside to know what time of year it is. All I have to do 
is sit here and open my mail. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the year, most of my letters go something like this: "Dear 
Restaurant Critic: My grandmother will celebrate her 102nd birthday next month, 
and I'd like to take her out for a really elegant celebration. She doesn't hear 
so well anymore, so we want to take her to a quiet restaurant. She still has 
all her teeth and chewing is no problem, but she doesn't like anything spicy 
(forget Thai or Mexican food), she hates garlic (Chinese is out) and her doctor 
has forbidden her to eat butter and cream (so don't send us to a French 
restaurant, either). We don't mind a short drive, but given her age, coming all 
the way into Los Angeles is out of the question. If you could come up with 
something within a 10-mile radius of Norwalk, that would be appreciated. Money 
isn't really an object -- there will be 10 of us, and we're willing to spend as 
much as $5 to $8 apiece (we'll bring our own cake). Where should we go?" 
</P>
<P>
You'll understand why it is a relief when the holidays roll around, bringing 
with them a dramatic change in query. All the 102-year-old grandmothers 
disappear from my mail; suddenly everybody wants to party. Specifically, when 
it comes to my mail, everybody is coming into Los Angeles to eat, and they want 
to know where to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Where can I take my boss to dinner that will make a good impression but won't 
cost a fortune? 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that I don't know your boss. If he's someone who will appreciate 
good food and pleasant service in a very cozy room (but rather cramped 
quarters), I'd suggest Locanda Veneta. The restaurant serves wonderful northern 
Italian food at very reasonable prices. If he's young and hip, you might try 
Indigo, a neighborhood restaurant for foodies. You can sit in an ultramodern 
setting and eat such dishes as chicken chili and seafood pot stickers. And if 
he's a very proper person who appreciates good food and good service, you might 
opt for lunch instead. Patina serves a businessman's lunch for $18.50. You'll 
get fabulous food in a small, beautiful (but slightly cold) room -- and your 
boss will undoubtedly think that you are very smart. 
</P>
<P>
I have friends coming in from out of town, and I want to take them to a typical 
Los Angeles restaurant. What do you suggest? 
</P>
<P>
There has never been a better time to do this. With the recession coming on, 
tables are available almost everywhere, and if you're willing to eat either 
early or late, you can take them to Spago (still, in my experience, the most 
sought-after reservation in town). Other suggestions: Campanile, with its 
wonderful space and fantastic rustic Italian food; DC-3, with its beautiful 
room overlooking the Santa Monica Airport; Chinois on Main, with its innovative 
blend of French, Chinese and California cuisines, and Matsuhisa, a wild, 
Latin-influenced sushi bar that serves food you won't find anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
I want to dress up and have a nice time in a good atmosphere. But I don't want 
to starve to death either. Where should I go? 
</P>
<P>
Nouvelle cuisine is dead and small portions aren't the problem they once were, 
but some restaurants continue to equate elegance with delicacy of appetite. One 
that doesn't is Saddle Peak Lodge, a dramatic, romantic restaurant in the 
Calabasas hills that looks like a rich man's hunting lodge and serves portions 
that would please a hungry hunter. Another big-deal restaurant that respects 
reasonable appetites is Champagne. I've hardly met anybody who managed to 
finish a portion of their cassoulet. 
</P>
<P>
I don't cook, and I don't want to buy takeout food, but I would like to be able 
to invite people out for food that tastes like it was made in somebody's house, 
instead of a big cold commercial kitchen. Does such a place exist? 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many. But if you like Italian food, Mario's Cooking for Friends is 
a place you should consider. The restaurant is small and attractive with soft 
yellow walls and comfortable chairs. The simple food really tastes as if it 
were cooked by someone's mama. The service is so pleasant that although the 
restaurant allows you to bring your own wine, they serve it as if it came from 
the most expensive cellar. 
</P>
<P>
I want to take my teen-age daughter out for lunch, and I'm hoping to find 
something she'll like besides hamburgers and Coke. More importantly, I want to 
take her someplace I'll like as well. 
</P>
<P>
This one's easy. Take her to the new Border Grill in Santa Monica. The 
atmosphere is bright and raucous, and she's sure to see lots of great-looking 
guys. And though this is truly terrific Mexican food, what teen-ager doesn't 
like tacos? Meanwhile, you can enjoy such fare as tongue stew and sophisticated 
tamales. 
</P>
<P>
What is the best fish restaurant in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Unlike New York, San Francisco and Seattle, Los Angeles doesn't have a single 
great place to eat seafood, outside of Cantonese seafood restaurants such as 
Chinatown's new VBC. (Although Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica does have a 
great oyster bar.) On the other hand, since almost every restaurant in town 
serves seafood, you can go to any good restaurant secure in the knowledge of 
finding fine fish. 
</P>
<P>
All my relatives want to do when they come for a visit is go out to eat where 
they can see stars. But I refuse to put up with the awful treatment "nobodies" 
get in most of those Hollywood places. Where should I take them? 
</P>
<P>
This is an easy answer: Musso and Frank Grill, Hollywood's favorite restaurant 
for 70 years. And no wonder. Even the stars aren't treated like stars here, and 
everybody's treated well. You'll have to wait for a table, but it gives you a 
chance to look at the celebrities and drink the best martinis in town. When you 
get to your table, stick to the simple dishes (prime rib, grilled sea bass, 
creamed spinach) and you'll be happy. You'll be happy when the bill comes, too 
-- the prices are reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best place to go for dim sum? I don't want to drive all the way to 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Seafood, a brand new Chinatown restaurant on the site of the former 
Miriwa. The dim sum is truly spectacular -- especially anything made with fish. 
Don't miss the siu mai, the long noodles with shrimp, the scallop dumplings and 
the giant clam, which is cooked on a cart before your very eyes. Come hungry. 
Every cart that comes your way will be seductive, and it's almost impossible to 
not end up with a table filled with food. 
</P>
<P>
My father is a major meat-eater. Where should I take him for steak? 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Dining Car is cozy, Hy's is elegant and the Palm is a scene -- but when 
you really care about great meat, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is the place to go. 
</P>
<P>
I want to go someplace nice -- but I don't want to spend a lot of money. Are 
there any fancy restaurants that serve bargain meals? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. The bar and the terrace at La Cienega's upscale Pazzia has become a 
restaurant called Pazzeria. For remarkably reasonable prices you can eat great 
antipasto, pizza and pasta. Even with wine (sold by the carafe), a couple can 
eat well here for $40. 
</P>
<P>
My husband has high cholesterol and has been told to cut down on butter and 
cream. Is there anyplace where we can get a really good meal that won't kill 
him? 
</P>
<P>
Lots of them. While there are a number of restaurants that specialize in 
healthy food, you don't need to stick to them. Most Mediterranean cuisines are 
low in cholesterol, and any Italian restaurant will have dishes that fall into 
your husband's diet. And while much French food relies on high-cholesterol 
ingredients, many local chefs pride themselves on being able to serve healthy 
food at a moment's notice. A few restaurants to try: La Toque, La Famiglia, 
Patina, Il Forno. 
</P>
<P>
We plan to spend the afternoon at the L.A. County Museum of Art. Is there 
anyplace nearby to eat lunch? 
</P>
<P>
Without even getting into your car, you can have a wonderful meal at one of the 
best Lebanese restaurants in the country. Al Amir serves extraordinary hummus, 
fattoush, kibbeh and the like -- in a quiet, comfortable and dignified room. 
They even have an outdoor patio. 
</P>
<P>
A friend's birthday falls right at the beginning of the year. A group of us 
want to take him out to a place where we can make a lot of noise without people 
giving us weird looks -- and get good food. Does such a place exist? 
</P>
<P>
If I were you, I'd choose Rebecca's. Architect Frank Gehry's wild, wonderful 
room has a really festive feeling and the upscale Mexican food is delicious. 
The noise on a weekend night can get so intense that a baby could wail for 
hours without disturbing anybody. If you have a party of about a dozen, there's 
a private dining room that hovers over the bar like a flying saucer about to 
land. It makes a particularly pleasant place for a small party. 
</P>
<P>
You're always saying, "Put yourself in the chef's hands and you'll get a 
wonderful meal." Really? Where can I safely do that? Do I have to call ahead? 
</P>
<P>
Many great chefs like nothing better than to make special meals for people who 
they know will appreciate them. There is nobody who does this as happily -- or 
as wonderfully -- as Michel Richard of Citrus. If he is on hand, you need only 
tell your waiter that you'd like to speak directly to the chef about your meal. 
To be on the safe side, it would be wise to call ahead and arrange the meal 
(and the price) ahead of time. This sort of eating is exciting -- and 
expensive. Piero Selvaggio, owner of Valentino, is another expert at the 
special, impromptu meal. He loves to stand at your table and invent dishes on 
the spot. And at Dan Tana's, you don't even have to ask for the owner. You can 
safely throw away the menu and simply tell your waiter what you'd like to eat. 
</P>
<P>
I get up late, eat breakfast late and don't want lunch until 3 or 4 in the 
afternoon. The problem: Most places have closed by then. Do I have to eat fast 
food? 
</P>
<P>
No. My favorite place for a lazy, late lunch is City, one of the few 
restaurants that actually have a separate middle-of-the-day menu. My favorite 
meal: a giant mush of avocados and goat cheese that you scoop up on crisp 
little toasts, followed by City chocolate cupcakes. Count on a light, late 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Is there such a thing as a good fast food restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, definitely. The La Salsa chain, with its freshly made soft 
tacos, gives fast food a good name. Benita's Frites in Santa Monica serves 
French fries worth dreaming about. Zankou chicken in Hollywood makes exemplary 
chicken, with great garlic sauce. And Senor Fish makes shrimp quesadillas so 
good that I have been known to jump into my car in the middle of a deadline and 
race off to Highland Park.

NOTEBOOK: ROCKENWAGNER: REMEMBER THE NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times may be tough in the restaurant business, but that isn't stopping Hans and 
Mary Rockenwagner, proprietors of Rockenwagner in Venice and Fama in Santa 
Monica, from fulfilling their dream of moving to new, larger quarters. The 
couple has just signed a lease on the restaurant space in the Frank 
Gehry-designed Edgemar complex on Santa Monica's Main Street -- a space in 
which chef Peter De Lucca and his partners had planned to install a bar and 
grill last year, but which has in fact remained unoccupied since Edgemar opened 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I see Edgemar as being like a modern town square," Hans Rockenwagner says. The 
interior, being designed by David Kellen and Rockenwagner himself (the two also 
designed Fama) will elaborate on the town-square theme. "You'll be sitting in a 
restaurant surrounded by the facades of buildings," continues Rockenwagner. 
"One will actually be the kitchen, one will be the bar, one will be the deli, 
and so on." The deli in question is a combination bakery and informal 
restaurant planned for one portion of Rockenwagner. Informal Continental-style 
breakfast and soups and sandwiches for lunch and dinner will be served there. 
The main restaurant will feature an expanded version of the present 
Rockenwagner's menu, and will be open for lunch. "We might even have a 
hamburger and steak with fries," Rockenwagner says. 
</P>
<P>
The new Rockenwagner, which will seat a total of 75 (instead of 48 as the 
Venice location does), is scheduled to open in summer of 1991. Meanwhile, the 
fate of the original restaurant is undecided. "We have all kinds of ideas," 
says Rockenwagner. "We might keep it and change the concept, or we might sell 
it. If we do close it, though, we'll probably do it about a month before the 
new one opens." 
</P>
<P>
SABROSO DOS: Rockenwagner's recently departed Venice neighbor, Sabroso, may not 
be gone for good after all. Restaurant owner Jeanine Coyle reports that one of 
her regular customers, distressed at her announced plans to temporarily retire 
("I'm just going to take the dog and drive towards Guatemala," she told this 
column recently), has found her a new location in Marina del Rey, where she 
plans to reopen early this coming year. "A lot of things have happened very 
fast," she says. Watch this space for details. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE FIRE: Jean-Francois Meteigner, former chef at L'Orangerie, has taken 
over the kitchen temporarily at Diaghilev, the newly renamed luxury dining room 
in West Hollywood's Bel Age Hotel. . . . David Teck, former co-proprietor of 
Ingrid and David's Gingerhouse International in Tarzana, has a new restaurant: 
the World Cafe in Santa Monica. . . . Fleetwood's is new in West Hollywood, on 
the site of the old Palette. Namesake and co-owner (with Peter and Ernest 
Lepore) of the place is Mick Fleetwood, drummer for and co-founder of Fleetwood 
Mac. . . . Mori Teppan Grill and Hibachi Pasta is new in Glendale -- the 
Hibachi Pasta part of the name refers to the restaurant's specialty, 
quick-grilled Japanese noodles with shrimp, beef, chicken or assorted 
vegetables. . . . And, on Thursday nights through the end of February, Emilio's 
Ristorante in Hollywood is serving that wonderful Italian "boiled dinner" 
called bollito misto -- including beef, veal, veal tongue, capon, and cotechino 
sausage, with lentils, sauerkraut and assorted sauces -- at $25 per person. 
</P>
<P>
FRENCH NUMBERS: What are L.A.'s best restaurants -- according to the French? 
The November 26th issue of FYI, a magazine published by Forbes, answers that 
question -- or at least tell us how Andre Gayot of Gault/Millau rates local 
places. His listing of America's top 40 restaurants includes five Southern 
California entries: Citrus (with a score of 18/20); Chinois on Main, Patina and 
Valentino (all with 17/20); and St. Estephe (16/20). The top-rated U.S. 
restaurants are Le Cirque in New York, at 19.5/20 -- the same score given by 
the French edition of the guide to such legendary establishments as Robuchon, 
Michel Guerard, Troisgros, Marc Meneau and Giradet; and then, at 19/20, Le 
Bernardin and Lafayette in New York (the latter of which has just lost its 
chef) and Jean-Louis in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
COLETTE'S COOK: Famed French restaurateur, author and gastronomic godfather 
Raymond Oliver has died in Paris at the age of 81. Born in Langon, in the 
Bordeaux region, he learned his trade at his father's hotel in the city of 
Bordeaux itself. In 1948, he and Louis Vaudable, proprietor of Maxim's (which 
had been closed temporarily after the liberation of Paris), took over the 
venerable old Le Grand Vefour in the Galerie de Beaujolais near the Palais 
Royal. Almost certainly the oldest continually operated restaurant in Paris, Le 
Grand Vefour was opened in 1784 (as the Cafe Chartres), and had once played 
host to Diderot, Dumas and Victor Hugo. It's even said that Napoleon courted 
Josephine there. By the 1940s, though, it had fallen into disrepair and 
disrepute. Oliver and Vaudable revived it, refurbishing its elaborate 
Directoire interior and winning back a latter-day celebrity clientele, 
including Colette (who lived a few doors away) and Jean Cocteau. In 1950, 
Vaudable went back to Maxim's and Oliver became the sole proprietor -- winning 
three stars in the Guide Michelin in 1954. Oliver's kitchen became famous as a 
training ground for chefs -- among its graduates is Claude Deligne, chef at 
Taillevent. He wrote at least 30 books on cooking and food history and 
broadcast several popular cooking shows on TV. In 1983, after he had lost his 
third star, and seen his dining room damaged by a terrorist bomb, he sold Le 
Grand Vefour to the Taittinger Champagne group -- and a year later he retired 
from professional life. His son, Michel, has become a famous restaurateur in 
his own right, with the popular, casual Bistrot de Paris, among other 
establishments. 
</P>

SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS: Joss, the upscale contemporary 
Chinese restaurant on the Beverly Hills end of the Sunset Strip, offers what it 
dubs a "Maid's Night Off" dinner every Sunday night -- five courses at $18 per 
person. I wonder if potential customers have to provide proof that they employ 
domestic help?

TEAR IN HIS EYE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Considering Michael Wilmington's many fine and sensitive observations about 
Western movies (Dec. 16) I'm surprised by his use -- twice -- of the term 
half-breed. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike cattle, dogs, and cats, we human beings aren't categorized into 
different breeds. To describe a mixed-race person as a half-breed is not only 
incorrect but demeaning, as it implies a sort of bestial-human union. 
Half-breed deserves to be dropped from usage like other racist terms have been.

'EMPEROR OF 9TH,' L.A. COUNCILMAN LINDSAY, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gilbert W. Lindsay, the first black Los Angeles city councilman and 
self-proclaimed "Emperor of the 9th District" for nearly three decades, died 
Friday of cardiac arrest. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran politician's death at 2:11 a.m. at Queen of Angels-Hollywood 
Presbyterian Medical Center followed nearly four months of hospitalization for 
a paralyzing stroke that left him unable to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay once ruled the inner-city 9th District with a brash arrogance that some 
compared to the imperious style of Chicago's late political boss, Richard J. 
Daley. 
</P>
<P>
He was a short, feisty man who liked big buildings and beautiful women. 
</P>
<P>
But the incapacitation that followed his Sept. 2 stroke left Lindsay unable to 
conduct city business and touched off a divisive City Hall battle over whether 
to replace or remove him. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay had been plagued by failing health for the last two years. He suffered 
an earlier stroke in 1988 and was briefly hospitalized last June after 
collapsing in an underground parking garage at City Hall. Critics said then he 
was unable to represent his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
A tearful Mayor Tom Bradley called Lindsay "a beloved public servant, one who 
declared on many occasions that he was going to be emperor and councilman for 
life. He got his wish." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley ordered that all city flags fly at half staff in observance of 
Lindsay's death. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Antonovich, chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, 
praised Lindsay for his "lifelong dedication to the City and County of Los 
Angeles" and also ordered flags at county facilities lowered to half staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all lost a good friend," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
City Council President John Ferraro, who appeared with Bradley in a joint press 
conference Friday, said he will request a special election be held during the 
upcoming April primary to select a successor to Lindsay, whose term expires in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
The council is on holiday vacation until Jan. 2. Bradley said he favors 
Ferraro's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Unresolved at Lindsay's death is a lawsuit filed by his stepson, Herbert 
Howard, alleging that Lindsay's former girlfriend, 39-year-old Juanda Chauncie, 
clandestinely gained the deeds to six residential properties owned by the 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, named conservator of his stepfather's estate earlier this month, had 
recently moved Lindsay from an Inglewood hospital to Queen of Angels-Hollywood 
Presbyterian to block any attempt to oust the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
A technicality in the City Charter allows the removal of a council member 
absent from the city for longer than 60 days, unless the member's absence is 
officially excused. The Inglewood hospital is just beyond the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was born Nov. 29, 1900, on a cotton plantation in Jasper County, 
Mississippi. After serving in the Army in the 10th Calvary and 25th Infantry in 
Arizona, he moved to Los Angeles. He applied for a job with the city and, 
despite some college credits taken through the Army, he was offered a job as a 
janitor. 
</P>
<P>
He accepted the post, but in his spare time he enrolled in business and 
government classes at the University of Southern California and gradually moved 
up in the clerical ranks of the city government. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, he worked on then-City Councilman Kenneth Hahn's successful campaign 
for county supervisor and was named Hahn's deputy. On Jan. 28, 1963, he was 
appointed to fill a vacancy in the City Council, becoming the first black 
councilman in the city's recorded history. He overwhelmingly defeated 11 
opponents in an election held five months later. He won every ballot 
thereafter, relying largely on the predominantly black constituency of a 
district stretching from Chinatown to South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay remained a staunch advocate of growth and an ally to developers in an 
era when growth was being increasingly criticized for crowding out the poor and 
creating too much traffic and smog. 
</P>
<P>
While praised for revitalizing downtown, he was also accused of neglecting the 
southern half of his district in South-Central Los Angeles, an area rife with 
crime and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was also a champion of civil rights, and his appointment to the City 
Council paved the way for other minorities, including Bradley, who became the 
city's first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody knew Gilbert Lindsay and didn't love him, something must have been 
wrong with them," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
"The legacy Councilman Lindsay leaves behind is one of care, compassion and 
commitment to all 9th District constituents with whom he shared a very special 
relationship," Ferraro said. "The 'Emperor of the Great 9th' is dead, but he 
will always remain in our memories, in our hearts and our love." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's power base eroded over the years, however, as Latinos increasingly 
approach the numbers of blacks in the 9th District. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay aide Bob Gay, accused by critics of being too eager to assume his 
boss's job, is a likely candidate for the now-vacant seat. 
</P>
<P>
Others most mentioned as possible successors are Brad Pye, an aide to Hahn. 
Both Gay and Pye are black. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said that, as recently as six months ago, when he discussed with 
Lindsay a likely successor, Lindsay had no preference. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have anyone he wanted to nominate," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bradley and Councilman Robert Farrell, whose South Los Angeles district 
abuts the 9th District, said they expect his successor to be black. However, 
new census data for the city, which will not be available until July, could 
show that the majority of the district's residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins the seat must be ready to fight to keep the boundaries of the 9th 
District intact. Early next year, the City Council will begin drawing new lines 
for its 15 districts and it is possible that council members may attempt to 
divide the tax-rich downtown portion of the 9th for themselves, carving out the 
neighborhoods of South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was the last of the city's old-style political bosses and a man not 
averse to calling up developers and investment bankers when contributions ran 
low. He liked to do things on a grand scale and prided himself on bringing 
skyscrapers to the Los Angeles skyline. 
</P>
<P>
"Gil was one who always said, 'I like big things, big buildings, big people,' " 
Bradley said. "He was one who just believed in the enormity of life." 
</P>
<P>
Before his stroke, he could be seen dining at least twice a week at the 
expensive Tower restaurant atop the Transamerica Building. He fancied lobster 
bisque, tossed salad and champagne. He always sat at table 9, close to the 
wraparound windows looking out on downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"He always said he wanted to survey his empire," said restaurant supervisor 
Andrew Harding. "He was known as 'The Emperor' here." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn employed Lindsay as a deputy supervisor for 10 years before Lindsay's City 
Council appointment. Hahn called him "a man of humor who could see the funny 
side of life. He was never depressed." 
</P>
<P>
An unabashed flirt and an often cantankerous councilman, "he just spoke his 
mind without any restraint," Hahn said. "He loved beautiful women." 
</P>
<P>
"He was certainly competent," said Hahn, who himself suffered a debilitating 
stroke two years ago. "He outfoxed them all by just staying on the council. 
When they tried to oust him, he outfoxed them by moving." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay explained his success during a period in history when blacks were 
politically disenfranchised this way: "I proved one thing: If you want 
something badly enough, all you have to do is roll up your sleeves and go for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's wife, Theresa, died several years ago, and his son, Melvin, died last 
spring. He is survived by his daughter, Sylvia, and Howard, his stepson. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services are scheduled for Jan. 4 at 10 a.m. at Victory Baptist Church 
in Los Angeles.

DWINDLING BLACK FARMERS FIGHT FORMIDABLE ODDS FOR FUTURE;

AGRICULTURE: SMALL OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE OWNED BY AFRICAN-AMERICANS,

TCHULA, Miss. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodalton Hart, a 39-year-old graduate of Jackson State University, has 2,000 
acres planted in cotton, corn, soybeans and sorghum. He also grazes cattle and 
has a lease, with option to buy, on 1,500 acres of prime Mississippi Delta 
bottom land. 
</P>
<P>
He owns his equipment: plows, harrows, tractors, combines, cotton pickers, 
planters -- you name it. He keeps a two-way radio in his mother's house and has 
a pickup with a car phone. He is an authentic hardhead: tough, resourceful, 
smart, certainly one of the more successful farmers in Holmes County, Miss. He 
is also black. 
</P>
<P>
Hart realized a long time ago that the system discriminates against small farms 
no matter what color their owners are. The lion's share of federal subsidies 
goes to large-scale farmers; those who produce more get more money. And loans 
are easier for big-acreage farmers to get; those with the most property have 
the most collateral. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to grow or die: "Getting bigger," Hart said, "is the only way 
to survive." 
</P>
<P>
And size alone will not ensure success. Hart is bucking the system and making 
it work, but history suggests that he is playing a losing hand. Black farming 
in the United States, by almost any measure, is a dying business. 
</P>
<P>
In 1920, there were more than 900,000 blacks among the nation's farmers, or 
one-seventh of the total. By 1978, there were only 57,271 black farmers; in the 
last agricultural census in 1987, there were 22,954 blacks -- a 60% decline in 
nine years. Today, just 0.1% of all farmers in the United States are black. 
</P>
<P>
Gone forever is the stereotypical sharecropper who worked in near peonage on 
white-owned land, doing the labor that used to be performed by slaves. 
Mechanization after World War II made such labor obsolete, and sharecropping 
all but disappeared by 1960. The few black farmers left are independent. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Civil Rights Commission predicted in 1982 that "there will be 
virtually no blacks operating farms in this country" by the end of the century. 
There is no reason to doubt this assertion; blacks are getting out of farming 
three times faster than whites. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have anyone who understands farming anymore. Farmers are 
disappearing and there's nobody replacing them," Hart said. "I couldn't 
encourage my son to go into farming; the system is geared up to get me -- he 
won't even have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Rep. Mike Espy (D-Miss.), this state's first black congressman since 
Reconstruction, succeeded in having $10 million for minority technical and 
educational assistance written into the 1990 farm bill -- money to try to save 
a dying trade: "I don't believe it's too late, but almost," Espy said. "We are 
going to have to work very hard to arrest the slide." 
</P>
<P>
It is a battle worthy of Sisyphus, since even the best black farmers in Holmes 
County, about 75 miles north of Jackson, have to struggle with a system that is 
exasperating on its best days, infuriating for much of the rest of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Discrimination in the modern South is a vicious circle. Because of racism and 
lack of opportunity, blacks historically have farmed the least arable land with 
the least adequate tools with the smallest investment. They could not and did 
not call on the white power structure for help. 
</P>
<P>
Today, banks are less likely to lend money to blacks, because blacks have the 
worst land, the worst tools and the fewest assets. By any measure, the bankers 
say, many black farmers are poor credit risks. Black farmers call it racism. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks don't have proper land, and if you get an opportunity to get land, they 
(whites) charge more," said Jimmy Lee Lacy. "A black farmer can even have the 
money, and they'll still deny him, especially if it's a white landowner." 
</P>
<P>
Lacy, at 57, has farmed near Tchula in Holmes County for 40 years. He started 
with cotton, corn, hogs and a mule-drawn plow. Like Hart, he is an anomaly, a 
success amid myriad failures. He has 640 acres planted in cotton and soybeans, 
almost all of it leased land. He is something of a local legend, known for his 
ability to make things grow -- and pay -- where nobody else can. "I'll do fair 
this year," is all he would say. "I always do fair." 
</P>
<P>
To escape the trap that history has sprung on them, black farmers turn to 
federal programs designed to circumvent the worst of society's biases. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy and many other black farmers in Holmes County complain about farm 
programs, especially those of the Farmers Home Administration, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture's lead agency in granting or guaranteeing crop loans 
to the poor farmers of the Mississippi Delta. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the complaints may be the customary farmer bellyaching. "Farmers Home 
never gives enough" is a frequent gripe, as is the widely held belief that the 
agency is staffed by incompetents. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks also say that Farmers Home systematically and deliberately drowns them 
in red tape, stalls on loans or responds late to their requests. The agency has 
an office in every agricultural county in the country, and most counties are 
staffed by local people. 
</P>
<P>
"I have talked about buying a plot of land from Farmers Home," Lacy said. "The 
guy I want to talk to is in the office until he finds out I'm black, then he's 
out of the office all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Lacy said he would like to see "justice" in lending from Farmers Home. What he 
wants are quick decisions: "A man needs his money on time," Lacy said. "If I 
apply in February, I want to know in March. I don't want to have to wait until 
May." 
</P>
<P>
It is a complaint heard throughout the Delta. Loans are agriculture's 
lifeblood, and Farmers Home is the lender of last resort, vitally important to 
Holmes County and hundreds of other poor counties in the rural South. A Farmers 
Home decision on whether to grant or deny a loan will often determine whether a 
black farmer can farm. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we have enough money to meet the needs of the community, we'll 
spend it," said Holmes County Farmers Home supervisor James L. (Larry) Bowen. 
"There's a place for the FHA, especially in a county like this. There are a lot 
of good farmers here, and they haven't got anywhere else to go." 
</P>
<P>
Bowen, a bluff, affable, middle-age white, is universally liked and respected 
by the black farmers of Holmes County. "He'll do anything he can for you," Hart 
said. "The problem is in other counties and in regional and state offices." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the equal-opportunity staff at Farmers Home in 
Washington show that blacks received 15% of all Farmers Home farm loans in 
Mississippi in the first quarter of 1990, but only 8% of the loan monies. The 
1987 agricultural census showed that blacks owned 13.7% of all farmland in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
These figures improved dramatically in Holmes County, however, bearing out the 
view of Lacy, Hart and others that Bowen's office will perhaps go further than 
others in helping blacks: A third of all loans in Holmes County, where black 
land ownership approximates that of the state as a whole, went to black farmers 
in the first three months of 1990, amounting to 30% of the available money. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, when department investigators found that Farmers Home was ignoring 
or violating equal rights laws in hiring, housing policies and loan 
preferences, the agency has tried to make a number of changes in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
It has given civil-rights training to all managers in the state and has 
conducted 100 civil-rights-compliance reviews at local offices. A loan program 
for socially disadvantaged farmers has been started, and the agency has entered 
into an outreach contract with Alcorn State University, a black land-grant 
school, to help black farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Specific instances of racial discrimination remain difficult to document, as do 
charges of foot-dragging or obstructing loans. For many black farmers, however, 
racism is there, even if they cannot prove it. 
</P>
<P>
"Any young white guy, he has no problem; he goes in there with his father and 
gets exactly what he wants," said Joshua Davis, 33, a beginning farmer with 162 
acres near Tchula planted in cotton and soybeans. "It doesn't work for us. Me 
and my dad go down there and apply for a loan, and they keep us waiting all day 
long." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers Home early this year denied Davis' loan application, saying he had no 
"cash flow," a local euphemism meaning he could show no profit at the end of 
his crop year. 
</P>
<P>
He appealed the ruling, and eventually won, but he still has not seen any 
money: "Seems like the way they have the system set up, they don't want a young 
black farmer to get started." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, unlike Hart or Lacy, has struggled since he first tried to plant a crop 
in 1982. One year he got a loan but could not repay it because rain delayed his 
harvest and reduced his cotton yield. Another year his son got sick, costing 
him a lot of money and forcing him to take a job in town. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "I haven't ever made any money farming," but said, "I hold 
the faith, and I'm hoping to bounce back." With cotton prices close to 70 cents 
a pound, it begins to look like he might finally succeed, "but there's a lot of 
time between now and going to gin." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, an easygoing, gentle man who once dreamed of playing professional 
basketball, takes his inspiration from his father, Shadrach Davis, 68, a stern, 
imposing, career farmer who marched in Mississippi with the civil-rights 
movement in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Shadrach Davis inherited 300 acres south of Tchula from his father and an aunt, 
and he has raised cotton on it since 1943. This year, he got $56,000 in loans, 
$30,000 of it guaranteed by Farmers Home. But, he said, "I asked for it in 
February and got it in May. I had to borrow from friends to get seed and plant 
my cotton." 
</P>
<P>
Shadrach Davis eventually would like to have Joshua take over the family farm. 
In the meantime, he is coaching Joshua on money and know-how. Without the 
boost, Joshua said, "I wouldn't have made it. He took care of himself and me." 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, Joshua said, he and other young farmers need some sort 
of a "pool" of federal money "set it aside so that if a young farmer has a bad 
year the government will stay with them, help them to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Shadrach agrees, but he is not hopeful: "If the little farmer could get some 
money and help, he could do all right. My daddy made a good living on 5 to 8 
acres," Shadrach said. "But they're trying to run Josh out of here, take the 
land. I'll tell you, though, no sucker in the world is going to take my land!" 
</P>
<P>
Educational and technical assistance -- from community organizations and 
colleges -- are the key element in Espy's minority farmers' rights legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it will make the USDA and, specifically, Farmers Home, more 
sensitive to minority farmers," Espy said. "It will also create some allies. 
Now we have a promotional component for minority farmers, just as we have in 
the farm program in general." 
</P>
<P>
They are small steps toward reversing a decline that has been going on for most 
of the 20th Century, the product of rural poverty in the South and urban 
promise in the North. 
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the '30s, you already had a lot of black farmers shaken loose 
from the system," said Pete Daniel, a curator in the Smithsonian Institution's 
Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. "Then World War II attracted a 
lot of blacks to industrial jobs, and when they saw how much money they could 
make, they never wanted to go home." 
</P>
<P>
The Mississippi Delta started to empty out as the emigrants headed for northern 
cities and menial jobs in factories and service industries. Shadrach Davis was 
20 in 1942 when his four brothers and sister moved to Detroit and Chicago, 
leaving him alone on the farm. "I never wanted to go north," he said. "My 
parents were getting old, and somebody had to stay on the farm, so I did." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, the exodus got a further boost from the widespread introduction 
of big farm machinery, especially automatic cotton pickers. 
</P>
<P>
"With mechanization, landowners could abandon sharecropping and tenant farming. 
They didn't need the labor," said Agriculture Department demographer Calvin 
Beale. "And by the end of the 1950s, a landowner couldn't go back to the old 
ways even if he wanted to. There weren't enough people left." 
</P>
<P>
The last jolt to black farming came at the end of the 1970s, and the beginning 
of the '80s. President Jimmy Carter encouraged farming and, at the beginning of 
his term, loans were easy to get -- even for farmers who, Rodalton Hart said, 
"maybe shouldn't have been farming." 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates started to rise, slowly at first, then alarmingly. Farmers 
defaulted on their loans, and then farms began to fail by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
The poorest and smallest farmers suffered the most, and blacks took a heavy 
hit. And, as the Reagan years wore on, Farmers Home, badly burned by liberal 
loan policies, became stingier. Loans were harder to get and black farmers 
again were disproportionately hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes County was a microcosm of this process. In 1930, it had 40,000 people 
and 6,604 farms, of which 5,660 were operated by blacks, many of them 
sharecroppers. In 1987, it had barely half that population and there were 420 
farms, 104 black farmers and no sharecropping. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes County today is one of the poorest in the nation, with per capita income 
estimated at $3,400 a year, and 70% to 80% of its people living in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is 15.3%, the highest in Mississippi. Lexington and 
Tchula, its two largest towns, are half empty, their streets lined with 
boarded-up buildings and used-furniture stores running fire sales. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the country, roads are unpaved and flanked by long, narrow "shotgun 
houses," so named because a single shotgun blast could pass through one of them 
from end to end. Most of these dwellings are tumbledown derelicts today, with 
porches overgrown by creeper vines and exteriors weathered to gray. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua Davis is hanging on, with his father's help. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers Home wouldn't give me a loan because I didn't have cash flow, but I 
had assets. I had a tractor, a planter, a cultivator, a harrow and a 40-foot 
cotton trailer," Davis said. "It cost me $25,000 just for planting expenses, 
chemicals and poison. I had to get it from Dad." 
</P>
<P>
As a young farmer, Davis is a rarity. As a young, black farmer, he is even more 
rare. As a young, black, small-acreage farmer, he is truly an endangered 
species, perhaps soon to be extinct.

VILLAGE LIFE IN PHILIPPINES: A STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE;

POVERTY: UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGH, IN PART BECAUSE YOUNG MEN OFTEN QUIT JOBS. 'WHEN

PILILLA, Philippines 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the first rays of morning burst over the verdant mountains, villagers awaken 
to nature's alarm clock, the cacophony of hundreds of roosters signaling a new 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Women in simple house dresses shuffle along the concrete streets to the 
neighborhood sari-sari stores to buy food for breakfast, usually rice with fish 
caught in nearby Laguna de Bay, a huge freshwater lake. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women crowd around outdoor hand-cranked water pumps to bathe in the 
cool morning. 
</P>
<P>
For the 25,000 people in this town 30 miles southeast of Manila, this day will 
be much like the thousands that preceded it, a search for sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
During the last decade, the Philippine Islands have been shaken by political 
turmoil, economic dislocation and social unrest, including the 1986 "people 
power revolution" that toppled the late President Ferdinand Marcos and 
propelled Corazon Aquino into the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
But in this town and the thousands like it where 70% of the 60 million 
Filipinos live, the rhythm of life has remained unchanged despite the upheavals 
in the capital, Manila. Life here is governed by customs and traditions shaped 
over the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that many aspects of that lifestyle -- including fatalism, 
family commitments and respect for authority -- deter social progress. 
</P>
<P>
But the timeless quality of Filipino life also provides a degree of stability 
in a nation still struggling to define its system of governing 44 years after 
independence from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Urban Filipinos, grappling with pollution, overcrowding and horrific traffic, 
tend to romanticize about the simple beauty of life in the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
During religious festivals or public holidays, thousands of urban dwellers 
return to the provinces to visit relatives and tend the graves of ancestors. 
The better-off urban relatives often give money to their less-fortunate kin or, 
if possible, help them get jobs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
For those who stay in the provinces, life is a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that nothing much has changed," says Nita Bolante, a housewife. "Life 
is hard these days. Everything is expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Pililla, a farming and fishing village in a relatively prosperous province, is 
not faced with the kind of hopeless poverty seen in the mountain communities of 
Luzon Island or the hinterlands of Mindanao, the second largest of the 7,100 
Philippine Islands. 
</P>
<P>
But by Western standards, life here is grim. 
</P>
<P>
Most people live in two-story, tin-roofed homes of wood and stone built close 
to one another. The ground floor houses chickens or an occasional pig and goat. 
</P>
<P>
The second story serves by day as a sitting room, by night as a common bedroom 
where family members sleep on woven mats of palm leaves. Many residents tend 
small vegetable plots in a country with virtually a year-round growing season. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, crowds of young men, dressed in T-shirts and shorts, loiter in 
the streets, unable to find work. So common is the phenomenon that the Filipino 
language has a word for them -- istambay, a Philippinized version of the 
English phrase "I stand by." 
</P>
<P>
Most istambays work occasionally, helping out in the fields during harvests, 
fishing or hustling cigarettes in the streets of larger towns. 
</P>
<P>
When they accumulate a little money, they quit and fritter away their time 
drinking local whiskey until the cash is gone. Then they work again. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Leonardo Legazpi, archbishop of Naga, attributes the istambay 
phenomenon to climate and centuries of colonial rule, which discouraged 
personal initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"You build your house, then the typhoon blows it down, and you build it again," 
Legazpi says. "The Filipino can work very hard, but there's never a feeling 
that you work to improve your condition." 
</P>
<P>
One istambay, Ronnie Tejade, 28, says he worked most recently at an appliance 
factory until he accumulated enough seniority to qualify for severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
He then quit, collected his money and used it to pay off his debts because his 
salary of $36 a month fell short of his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"When I don't work, I earn nothing," Tejade says. "When you work, you still 
earn nothing. It comes to that." 
</P>
<P>
But fatalism has prevented this sense of hopelessness from becoming the 
catalyst for social revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not blaming the government," Tejade says as he sips his whiskey. "We were 
born this way. We have to live our lives this way." 
</P>
<P>
Lack of educational opportunities contribute to the cycle. Pililla has a free, 
state-run elementary school, but the nearest public high school is 15 miles 
away in Morong. 
</P>
<P>
There is no free school bus service, and many parents cannot afford the 
$14-a-month transportation charge, as well as fees for books, meals and 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
For the more ambitious provinciano, the ticket to a better life has 
traditionally been a job abroad, especially in the Middle East. About 500,000 
Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia and send home their savings to families in the 
provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Many "Saudi boys," as they are known locally, return with savings that they 
invest in small businesses, such as neighborhood stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a dream, but it's still unfulfilled," says Hermi Retuerna, 28, a 
foreman on a small farm. "I want to join my brother in Saudi Arabia. I want to 
leave for the future of my two children." 
</P>
<P>
Long-term separations strain family ties, but the alternatives are worse. 
</P>
<P>
"You may be together but you have nothing to eat and you cannot send your 
children to school," says Mrs. Bolante, whose husband works in Saudi Arabia and 
sends $200 a month to his wife and five children. "At least there's an 
assurance you'll be able to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Family ties, strong in Philippine culture, keep many villagers from leaving. As 
in other Asian societies, Filipinos often live in extended families, with aged 
parents, breadwinners and children under the same roof. 
</P>
<P>
Breadwinners pool their resources for the family's livelihood. Those who cannot 
work are rarely turned away. The system inhibits a natural flow of workers to 
available jobs and keeps unemployment rates high in impoverished areas. 
</P>
<P>
But it also provides an economic and psychological cushion in a country where 
few earn pensions or collect welfare.

JEWISH CATACOMBS REMAIN SECRET; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO MAKE THE TOMBS IN ROME AS POPULAR AS THE 
CHRISTIAN ONES. THE BURIAL SPACES ARE A UNIQUE DOCUMENTATION OF LIFE DURING THE 
FIRST CENTURIES AFTER JESUS.

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Roman Catholic Church turned over the Jewish catacombs to Italy, 
leaders of the West's oldest Jewish community thought they would be as popular 
with tourists as the Christian catacombs on the Appian Way. 
</P>
<P>
More than five years later, most tourists still do not know that the Jewish 
catacombs exist. Those who do have to brave Rome's bureaucracy for permission 
to visit them. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to make the Jewish catacombs safe and easy to visit fell victim to a 
government budget that is chronically short of money even to care for 
archeological sites already open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"All the plans are ready," said Nicoletta Pagliardi of Rome's superintendency 
of archeology. "We could do it tomorrow, but the funds are used up. We have to 
wait for next year's budget." 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed but determined, Italian Jews have turned to private groups. Last 
spring, the World Monuments Fund began raising money for a scientific survey of 
what must be done to make the catacombs suitable for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The catacombs, used in the first three or four centuries after Jesus, are a 
"unique documentation of Jewish life, of a religious minority which lived in 
imperial Rome," said Tullia Zevi, president of the Union of Italian Jewish 
Communities. 
</P>
<P>
Burial spaces, like narrow berths in a railroad sleeper car, were carved in 
soft tufa stone, one atop the other. Inscriptions on marble slabs that covered 
the niches are the main source of information about the ancient Jews, Zevi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Inscriptions indicate that the Jews prayed mainly in Greek and spoke in Latin. 
Many apparently were ordinary people, artisans or merchants, but there also 
were bankers, magistrates, actors and other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
On the walls of the catacombs are stunning images of menorahs, peacocks and 
pomegranates symbolizing fertility. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the inscriptions now reside in the Vatican's museums and storerooms. 
The Vatican took charge of the Jewish catacombs after their discovery more than 
100 years ago, before the modern Italian state was created, because it was the 
only organization with the means to excavate them. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40,000 to 60,000 Jews lived in ancient Italy, compared to today's 
total of 35,000 to 40,000. A synagogue at Ostia Antica, Rome's ancient port, 
may be the oldest monotheistic temple in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Of Rome's six known Jewish catacombs, four collapsed or were built upon in the 
last centuries. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth is on property of a private villa near the Appia Antica and the sixth 
on the grounds of Villa Torlonia, now a city park, where dictator Benito 
Mussolini lived for 20 years. Mussolini signed the 1929 Lateran Pacts that gave 
the Vatican control of all catacombs. 
</P>
<P>
To see the Jewish catacombs, a visitor must apply in person for a permit at the 
superintendency of archeology. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person comes to Rome for a weekend, they'll be gone by the time they get 
a permit," Zevi said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all requests are from scholars or Jewish groups, Pagliardi said, and 
"it's rare when an ordinary tourist hears about" the catacombs. 
</P>
<P>
Zevi said she realizes it will not be possible to match the hours of the 
Christian catacombs, which are open morning and afternoon six days a week and 
have thousands of visitors. Villa Torlonia, for example, can accommodate only 
about 10 people at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish groups would be content to see the catacombs open to the public at least 
one day a week, Zevi said. 
</P>
<P>
The World Monuments Fund favors making the Jewish catacombs more accessible, 
but it worries that tourists might damage them -- by brushing against a 
frescoed wall, innocently introducing bacteria, even just by breathing, said 
Samuel Gruber, director of the fund's Jewish Heritage Council. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliardi said Christian catacombs have been damaged by excessive numbers of 
visitors and the state wants to save the Jewish catacombs from a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
Electrical wiring has been installed in the first 100 yards of the 
half-mile-long passageway at Villa Torlonia, but much remains to be done. When 
it rains, archeologists place blocks of wood near the entrance to serve as 
stepping stones through ankle-deep water. 
</P>
<P>
The reward for going in is a chance to stand for a few minutes in a room that 
testifies to the Jews' strong feelings for their faith. A menorah fresco 
decorates the vaulted ceiling and a rolled scroll, representing the Torah, is 
painted near the entryway. 
</P>
<P>
Other frescoes include dolphins, palm leaves and the Ark of the Covenant.

DROUGHT SPURS ANOTHER ISRAELI-ARAB CONFLICT

<P>
Israel has stopped pumping water from the Sea of Galilee and the River Jordan 
has become a dirty, brown stream. Palestinians often are lucky to get a drip 
when they turn on the faucet. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is suffering a drought, which in the Middle East means much more than 
not being able to sprinkle the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Water is another of the region's many crises, extending beyond Israel to 
Turkey, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. Water is inseparable from Israel's conflict 
with the Arabs, and especially the Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture minister Rafael Eitan has run full-page newspaper ads warning 
Israelis that their country would lose nearly 60% of its water if it gave up 
the occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Water is an extremely scarce resource in Israel," the ads say. "In fact, it is 
in many ways the limiting factor on the country's future development." 
</P>
<P>
As thousands of Soviet immigrants pour in monthly, with 1 million expected by 
the end of 1992, everyone fears a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians see Israel's handling of water as another attempt to drive them 
from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"Water is a final solution to the Palestinian problem," said Saeb Erakat, a 
professor of political science at An-Najah University in the West Bank. 
"Denying Palestinians water means, 'Get out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Erakat turned on the tap at his home in Jericho, an oasis city since ancient 
times. A few drops trickled out and he said: "No water, no life." 
</P>
<P>
Eitan calls Israel's dwindling water sources "a potential catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 25, Israel stopped pumping water from the Sea of Galilee, which 
supplies about a quarter of its drinking water. The sea had dropped to within 2 
inches of the level where more pumping could turn it into a salt lake. 
</P>
<P>
Reports say the country's underground water also is near the danger level. 
</P>
<P>
Predictions are for a late, plentiful rainfall this winter, but November ended 
without significant rainfall. A group of rabbis even held a special prayer for 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaza Strip has more serious problems than the West Bank or Israel. Open 
sewers in crowded refugee camps drain into its only water source, an aquifer 
nearly destroyed by overuse. Israel already pumps in water for the few thousand 
Jewish settlers and 750,000 Arabs in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Eitan talks of importing water from Turkey or Eastern Europe 
and building desalination plants. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve army general leads the right-wing Tsomet Party, which wants to make 
the occupied lands part of Israel. "Giving up control of the West Bank is 
basically giving up control of the entire water system," said Martin Sherman, 
one of his advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Water from an underground mountain reservoir that straddles the West Bank and 
Israel now is divided 80-20 in Israel's favor. The government says this is 
justified under international law, based on population figures before Israel 
captured the territory in the 1967 Middle East war. 
</P>
<P>
One-quarter of all Israel's water comes from the reservoir. The ad placed by 
Eitan's ministry said another aquifer that provides one-third of the supply 
would be affected if a Palestinian state were to be created in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Erakat said 30% less arable land is irrigated now than before 1967, reducing 
the economic output of the West Bank by more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Shehadeh H. Dajani, manager of the Arab Development Society in Jericho, used a 
large map on the wall of his office to point out land that was irrigated before 
the occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something they have gained after 1967, and they don't only control the 
land, but our water from heaven," Dajani said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied taking water that should go to Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, Israelis use twice as much water per person 
as Palestinians. A government conservation campaign has had little effect and 
farmers have stymied efforts to raise the subsidized price of water for 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
As the crisis gets worse, Sherman said, the government will have to decide who 
gets water and how much. 
</P>
<P>
Left-wing legislator Dedi Zucker said water is the deciding factor in the 
Palestinian-Israel conflict. "It will either force us to cooperate with one 
another or to kill one another by thirst," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Jordan and Syria have water disputes with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I would tell the world, if you want to limit the tension in the Middle East, 
don't send tanks and don't confuse us with fruitless talks," Eitan said. "Send 
water and that will cool down the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
In Oja, a village outside Jericho, Mubarak al-Nujoum pointed to fields 
overgrown with brush and blamed his water shortage on a nearby Jewish 
settlement that even has a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
He said more than half his 25-acre farm, which supports an extended family of 
17 people, no longer is irrigated. He still raises tomatoes, cucumbers and 
corn, but has stopped growing bananas because they need too much water. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Nujoum threw a pebble into an irrigation pond, which he said was only 
one-third its normal depth. 
</P>
<P>
"These whirls of water are the rings of war here," he said.

Shirley Ceasar is 27, and she is expecting her 10th child. But another baby 
won't be a burden for her. Like the rest of her kids, the child will be taken 
care of by its grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley, a crack addict for at least four years, lives in Harlem with her 
boyfriend, the father of all her children. Her mother, Sarah Mae Ceasar, lives 
a 15-minute subway ride away, in a housing project in lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
There, in a cramped three-bedroom apartment, Sarah Ceasar takes care of five of 
her grandchildren, including 11-year-old Walique, who was born deaf and 
mentally retarded. Shirley's other children are cared for by their paternal 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go up and see them and there was nothing in the refrigerator to eat, 
no clothes for them to wear, they weren't even going to school," said Sarah 
Ceasar, 57, who is hoping to adopt the children. "I'd bring them clothes. Their 
father would sell the clothes for drugs." 
</P>
<P>
In New York City and other large metropolitan areas, grandmothers such as 
Ceasar are the glue holding together many poor black families splintered by 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the crack epidemic has made addicts of more young 
minority women than any other drug in history. In particular, experts say, it 
has threatened the tradition of black women who often hold their families 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a quality in crack that is so quickly addictive that people don't get 
away with experimenting with it," said Richard Johnson, director of the Jewish 
Child Care Assn. of New York. "Women who would normally retain some 
responsibility and some conscience about their children don't have the chance. 
They're addicted so quickly. They're just lost." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the number of children in New York City's kinship foster care 
program, which allows grandmothers and other relatives to receive aid for 
taking care of dependents, has jumped from 150 to 17,000. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the placements of children within kinship foster care are 
the result of mothers' crack addiction, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the absence of a father is bad, but now the mother is missing," said 
Melba Hamilton, director of the Harlem Dowling Children's Service. "These 
children are facing a very bleak future." 
</P>
<P>
And, as a result, grandmothers like Sarah Ceasar have been called upon to 
assume enormous family burdens. 
</P>
<P>
They are mostly Southern women, tied to a rural past while mired in the harsh 
economic realities of the inner city, according to social workers. Many came to 
New York as newlyweds, hoping for a better life. Most have outlived their 
husbands and lost some of their children to drugs and the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Now they must become mothers again, sometimes caring for children born impaired 
or mentally handicapped because of their mothers' addictions. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the grandmothers are really exhausted and would like to not have to 
do this," said Johnson. "But if it has to be done, they're going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Some grandmothers care for their grandchildren on an informal basis. But a 
growing number are taking advantage of kinship foster care and the financial 
aid it offers. Depending on the age of the child, foster grandmothers are 
allowed anywhere from $450 to $900 per month for their care. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strain the grandchildren add to their lives, some grandmothers are 
surprisingly resilient and learn to enjoy having kids around again. 
</P>
<P>
Some are younger than the stereotypical grandmother. In the words of Lorraine 
Hale, director of Hale House, a Harlem home for the children of unwed, working 
and drug-addicted mothers, "They don't all wear their gray hair in a bun and 
act wise." But they're often realistic when it comes to the problems of their 
own children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my fault," Sarah Ceasar said of the drug addiction of her daughter, 
Shirley, and her other children. "It's their fault and it's their life. If they 
don't want to make anything out of their life, there's nothing I can do about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Her grandchildren remain loyal to their parents but said they love their 
grandmother and the security of her home. 
</P>
<P>
"She takes us out places and does a lot of things with us," said Rasheeda, 10. 
"I like being home with her instead of a foster home." 
</P>
<P>
The children's father, Lorenzo Adderley, 28, also said he was grateful to Sarah 
Ceasar. As he stood in the doorway of the Harlem apartment he shares with 
Shirley Ceasar, whom he met when he was 14, Adderley said that he was looking 
for work and that Shirley soon may go into a drug rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Ceasar said both Adderley and her daughter are addicts. Adderley said 
Shirley was, but denied that he was an addict, though he appeared to be under 
the influence of drugs during an interview. Shirley Ceasar declined to be 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Ceasar, who was born and reared in Sumter, S.C., is not unlike many of 
the grandmothers who look a decade or more older than their age, testament to 
unusually harsh lives. 
</P>
<P>
Her life story, the details of which she recounted stoically in her living room 
as her grandchildren did their homework at the dining room table, has been one 
of frequent tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Her father was an alcoholic who beat his wife and children and forced her to 
begin work in the field picking peas and corn at the age of 8. Two of her 
brothers were murdered as young adults. She got pregnant at 13 and married the 
father. 
</P>
<P>
After the family moved to New York, one of her sons was strangled at age 17 and 
another died of a heart attack in her living room at age 30. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in a Manhattan social services office with her caseworker, Blanche 
Giles, 68, who arrived in Harlem from Atlanta in 1949, recounts an equally 
tumultuous life. 
</P>
<P>
She copes by rising at 5 a.m. every day and opening to the 91st Psalm in the 
Bible she brought from Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"It opens up the day for me," she said. "It keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
Giles needs all the spiritual sustenance she can muster. She has been a widow 
since 1967. Her only child, a daughter, died of a heart attack brought on by 
alcoholism and other addictions at the age of 45 the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Giles then reared her two granddaughters, one of whom, Marilyn, also an 
alcoholic, died of a brain tumor in 1987. Giles, who often had cared for 
Marilyn's children over the years, now has custody of Rochelle, 17, Randy, 15, 
Andree, 13, Eunique, 11, and Tenell, 10. Rochelle is pregnant with twins. 
</P>
<P>
Giles' other granddaughter also has had problems with addiction, and her two 
children are with their paternal grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Viola Jenkins, 63, has lived in the same apartment building in the South Bronx 
since she arrived in New York from her native Fayetteville, N.C., in 1945. Her 
husband, with whom she had four children, died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, she has taken care of her grandson and granddaughter. They were 
placed in her care after authorities were tipped off that the children were 
being tied to the radiator in the apartment they shared with their parents, who 
fought often and were involved with drugs. 
</P>

CRITICS SAY EXHIBIT HID GLASGOW'S GRIMY PAST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it's a sign of better times in tough old Glasgow that this year's 
biggest uproar was about the past. 
</P>
<P>
Critics attacked an exhibition about the city's 800 years, which stressed its 
relations with the world, for "sanitizing history." 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow's Glasgow, as it was called, closed last month and was the city's 
biggest attraction in 50 years, drawing a half-million visitors. The show may 
have lost more than $8 million in its 30-week run, which the city will have to 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was the centerpiece of the yearlong festival celebrating the 
city's year as the European Capital of Culture, bestowed by culture ministers 
of the 12-nation European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Below the central railway station, unused for 60 years, the show assembled 
3,200 artifacts of Glasgow history, industry and social life. 
</P>
<P>
They ranged from a model of the yacht Shamrock V, with which Glasgow grocery 
tycoon Sir Thomas Lipton made five unsuccessful tries for the America's Cup, to 
the suitcase of an emigrant who paid 2 pounds (then $10) for passage to Canada 
in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Documentary films lauded Glasgow's greatness as the second city of the British 
Empire, an industrial cornucopia that poured out textiles, locomotives, weapons 
and, by 1913, about 60% of the world's ships. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the exhibition was a great success," said Robert Palmer, director of 
the cultural year. "A space which was dripping wet, unusable and derelict was 
renovated, and that space and the new Arches Theater there seem certain to 
become a permanent part of the city's life." 
</P>
<P>
An unusual partnership of business and a socialist council budgeted 50 million 
pounds ($80 million when the year began) to make Cultural Capital 1990 a 
success. About $7 million went for Glasgow's Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
Sniper fire was aimed at it regularly, however, by the daily Glasgow Herald and 
Workers' City, a group of left-wing and anarchist artists and workers. The 60 
or so active Workers' City members champion the class struggle against what 
they regard as Glasgow's yuppie ascendancy. 
</P>
<P>
Although unemployment remains above 14%, the cultural capital designation 
recognized Glasgow's self-regeneration from industrial blight, slums, ill 
health and violence to a humming center of commerce, tourism and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
The poor have been moved out of the city center and their tenements demolished, 
but to Workers' City they are no better off in the bleak, damp tower blocks 
erected for them on Glasgow's periphery. 
</P>
<P>
"In the interests of privatizing Glasgow and presenting it as a place without 
problems, the Glasgow's Glasgow exhibition buries our history of industrial 
struggle," said Brendan McLaughlin, owner of the Scotia Bar, where Workers' 
City meets.

El Nino, a weather phenomenon first detected by Peruvian fishermen at the turn 
of the century, could leave much of rural Australia praying for rain next year, 
weather forecasters said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
El Nino may bring drought conditions to eastern Australia, where farmers are 
suffering from falling commodity prices and high interest rates, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The effect begins with a warming of water in the Pacific between Australia and 
South America followed by a change in atmospheric pressure and a movement of 
winds that carry rain-bearing clouds away from Australia toward the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
It was named El Nino, Spanish for boy child, by fishermen off Peru who noticed 
an increase in water temperature followed by torrential rain.

YAKIMA REBEL STANDS GROUND FOR FISHING RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
INDIANS: DAVID SOHAPPY BELIEVES IN TRADITION AND AN 1855 TREATY GUARANTEEING AN 
UNLIMITED SALMON AND STEELHEAD HARVEST.

COOKS LANDING, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old fishing platform sags, held up by ropes, a few rotting boards and 
perhaps the ghosts of fishermen who lived at a time when Indians pulled as many 
salmon as they wanted from the Columbia River. 
</P>
<P>
David Sohappy, a Yakima religious leader and rebel, believes that is a right 
worth fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go fishing whenever I feel like it. With no strings attached 
whatsoever," Sohappy says. 
</P>
<P>
It is an idea as dated as the old-fashioned platform, long since supplanted by 
powerboats. But for Sohappy, there is no compromising his belief that Indians 
have the right to fish when and where they want, guaranteed by the Yakima 
Nation's Treaty of 1855. 
</P>
<P>
After 20 months in prison, suffering a stroke and being threatened with 
eviction from his ramshackle home, he still refuses to give up. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, U.S. District Judge George Boldt of Tacoma issued a ruling limiting 
Indian rights to half the harvestable salmon and steelhead in the Puget Sound 
region. That decision arose, in part, from protests Sohappy and other Indian 
began in 1968 over state restrictions on their fishing. 
</P>
<P>
For all the fuss he has created, Sohappy rarely fishes. He prefers to spend his 
time watching soap operas and TV news. A frail 65-year-old man with one arm 
crippled by the stroke, he speaks barely above a mumble and leans on an old 
golf putter to walk. 
</P>
<P>
"I speak softly but carry a big stick," he joked, brandishing the putter. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest chapter of this rebel's saga, Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) and Sen. 
Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), are asking the government to stop eviction efforts 
against Sohappy. 
</P>
<P>
The government argues that the Cooks Landing fishing site where Sohappy lives 
with his wife and some of his seven children is supposed to be a river access 
point for all Indians, not a private home. 
</P>
<P>
Sohappy built a long house -- a communal dwelling that also serves as a church 
-- on this spit of land on the shore of the mile-wide Columbia, east of 
Vancouver, Wash., in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The long house stands as a protest to the flooding of more than 40 Indian homes 
and 37 of their fishing spots with construction of Bonneville Dam in 1937. The 
government agreed in 1945 to replace those homes and fishing sites, but little 
progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
Sohappy says he has a historic right to live and fish on the river and he will 
never leave the home to which he returned to after his release from prison in 
May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Move out and let them win? No way!" he said. "We still own the land." Sohappy, 
a leader of the Indian feather religion, speaks of dire consequences for whites 
who harass Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just asking for trouble," he said. "People have told them to leave us 
alone. If they don't, nature will step in and make you spend millions of 
dollars on weather-related things." 
</P>
<P>
The 365-page Department of the Interior appropriations bill contains one 
paragraph directing Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan to reconsider the eviction 
issue. The bill awaits President Bush's signature. 
</P>
<P>
Sohappy and his son, David Jr., were arrested by federal and state wildlife 
authorities in an undercover operation called "Salmonscam" in 1981 and 1982. 
They were accused of selling 317 fish out of season. 
</P>
<P>
The Sohappys were convicted in federal court in Los Angeles in 1983 and 
sentenced to five years in prison. They served 20 months each and remain on 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
A Yakima Tribal Court jury in 1987 acquitted them of tribal poaching charges. 
That trial, labeled "Tradition on Trial," won international attention from 
human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
Some members were angry when the tribe prosecuted Sohappy, tribal prosecutor 
Jack Fiander said. Others were glad a violator of tribal fishing laws was on 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The tribe for 25 years has set fishing seasons for its members and rules for 
equipment, Fiander said. They prosecuted Sohappy to protect tribal authority in 
such matters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"David Sohappy, like any human being, is neither all good nor all bad," Fiander 
said. "Sometimes, he was both."

JUDGE SHAKES UP THE SYSTEM IN DRIVE FOR NEW FACILITIES; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISM: PAM ILES IS NEARING HER GOAL FOR A PROPOSED $190-MILLION CIVIC 
CENTER. THE AREA OF ORANGE COUNTY HAS EXPERIENCED SKYROCKETING POPULATION 
GROWTH.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Orange County officials put off a decision on plans to expand South Orange 
Municipal Court, Judge Pam Iles made preliminary arrangements to hold court in 
the elegant grand ballroom of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point and bill the 
county for the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Officials swiftly offered her new office space in a Laguna Hills commercial 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
And when a county building inspector delayed the approval of renovation work on 
the building, Iles returned to her chambers and dictated a contempt citation 
against the inspector. The inspector approved the project the same evening. 
</P>
<P>
Known for her sharp wit and untraditional style on and off the bench, Iles, 46, 
has taken the law into her own hands in lobbying for better court facilities in 
South County, an area where rapid population growth has caused the caseload to 
skyrocket and outstrip existing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Many people say that after several years of threatening, prodding and 
negotiating, she is closer than ever to achieving her goal of having a new 
regional civic center built in the area. The proposed $190-million facility 
would house at least 19 courtrooms, a prisoner-detention facility, a Sheriff's 
Department substation and several other county agencies. The proposed site is a 
100-acre plot just south of Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
"Pam is a progressive judge who has good ideas of where she would like to see 
the courts grow," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "She has incredible amounts 
of energy and a great deal of determination. I have a great sense of optimism 
that she'll succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Iles' quest for improvements to court facilities in South County began shortly 
after she was appointed in 1982 to South Orange Municipal Court, which covers 
an area from south of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to Riverside County, and 
from south of Crystal Cove to San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, she earned a reputation as an aggressive jurist who was not 
afraid to shake up the court's rigid tradition. But Iles, who served as head of 
the court's building fund, soon discovered that the burgeoning caseload and 
inadequate courtrooms were creating problems for judges, prosecutors, public 
defenders, court staff and defendants alike. 
</P>
<P>
The main courthouse, which consists of four courtrooms, is in the South County 
Regional Civic Center on Crown Valley Parkway in Laguna Niguel. An annex on 
Moulton Parkway in Laguna Hills houses three traffic and small claims courts. 
</P>
<P>
Iles, a former public defender and deputy district attorney, has lived in South 
County since 1962 and has seen the region's once rolling farmland and verdant 
foothills converted into a series of freeway off-ramps leading to residential 
communities, business parks and regional shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
And as the area grew, so did the litigation cycle and the need for more courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then there were more cows than people," she said. "But now we have more 
than 400,000 people (in South County). After they get into their new houses, 
they sue their builders, their landscapers and their neighbors over the barking 
dog. Then they get arrested for beating the neighbor over his barking dog and 
for drunk driving. Cows almost never get arrested for drunk driving." 
</P>
<P>
South County is now the fastest-growing judicial district in the state and 
perhaps the country, Iles said. During the last decade the caseload in South 
County has almost doubled -- from 65,204 in 1981 to an estimated 125,831 in 
1990 -- while increases in office space for courts and staff have been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mounting caseload, the latest report by the Judicial Council -- the 
policy-making arm of the state court system -- stated that South Orange 
Municipal Court disposed of more cases in 1988-89 than any other court of its 
size in the state. The handful of South County judges -- four judges and three 
commissioners -- disposed of more cases per judge than all but three of the 88 
Municipal Courts in California. They handled an average of 19,505 criminal, 
traffic, civil and small-claims matters -- or more than 75 cases per day. 
</P>
<P>
"We clearly have the best pit crews in the business," Presiding Municipal Judge 
Arthur Koelle said in a memorandum to court staff. "And we certainly do need 
them, since sometimes it's really the pits. . . . For doing such an outstanding 
job, we can assure you that you will all get your reward . . . but not 
necessarily in this lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
County officials also predict that court filings in South County will continue 
to soar as population continues to increase. The region is where most of the 
major new planned communities will be built in the 1990s and will increase by 
10,000 new residents a year -- representing an annual growth of 2.6%, a county 
study on the proposed South County facility noted. 
</P>
<P>
During the last decade, South County added an average of 16,000 residents a 
year, a growth rate of 6.4% a year, contrasted with the 2.1% rate countywide. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of some public agencies in South County, who would benefit from a new 
regional center, believe that the public is oblivious to their poor working 
conditions. For example, a dilapidated trailer housing the public defender's 
office was destroyed a couple of years ago when the stench of dead rats became 
overbearing. 
</P>
<P>
The department's six lawyers, who represent criminal defendants who cannot 
afford private attorneys, now share a narrow, closet-size trailer with their 
secretarial staff. Public defenders interview clients outside the trailer and 
use a meeting room at the neighboring county library and a separate trailer to 
store their court files and books. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lawyers' offices are their briefcases and back pockets," said Chief Deputy 
Public Defender Carl Holmes. "We've threatened several times to close our 
office, but the county has repeatedly assured us that a new building is right 
around the corner. . . . They've said so a dozen times and we're still 
waiting." 
</P>
<P>
The sentiment is shared by many other agencies who face similar, if not graver, 
problems. At the sheriff's substation down the road from the court, the office 
is even more claustrophobic. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department serves four cities in the South County in addition to 
its unincorporated territory -- the largest such area left in the county. It 
moved into its modular trailer -- complete with wheels and license plates -- in 
1979. The staff, including civilians and sheriff's deputies, totaled 95 people. 
Now, 226 people occupy the same space. 
</P>
<P>
Male and female deputies change into their uniforms in the parking lot, and 
employees have to step around holes in the floor, said Assistant Sheriff Dennis 
LaDucer. 
</P>
<P>
There are no interview rooms, he said, so rape victims are interrogated in full 
view of other staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The conditions have reached almost crisis proportions," LaDucer said. "There 
has been a cavalier approach to our concern. It doesn't seem that anybody is 
moving or showing care at all for those men and women who go out to protect the 
community. All we're asking for is a few of the basic amenities, like lockers 
and showers." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, after spending more than $350,000 to study an expansion for the 
Laguna Niguel site, the county reported that it was putting off the project 
because of a lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"They were buying time," Iles said. "We had no jury assembly room. The jury, 
attorneys, and all the witnesses were milling around the hall. The lines for 
traffic court wrapped around the building." 
</P>
<P>
Iles decided to take the matter into her own hands. She approached the Santa 
Margarita Co. and said she needed 100 acres of the 44,000-acre Rancho Mission 
Viejo land managed by the company. After meeting with company officials, she 
said she was gratified with their response and turned over the negotiations to 
the county's chief administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Gaynor, a spokeswoman for the company, said that the company has made no 
commitments to Iles and that there are no serious discussions taking place. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it is not a top discussion item for us due to various business 
reasons," Gaynor said. "We probably wouldn't be able to discuss this land use 
until later next year." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Vasquez, however, said the county board's recent approval of the 
company's Las Flores project included an agreement that the company would 
consider participating in such a project. 
</P>
<P>
With the county facing a severe budget crunch, county officials said, financing 
a regional civic center would be a problem. But Iles foresaw that and has 
suggested public-private partnerships to build the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The old way was to raise a bond and have the county pay through its nose," 
Iles said. "This is not a little private kingdom. It's a cooperative community 
project." 
</P>
<P>
An interim county report on the South County facility urged the county to 
determine which cities might be interested in helping to finance the 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I have held some discussions with the mayors and they are very receptive to 
the idea," Vasquez said. "We have to look at financing alternatives, and the 
major cost is the land cost. We may be able to work for an arrangement (for the 
land) and identify financing for construction." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez acknowledged that he has had informal discussions with Santa Margarita 
Co. officials, adding that the prospects for an arrangement appear promising. 
</P>
<P>
Iles said she is heartened by the progress made in pursuing a new regional 
center. "I think I've been justified in being critical of the county in the 
past," she said. "But I'm not fighting anymore. It's a new can-do philosophy in 
the CAO's office. They are truthful in their negotiations, and I can take their 
word to the bank." 
</P>
<P>
She added, however, that she hoped that there are no further delays, because 
"justice is being denied." 
</P>
<P>
"The people who come to us need help," she said. "The only happy people who 
come here are those who come to get married, and sometimes that only lasts a 
short period of time. We are the only game in town. I hope we don't run out of 
time. If we run out of time, we're running out of options, and it'll be a loss 
we can't recoup from. 
</P>
<P>
"Time," she said, "is my enemy."

"You do know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together 
and blow." 
</P>
<P>
That was Lauren Bacall's husky parting shot to Humphrey Bogart in the classic 
film "To Have and Have Not." It seems hardly anybody knows that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, sure, people do whistle. You hear those ear-splitting shrieks at football 
games, the shrill blasts that summon home wandering pets, the descending note 
of surprise, the wolf whistle. 
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the country it's rare to hear somebody whistling a tune in 
public. Rarer still to hear it done well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost a lost art," said Bill Taylor of Musician Magazine in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in this century, street-corner whistling mirrored popular music. Top 
entertainers -- Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Sammy Davis Jr., Jack Benny and folk 
singer Pete Seeger, to name a few -- whistled in their acts, and amateurs 
picked up the tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Taylor, a Boston jazz promoter, said some artists occasionally incorporate 
whistling into their acts, and a few avant-garde performers whistle 
exclusively. "It's in the novelty category," he said. "It's a cult." 
</P>
<P>
Among the faithful is Brad Terry, who discovered his talent about 25 years ago 
in a Manhattan parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, a jazz clarinetist from Brunswick, Me., had just finished a jam session. 
While waiting for his car, he started whistling. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extraordinary," Terry recalled. "It had tremendous reverberation. There 
were 25 or 30 people standing on a platform behind me, and they all started 
applauding." 
</P>
<P>
Not long after that, he tried whistling on stage. "It's been part of the act 
ever since," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Terry has since recorded three whistling albums, and is one of the few 
professional practitioners of what appears to be a vanishing art. 
</P>
<P>
Downbeat Magazine has called Terry "the finest jazz whistler in the world." 
Another practitioner is Ron McCroby of Chagrin Falls, Ohio. An advertising 
executive by trade, McCroby has recorded jazz and classical albums and 
performed on the "Tonight" show. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of spare-time whistlers has been trying for more than a 
decade to revive the dying art. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of us had noticed that you don't hear whistling anymore," said Mimi 
Drummond of Horsham, Pa., who publishes a newsletter for the International 
Whistlers' Assn. "So we formed the association to promote whistling, especially 
among children." 
</P>
<P>
The group evolved from a whistling contest sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce 
in Carson City, Nev., in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 people showed up for the "Whistle-Off." Some whistled a cappella; 
others were accompanied by piano, guitar, banjo, washboards, taped music and 
even live back-up singers. Since then, the association has grown to about 200 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-core whistlers want to elevate whistling to a serious musical form. "We 
don't do the bird-whistle competition," said Drummond, a national champion. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, whistlers want to preserve the light-hearted spirit that 
prompts them to whistle, so they have a novelty category. One year a contestant 
performed while standing on her head. 
</P>
<P>
Whistlers say their art is a form of self-expression more socially acceptable 
than bursting into song in public. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to walk down the street and see people smiling at you," Drummond 
said. "If you walked down the street singing 'How Great Thou Art,' you'd get 
carted away in a wagon." 
</P>
<P>
Whistlers' techniques differ. Most make music by blowing air out; a few by 
drawing it in. Most pucker. Some smile widely as they whistle through their 
teeth. Some produce a reedy sound deep in their throats. Some whistle through 
their fingers or fists. 
</P>
<P>
Whistling, so it is said, began as signaling. The earliest known whistlers were 
shepherds and sailors, who wanted sounds to carry great distances. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, whistling was a popular form of music-hall entertainment 
in the 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the Oxford Companion to 
Music, Alice Shaw, an entertainer known as "La Belle Siffleuse" (The Beautiful 
Whistler), performed throughout the country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Early in this century, aspiring whistlers could study at Agnes Woodward's 
California School of Artistic Whistling in Los Angeles. It's gone, but there 
remain textbooks, such as "How To Whistle Like a Pro (Without Driving Anyone 
Else Crazy)" by David Harp. 
</P>
<P>
Musician Fred Lowrey performed with big bands, recorded a dozen albums and 
wrote his autobiography, "Whistling in the Dark." Contemporary whistlers still 
perform his version of "Indian Love Call." 
</P>
<P>
Why has whistling faded to a mere echo of its former glory? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Drummond said, much currently popular music -- rap, heavy metal 
rock, synthesized pop -- doesn't have simple melodies easily whistled. "Even 
the Beatles are hard to whistle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whistlers acknowledge, reluctantly, that some people find whistling as annoying 
a habit as knuckle-cracking or pen-tapping. 
</P>
<P>
Whistling also has some negative connotations. Tattletales are whistle-blowers; 
a whistle-stop speech is one of little substance. Some people "whistle past the 
graveyard" to cover their fears; cartoon characters whistle when trying to 
cover up something. 
</P>
<P>
Women have had to overcome additional anti-whistling prejudices. Victorian 
etiquette books declared the practice vulgar. In Louisa May Alcott's "Little 
Women," ladylike Meg exhorts sister Jo to stop whistling because "it's so 
boyish."

PERFECTION DENIED, BUT UCLA WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA made all but one of its 28 free throws Saturday night at Pauley Pavilion, 
failing to equal an NCAA record in a 94-74 victory over San Diego State only 
because Tracy Murray missed a free throw with 1:37 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted it back as soon as I let it go," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was happy to accept the victory, which improved the Bruin record to 10-1 
going into their Pacific 10 Conference opener against USC (8-1) Wednesday night 
at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't come without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's lead was only three points with 6 1/2 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought San Diego really did a great job of scouting us and preparing for us 
and came in here to win," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said. "Defensively, they were 
very well prepared and caught us off-guard a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, after Fresno State was blown out in the second half of a 110-89 
loss to the Bruins, Bulldog Coach Gary Colson said the odds of an unranked team 
winning at Pauley Pavilion were "about 25 to 1." 
</P>
<P>
The odds are long, San Diego State's Jim Brandenburg agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But not that long. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can put a number on it," Brandenburg said before the game. 
"Obviously, UCLA is a good basketball team, but if we play well enough, we've 
got a chance to win. If we don't, we'll pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can play good enough defense and we can rebound and make sound offensive 
decisions, we've got a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs then went out and did almost everything Brandenburg had asked of 
them, outrebounding the Bruins, 32-21, shooting 53.4% and slowing the game to a 
pace more to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
"They took us out of a lot of things and made us impatient," Harrick said. 
"They really hustled, especially on the boards. I can't even remember us 
getting an offensive rebound." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State (5-5) took an 11-5 lead, only to see it disappear during a 4:13 
stretch when UCLA put together a 10-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins never trailed again, but San Diego State kept it close, using a 6-0 
run to cut the deficit to 69-66 with 6:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing that they were in a tight spot, the Bruins went to their leading 
scorer, 6-foot-10 junior forward Don MacLean, who posted up San Diego State's 
7-1 center, Marty Dow, drew a foul and made two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end, Dow fumbled a pass out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Gerald Madkins made two free throws to increase the Bruin lead to 73-66, 
but San Diego State rallied again, getting a tipin from Dow and then stealing 
the Bruins' inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
Dow then put up an air ball from about 10 feet out and Brandenburg, believing 
that his center had been fouled by MacLean, apparently protested too 
vehemently, drawing a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean made two free throws to start a 10-2 run and UCLA, which shot 56.9%, 
turned the last five minutes into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the technical and then UCLA breaks it open," said Brandenburg, 
recapping. "Our guy was getting hammered in there." 
</P>
<P>
Dow, who made only three of 17 shots in a 77-66 loss to USC this month at the 
Sports Arena, was much more of a factor against UCLA, making 12 of 19 shots, 
scoring 25 points and taking a game-high 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Dow played a tremendous game," Harrick said, "but I knew he was good. He's had 
pro scouts looking at him all year long." 
</P>
<P>
MacLean led UCLA with 31 points, making nine of 15 shots and all 13 of his free 
throws. Darrick Martin scored 16 points, making six of seven shots and all four 
of his free throws, and had five assists. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Murray had made all four of his free throws in the game, 31 of 35 this 
season, 14 in a row and 21 of 22 in UCLA's last seven games before he missed. . 
. . According to the 1991 NCAA Record Book, UC Irvine made all 34 of its free 
throws in a game against Pacific on Feb. 21, 1981. . . . UCLA's free-throw 
percentage of .964 was believed to be a school record. . . . The Bruins made 
their first 26 free throws, also believed to be a school record. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Harrick told the Bruins before the game: "I was watching television 
today and saw some team shoot 24 for 24 (from the line)." He didn't tell them 
it was the Milwaukee Bucks. . . . UCLA will play two more nonconference games 
-- against Louisville next Saturday and against Pittsburgh Feb. 2, both at 
Pauley Pavilion. . . . UCLA's game against USC Wednesday night at Pauley 
Pavilion is sold out. . . . One of San Diego State's part-time assistant 
coaches is Jim Harrick Jr., who played for his father at Pepperdine. Shouted 
the UCLA student section whenever he stood: "Sit down, junior." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will meet San Diego State next season at the San Diego Sports Arena, 
playing the Aztecs at San Diego for the first time in more than 50 years. . . . 
San Diego State's Jim Brandenburg was the coach at Wyoming in 1987 when the 
Cowboys upset UCLA in the second round of the NCAA tournament.

CHARGERS PUT FRIESZ IN THE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oddsmakers raised the Raiders from an eight-point choice to a 10-point 
favorite after the Chargers announced they would start rookie quarterback John 
Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City General Manager Carl Peterson has complained that the Chargers will 
be starting "a sixth-round draft pick who hasn't taken a snap in an NFL game" 
rather than a game-tested Billy Joe Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
And for the Chiefs to win the AFC West Division title, they will need the 
Chargers (6-9) to beat the Raiders (11-4) today. 
</P>
<P>
If they took a vote in the Chargers' locker room, Friesz wouldn't even be the 
team's unanimous choice to start against the playoff-bound Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to come out and second-guess the front office, but me personally, 
I'd rather go with Billy Joe Tolliver and try and win the game," said Broderick 
Thompson, the Chargers' starting right tackle. "I've seen so much improvement 
in him all year. Why do something to possibly damage his confidence going into 
next year? That's not good." 
</P>
<P>
Said starting left guard Courtney Hall, "I'd rather see him (Tolliver) in 
there, but that's the way the game goes. I'd like to be paid a lot more, but 
that's the way things go." 
</P>
<P>
So imagine if you were John Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be in his position," cornerback Gill Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
With the benefit of three days of practice, Friesz will begin his NFL career 
against a Raiders team that has to win to receive a bye in the first round of 
the playoffs -- a Raiders' team that needs a victory to claim the AFC West 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have won four games in a row. The Raiders, who are No. 2 in the 
league with 47 sacks, are ranked No. 5 in defense. The Raiders are big and bad, 
and oh, how they like rookie quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"John Friesz will find out real quick about the Raiders' pass rush," Peterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real worried about what Carl has to say," replied linebacker Billy Ray 
Smith. "All we want to do is please Carl. Carl can kiss our butts at this point 
in time. Carl's team should have taken care of business weeks ago. We have 
things we have to prepare for next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because John Friesz is starting the game doesn't mean it's going to be a 
wash. We're still putting out our starting defense, our first-team offensive 
line, John Carney is kicking and John Kidd is still punting. The only thing 
different is we're just going to see how this kid does." 
</P>
<P>
The kid is 23. The Chargers traded a third-round pick in the 1991 draft to 
obtain the first pick in the sixth round of the 1990 draft to select Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
Friesz, 6-foot-4 and 209 pounds, came to the Chargers with 24 school, 18 
conference and five NCAA Division I-AA records. He guided the University of 
Idaho to a 27-5 mark as a starting quarterback and three NCAA playoff 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
But now he's playing the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think the Raiders have any respect for us any ways," Byrd said. 
"I think they'll just want to come out and prove without a shadow of a doubt 
that they are a better football team, and that we shouldn't even be in the same 
stadium with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it was Billy Joe, Mark Vlasic or John Friesz, nobody expects us to 
win. Nobody outside this locker room believes we can win. The decision to play 
John Friesz is a coaching decision, and we have to live with that. 
</P>
<P>
"What we all have to understand is the NFL is a very transient business, and 
it's 'what have you done for me lately?' in this league. If you don't go out 
and perform, the front office is going to remember it in the offseason." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' replacement team in the 1987 strike defeated the Raiders in the 
Los Angeles Coliseum, but the Charger regulars have failed to win there since 
the Raiders moved to Los Angeles in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, the Raiders came to San Diego and won, 24-9. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of who is in there, it's going to take a total-team effort," Friesz 
said. "Billy Joe's got some experience, and mistakes he made real early, I 
might make in this game. But for whatever reason, this is what the front office 
has decided to do." 
</P>
<P>
The front office likes Friesz's accuracy. In practice, he was on target pass 
after pass, and when given the opportunity to run the two-minute offense 
against the Chargers' first defensive unit, he drove his team in for a score. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody upstairs has made a decision on what they want to do with this game," 
starting guard David Richards said. "And it will be interesting to see what 
happens. Who knows, maybe the kid will go out there and throw three touchdown 
passes for 350 yards and just light the world on fire." 
</P>
<P>
Even Friesz, however, concedes "that 90% of the quarterbacks who have made 
their NFL debut have struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in good shape as far as what I'm expecting of myself; I'm not expecting a 
ton," Friesz said. "But I'm expecting a good solid performance." 
</P>
<P>
A good solid performance will have to include a big assist from the Chargers' 
defense, special teams and running game. Marion Butts, who has gained 1,225 
yards, will miss his second game in a row with a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Bernstine, who has run 97 times for 475 yards, will assume Butts' duties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to us," Richards said. "We have to make the running game work. We 
can't get stuck in third and long because you know those defensive linemen in 
LA are licking their chops. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time Billy Joe started (in Seattle) they blitzed the heck out of 
him. I don't think any team in the league would do it any differently. You know 
they're going to put the heat on him and force him to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
If the mistakes come, if the Raiders get to Friesz and rearrange his body and 
send him to the sideline, it will be up to Tolliver again to take command of 
the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows if I'll play," Tolliver said. "They're pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Friesz, overhearing Tolliver's response to the media, interrupted. "Billy Joe's 
suffering from what Freud might have called quarterback envy." 
</P>
<P>
After the laughter subsided, Tolliver sent Friesz on his way (with expletives 
deleted): "Play a quarter first . . ."

CANADIENS DAMPEN THE KINGS' SPIRITS, 3-2; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: COURTNALL SCORES WITH 38 SECONDS TO PLAY, SPOILING THE RETURN OF 
SANDSTROM AND MCSORLEY. L.A. IS 2-8-4 IN ITS LAST 14 GAMES.

<P>
It was the night Dave Taylor scored his 400th career goal. 
</P>
<P>
It was the the night Tomas Sandstrom and Marty McSorley came back. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody in the Kings locker room was in a celebrating mood. 
</P>
<P>
Because it was also the night the Montreal Canadiens came back. 
</P>
<P>
Rallying with three goals in the final period, including the winner by Russ 
Courtnall with 38 seconds to play, Montreal defeated the Kings, 3-2, Saturday 
night before a sellout Forum crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you say?" King Coach Tom Webster said. "How do you figure we could 
work as hard as we did and still lose? We played a hell of a hockey game and 
didn't win. It's just not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Courtnall's goal, Wayne Gretzky shot from in close and Rob Blake 
shot from the right circle, but Montreal goalie Jean-Claude Bergeron stopped 
both, Blake's shot knocking him over. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Skrudland recovered the puck after Blake's shot and got it to Courtnall. 
He shot from 40 feet out, the puck barely clearing the outstretched glove of 
goalie Kelly Hrudey for Courtnall's 11th goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings dropped to 18-13-5, 2-8-4 in their last 14. And they dropped five 
points behind the Smythe Division-leading Calgary Flames, winners over the 
Hartford Whalers Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We play a strong game," Hrudey said, "it goes down to the wire and we find 
ways to lose. Lord knows, everyone here is trying." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal is 19-16-5. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom and McSorley had been sidelined for a month, Sandstrom because of a 
fracture in the lower back, McSorley because of bruised ribs. 
</P>
<P>
But neither could halt the Kings' slump. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, now in his 14th season, became the 30th player in NHL history to get 
400 goals. 
</P>
<P>
The milestone came at 6:48 of the second period. Todd Elik whipped a pass from 
the end boards through two Montreal defenders to Taylor in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor swept the puck through the pads of Bergeron for his 11th goal of the 
season to give the Kings a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It means a lot to me," Taylor said of the goal. "I just feel fortunate to have 
played 14 seasons with some great players like Marcel Dionne and Charlie Simmer 
and now on a line with Luc Robitaille and Todd Elik. I was a 15th-round draft 
choice and it was a chore just making this club at first." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky scored the game's first goal off the stick of Montreal defenseman 
Sylvain Lefebvre 1:53 into the period. It was Gretzky's team-leading 22nd goal, 
his league-leading 68th point and the 699th goal of his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens got on the scoreboard the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were on a power play at the start of the final period because of a 
Montreal bench minor called on Coach Pat Burns. But Robitaille's pass into the 
slot from the left boards was intercepted by Mike Keane. 
</P>
<P>
The Montreal wing took the puck down the slot and shoved it past the helpless 
Hrudey on the right side 1:15 into the period. It was Keane's ninth goal and 
the team's fifth short-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Burns called the bench minor "the most amazing turning point in the game. I was 
upset by the officials' calls, but I was more upset at my players. I did some 
furniture changes in the dressing room." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre's third goal, at 12:22, tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
Any fan caught in traffic missed McSorley's return. He barely lasted 30 seconds 
on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Only 13 seconds into the game, he was slapped with a roughing penalty. Then, at 
the 8:09 mark of the first period, McSorley got into an altercation that 
resulted in a game misconduct and an automatic ejection. 
</P>
<P>
An incensed Webster nearly duplicated his stick-throwing incident of a few 
weeks ago. This time, after grabbing a handy stick, the Kings coach thought 
better of it and settled for an angry snarl at the officials. 
</P>
<P>
Before the evening was over, there would be a lot worse to fume over. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The comeback of defenseman Tom Laidlaw is over for now. And probably for this 
season. Sidelined since March because of a disk problem, Laidlaw had improved 
enough to begin playing with the Kings' Phoenix Roadrunner farm team. But 
Thursday night, in Laidlaw's fourth game for the Roadrunners, the trouble 
flared anew. "I hit a guy," Laidlaw said, "and felt a little twinge. It wasn't 
that bad. Then I reached for the puck and I felt a spasm and the pain shooting 
down my leg. I went to the bench and caught the first plane for L.A." Laidlaw 
knows the implications of what he felt. "I'm right back to where I was," he 
said. "There's not much more a doctor can do. If you figure it would take me 
another month and half to two months to get going again, you're looking at 
March." . . . This was the Kings' final Forum appearance of 1990. The club will 
play five road games before returning to face the Hartford Whalers Jan. 8.

Randall Cunningham didn't get his rushing record, but the Philadelphia Eagles 
got what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham threw three touchdown passes, two to Fred Barnett, as the Eagles 
beat the Phoenix Cardinals, 23-21, Saturday to clinch the home-field advantage 
for their first-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (10-6) will play host to the Washington Redskins in an NFC wild-card 
game next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We got what we wanted and what we needed and that's the home-field advantage," 
Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan said. "We know Washington well and they know us 
well. It'll be another tough game, like the other two this year." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix ended its season with its third consecutive loss and finished 5-11 for 
the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not proud of our record, but we've grown," said first-year Cardinal 
Coach Joe Bugel. "The Eagles are one of the beasts of the East. We beat them 
earlier this season and we almost beat them again here." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix trailed, 23-7, early in the fourth quarter and closed to 23-21 on two 
touchdown passes by Timm Rosenbach -- a 38-yard play to rookie Ricky Proehl 
with 5:56 remaining and a 45-yarder to J.T. Smith with 1:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
Al Del Greco's first on-sides kick attempt went out of bounds and his second 
was recovered by Philadelphia's William Frizzell at the Phoenix 45. The Eagles 
then ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"A typical Cardinal-Eagle game," Ryan said. "They always seem to come down to 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham completed 13 of 19 passes for 172 yards and rushed four times for 60 
yards before being replaced by Jim McMahon late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham entered the game needing 87 yards to break the NFL's single-season 
record for most yards rushing by a quarterback -- 968, set by Chicago's Bobby 
Douglass in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think about bringing Randall back in," Ryan said. "Jim was doing a 
good job. I also didn't think about getting him the record. But I did give a 
game ball to Randall." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cunningham: "I'm not disappointed at all about not breaking the record. 
I'm just happy we won. Buddy told me to get it done within a quarter or two 
because I was coming out. Throwing a few touchdowns and having the home-field 
advantage is good enough for me."

IT WAS A SPECIAL CHRISTMAS FOR STAN HUMPHRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a magical time of joy and thanksgiving for Washington Redskins 
quarterback Stan Humphries and his wife, Connie. 
</P>
<P>
Natives of Louisiana, they celebrated Christmas in the Washington area for the 
first time. They also shared it with a child for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The health of that child, a 6-month-old daughter named Brooke, is why Stan 
cares much less about being stranded on the injured reserve list and much more 
about the gift some good fortune and helpful people brought him around the time 
he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real special time," Stan said. "Everything now is great." 
</P>
<P>
When Brooke Renee Humphries was born June 20, there was some doubt she would 
make it to June 21. A little more than three weeks premature, but already 7 
pounds 6 ounces, Brooke came into this world a little too easily for her own 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"It went really fast," Connie Humphries said. "And they (the doctors) said she 
was a lot like a Caesarean baby." Fluid that normally would have been squeezed 
from the baby's lungs as she was being born remained there. 
</P>
<P>
"She would just quit breathing," Connie said. 
</P>
<P>
Horrifying moments, but ones Brooke overcame. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, though, there was a bout with jaundice. And then came a condition that 
would terrorize Stan and Connie Humphries not for moments, but for months. 
</P>
<P>
It was an allergy to protein. Think about what that means -- a basic nutrient 
being rejected by the body at a time it needs it the most. "She has to get so 
much for her brain to form and for her to grow," Connie said. 
</P>
<P>
But protein was making Brooke's stomach do gymnastics. And, of course, there 
was only way for her to let anyone know something wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
"Every minute, all day long she was crying," Stan said. "She was starving but 
when you would feed her, she would cry even worse because it was hurting her so 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
For what seemed the longest time, the Humphries' doctors could not determine 
the problem. And for a parent -- especially a first-time parent -- there is 
nothing worse. "The baby can't tell you what's wrong and you just sit there 
wondering," Stan said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the time came for Stan to go to training camp in Carlisle, Pa. Left 
alone with Brooke for the first time, Connie wore down. She finally made two 
phone calls -- one to her mother, one to Stan. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan, I'm sorry if you're mad," she told him, "but I can't handle it any 
longer. I'm getting on the next plane home." 
</P>
<P>
Connie took Brooke to the doctor who had been her pediatrician. After changing 
Brooke's formula "like six times" during the week and a half Connie and Brooke 
spent in Louisiana, the doctor found one that seemed to agree with the little 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
But about four weeks later, in early September, Brooke started having trouble 
again. Stan and Connie were frantic. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked everybody," said Stan, who spoke to the Redskins' team physicians and 
asked them for help. 
</P>
<P>
Connie ended up taking Brooke to a specialist at Georgetown University 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He was wonderful," Connie said. "I told him five minutes worth of stuff, just 
different things that she had gone through. He said, 'She's allergic to 
protein.' I said, 'How do you know that? You haven't run a test. You haven't 
done anything.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said he sees this eight to 10 times a week. That really shocked me. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, how many kids would you think are allergic to protein?" 
</P>
<P>
It was a relief, but the battle was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 23, during the time the Humphries and the doctors were struggling to 
find the proper mixture of formula and water for Brooke, Redskins starting 
quarterback Mark Rypien injured his knee. The job, the media crush and a huge 
responsibility were Stan's. Meanwhile, Brooke still was spending a lot of her 
time crying. But Stan now needed his rest and his space more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We pretty much slept in separate bedrooms," Connie said. "We had to because 
she was up so much that he would have never gotten any sleep." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Stan would get very little sleep and drag himself to Redskin Park. 
He kept mostly to himself about Brooke. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why," he said. "I guess that once I got here, I kind of tried to 
put it out of my mind for a little bit and tried to contend with what was going 
on here. But it was hard to cut it all the way out. The sad thing was that 
Connie never had any time to get away. She was there continuously." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Connie isn't sure how she managed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard," she said. "It is very hard. But Stan was under a lot of pressure, 
and I wanted him to do well. I didn't want because Brooke was sick or whatever 
... well, you just do it. I don't know. I don't know where I found the energy 
to stay awake all the time or anything. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have some really good friends." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Edwards, the wife of safety Brad Edwards, was among those who helped 
Connie with her ordeal. The Redskins' bye week helped, and so did quarterbacks 
coach Rod Dowhower. Formerly a coach at Stanford, Dowhower put the Humphries in 
touch with a doctor at the school who had just completed a paper on protein 
intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Things came to a head as the Redskins were getting ready for the three-week 
stretch in October in which they played the Giants twice and the Eagles once. 
</P>
<P>
With Brooke continuing to struggle and Stan continuing to start, the doctor at 
Georgetown recommended that Brooke be placed in the hospital for a series of 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to make sure that it wasn't a tumor or an ulcer or anything like that," 
said Connie, who again called home to Louisiana for reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Brooke emerged from the tests still diagnosed as having only the allergy, 
although the Humphries were told the ailment might linger until she was 2 or 3 
years old. Remarkably, though, by about the beginning of November the problem 
disappeared. The Humphries and the doctors think Brooke has outgrown it. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was just about then that Stan injured his knee in a Monday night 
game against the Eagles in Philadelphia. But now Stan has recovered, though he 
remains on the Redskins' injured reserve list, and Brooke is headed in the 
right direction. 
</P>
<P>
She still weighs only 15 pounds (about double her weight at birth), "so it's 
going to take her a little while to catch up," Connie said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are so happy right now. It's wonderful."

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ROAD BACK FOR KING IS SMOOTHED BY 52 POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before the knee injury that almost ended his career late in the 1985 season, 
50-point games were nothing to Bernard King. 
</P>
<P>
But, after being sidelined for nearly two seasons and making a slow, painful 
recovery, the veteran forward of the Washington Bullets doubted he would ever 
reach that figure again. 
</P>
<P>
So, even though they came against the run-and-shoot Denver Nuggets, King's 52 
points Saturday night at Landover, Md., were special. 
</P>
<P>
King had 23 points in the first quarter as the Bullets scored 48 on their way 
to a 161-133 romp. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely the most special game in my career in the sense that I've 
come back from a major injury that no one thought I could come back from," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I always believed I would come back and play well, but I never thought I would 
score 50 points in a game after undergoing major knee surgery." 
</P>
<P>
King, 34, had already clinched the NBA scoring title before the injury in 1985. 
He averaged 32.9 points. When he was ready to play two years after the injury, 
the Knicks let him get away. 
</P>
<P>
By last season, he was averaging 22.4 points. This season he has been among the 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
And he has become more than merely a shooter. He was 20 for 35 in this game and 
had eight rebounds and six assists. 
</P>
<P>
His last basket broke Moses Malone's Washington scoring record. But he left 
with four minutes to play and missed his own mark of 60. It didn't seem to 
bother him at all. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 116, Seattle 91 -- The SuperSonics built their six-game winning streak 
against teams with sub-.500 records. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan and the Bulls made short work of the streak at Chicago. Jordan 
had 31 points as the Bulls broke a close game open in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Their fifth victory in a row enabled the Bulls to remain a half-game behind 
Milwaukee in the tight Central Division race. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 134, Golden State 130 -- Dominique Wilkins was afraid his Hawks would 
have a letdown after Friday night's upset of the Boston Celtics. So he took 
personal charge at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins scored a season-high 45 points and had 14 rebounds. His two free throws 
with five seconds left ended a rally by the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks scored 18 points in the first 3:06 and led the entire game. Only a 
traveling call against Chris Mullin shortly before he scored a basket prevented 
the Warriors from creating a tie with seven seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 120, Cleveland 114 -- The Trail Blazers, showing signs of fatigue in 
their third road game in four nights, managed to improve the best NBA road 
record to 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
Portland (27-3) opened a 14-point lead in the third quarter, but it took a 
banked-in three-pointer by Clyde Drexler with 20 seconds to play to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, who have won five in a row and eight of their last nine, 
wind up the trip tonight at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 109, New York 100 -- The Bucks, hoping to give their top players some 
rest for tonight's game against Portland, built a 21-point lead at New York 
early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no rest. The Knicks fought back to tie before the third quarter 
ended. It took perfect free-throw shooting (24 of 24) and clutch shooting by 
Ricky Pierce in the stretch to pull it out. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had a breather," Pierce said. "But we started making silly fouls 
and they came back to get even." 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks are 14-0 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 134, Miami 95 -- The Suns weren't about to let up on a weak team. With 
Xavier McDaniel scoring 24 points at Phoenix, the Suns won by their biggest 
margin of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns are 7-0 against the Heat. The Heat, playing for the first time without 
injured center Rony Seikaly, made it a game for a half, trailing by only six 
points. The Suns scored 49 points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns' Tom Chambers suffered a hamstring injury in the second quarter and 
didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 99, Houston 84 -- When the Pistons were in their slump, it was largely 
because their guards weren't scoring. Joe Dumars has put an end to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars scored 20 of his 30 in the first half at Auburn Hills, Mich., and led 
the Pistons to their third victory in a row. In the three games, Dumars has 70 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 114, New Jersey 105 -- Rik Smits scored 15 of his 23 points in the 
third quarter at Indianapolis to help the Pacers break open a tight game. The 
Pacers, leading by 56-52 at halftime, opened the second half with an 11-2 run 
and were never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 109, Orlando 100 -- Kenny Gattison came off the bench to score 19 
points at Charlotte and help the Hornets end an 11-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 90, Sacramento 79 -- The Mavericks held the cold-shooting Kings to 30 
points in the first half at Dallas and handed them their sixth consecutive 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Harper scored 26 points for the Mavericks. DAN HAFNER

BLAZERS PUTTING THEIR STAMP ON NBA THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Like 10 teams before them, the San Antonio Spurs became reluctant admirers. 
Last season, they were eliminated from the playoffs in Portland when they lost 
a seven-point lead late in Game 7 of their Western Conference semifinal series. 
They were so close to winning. They were so close to being as good as the Trail 
Blazers. So it was quite surprising to them when they visited Portland the 
first time this season and watched almost helplessly as the Blazers bolted to a 
31-point lead after one quarter. After the Blazers strolled to a 117-103 
victory, Spurs' Coach Larry Brown said the Blazers could have beaten the 
All-Decade team that night. David Robinson summarized the feelings of the rest 
of the league. 
</P>
<P>
"If they do that to other people," Robinson said after the Blazers improved 
their record to 11-0, "it's going to be a scary season for the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers have, in a sense, come back to earth. Since then, they've had a 
record of "only" 13-3, and they even lost two road games -- but not until they 
won their first eight. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are many reasons for opponents to fear the Blazers, who made their 
only Madison Square Garden appearance Wednesday, beating the New York Knicks. 
And their 26-3 record -- a reflection of the outstanding group of players the 
Blazers have assembled -- is only a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
For opponents, the scariest part of the Blazers' makeup is that they have begun 
to act like champions -- off the court as well as on. They've developed their 
own sort of Blazers mystique, and that often can be the forerunner of rings and 
trophies. 
</P>
<P>
Blazers management has a championship attitude. After the key move of obtaining 
power forward Buck Williams, whose strength was the key ingredient the Blazers 
needed to reach the finals last season, the Blazers did not stand still. They 
acquired Danny Ainge in the offseason, and the former Celtics' standout has 
provided the Blazers with championship experience (he was on two title teams), 
great outside shooting and another boost in confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Great teams make great player moves. In the last two years, the Blazers have 
made two. 
</P>
<P>
Management also has taken steps to ensure the Blazers have no salary 
controversies. Since October, the Blazers have given Clyde Drexler a one-year, 
$8-million extension; given Williams a one-year, $4-million extension, and 
signed Jerome Kersey to a four-year, $11-million contract. Terry Porter has a 
six-year, $13-million contract and Kevin Duckworth has an eight-year, 
$14-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
Great teams are willing to spend money to win titles. The Blazers have opened 
the vault, which has provided the players with a feeling of security and a 
future of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a feeling of togetherness," Drexler said. "The guys know we're going 
to be around for a while. The teams that have had a lot of success are the ones 
that have stayed together. That's the beautiful thing about this. The nucleus 
could easily play together for five more years -- at least five years. It's a 
great situation." 
</P>
<P>
And the Blazers even have a recent championship trend on their side. Six times 
since 1970, a team that has lost in the finals came back to win the title the 
next season. The frustration of accomplishing so much and advancing so far, yet 
ending the season only second best has been a powerful motivator. The Blazers 
have felt it, and are feeling it, which is why they don't seem to be too 
impressed by their impressive start. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure does look sweet," Porter said, "but you have to keep it in 
perspective. It's great to get off to a good start, but it doesn't mean 
anything if you flop at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Barring injuries, it seems unlikely the Blazers will flop. They may be beaten 
but it's going to take a great team to do it. 
</P>
<P>
With Ainge joining Drexler and Porter, the Blazers have perhaps the best 
three-guard rotation in the league. Drexler again is demonstrating his 
considerable all-around skills, averaging 23 points, 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 
assists. Porter averages 18.3 points and 8.8 assists, and Ainge averages 11.8 
points in only 21.3 minutes. There is no letup. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, Williams averages 9.9 rebounds, Duckworth averages 15.5 points with 
good outside shooting and a clever assortment of inside moves, and the 
acrobatic Kersey averages 14.4 points. The Blazers got a steal in the draft 
last year with 6-10 Cliff Robinson, who has benefited from the experience of 
his rookie year and averages 11 points. Robinson fits in perfectly with the 
Blazers' other role players, 6-10 center Wayne Cooper and backup point guard 
Danny Young. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is here," Williams said. "We've got outside shooting, we can go 
quick, we can go with power, we can go with a defensive team. We can go any 
which way." 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers have even developed a little arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have won the title last year," Drexler said. "Not to take anything 
away from Detroit. They know what it took to win and they did it. But we want 
to go the extra step."

WEBER STATE STUMBLES PAST NORTHRIDGE

<P>
Cal State Northridge finally met its match on the road, but the Matadors played 
so poorly they couldn't take advantage of an equally inept Weber State team. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats (3-6) shot 39.6%, committed 17 turnovers and didn't score for four 
minutes of the second half, but were able to beat Northridge, 69-61, before 
2,358 at Dee Events Center Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (2-8) committed the same number of turnovers, all but four of which 
were unforced, in its worst scoring effort of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Matadors had a chance to win when Keith Gibbs' three-point basket 
with 43 seconds to play cut the Weber State lead to 64-61. 
</P>
<P>
However, Weber State's Jason Joe, formerly of Santa Monica High, countered with 
two free throws and Gibbs missed a six-footer. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Chevalier and Todd Bowser led Northridge with 13 points each, Bowser 
getting his 900th point. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do it last (Friday) night because I missed everything," he said of 
his one-for-eight shooting in a loss to Idaho State. "But I'd rather play like 
last night and win than lose and get the 900th point. It's hard to take. We're 
dying for a road win."

Colorado State had more fans in Titan Gym than did Cal State Fullerton 
Saturday, but Titan fans had more fun, storming the court after Joe Small's 
acrobatic, 16-foot shot as the game ended beat the Rams, 62-60. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 60-60, with three seconds to play when Small attempted an 
off-balance three-point shot that bounced off the front of the rim. Small ran 
in, leaped for the ball at the free-throw line, caught it and released a shot 
at the top of his jump. The buzzer sounded and the ball went in, igniting a 
wild celebration and giving the Titans (7-2) their seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like we diagrammed it," joked Small, who scored 26 points and made six of 
nine three-point attempts. "The ref said it counted and that's all I remember. 
I got tackled. I was looking for my teammates. I didn't know where they went." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 3,729 -- about 2,000 of them Colorado State fans in town for the 
Rams' Freedom Bowl football game against Oregon -- must have wondered where 
Small went in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
After making a three-point shot with 18 minutes remaining to give Fullerton a 
41-35 lead, the Rams (7-3) threw a box-and-one defense at Small and shut him 
out for more than 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the shooting of guard Mark Meredith, who scored all 13 of his points in 
the second half, Colorado State took a 55-50 lead with 5:55 to play. 
</P>
<P>
After the teams exchanged missed shots and turnovers, Titan forward Agee Ward, 
who scored 15 points and grabbed eight rebounds, made a short jumper to make 
the score 55-52. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Bowen then drew a charge on Meredith -- the Ram guard's fifth foul -- and 
Small responded with a three-point basket to tie the score, 55-55. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State forward Chuckie White, the Indiana transfer who made all eight 
of his field-goal attempts and scored 19 points, answered with a basket and a 
free throw, but Fullerton's J.D. Green came right back with a three-point play 
-- a driving basket and free throw -- that tied it at 58-58 with 1:51 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans went ahead on Ward's follow shot with 58 seconds left, but Ram guard 
Lynn Tryon tied it with an 18-foot bank shot with 25 seconds to go. Fullerton 
then rode Small's last-second heroics to the victory.

CAL HAS GREATEST OF EXPECTATIONS FOR RUSSELL WHITE IN '91 
</P>

<P>
Russell White can see it coming. One eye twinkles eagerly, the other narrows 
circumspectly as he watches the curtain rise above him on center stage. 
</P>
<P>
The University of California sophomore will share time at tailback with senior 
Anthony Wallace in Monday's Copper Bowl against Wyoming, an arrangement that 
enabled both players to rush for 1,000 yards this fall as the Bears compiled a 
surprising 6-4-1 record. But the acclaim that enraptured and enslaved White 
during his high school years is quickly returning, whether he likes it or not. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out next year, people might put my face of the cover of some little 
magazines," he says. "I don't want that. I want them to premier Cal, not 
Russell White. But it won't happen that way. I'll probably be a preseason 
All-American." 
</P>
<P>
Modest in one breath, cocky in the next, White is something of an enigma. The 
same fellow who came to Cal proclaiming his desire to win at least one Heisman 
Trophy now wishes Wallace rather than himself had been named to the 
All-Pacific-10 Conference team. 
</P>
<P>
Washington tackle Steve Emtman was put off by White's arrogant attitude when 
the Huskies whipped the Bears earlier this season. No question, White moves 
with a certain swagger on the field. Yet he is popular with his teammates and 
coaches, who enjoy his company as well as his undeniable physical gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy's a player, but I knew that would be the case," coach Bruce Snyder 
says. "What I didn't know about him was how he'd be as far as the team concept 
was concerned and how he'd respond to pressure. He's got a great sense of team 
unity, and he's an iceman. He is terrific in terms of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Two games illustrate Snyder's point about the manner in which White responds to 
pressure. After sitting out the 1989 season as a Proposition 48 exile, White 
felt understandably anxious before Cal's home opener against defending national 
champion Miami in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
So anxious, in fact, that he returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown the 
first time he touched the football. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Big Game against Stanford rolled around, White had established 
himself as one of the best backs in the conference. But he was outstanding in a 
27-25 loss, scoring two touchdowns and rushing for 177 yards to finish the 
regular season with an even 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very tough to handle," White said. "I had the best game of my life, 
when you have an 'L' next to your stats, you think that you didn't do enough." 
</P>
<P>
What makes all of this particularly intriguing is the growing notion that this 
season represented little more than a teasing glimpse of White's talent. Having 
missed the previous season, without the benefit of a single spring practice, 
White sees 1990 as an extended tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've reached that peak I had in high school, when I was so 
confident I thought I could do anything," he says. "This year wasn't a Russell 
White year. I think I can bring my game up another level." 
</P>
<P>
It was during his sophomore year at Crespi High in Encino, when he rushed for 
2,339 yards and 31 touchdowns, that White assumed larger-than-life proportions. 
He sees a parallel between then and now, and hopes he handles the expectations 
better than he did then. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get to the point where I got in high school, when I got 
cocky," White says. "I want to be humble about it. I have more control of 
myself now." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Redell remembers the first time he saw the magical instincts. It was the 
fall of 1985, when White was a freshman at Crespi and Redell was the varsity 
coach biding time before the main event. 
</P>
<P>
"He was playing for the freshman team," Redell says. "They punted the ball to 
him and he went 80 yards for a touchdown. I said to one of my assistants, 
'Geez, next year, we're going to win it all.' " 
</P>
<P>
When he was 14 years old, White high-jumped 6 feet, 8 1/2 inches, a national 
age-group record. For all of his early accomplishments, White never really saw 
himself as a childhood prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
"I never was most valuable player on my team until the ninth grade," he says. 
"It didn't come early." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, White turned Redell's vision into reality as Crespi won the 
Southern Section Big Five Conference championship during his sophomore season. 
In the second quarter of a first-round playoff game against Edison, he left the 
field with an injured ankle. Crespi held a tenuous 14-8 lead in the fourth 
quarter when White walked up gingerly to an assistant coach and said, "I think 
I can go one more play." 
</P>
<P>
Eighty yards and six points later, Crespi had a more manageable lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a well-blocked play for about two yards," Redell recalls. "The rest was 
his. I coached Marcus Dupree with New Orleans (in the United States Football 
League) and I'll say this: I have never seen a player of Russell White's 
status." 
</P>
<P>
But White felt out of place at Crespi, an all-boys Catholic school of 
approximately 500 students. He went there at the suggestion of his cousin, 
former UCLA star Kermit Alexander, and Helen White agreed that her only son 
would be better off away from his neighborhood buddies in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go there," White says. "It was tough at first, but it got 
easier and easier as time went on. Eventually it got a little too easy." 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-eight percent of Crespi's graduates go on to college, and White always 
knew he'd be included in that group regardless of his study habits. He finished 
his three-year varsity career with a state record 5,998 yards and 94 touchdowns 
while doing just enough class work to maintain a C average. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for competition as college freshmen, athletes must score at 
least 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. White took the SAT "four or 
five times" without reaching that cutoff score. Each failure received 
considerable attention in the newspapers, being that he was the best-known prep 
athlete on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Russell is not a dumb kid in any way, shape or form," Redell says. "I 
personally feel he tightened up on the SAT. If I had to take the SAT and the 
whole United States had to know what my score was, I'd probably tie up, too." 
</P>
<P>
Many universities backed off from White during his SAT struggles, but Cal 
promised him a scholarship regardless. Signing an athlete who failed to meet 
the NCAA's Proposition 48 guidelines caused a stir at Berkeley, where 4.0 
students are occasionally denied admission. 
</P>
<P>
White nearly flunked out during his first semester and was not declared 
eligible for the 1990 season until he passed an English course in summer 
school. But to his immense relief, White learned during his first year at Cal 
that he had a legitimate excuse for his SAT woes. 
</P>
<P>
He suffers from dyslexia, a learning disability in which letters and numbers 
often appear backward on the printed page. A '3' might look like an 'E', a '9' 
resembles a 'P.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to learn that I wasn't dumb," White says. "It was something I had 
no control over." 
</P>
<P>
When his running backs met for the first time during fall camp in Santa Rosa, 
Cal assistant coach Ollie Wilson noticed with a smile that an eager sophomore 
by the name of Russell White had arrived a full 20 minutes early. 
</P>
<P>
"That Proposition 48 is such a mental thing," Wilson says. "Once Russell got 
through that, I knew he'd be fine." 
</P>
<P>
For perhaps the first time in his athletic career, White had doubts. He 
wondered how he'd move at 200 pounds, an increase of 20 pounds from his high 
school weight. When the Bears traveled to Wisconsin for their 1990 opener, he 
asked Wallace whether the Badgers would hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
To which Wallace replied: "Man, everybody hits hard in college." 
</P>
<P>
White gained 78 yards in 16 carries as Cal beat Wisconsin 28-12. The next week, 
he made his electrifying debut at Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Miami run will hold up as far as Russell White is concerned," 
White says. "People came to that game wondering what I could do. To touch the 
ball for the first time and go 99 yards, a lot of people were shocked." 
</P>
<P>
The Wallace-White combination wound up making history, becoming the first 
Pac-10 teammates to rush for 1,000 yards in the same season. White technically 
remains a reserve, the first to earn all-conference honors, but not once did he 
express even a hint of displeasure about his secondary status. 
</P>
<P>
"It encouraged Anthony and me to jump a little sooner," White says. "You can't 
sit around and wait 10 or 11 carries to get in your groove. You have to do it 
right away." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are those who at least partially blame Cal's loss to Stanford on 
the fact that Snyder played Wallace rather than White for the first 20 minutes 
of the second half. White averaged 5.6 yards a carry this season, a full yard 
better than Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
"White has the ability to go the length of the field at any time," Oregon coach 
Rich Brooks says. "I think Wallace is in the same category." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is one of those people who envision greater things -- much greater 
things -- from White. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll eventually see him play on Sundays," he says. "Physically, he is 
still maturing. He's like a 225-pounder from the waist down and 170 pounds from 
the waist up." 
</P>
<P>
As for playing on Sundays, White says that will have to wait until 1993. He has 
no intention of leaving school early for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"No way, no chance," he says. "I can't do that. I've got to have a degree." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he still has to bring his game up another notch or two. 
</P>
<P>
"You can always do better," White says. "Make a move a little quicker, use my 
peripheral vision a little better. Hey, Joe Montana can get better, Bo Jackson 
can get better. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo better get better, getting caught from behind like he did (on an 88-yard 
run against Cincinnati)," White says. 
</P>
<P>
Russell knows humble.

Keith Nelson scored 32 points, including 15 in the final nine minutes, as 
Tennessee Chattanooga rallied to beat UC Irvine, 88-68, Saturday night in the 
championship game of the Tennessee Chattanooga tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (5-7) closed to within 60-58 on Craig Marshall's layup with 9:00 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson and Derrick Kirce, who scored eight of his 15 points in the final 
nine minutes, keyed a run as Tennessee Chattanooga (6-5) of the Southern 
Conference outscored the Anteaters, 28-10. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine led most of the first half while making seven of 13 three-point shots 
before Nelson hit a free throw to key the Moccasins' comeback for a 43-40 lead 
with 1:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine tied the game, 43-43, at halftime, but went cold from three-point range 
and made one of 10 attempts in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Herdman led Irvine with 16 points. Cornelius Banks had 12 points and Dylan 
Rigdon 11. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's next game will be Wednesday at Utah State. The Anteaters then play at 
San Jose State in their Big West Conference opener next Friday.

ST. ANTHONY'S ROMPS TO ABOVE THE RIM CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Tournament officials boasted about having three top-20 teams at the Above The 
Rim Hoopwear Classic not knowing that the championship game would make a 
mockery of those who predict national high school top 20s. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Jersey City St. Anthony's ran away from No. 2 New York St. Raymond's, 
83-65, in Saturday night's final at Torrey Pines High School. 
</P>
<P>
It was over in the second quarter when St. Anthony's went on a 14-point run. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't St. Anthony's offense, however, so much as its defense that keyed the 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Anthony's just came out and played great defense," said Gary De Cesare, 
St. Raymond's coach. "They just shut down all the passing lanes." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most impressive was the play of Rodrick Rhodes, who stayed on Orlando 
Antigua all night. Antigua, it should be noted, was the only guy in the 
tournament program singled out with a full-page blowout trumpeting him as one 
of the best high school players in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes held Antigua to 18 points, his lowest output in the tournament. Further, 
Rhodes held Antigua to only three points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Antigua is a very fine basketball player," said Bob Hurley, St. Anthony's 
coach. "But Rodrick is a great basketball player and he's only a junior. Wait 
to see what he does next year." 
</P>
<P>
While Rhodes found success on defense, Danny Hurley, the coach's son, found it 
on offense. He provided eight points during the second-quarter run and finished 
with 28 overall. 
</P>
<P>
And seemingly each time St. Raymond's appeared on the verge of putting its own 
string of baskets together, Hurley was there to bury a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
He did it with two minutes left in the first quarter after St. Raymond's had 
dropped in five unanswered points to make it 18-15, St. Anthony's. 
</P>
<P>
He did it again with three minutes to go in the half to give St. Anthony's its 
largest lead of the game, 47-23. 
</P>
<P>
And he did it once again in the third quarter after St. Raymond's had slowly 
whittled the margin to 13. Hurley's three-pointer made it 59-43. 
</P>
<P>
"When (opponents) make a run, he always seems to come up with a jumper that 
breaks their momentum," Bob Hurley said. 
</P>
<P>
Hurley said he was genuinely proud of his team, and to prove it he decided to 
give them a break today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so proud of you," he told his players afterward, "All you're going to have 
to do tomorrow is lift." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Bob Hurley should do something extra special for the referees, too. They 
sent St. Anthony's to the line 12 times during the fateful second quarter while 
St. Raymond's aimed only three free throws. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the disparity, De Cesare said, "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hurley wouldn't give credit to the referees as much as he did to his own 
players for drawing all the fouls. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been significantly getting more free throws than our opponents all 
year," he said. "And I think that's because of our relentless play. We're in 
great shape and I think we wear our opponents. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
Miami Senior 96, New York Monsignor McClancy 79 -- Four Miami players reached 
double figures. Steve Edwards led the way with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
In consolation games: 
</P>
<P>
Deep Creek (Va.) 94, Lincoln 77 -- Both Keaton Hyman and John Nixon scored 20 
points for Deep Creek, which had three other players in double figures. Berry 
Randle led Lincoln with 33 and Hosa Baker added 14. 
</P>
<P>
Camden (N.J.) 114, Valhalla 78 -- Camden had three players over 20 points: Art 
Crowder, 23; Vernel Sturdivant, 27; and Greg Barr, 30. Mike Nalu led Valhalla 
with 34. Teammates Mark Dillon and Cole Deneen each had 15. 
</P>
<P>
Payson (Utah) 84, Las Vegas (Nev.) Bonanza 81 (OT) -- Bryan Nielson led Payson 
with 30 points and teammate Phil Degraffenried added 21 points, making nine of 
11 floor shots.

NHL ROUNDUP;

<P>
PLAYING THE MAPLE LEAFS IS NO LONGER A JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Early in the season, it seemed every team was pushing the Toronto Maple Leafs 
around. They were the butt of jokes around the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in Toronto is no laughing matter these days. The Maple Leafs have 
toughened. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Penguins, who had won eight of their last nine and were leading 
the league with 4.2 goals a game, found that out Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Krushelnyski scored twice to lead the Maple Leafs to a 6-3 victory, their 
fourth in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have a renewed feeling," Krushelnyski said. "We're ready to play 
anybody. We were ready for these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 8, Hartford 2 -- The Flames were only 9-7-1 at home before Al MacInnis, 
Theoren Fleury and Doug Gilmour each scored twice to lead the rout of the 
Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, New York Islanders 1 -- Goaltender Ed Belfour stopped 34 shots at 
Uniondale, N.Y., and gained his league-leading 23rd victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders spoiled his shutout on Wayne McBean's goal with 13:44 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 4, Washington 3 -- Mike Hough scored twice and assisted on another goal 
at Quebec, and the Nordiques extended the Capitals' winless streak to 0-7-1. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 4, Buffalo 4 -- With 2:06 to play in regulation, Brendan Shanahan 
scored to give the Devils a tie at home. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 3, St. Louis 1 -- Goaltender Ron Hextall stopped 34 shots at St. 
Louis and Keith Acton scored twice on power plays to lead the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Minnesota 4 -- Goals by Ulf Dahlen and Dave Gagner 20 seconds apart 
brought the North Stars even with 2:03 to play. DAN HAFNER

BEHIND THE WHEEL: IN TUNE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE SILVER GHOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Safety commandments haunt the 83-year-old Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
Thou shalt not exceed 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Thou shalt not drive on public roads without a blocking car up front and a 
buffer car behind, both by Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
Thou shalt not allow the Silver Ghost to be driven by anyone outside its elite 
cadre of Rolls-Royce handlers and feeders. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the early morning is peaceful and if one driver's vintage 
car credentials just happen to meet the approval of Rolls-Royce Western Zone 
Manager Christopher Brown, and if the guardian spirits of Rolls, Royce and 
Johnson are slumbering far from Southern California. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But you'd better let me start her," says Brown. "This can get a little 
tricky." 
</P>
<P>
True. If elopement or convenience market robberies be your thing, do not rely 
on the Silver Ghost for getaway. Starting is far from turnkey: It is more of a 
mid-term exercise at MIT after translation from the Queen's mechanical English. 
</P>
<P>
First, the clutch pedal is unchocked. The mahogany block keeps the pedal and 
cone clutch disengaged when the car is at rest. Otherwise, the clutch will 
stick to the flywheel. 
</P>
<P>
The petrol tank is then pressurized to 1 1/2 psi by a hand pump (silver plated, 
of course) in the cockpit. Next, open the bonnet and prime the carburetor bowl 
by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Fuel-air mixture control, set. Magneto switch, on. Trembler coil switch, on. 
Governor control lever, set. Ignition advance and retard lever, set. 
</P>
<P>
Then, if your riding mechanic has not left for lunch, it is his (do not expect 
many female volunteers for this job) honor to lean into a crank and push 
against the compression of six fat cylinders until the engine fires. 
</P>
<P>
When it does, it purrs. But not exactly a whisper. More like the snore of a 
Bengal tiger. Regular. Purposeful. Also not to be disturbed until one knows 
exactly what to do when the owner comes awake. 
</P>
<P>
Undivided attention, of course, is the first dictate of driving the Silver 
Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
It has four forward gears and one reverse gear, and that seems about as normal 
as anything from Chevrolet. But the shift pattern is more of a U than an H. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the gearing was assembled decades before the luxury of 
synchromesh. That means digging into misty personal lore to recall the 
hand-foot coordination of double clutching a crash gearbox. 
</P>
<P>
Even with that antediluvian instinct exhumed, smooth shifting remains more a 
matter of matching the noise of the gears with the breeze on your cheek. 
</P>
<P>
The Ghost has a hand brake and a foot brake, and there should be nothing 
complicated about either -- except the foot brake works against the drive 
shaft. It's good only for speeds barely above walking pace. Any serious 
stopping must be done by hauling on the hand brake. 
</P>
<P>
The steering wheel is round, wooden and routine -- but the steering itself is 
leaden and as direct as a wheelbarrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Silver Ghost has three horns -- two bulb hooters and an "oogah" under the 
bonnet -- and no known reason for this rude trio. 
</P>
<P>
Abundance ends there. Apparently, $80 million doesn't even buy a heater, turn 
signals, radio, seat belts, canvas top or a driver's side door. And the hood 
emblem is an Automobile Assn. badge because Flying Ladies didn't come in until 
the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
Yet somewhere between Coast Highway and the paths lacing Newport Dunes -- 
somewhere in that time warp between 1907 and now -- the magnificence of the 
Silver Ghost resurfaces. 
</P>
<P>
The engine -- six huge cylinders in tandem -- may only be developing 48 
horsepower. But it is chuffing along, turning slowly and never missing a beat. 
You just know that if the Atlantic weren't in our way, this car would carry us 
to Brighton. 
</P>
<P>
The brakes do require some planning ahead, each gear shift is a matter for deep 
thought, and the steering does get a little wobbly around 40 m.p.h. But every 
shortcoming is constant and absolutely predictable -- and, after all, the car 
is doing a genuine 40 m.p.h. With a lot left. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, resplendent in linen cap, goggles and duster, doesn't flinch at being 
asked for corporate approval to attempt an acceleration run. Piece of cake, old 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
So the old girl winds up and whines like a London double decker bus. There are 
mild lurches and a slight clunks going through the gears to fourth. But the car 
tops 30 m.p.h. in 17.3 seconds. We chortle. The Silver Ghost remains quite 
unruffled. 
</P>
<P>
But that must be it. There is no reason, only a distinct lack of respect, in 
further testing the past of the Silver Ghost. After all, she is 83 years old 
and a long way from the comforts of home. 
</P>
<P>
Also, she always gets a little creaky and rheumatic in Southern California's 
winter clime. 
</P>
<P>
It's her wheels. They're spoked and wooden, and accustomed to the humidity of 
England. In California, the joints start to dry out and separate. 
</P>
<P>
Says Brown: "If we were here much longer, she'd have to stand with her feet in 
bowls of warm water." 
</P>
<P>

ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: SANTA ANITA KEEPS PARTIES ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after Christmas, Santa Anita was keeping the spirit bright in the 
Directors Room high above the race track in Arcadia. Chairman of the Board 
Robert P. Strub and his wife, Betty, of San Marino hosted their traditional 
opening-day luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Chatting over Christmas gifts and the expected January slump in parties were 
Santa Anita President Clifford and Karen Goodrich, Mary and Arthur Crowe and 
Violetta and Bill Dougherty. Santa Anita's director of racing emeritus, Frank 
Kilroe, got cheery hellos, along with Dorothy and Ray Rogers, Martha Chandler 
and William Croxton, Jacqueline and Peter Dailey, Connie and John Gavin, Marion 
and Earle Jorgensen, Fielder and Lotsie Webster and Philip and Mary Hawley. 
Mary Frances and Bob Morgan and Candi and Taylor Grant came from Newport Beach, 
Walter and Sheila Hoffman from Ventura and John and Norma Bowles from Los 
Olivos. 
</P>
<P>
At the rail watching Moon Madness win the first race were Felix and Barbara 
McGinnis, Anne Brophy and Carl McGinnis. Lynn and Clement Hirsch were excited 
about entering their Magical Mile in the Malibu Stakes race. 
</P>
<P>
Among prominent horse owners in the Turf Club were Clarence and Dorothy 
Scarborough of Midland, Tex. Biggest social days this season are the Charles H. 
Strub Stakes, Feb. 10; the Santa Anita Handicap, March 9, and the Santa Anita 
Derby April 6. 
</P>
<P>
OPINIONS: Everywhere this holiday season, people compared invites. The 
consensus: fewer black-tie events (Barbara and Marvin Davis and Henry and 
Caroline Singleton canceled their traditional Christmas parties) and more teas. 
</P>
<P>
There was an onslaught of cocktail open houses with mirth abounding, but the 
serious question everyone asked was, "Do you think there'll be a war?" Worry 
took the edge off fun. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, among the many hosts and hostesses giving lively parties with 
guests eating too much and exchanging hugs and kisses under the mistletoe were 
Debbie and Terry Lanni, Beverly and Larry Thrall, Cheryl and Bill Doyle, 
Priscilla and Curt Tamkin, Carolyn and Chuck Miller, Barbara and Chuck 
Schneider, Carolyn and Maury DeWald, Debby and Bill Appler, Gretchen and David 
Seager, Phoebe and Joe Vaccaro, Liz and Craig Black, French Consul General 
Gerard and Naomi Coste, Fred Nason Jr. (celebrating his 60th birthday), Veva 
and Kingston McKee, Jess and Phyllis Marlow, Nancy and Bill Burrows and Connie 
and Bob Butler. Whew! 
</P>
<P>
DAY LIFE: If the evenings were filled with parties, the days were filled with 
teas and luncheons. One of the special teas was at the glorious contemporary 
home of Kitty Moses, with Maggie Edwards, Paty Kouba and Doris Coleman 
co-hosting. More than 150 ladies attended, receiving little scrolls as they 
left advising "Take Time." Such as, "Take time to think -- it is the source of 
power." And, "Take time to laugh -- it is the music of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Avery hosted a mammoth tea at the Los Angeles Country Club for 450 women. 
</P>
<P>
At another tea at the club, Louise Griffith and Joyce Stuart sent their guests 
off with miniature gold baskets containing three tea bags. 
</P>
<P>
In Hancock Park, Suzanne Rheinstein had the silver tea urns polished and 
gleaming for a friendly affair, and in Pasadena, at Dina Oldknow's tea, 
daughters and granddaughters in lace and velvet outnumbered adults. 
</P>
<P>
At the tea parties, the most common phrase is "tea food is my favorite food" -- 
as the cucumber and chicken salad sandwiches and the lemon bars, fudge and 
baklava were devoured. 
</P>
<P>
SITDOWN: One of the most joyous parties was the one Stephen and Jane Ackerman 
gave upstairs at the Bistro. After good friends dined and danced, they joined 
hands in Christmas carols and even a few tears, signaling that in almost every 
family joy and sorrow mix, and friends are awfully nice to be there to help 
lead you through. 
</P>
<P>
Another night, the fireplaces their home set a cozy ambiance for Jane and 
George Barretts' sit-down for 50. 
</P>
<P>
HEARTS: Romantic touches have marked the season. Valet parkers had a heavy job 
parking the cars at Carol and Mike Inman's home in Bel-Air at the party 
honoring their son, Peter, and his wife, Lori, wed last month in a formal 
ceremony in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the engagement of Melissa Swann Winston and Dennis Victor Alfieri, 
Edward and Patty Turrentine sent invitations wrapped in gold and burgundy silk 
cording. The black-tie event also heralded the grand opening of the 
Turrentines' (he's an interior designer) magnificent Italian ballroom, where 
dancing continued until the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, Amie Lu and John Haake and Jan and Buzz Hanson honored Paul 
Anderson and Elizabeth Murphy at a shower with holiday pizazz. They'll be 
married Saturday. 
</P>

LUNCHEONS: The Blue Ribbon at the Music Center and its president, Joanne 
Kozberg, filled the Grand Hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for a Christmas 
luncheon before the Joffrey's "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
Roger and Joanne Kozberg brought daughter Lindsey home from Princeton. Andrea 
Van de Kamp had daughter Diana, Harriet Deutsch had granddaughter Cari Deutsch 
and Dody Booth brought daughter Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Rutt took over the Pavillion at the Bistro Garden to host 60 for a 
luncheon. Launched with chat and green ravioli, the affair finished with 
giggles and ice cream and chocolate. As a surprise, the hostess asked Neiman 
Marcus to do a mini-fashion show of ball gowns. Rutt provided favors of 
Christmas red lipsticks and tied-up boxes of lemon drops for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the Bistro Garden at Coldwater, the Luminaires Juniors (supporting the 
Doheny Eye Institute), including Mary Milner and Diane Avery, were in the 
holiday spirit.

ALICE KAHN: THE TOUGH LIFE OF THE ORDINARY GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are you man enough to read this column? I ask this knowing how the issue of 
manliness seems to pop up even in the most trivial aspects of a guy's life. Are 
you man enough to do 50 pushups? Are you man enough to eat Hunan prawns? Are 
you man enough to drive an Alfa? Are you man enough to find your way without 
asking a gas station attendant for help? 
</P>
<P>
The other day, three friends of mine -- all Ph.D.s, academic heavyweights, 
intellectual Schwarzeneggers -- were discussing the situation in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think Bush is too much of a wimp to go through with it." 
</P>
<P>
"But can you imagine the situation if that Dukakis had been elected?" 
</P>
<P>
"Bush has certainly been talking tough." 
</P>
<P>
Do you notice a certain pattern here? A certain obsession that runs through the 
affairs of men, a tendency toward constant checks on their heterosexual 
homeostasis? Imagine if women talked this way: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure glad Mrs. Thatcher had the ovaries to get out and stop fighting." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but what's wrong with that macho Barbara Boxer -- she needs her estrogen 
checked." 
</P>
<P>
I sympathize with the stressful life men lead. What a strain it must be to have 
to keep asserting gender solidarity, as if every act were a chance at one of 
those carnival games where a mallet to a bell casts your fate as He-Man, 
Loverboy, Only Average or Sissy. How hard the life of Just an Ordinary Guy, 
fending off the ongoing threat of sexual inadequacy, physiological oddity and 
behavioral perversity. 
</P>
<P>
It starts early. Last year I drove my daughter to school in a car pool with 
three 11-year-old boys. Among the boys, there was a steady stream of you-wimps, 
kicked-butts and unprintably worse imputations. 
</P>
<P>
One day, as a girl got out of the car, one of the boys sat there waving his 
hand in front of his nose for several minutes in a gesture designed to show 
displeasure with the stench left from her cosmetics. In an attempt to be one of 
the little boys, I turned to him and said, "She's going to really kick butt 
with that mousse." 
</P>
<P>
Now, most of the time we gals can just sit back in amusement and watch guys 
fight over who has the fastest Porsche, the best forearm, the fattest paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to questioning our national masculinity in the military 
arena, women want in. As recent reports show, women are getting very aggressive 
about peace. 
</P>
<P>
I am not such a pacifist myself that I think we should accept the ascendancy of 
bullies. I think truth, justice and even the pursuit of happiness are worth 
fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
But if the fight is over who's a wimp, as I increasingly hear both men and 
women cast the situation in the Middle East, I think we might want to put down 
our assault missiles and our attack helicopters and pick up the carnival 
mallet. 
</P>
<P>
Last week I met a man who told me he had an 18-year-old son who played in a 
rock band. "You must be watching things in Saudi Arabia very carefully with a 
son that age," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraging him to enlist," the father said. 
</P>
<P>
I was astonished to think that anyone would actually want to risk his son's 
life. "Why would you do that now? You must really believe that war with Saddam 
Hussein is the only way to stop him." 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's more a personal thing. I'm worried about my son," he said. "I think 
the military would be good for him. Make a man out of him." 
</P>
<P>
It could make a dead man out of him, too, I thought, but I didn't say it. I'm 
too much of a lady to want to hit him where it hurts.

3 EXPERTS APPRAISE A BUDDING ROSE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They stooped to look at hedgehogs. They peered into the mouths of alligators. 
They cringed at Godzilla's roar. And they climbed stairs to gaze down at 
tigers, elephants and dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
The three previewers trekked through five warehouses in Azusa and Pasadena last 
week to preview 53 of the 60 floats that will roll down Colorado Boulevard on 
Tuesday in the 102nd Tournament of Roses Parade. The remaining floats were 
being assembled individually. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed at the complexity of them all," said Clair Martin after 7 1/2 hours 
of float-viewing. "It's sort of the conspicuous consumption of paradedom." 
</P>
<P>
The Times recruited three people with expertise in design, horticulture and 
parade-going to preview the Rose Parade floats and come up with their 
individual top three choices. The idea was to give readers an advance look at 
Pasadena's most famous event. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, rose curator of the Huntington Botanical Gardens, discovered that 
previewing the floats and picking favorites is no easy task. And that was 
especially true six days before the parade, when some floats were nothing more 
than steel skeletons with only welders' sparks for decoration. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Martin and his co-previewers were impressed by the time, money and labor 
spent on floats, which can cost up to $300,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing them up so close is so awesome," said Scott Finnell, lead singer of the 
Doo Dah Parade's official band, Snotty Scotty and the Hankies. The Doo Dah, 
traditionally held the Sunday after Thanksgiving, is a spoof of the Rose 
Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, Finnell and Stuart Frolick of Pasadena's Art Center College of Design 
contemplated their favorites Wednesday evening at the Espresso Bar in Old 
Pasadena and finally arrived at their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's first choice was Godzilla, by American Honda Motor Co.; Finnell's, 
foxes hunting, by Dr Pepper Co., and Frolick's, the basketball player by ITT 
Sheraton. 
</P>
<P>
The parade's official judges get more time than the previewers to mull over the 
19 trophy winners, which will be announced during the New Year's Day parade. 
The three judges selected by the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Assn. make two 
trips to the warehouses beforehand and one final 4 a.m. stroll along Orange 
Grove Boulevard as the floats queue up New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
This year's official judges are Marleen Pedroza, executive vice president of 
the Fiesta San Antonio Commission; Pasadena float-building veteran David R. 
Coleman, and Arcadia floral designer Celia Kalm. 
</P>
<P>
They will "look for floral impact rather than the use of seeds, leaves and 
bark," said association spokeswoman Kristin Tranquada. Floats designed to be 
viewed equally from both sides of the street also score high, as do those with 
dramatic impact and those that match the parade theme, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But for the previewers recruited by The Times, standards were more 
off-the-cuff. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the parade theme this year?" Martin asked Wednesday morning, moments 
before entering the Rose Palace on South Raymond Avenue, where 10 floats were 
being assembled. The theme is "Fun 'N' Games"; grand marshal is comedian Bob 
Newhart. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Pasadena warehouse, association members, dressed in their uniform 
of white suits and red ties, greeted members of the public, who paid $2 to see 
the unassembled floats. But the officials' smiles turned even broader when 
television parade commentators Bob Eubanks and Stephanie Edwards arrived in a 
gray stretch limousine nearly as long as a float. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we judge the commentators?" Martin asked. "I think it would be more fun." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, floats were on the floor, some in pieces, some doubled over to fit in 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
Guide Sue McInerney explained that the floats are painted the same colors as 
the flowers they will bear so volunteers can easily match the right flower to 
the right spot. Parade rules require that only natural materials cover the 
floats. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner, the previewers backed away from the heady scent of glue used by 
workers applying seeds to a float. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get real high in here," McInerney said. "That's why everybody stays so 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
At a float-building warehouse in Azusa, the previewers found City Councilman 
Harry Stemrich, dressed in cowboy hat and Mexican-style vest, standing proudly 
by the Elks float, a circus wagon to be pulled by Belgian horses. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, he wanted to bet me 100 bucks that the float would win the sweepstakes 
prize," Finnell said as he left with the other previewers. "I had to tell him 
it was being drawn by 12 Belgian waffles," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
At a second Azusa warehouse, the previewers listened to an explanation of the 
hydraulic workings of a couple of the parade's more complex floats: Godzilla, 
and the Purple People Eater. Afterward, Martin pronounced them "the Neiman 
Marcus of floats." By comparison, he dubbed smaller floats the "Fedco of 
floats." 
</P>
<P>
In one of two Arroyo Seco float-building areas, the previewers peered at the 
inner workings of the Betty Boop float. Inside, a bicycle was rigged to turn 
the wheels of the giant cartoon figure's car when a youngster pedals it during 
the parade. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, they're not all battery-operated," Finnell said. "That poor kid is going 
to be pedaling the whole way!" 
</P>
<P>
Their pockets full of tiny lapel pins handed out by float-builders, the 
previewers finally called it a day at the espresso bar. They were surprised and 
pleased by some floats promoting recycling, ride-sharing and reading. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Finnell pronounced the parade "kind of kid-oriented more than anything 
else. . . . It felt like Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>

NEW FACES AND NEW IDEAS ON WATER BOARDS; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: FIVE ENVIRONMENTALISTS ELECTED IN NOVEMBER MAY HAVE DIFFERENT 
SOLUTIONS TO GROUND-WATER PROBLEMS. A RIPPLE EFFECT MAY CAUSE CHANGES IN OTHER 
AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last November, when five environmentalists won elections in three key San 
Gabriel Valley water districts, Hacienda Heights environmentalist Wil Baca 
predicted, "you're going to see wholesale changes in January." 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, the environmentalists advocated a more aggressive approach 
to remedying the region's ground-water pollution, one of the worst problems of 
its kind in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the five winners -- three newcomers and the two incumbents -- prepare 
to begin their new terms next month, early signs indicate changes will indeed 
take place, potentially shaking up water boards from El Monte to Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
A ripple effect also will likely occur on other water agencies where the 
defeated incumbents, as well as some officials who were not up for reelection, 
have served in appointed posts, owing to their membership on the key water 
boards -- the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, the Three Valleys 
Municipal Water District and the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The new environmental influence in those districts -- which focus on providing 
adequate water supplies to their customers -- could result in significant 
changes in the appointments to these other water agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of Donald F. Clark by Carol Montano for the Azusa seat on the San 
Gabriel District provides an example of the type of change that is expected. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime water official, Clark was chairman of the San Gabriel district. He 
also served as president of the newly created water-quality authority that was 
set up to help deal with severe ground-water pollution that plagues the San 
Gabriel Valley. In addition, he represented his board on another local water 
agency, the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster. 
</P>
<P>
His defeat not only opened up the presidency of the San Gabriel district, but 
created vacancies on the two other important boards. 
</P>
<P>
Even incumbents still in office are threatened with a loss of power as the 
boards during the next month reorganize, elect new officers and make their 
appointments to regional water agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Influencing their boards' discussions on new appointments and officers, members 
of the three San Gabriel water districts say, will be the November victories of 
the environmentalists, as well as determining how the individual boards decide 
the water cleanup efforts in their areas should be handled. 
</P>
<P>
Witness the case of Burton E. Jones of the Upper District, where two 
environmentalists -- Marvin Joe Cichy and Anthony Fellow, both of El Monte -- 
defeated incumbents identified as favoring the water industry viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year member of the board and a longtime representative in the Southern 
California water Establishment, Jones won't be up for reelection for two years. 
But, because of environmentalists now making up a majority on his board, he 
faces a potential loss of several powerful positions, including presidency of 
the Upper District, vice chairmanships on both the Metropolitan Water District 
of Southern California and the regional water quality authority, and his 
membership on the Watermaster board, which oversees water rights and pumping in 
the San Gabriel Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, of South Pasadena, and others on his board say he may lose several of 
the key posts because his colleagues don't see him as an environmentalist and 
won't reappoint him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very possible," Jones said. "I hope I've lived long enough to understand 
that's politics. But water has become a highly political thing. Everyone that 
turns on a faucet is now an expert." 
</P>
<P>
Local water agencies during the last year have grappled with the fact that no 
single governmental agency has the overall authority to finance and supervise 
the pollution cleanup. Environmentalists have favored the legislative creation 
of a regional "super-agency." 
</P>
<P>
But many local water officials have believed this was unnecessary, saying the 
San Gabriel Valley's new water-quality authority can be given the necessary 
powers to do the job, along with the Watermaster. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have called for water officials to involve the public more in 
the decision-making process of alleviating the ground-water problem, estimated 
to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and to take decades to solve. 
</P>
<P>
Established water officials, who have been criticized for paying more attention 
to interests of water companies than to consumers, and environmentalists all 
say they hope for a spirit of compromise to prevail as they go about their 
tasks in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic," said Robert G. Berlien, who wears two hats as executive 
officer of both the Upper District and the Watermaster. "But I'll grant you the 
possibility that (the two factions) can't get along. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the old-time water Establishment in conflict with the new-line 
environmentalist, public activist groups. Whether they can reach an accord, I 
don't know. It's not going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
Upper District member Bill Robinson, who joined the board two years ago when he 
defeated a San Gabriel Valley water Establishment icon, Howard Hawkins -- once 
chairman of the powerful Metropolitan Water District -- said he is hopeful for 
a new era in which the concerns of the environmentalists have more impact on 
policy. "We have a great opportunity to make some real progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Stiglich, one of the Three Valleys incumbents who was reelected with 
support from environmentalist groups, said he expects some changes within his 
board and the appointments it will make next month. Likewise, he said, he also 
expects perhaps even more environmentalist-inspired changes on the water 
quality authority. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how much certain people want to rock the boat," he said. "But I 
think it's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the criticism made by water Establishment members who are skeptical 
of changes advocated by environmentalists, Marvin Cichy of the Upper District 
acknowledged that he and his environmental colleagues have much to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"But my position is similar to when I served on the Rosemead City Council," 
Cichy said. "We always said of new council members: 'Give them a year, and 
you'll know whether they'll be good or not.' "

TREE RECYCLING PLAN SET UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time, the city will recycle residents' Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
"For San Marino, this is a start," said Keith Till, acting city manager. "Every 
little bit helps." 
</P>
<P>
Residents can take trees to Lacy Park from 9 a.m. to noon on Thursday. Workers 
will run the trees through a "chipper," grinding them into recyclable material. 
</P>
<P>
The service is part of the community's new comprehensive recycling program. 
Residents, who may be asked to show driver's licenses, are asked to remove 
nails or other protrusions from trees.

DRIVER'S ED PROGRAM STALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fee-for-service plan to revive driver's education has stalled in the Rowland 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
If 200 students had enrolled, the district would have offered behind-the-wheel 
training for a fee of $200 per student. 
</P>
<P>
Because only 35 students signed up by mid-December, the district canceled the 
program and will refund students' money, said Diane Ho, the district's public 
information officer. 
</P>
<P>
Like the majority of districts across the state, Rowland Unified canceled its 
behind-the-wheel driver's training program when Gov. George Deukmejian and the 
Legislature eliminated money for the program from this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland and other districts still offer the classroom portion of the program. 
Without on-the-road training, however, students are not eligible to take 
licensing tests until they turn 18.

PEOPLE IN THE NEWS: RETIREE ENDS A RECORD STREAK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It may be hard to believe, but Roy Okamura hasn't missed a day of work during 
his 30 years as a forklift operator at Sysco Food Services. 
</P>
<P>
He'll have his day soon, though; Okamura, 68, retired last week. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, he won't rise before dawn to get to work by 6 a.m., as he's done every 
weekday since May 15, 1961, except for vacations. He won't walk briskly around 
the block for exercise before hopping on the orange-and-black forklift and 
unloading crates of frozen food from delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he and his wife, Loy, plan to relax and travel to Japan for the first 
time to see relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials say Okamura is the only one of the 924 employees at the 
company's Walnut division with a spotless attendance record. 
</P>
<P>
"It's phenomenal," said Michael Ducharm, Sysco's director of transportation and 
Okamura's former supervisor. "He's worked days when he had the flu." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on Thursday morning, Okamura showed up for work as usual, even though 
his throat was so sore that he could barely talk. Another time, co-workers 
said, a heavy carton fell on Okamura, knocking him down. His head was bleeding, 
but Okamura got up and went back to work. 
</P>
<P>
During a break Thursday, Okamura said his work ethic hails from his days as a 
potato farmer in his native Pocatello, Ida., during the 1940s.

"When you're a farmer, you've just got to keep going," Okamura whispered. "If 
you sit back, you're just gonna go broke." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in his normal work attire -- gray golf hat, lined denim jacket and 
rubber leg guards -- Okamura said he's taken aback by all the fuss about his 
attendance record. Even when Sysco awarded him a plaque last year, he didn't 
bother hanging it up in his Los Angeles home because he said he would feel 
uncomfortable displaying it. 
</P>
<P>
Co-workers, however, weren't so low-key about their colleague. "They don't make 
men like that anymore," said receiving clerk Carlos Vidal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gonna put him in the Guinness Book of World Records," Stanley Robinowitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Okamura smiled, shrugged his shoulders and went back to work.

WHEN IN ROME; 
</P>
<P>
ON NEW YEAR'S EVE IN THE ETERNAL CITY, STAY IN THE BIG PIAZZAS, KEEP TO THE 
CURB AND WATCH OUT FOR FALLING OBJECTS

ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strolling around the city at the end of the day can be one of the more 
enlightening (and potentially dangerous) activities available to the traveler 
here. After a hefty spaghetti dinner, a long camminata calms the digestion, 
soothes the mind and reveals hitherto unappreciated aspects of the city: For 
example, dusk over the river, when the evening sky discloses sun-tinted 
mashed-potato clouds above the Tiber bridges. 
</P>
<P>
But looking upward as you walk along Rome's old streets can be a matter of 
physical -- as well as spiritual -- survival, particularly on New Year's Eve, 
when the local populace tends to hurl cherry bombs and other explosive devices 
from their windows and terraces. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, objects more substantial than firecrackers were landing in the 
streets as householders enthusiastically dumped furniture, crockery and 
appliances that had outlived their domestic usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
Historians suggest that Romans first got into the habit of throwing things in a 
downward direction when the barbarians tried scaling the imperial walls in 
pre-Christian times. The Encyclopedia Britannica advises that New Year's Eve 
became a universal festival of destruction and renewal as many as 5,000 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure when Romans first began throwing old furniture, broken 
appliances and plumbing out of their dwellings -- mimicking the destruction of 
an old, ordered universe by way of making room for the new. It is known that 
the ritual tends to lose steam in times of social crisis. 
</P>
<P>
During the last, harsh, deprived days of Fascism, for example, when 
replacements and parts for consumer-rejectables such as hair driers and radios 
were hard to come by, New Year's Eve was comparatively peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
Romans resumed throwing things out of their windows again at the end of World 
War II, and the annual defenestration was still going strong when my wife and I 
moved to the Eternal City 22 years ago. My diary of the time records our first 
New Year's Eve in the city, in 1968: 
</P>
<P>
"Dec. 31, 10 p.m. -- Collapsed in the living room after the ritual cenone (big 
supper), featuring lenticchia (lentils) and cotechino (boiled sausage). A 
bottle of Spumante cooling in the frigorifero for the midnight toast. 
Neighborhood quiet. Traffic noise vaguely increasing on nearby Via Candia and 
Viale Guilio Cesare. 
</P>
<P>
"11 p.m. -- First firecracker cracks. Neighbor's dog, Snoopy, barks in reply. 
(Note: When I arrived in Italy, "Peanuts" was the favorite comic strip and most 
dogs answered to the name of Snoopy.) Significant increase in firecracker and 
traffic noise, some car horns and occasional shouts of strolling revelers. 
</P>
<P>
"11:45 (15 minutes to go) -- From outside in the street below comes the 
unmistakable 'clank' of dinnerware encountering pavement. I rouse myself to see 
what's going on. Terraces of apartment buildings across street full of Romans 
bundled in sweaters and overcoats against the cold. A female citizen lifts a 
busted wooden clothes drier over her railing and, with a cautious look down to 
see if anyone is walking underneath, lets it go onto empty sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"On the terrace adjacent to ours -- as architecture, the typical terrace in 
this neighborhood is no big deal, a sort of walled-in box hanging over the 
street -- a middle-aged lady and her husband are locked in a struggle for 
possession of an old table-top radio. 'Giuseppe, let me have the radio!' 
Giuseppe's wife cries. 'You play it all day long! I'm sick of the noise! You 
make the house sound like a barbershop. Give it to me! It doesn't work anymore 
anyhow!' Taking violent possession of radio, neighbor's wife hurls it into the 
street -- cord, antenna and all. Radio free-falls five flights, bounces off our 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"When I tell the agitated woman in my halting Italian that the radio has hit my 
car, she waves aside my objection. 'You are an American!' she exclaims. 'You 
get a car any time you want!' Before I can work out an answer to that -- it's a 
complex concept, to be sure, and not an entirely amicable one -- the husband 
assures me that his mechanic brother will fix my car come nuova (like new) for 
practically nothing. I am disinclined to follow his suggestion that we go 
downstairs to examine the damage. I say it's too risky to go into the street 
just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"The magic moment arrives -- I open the Spumante and toast the immediate 
future. 'Buon Anno!' From one corner of this densely inhabited capital to 
another, Rome erupts in full celebration -- skyrockets, Roman candles, cherry 
bombs, Chinese firecrackers; car horns blare on the adjacent traffic-infested 
thoroughfares; church bells fill the air with clanging cheer; plates, cups, old 
brooms and flower pots rain steadily into the street. In the adjacent 
apartment, where he has been left alone, presumably to guard the fort, Snoopy 
contributes his share of agitated noise to the proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
My last diary entry for Dec. 31, 1968, is an admonishment to myself to find a 
garage for the car before this important date comes around again next year. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the apartment house the next morning, I confront an alarming array of 
forlornly uninteresting objects. My neighbor's radio has left a modest crimp in 
the engine cover of my Citroen DS -- mild damage compared to the casual mayhem 
inflicted on other cars parked along the curb. A chipped bathroom sink has 
landed with deep emphasis on the roof of an Alfa Giulietta. The back seat of a 
Fiat sports convertible on the corner is partially occupied by a dusty old 
bidet that has plunged neatly through the canvas roof. 
</P>
<P>
New Year's Eve in Rome hasn't been quite the same in recent years, I'm glad to 
say. Through the pervasive auspices of the economic miracle, the motor car has 
become an emblematic component of Italian self-esteem ( along with 
prohibitively high damage-insurance rates). 
</P>
<P>
In their own self-interest, modern Romans stopped throwing big things into the 
car-filled streets 15 years ago or more. But habits die hard, and in many 
neighborhoods, junk that is not actually thrown out the window or off the 
terrace is moved down by hand during the last night of the year and left on the 
sidewalks for the bag people to pick over before the street cleaners arrive in 
the early days of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
Superannuated dinnerware still gets the traditional heave-ho in some of the 
more exuberantly traditional neighborhoods such as Trastevere (possibly the 
oldest inhabited area of Rome, south of the Vatican) and Testaccio (a 
working-class neighborhood on the Tiber on Rome's south). Launching 
firecrackers into the void and parading slowly around town tooting the car horn 
are, today, the principle ways residents (who do not bother to make timely 
reservations in the restaurants and nightclubs) celebrate the demise of the old 
year. 
</P>
<P>
One hundred and fifty-three emergency calls were made to the police here during 
the night of Dec. 31, 1989, to report fires and personal injuries. And 
firecracker-related trauma has been on the increase since 1987, possibly 
reflecting a rise in enthusiasm for celebrating of this kind. During last New 
Year's Eve's festivities, a record 63 Romans checked into local emergency wards 
with charred hands and blinded eyes, up 40% over 1988. If the stats are any 
indication of what's in store, Jan. 1, 1991, may see new records set in numbers 
of burning terraces and torched automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say, walking home from dinner in Rome is not advisable on New 
Year's Eve, although an old umbrella might be useful, opened against the 
falling fireworks if not against the flowerpots. And if you do try to make it 
back to the hotel, it's just possible you'll find the protection you need lying 
in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Waking up on New Year's Day (given that he could get to sleep in the first 
place), the inquisitive traveler in Rome should hot-foot it over to the Cavour 
Bridge about 11 a.m. for the First Dive (Il Primo Tuffo) of the year, which, 
for years, featured a local citizen, the late Spartaco Bandini, the dean of a 
handful of extrovert males who inaugurate the New Year with an uninhibited jump 
into the Tiber River. 
</P>
<P>
Bandini was 78 years old when he last shed his bathrobe and stepped up on the 
wall of Il Ponte Cavour to make what proved to be his farewell 18-meter swan 
dive into the cold, cappuccino-colored effluvia below (considered by 
environmentalists to be among the more polluted waters in Europe). 
</P>
<P>
But the tradition lives on as other hardy types carry on his work. Usually, a 
fire department launch is on duty at the bridge, manned by lifeguards in 
underwater diving equipment, in case a diver gets into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Last Jan. 1, Bandini's semi-nude, three-second flight through the sunny, midday 
Roman air seemed to evoke all the old objects that had been surrendered to 
gravity at year's end in the past, and which, no doubt, will be surrendered 
again in the years to come.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: HERE'S THE DEAL: WINTER BRINGS A BUYER'S MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
BARGAINS: AS THE NEW YEAR BEGINS, MANY AIRLINES, CRUISE COMPANIES AND RESORTS 
ARE OFFERING MAJOR DISCOUNTS. FREQUENT FLIERS STAND TO SAVE THE MOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A strange thing happened earlier this month: Airlines announced their January 
fare wars a month early. Cruise lines began offering hundreds of substantial 
last-minute discounts. Even upscale resorts and hotels -- in some of the more 
desirable vacation destinations -- began to discount. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the winter of the travel industry's discontent has created a buyer's 
market for holiday deals. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 12, Delta Airlines announced to members of its frequent-flier program 
that it would give a free ticket for passengers flying as few as two round 
trips. The move was significant in that Delta is an airline that had previously 
refused to start any kind of fare war or fare discounting. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it all started in late November, when Continental -- then on the 
verge of bankruptcy -- announced a two-for-one deal: Anyone who purchased a 
round-trip "maxsaver" fare ticket to selected destinations before Nov. 30 could 
take along a companion for free. Within hours, a number of airlines matched the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later came the Delta bombshell. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic has been soft," admits Delta spokesman Vince Durocher, "and we looked 
at our advance bookings, which were also down. So we did it to stimulate our 
passenger loads among those who fly us already. We wanted to spur business 
travel. " 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, the Delta offer -- good until March -- has sparked a 
frequent-flier/air-fare war among rival airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Delta's announcement, American, United, Northwest, TWA and 
Continental had announced their own programs. American's offer: Fly three round 
trips or eight separate flights, get one free round-trip ticket. Or fly five 
round trips or 14 separate flights and get two free round trips. And you get 
three round trips for flying seven round trips or 20 separate flights. 
</P>
<P>
The Northwest program is similar. Fly three round trips or eight separate 
flights between now and March 25, 1991, and get a free coach-class ticket. Fly 
five round trips and Northwest gives you a free ticket to Europe. Fly seven 
round trips and get Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
United goes one step further: Fly seven round trips between now and March 15 
and the airline will give you a free coach ticket anywhere United flies 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
One small catch on these deals: To qualify for the free tickets, each flight 
must cost a minimum of $50. Surprised? The $50 minimum is in response to a fare 
war between Los Angeles and the Bay Area that has dropped prices to as low as 
$29. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the mileage deals. Alaska Airlines reintroduced triple mileage. From 
now through March 15, travelers will earn triple mileage on every Alaska 
flight. And TWA announced that members of its frequent-flier program will now 
earn triple miles for any flight taken between Jan. 7 and Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"In an environment of shrinking market share, I think this was an attempt to 
hold market share rather than gain it," says Charles Demoney, president and 
chief executive of MGM Grand Air. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, MGM announced its own two-for-one deal. Between Dec. 17 and 
Jan. 31, every full-fare passenger flying the upscale airline is entitled to 
bring along a companion at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Air France Concorde is offering deals -- indirectly. Air France has 
announced that between Jan. 1 and March 31, American Express card holders using 
the card to purchase a round-trip, first-class ticket on any Air France flight 
between New York City and Paris can reserve a free round-trip seat on the 
Concorde. 
</P>
<P>
The discounting has also extended to the cruise industry, which finds itself 
awash in empty berths. 
</P>
<P>
World Wide Cruises, a Fort Lauderdale-based cruise agency and consolidator, is 
offering very attractive deals on unfilled cabin space. 
</P>
<P>
For example: There's a seven-day Caribbean cruise on the Meridian for $799, 
including air fare, stopping in Antigua, St. Thomas and Nassau. Regular price: 
$1,095. Or a seven-day Mexican Riviera cruise on the Dawn Princess from Los 
Angeles, including air fare, for $895. Regular fare is $1,475. 
</P>
<P>
While many resorts and destinations do not officially acknowledge a drop-off in 
visitors, many are beginning to behave in an uncharistic manner: they're 
offering deals. Most of the deals and discounts aren't being widely advertised, 
but they are there for the asking. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Lodge at Vail is offering discount packages, although they are 
not advertised as such. One package, which offers six days of unlimited skiing, 
hotel accommodations for seven nights and buffet breakfasts daily, costs $1,125 
($945 for nonskiers). 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Savoy Group of Hotels has announced that each room reserved for 
two nights or more by travelers originating from the United States or Canada 
will include Savoy Group "gift vouchers," amounting to nearly $250. The 
vouchers can be used at any of the group's restaurants, or to pay for such 
incidental charges as telephone and fax bills, cocktails, tea or even future 
room nights. 
</P>
<P>
If you're interested in visiting Hawaii, Florida or the Colorado ski slopes, 
don't just ask what the room rates are; ask what special packages they might be 
offering. Chances are, you'll get a more attractive quote. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has also become a buyer's market, with many upscale hotels beginning 
to offer discounts. 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for ads announcing these deals. Officially, most hotels and 
resorts are advertising their regular prices. But the fact is, many have 
occupancy rates significantly below the same period last year. Thus, you may be 
able to make them an offer they just might not refuse. 
</P>
<P>
But are these deals really worth it? Each comes complete with a set of 
restrictions and disclaimers. And, for once, at least one airline -- Northwest 
-- has officially acknowledged in plain English how restricted their program 
can be. Within the advertising small print can be found the following 
statement: "Seats for free travel awards are limited and may not be available 
when you call. Popular flights may already be sold out." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it gets down to a definition of terms. Yes, each airline limits the 
number of seats available for free or award travel. But there's nothing that 
says they can't raise the limits. If you call to redeem one of your awards and 
you're told that "no seats are available for the awards," you should ask if 
there are seats available for sale. 
</P>
<P>
If so, ask to speak to a supervisor immediately. Kindly explain that you 
received this free ticket as a reward for your loyalty and that if you then 
can't redeem your ticket, your loyalty could easily go elsewhere. Ask the 
supervisor -- gently -- to look once again to see if any seats are available.

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICAL FORCAST; 
</P>
<P>
WILSON CAN BE A HERO -- IF, AND THAT'S A BIG WORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeff Levin, Political Forecast interviews were conducted by Jeff Levin, a 
free-lance writer in Santa Monica who has worked in government in New York, 
Washington, and Los Angeles: Four years from now, will Gov. Pete Wilson be a 
hero or a bum? And why? The Times asked eight government officials and 
political observers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed McLaughlin, farmer and chairman, Butte County Board of Supervisors: 
</P>
<P>
As a local government official, I certainly hope four years from today Pete 
Wilson is regarded as a hero. His experiences as a city mayor, a state 
assemblyman and a U.S. senator make him the best-prepared governor-elect in 40 
years to tackle the tasks that lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
His task of rebuilding our confidence in California's future on a wide range of 
issues, from environmental concerns to the state's fiscal stability, do not lie 
totally within his control. To be successful, he must communicate and strike 
frequent compromises with an often-hostile Legislature led by an equally strong 
and determined Speaker of the Assembly, whose priorities are often at odds with 
the governor's. 
</P>
<P>
. . . In the past, Wilson has demonstrated that he can work with diverse 
special-interest groups at any level of government and bring them together to 
develop workable solutions. We are all hoping and praying that he can use that 
"Midas touch" once again as we enter a challenging new decade. 
</P>
<P>
John M. Dominguez, community action program chairperson, United Auto Workers 
Local 645, Van Nuys: 
</P>
<P>
We didn't support Wilson because of his poor record on labor issues -- for 
example, his lack of support for worker-safety legislation. In spite of his 
past, we're looking forward to working with him to deal with the problems 
facing workers. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has inherited a state with growing unemployment caused by the loss of 
good-paying industrial jobs to foreign competition, lack of capital for 
investment and a shifting of work to southern states and/or maquiladora plants 
in Mexico. California is also suffering from the effects of the nationwide 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Areas where Wilson can have an important impact -- accessible education for 
future workers, retraining present workers, health and safety and investment in 
technology -- will be key to the future economic growth of California. The 
fight for a state health-care program is going to be a good opportunity for the 
new governor to demonstrate leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The question is: Can Pete Wilson rise above his party's shortsighted policies? 
</P>
<P>
Terry Friedman, member of the California Assembly (D-Los Angeles): 
</P>
<P>
Wilson returns to a California in decline. Los Angeles is the gang and cocaine 
capital of the world. Our schools are failing. Infant mortality approaches 
Third World levels. 
</P>
<P>
These problems are of our own making. Voters have chosen lower taxes over safe 
streets, good schools and healthy children. We cannot build the society we want 
without paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has the temperament and experience to be a hero. He's a doer, a 
pragmatist. California will prosper again if he soundly invests more money in 
law enforcement, children, health care, the environment. If Richard Nixon could 
go to China, Pete Wilson can raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
H. Eric Schockman,associate director, Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at 
USC: 
</P>
<P>
. . . The California governor's office is quickly approaching "institutional 
meltdown." The voters of this state have not seen an activist governor since 
the days of Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and Earl Warren. An entire generation of 
voters have grown up with a succession of administrative caretakers. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder that the electorate now wants to further "Balkanize" the 
governorship -- pulling out power from its traditional domain of insurance 
oversight and environmental regulation? Unless Wilson can capture the high 
ground of leadership and tackle the dragons of, say, a state health-care 
policy, be prepared for yet another initiative battle and perhaps a new health 
"czar" elected by the people. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson must furthermore stop the hemorrhaging and divisiveness that public 
policy has produced in this state. As the Soviet Union may break apart, so, 
too, is California poised to continue to splinter into rival encampments: urban 
vs. rural; north vs. south. A Wilson-led, balanced state water policy would 
certainly mend the "water wars." Bottom line, Wilson has a Herculean task in 
securing a place in the California history books. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Weber,president of the San Diego Unified School District Board of 
Education and chair of the Afro-American Studies Department at San Diego State 
University 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has initially done something good by elevating education to 
cabinet-level status and appointing Maureen DiMarco to that job. He's at least 
focused on children, and that's the key. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, can he hold fast in the midst of all of the other demands? Can 
he convince the Legislature and rally the people of California to understand 
that we have to put more resources into prevention? 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that we are not judged by the number of students we send to 
Harvard; we are judged by the number of dropouts. We are judged by what we do 
for the least of our children. 
</P>
<P>
So I'm saying to Wilson that you are going to have a difficult time because of 
the budget crisis. But what's your vision? And do you have the intestinal 
fortitude to hold to that vision and to try to convince others to invest in 
long-term solutions rather than quick fixes? 
</P>
<P>
Ed Davis,member of the California Senate (R-Northridge): 
</P>
<P>
Pete's success depends on his ability to strategically plan a budget. Our 
current practices stink. If he can extrapolate trends and fiscally plan for 
them, then we cannot only avoid disaster, but once again provide the resources 
for a growing and dynamic California. If Gov. Wilson can't adopt the necessary 
budget reforms, he will fail and so will the entire state. However, I strongly 
believe that Pete Wilson will make it. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Raimundo,former political reporter in Sacramento and Washington: 
</P>
<P>
After eight years of mulish confrontation with the Legislature and lack of 
problem-solving vision, George Deukmejian should be an easy act to follow. 
Wilson will be a hero. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing a respected Democrat (Bill Hauck) to co-chair his transition team, 
selecting a highly regarded finance director (Republican Tom Hayes), promising 
to set up a new environmental agency and appointing an education adviser (also 
a Democrat) to his cabinet, Wilson already has displayed the cooperative spirit 
and thoughtfulness needed to attack California's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reapportionment will provoke tensions with the Democrat-controlled Legislature, 
but it also will give Wilson the bargaining chips he'll need to confront 
budget, health care and a host of other crises facing California. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Baker,member of the California Assembly (R-Walnut Creek): 
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Californians will be thankful that they had Wilson to repair and 
restructure the machinery of state government so that it could begin to answer 
the challenges of the '90s -- rather than compound them. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson will be praised for his well-honed administrative skills, which steered 
California in the direction of "crisis-prevention management," particularly in 
areas of health care and education, with future-oriented policies tailored to 
our state's growth demand. 
</P>
<P>
. . . A hero is one who does what's right and needed in the face of great 
difficulty or danger. I'm trusting that in 1994, Californians will say that 
Pete Wilson rose to the occasion.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican kids stand on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills beside sandwich boards 
advertising "STAR MAPS." They stare patiently toward private horizons as cars 
whiz past them. 
</P>
<P>
There are two futures in California. There is the glamorous, the famous, the 
gaudy telling of time in California as possibility. There is also a tragic way 
of telling the future in California as limitation. 
</P>
<P>
One future describes California as a series of problems -- pesticide 
contamination; drugs; bad air -- a future mired in the past. Tomorrow, when the 
new freeway opens, it will already be obsolete. In five years, the small 
farming towns in the Central Valley will be one suburban blur. By the end of 
the century, Californians will not be able to barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
If California now entertains tragic possibilities, such was not always our way. 
For generations, since its American beginnings, California denied 
inevitability. The point of this place was that it represented an escape from 
certainty. Go to California and find gold. Go to California and find yourself a 
new life. 
</P>
<P>
America seems the least tangible of countries in the world because it is built 
on expectation. You can start all over here. That is why people come to America 
-- to become something new. Immigrant Americans put up with tenements and sweat 
shops and stoop labor not in resignation to tragedy, but in the name of the 
future (". . . something better for my kids"). 
</P>
<P>
At the edge of geographic possibility and under a paradisaical sun, California 
traditionally has played America's wild child, America's America. To people in 
Tulsa or Como, Miss., as much as to pilgrims from Vietnam or from Ireland, 
California has been the most extreme version of America. 
</P>
<P>
Who can be surprised that the world came to California and still wants to come? 
Most immigrants in the world head for America, and more choose California. Or 
would. And not only foreigners; the restless come also from Pennsylvania and 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Californians are not in the mood to be flattered. Californians, like many other 
Americans, are troubled by the suspicion that something is dying. Call it the 
American Century. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have seen Japanese economic and scientific ascendancy. When the 
Japanese came to town a few weeks ago and bought up Universal Pictures, the 
American response was worry, not flattery. 
</P>
<P>
What on earth do the Japanese think they are buying when they buy up a 
Hollywood studio? 
</P>
<P>
What the Japanese businessman knows is that the world goes to American movies. 
No one else in the world makes movies the world wants to see. The Italian 
businessman and the British mogul know this, too -- they also have recently 
purchased Hollywood studios. 
</P>
<P>
Did America invent the movies? It doesn't matter. The movies invented America 
for the world. The movies have been our best advertisement. And, not 
coincidentally, the home of the movies was California. 
</P>
<P>
The French make films about couples who go on picnics. And the British make 
movies about detectives in cardigans. Bombay has her elephantine soaps. But 
only the Americans seem to have understood the implications of the size of the 
movie screen. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are famous for their skill at reduction and miniaturization, 
whether in horticulture or in the size of the TV screen or in the thrift of 
automobiles. Tokyo may well serve as a prophetic example to Los Angeles and San 
Francisco as urban life in California grows more crowded and space becomes the 
valued commodity. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Jewish immigrants to America from Eastern Europe who established the 
scale of the movies and thereby taught us that our lives could aspire to scope 
and grandeur. Neal Gabler was too modest in his recent and excellent book, "An 
Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood." The haberdasher's son 
and the tobacconist's son in fact invented America at the movies. They gave the 
democratic yearnings of Americans adequate range on the screen. A chandelier 
and a long car in every life, yes. But lips that were 10 feet long and faces 
that were 40 feet high became our best metaphors of democracy. The exaggeration 
flattered our private ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
Who needed kings in such a world? Movies belonged to their own palaces. And the 
people on the screen, the "stars," belonged uniquely to a place where you could 
become anything you wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
The divorcee on "Wheel of Fortune" who tells Pat Sajak that she's "originally" 
from North Carolina came last year to California to get away from the past, as 
did the Joad family before her and as the Guatemalans are doing today. Their 
lives define California; restless lives are the point of California. 
</P>
<P>
The newcomers embarrass those of us who are born here with that knowledge. For 
we are not the point of California. They are. John Sutter and Lucille Ball, 
John Fremont and Walt Disney -- they are the famous Californians. They came 
here from some place else. They recreated themselves. 
</P>
<P>
As a native-born son of California, I am under no illusions. I do not imagine 
that an editorial-page essayist is more important to the vitality of this state 
than a Mexican illegal immigrant who is, this day, working the artichoke fields 
around Salinas with an intensity we mistake for resignation. I think something 
closer to the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Native-born Californians, we have been looking at movies all our lives, but 
with a knowledge different than that of people who saw those same movies in 
faraway theaters. We recognized the street pictured on the screen, and we 
measured the exaggeration. Our movies became a kind of family album for us, 
marking the changes around us. The earliest films made in Niles or in Santa 
Barbara or in the San Fernando Valley (in those days when it could pass as the 
Old West) we saw with irony and regret for our dry, lovely landscape lost. 
</P>
<P>
You do not have to be an old-timer (though, of course, in a state of much 
change you can easily become an old timer) when you remember orchards in the 
Santa Clara Valley or orange groves before Disneyland or the two-lane road 
where now there is freeway or searching dry creeks on Saturday mornings for 
arrowheads. And finding them. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to California, those outsiders who are also our parents or our 
grandparents, leave us an impossible inheritance. The house is too big; the 
ambition too large to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, the native-born Californian has a different sense of history than 
the newcomer. The native born discovers consequence, fears change as pollution 
or congestion or loss, the loss of the oak trees. The native born saw parents 
work and work to create a new life for their children. To the native-born 
Californian, however, paradise reduces to a three-bedroom house, a mother who 
knew how to drive, endemic sun, all were the given, not symbols of paradise. To 
mama and papa, California must have seemed a great deal like paradise after 
civil war in Hungary or the Oklahoma dust bowl or the segregated South. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants from China and from Mexico arrive in California today. And 
California seems to them to stretch to all-possibility. Those of us who are 
native born see only smog and remember when it was possible to get downtown in 
under 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma for California for coming years is that the state will be separated 
into two time zones, two competing futures. Already, native-born Californians 
are, on average, older than the newcomers. One California speaks of 
conservation, the other needs space. One California votes, the other does not. 
One is thinking of retirement, the other of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The native-born Californian ends up saving grandpa's stucco bungalow, 
preserving as historical landmark what was for grandfather a symbol of 
progress. The native-born Californian's best gift to this state is the wisdom 
of tragedy. We will be the ones who must speak of limits, of restrictions, of 
conservation. We will be the state's finger-waggers, problem-solvers -- an 
elect. 
</P>
<P>
I do not think, however, that from the native born will come California's great 
visionaries. What the newcomer offers California is comic vision. The 
newcomer's gift to California has always been the audacity of optimism and the 
assurance that one can forget the past, put the feud between the Hatfields and 
the Capulets far behind. The newcomer has always taught California (as America 
taught the world) that you can re-invent history. 
</P>
<P>
Each side must learn the wisdom of the other. California's destiny depends on 
the melding of tragic and comic sensibilities. The land cannot sustain the 
unalloyed traditional immigrant optimism. On the other hand, those of us who 
are native born must know that we are an imposition on California. 
</P>
<P>
All the time now one hears native-born Californians complain that they have had 
enough of this or that. Crowds. Prices. Traffic. They mean there are too many 
newcomers, too many immigrants. They tell you they are thinking of moving to 
Oregon or to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
California is becoming as crowded with individual ambitions as 18th-Century 
London or Paris, but there is, as yet, no great satirist, no Jonathan Swift, to 
note the ironies of our state. Swift's "Modest Proposal" was that the children 
of the poor could be sold to the rich as food. My own modest proposal for 
California is that there should be a limit to California. Every family in this 
state should be allowed no more than three generations here. When your time is 
up, you would have to move on -- move to Australia or Argentina or your condo 
in Baja, move to Oregon. Is there, after all, any other way to "save" 
California for those newcomers who give California its dynamism? 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese businessman perhaps does not understand that the movie company is 
now a second-generation affair. The Eastern European immigrant long ago passed 
away and has been succeeded by a committee of executive vice presidents. 
Hollywood is a second-generation affair. The actress is the daughter of the 
actress. The director is the son of the producer. Hollywood films are filled 
with allusions to other, earlier films. Or Hollywood films are stuttering 
repetitions of tried formulas. Lacking vision of its own, Hollywood buys 
options to other people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking confidence in a narrative line, second-generation Hollywood offers 
technology. The technological effect is meant to approximate the immigrant 
stories of an earlier generation. 
</P>
<P>
Thus does THX Sound or Dolby stereo attempt to offer today's moviegoer 
something of what we once recognized on the great screen at the movie palace 
when Henry Fonda and the rest of the Joad family got out of their smoking 
truck, to stare in wonder -- as though at paradise -- at California's Central 
Valley.

ECONOMY: HAND-WRINGERS AND CRYSTAL-BALLERS HAVE EMBRACED CALIFORNIA DECLINISM. 
BUT THEIR FAVORITE EVIDENCE IS REALLY A HEALTHY SIGN OF A STATE MOVING TO CUT 
ITS DEPENDENCY ON WAR.

<P>
Is California losing its luster as the beacon of the nation's economic and 
technological future? Some national business publications -- Forbes, Fortune 
and the Wall Street Journal -- have laid out the case for a new phenomenon, 
"California declinism." Angst over the future has also surfaced in the state's 
traditionally more upbeat academic, corporate, governmental and media 
Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
True, there is cause for concern. The continuing slowdown in military spending, 
the economic effects of the Persian Gulf crisis, the global credit crunch and 
resulting housing slump, all have braked the fast-growth pace of the mid- and 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite these problems, California's economic fundamentals remain 
remarkably strong. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what the "decliners" see as harbingers of an economic fall are really 
signs of a healthy long-term transition from dependency on the warfare state to 
a more highly diversified economy with expansive global links. The region is 
well-positioned to emerge in the 1990s as among the most dynamic in the 
advanced industrial world. 
</P>
<P>
The enormous vitality of this evolving California economy is evident even amid 
the pain and wreckage of the current recession. Despite some slowing, virtually 
all California's vital signs -- from exports and job creation to gross state 
product -- remain healthier than those of the nation. The real-estate market, 
though drastically down from its recent boom levels, does not appear poised for 
the "meltdown" now hitting the Northeastern states and sections of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
One critical factor is the state's population growth. During the 1980s, 
California's population grew by more than 26%, an increase of more than 6 
million people. By contrast, New York's population rose by less than 3%, or a 
total of 486,433 people. 
</P>
<P>
This steady increase has helped keep California's net absorption of office 
space -- the supply of which has doubled in Southern California during the past 
decade -- among the highest in the nation. Next year, even much-maligned Los 
Angeles, now overbuilt with largely Japanese-financed projects, will lead all 
the nation's cities in new office-space acquisition, according to a recent 
Cushman and Wakefield survey. 
</P>
<P>
"The Northeast's perception that we're ready for a fall doesn't understand that 
we are still absorbing people and creating jobs, while both (those indices) are 
now negative in places like Massachusetts and Connecticut," says Jerry Jordan, 
chief economist for First Interstate Bank. "As long as you have net growth and 
people coming in, the buildings should keep filling up, even if it takes more 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's optimism about the state's ability to churn out more jobs flies in the 
face of widespread hand-wringing over the impact of military cutbacks. By some 
pre-gulf crisis estimates, less Pentagon spending could wipe out as many as 
140,000 of the 350,000 new aerospace jobs added in California during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA Forecasting Project, perhaps the most frequently quoted local voice of 
"California declinism," predicts the state could soon be hit by a deep-seated 
recession similar to the one it experienced in the early 1970s. Then, 
California lost 25% of its aerospace jobs, and total employment, as well as 
real-estate values, plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
Such gloom and doom, barring a worldwide economic catastrophe, is unlikely. 
Since the late 1960s, California's dependency on military spending has been cut 
in half, to roughly 8% of state product. Meantime, the commercial portion of 
the aerospace business -- dead in the water during the 1970s -- continues to 
grow. Last year, for instance, Boeing alone contracted some $3 billion in 
components from Southern California businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the military-related cutbacks, California -- which in the 1980s created 
more new jobs than all of Western Europe -- generated more than 400,000 net new 
jobs in 1989. Together, San Bernardino and Riverside put more people to work 
than the New York and Boston areas combined. Although industrial employment has 
been slipping, this may simply be an effect of the emerging national and global 
recession. In the coming decade, Robert Dye, director of state forecasting for 
the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., predicts that "California will continue to 
outperform the United States in industrial output." 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite chant from the "California decliners" mantra is based on 
reports of a mass exodus of California companies to other states. True, some 
firms have relocated or expanded into such lower-cost states as Utah, Texas, 
Colorado, Oklahoma, even Baja California. This was the centerpiece of Forbes' 
hit piece on the state, titled "California's Fading Boom." 
</P>
<P>
This and similar articles, however, ignore a basic fact: the decreasing 
importance of corporate relocation decisions. Today, most new jobs -- including 
in the critical manufacturing and high-tech sectors -- are created by locally 
owned small firms. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the Center for the New West of California and other Western 
metropolitan areas found that, during the late 1980s, locally owned firms 
generated all net manufacturing jobs and as many as 10 times many new jobs in 
such areas as business services. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important -- although some California companies will migrate in search 
of less expensive labor, cheaper land and fewer environmental restrictions -- 
the state is unlikely to lose out in sectors like time-sensitive fashion and 
technological products. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than a sign of decline, the shift of some assembly and lower-end 
functions to the hinterlands represents the continued expansion of the coastal 
California economy. In some senses, it parallels the shift earlier this century 
of assembly and mass-production industries from the Atlantic Coast to the 
Middle West and South. 
</P>
<P>
This movement will cause dislocation for industries that are both 
labor-intensive and low value-added or pose severe pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
Value-added refers to the amount of cash added at each stage of the economic 
process. Low valued-added means that relatively little of the final cost of a 
product is added at a particular stage of the process. For instance, cables 
assembled for a General Dynamics aircraft at a plant in Mexico may represent a 
shift of jobs but very little of the final product's total value. The effects 
in terms of pollution will be particularly severe in such industries as 
furniture, chemicals and certain metal-related manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
These losses can be offset with the growth of other more advanced industries. 
With more engineers and scientists than any other two states combined, for 
instance, California's key growing industries -- computer systems, software and 
telecommunications products -- should continue to grow well into the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Paced by Orange County and Silicon Valley, for instance, the value of 
California's export licenses surged, between 1987 and 1989, from roughly $30 
billion to nearly $35 billion. During that time, exports in mid-Atlantic states 
dropped to $14.1 billion. U.S. television exports, mostly from Hollywood, will 
more than double by 1992, according to estimates from Frost and Sullivan, to 
nearly $3 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as the industrial power of the region stretching from the Inland 
Empire of California to the Rockies -- as well as Baja California -- increases 
during the 1990s, Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area will enjoy 
great opportunities in meeting its financial, international trade and other 
business-service needs. With the decline of the New York money-center banks, 
this is even more the case now than in the '80s, when California bank assets 
grew twice as quickly as those of their Gotham rivals. 
</P>
<P>
But the pushers of "California declinism" don't rest their predictions merely 
on economics. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's School of Architecture and Urban Planning has been building the case for 
the idea of Los Angeles as the "capital of the Third World." Here and in other 
parts of the state, there is a widespread impression that massive foreign 
immigration is being accompanied by a swelling exodus of middle-class whites to 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
Belief in this scenario is widespread, if largely unspoken, in California's 
elite ranks. One top official of the Southern California Association of 
Governments recently complained that most newcomers to his region were 
"uneducated Latinos" unsuited for our developing high-tech economy. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration, particularly illegal, does pose long-term employment and social 
problems. But stories of a mass walkout are far off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, about as many people "immigrated" to the state from the rest of the 
country as from the rest of the planet. Among the leading net exporters of 
people were many of the states crowing loudest about the exodus of skilled 
professionals and businesses from California -- including Minnesota, Texas, 
Colorado and Washington State. The latter sent three times as many emigrants 
here as Californians moved there. Utah, the state Fortune described as the best 
place for finding employees in America, sent almost 4,000 more people to 
California than vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
California, then, still enjoys, nationally and abroad, widespread appeal as a 
place to live and work. Unfortunately, the state's leadership, compared with 
past eras, lacks a common vision that could inspire California to tap its 
latent energies. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, California must go beyond the approach of the George Deukmejian 
years, when planning didn't go much beyond building prisons and, whenever 
possible, expanding the executioner's franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than anything else, we need to return to the enlightened activism 
practiced by turn-of-the-century Republican Progressives and the Democratic 
administration of Edmund G. (Pat) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of playing the politics of racial division and class warfare, these 
leaders focused on creating the transportation and education infrastructure 
that allowed previous generations of newcomers achieve their own dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than mimicking the deepening malaise of the East Coast, California 
should strive to recover the spirit that built it -- "can-do" optimism. A 
revival of that spirit is our best hope of extending the California dream for 
the next generation.

CAN CALIFORNIA PROVIDE ALL THE BILINGUAL EDUCATION NEEDED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the 1980's, the numbers of students in California public schools who 
speak and write little English more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of these students speak Spanish. The growth of students needing 
help because of their English skills may slow over the next 10 years, but the 
critical shortage of trained bilingual teachers is likely to persist.

I have heard people say that they don't give money to homeless people because 
they'll just spend it on alcohol or drugs. What I do to get around this is to 
give fast-food gift certificates to street people who ask me for change. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that those I give them to are almost always happy to get them 
demonstrates that these people don't just want to get high.

SHEVARDNADZE'S RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times presented verbatim highlights of Shevardnadze's speech in which he 
clearly states that he is still a Communist (Part A, Dec. 21). Anyone who ever 
studied Communism must know that it is a doctrine that advocates the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. So, how can Shevardnadze resign his post 
because of a threat of a dictatorship? Or perhaps, is it just a dictatorship 
not to his liking?

JAPAN: THE CHECK'S IN THE MAIL; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS CRITICAL OF TOKYO'S LIGHTWEIGHT SHOWING IN GULF CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many people nowadays think of Japan as a society that can do no wrong. But 
Japan sometimes seems as if it can't do anything right when it comes to foreign 
policy. On that, the rich new kid on the block gets little respect. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Persian Gulf crisis. Having quietly retreated to the sidelines after 
an unsuccessful attempt to send troops to the gulf, Tokyo now is slowing its 
military spending while boosting its support of U.S. troops stationed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
That's good news on two fronts: Asian countries, wary of Tokyo's military 
buildup, are relieved. Closer to home, Washington had been pressing Tokyo to 
pick up a bigger share of the tab for maintaining 50,000 U.S. servicemen and 
women in Japan. That should ease the U.S. deficit, now burdened by the costs of 
Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's new five-year defense budget caps annual spending increases at 3%, 
compared to 5% before. Its share of expenses at U.S. bases will rise to 50% 
from 40%. With its defense spending pegged at 1% of a rising gross national 
product, the military budget has been growing. 
</P>
<P>
For all this, Tokyo can't escape the fire over Iraq. There's renewed criticism 
in Congress that Tokyo isn't doing its share. Of the promised $4 billion in 
nonmilitary aid and loans, Tokyo has provided about $830 million. The State 
Department and the Pentagon say this in line with expectations. But it's not $4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tokyo and Washington concede that Japan needs some visible presence in the 
gulf. Its attempt to send a 100-person volunteer medical team to the Mideast 
flopped, which speaks sadly of what Japanese citizens see as their world 
responsibilities. Domestic opposition killed the controversial U.N. peace 
cooperation bill that called for sending Japan's self-defense forces overseas. 
That's prohibited by the U.S.-inspired Japanese constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's attempts to fulfill international obligations have fallen short of 
expectations. A place in the new world order is eluding Japan. For a variety of 
reasons, that won't change overnight.

SHEVARDNADZE'S RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your front-page article "Bold Rightists Press Cause in Uneasy Moscow" (Dec. 22) 
is confusing in its terminology. Why is it that forces in the Soviet Union 
intent on retaining Communism are referred to as "rightists," "reactionaries," 
"right-wing" and "conservatives"? In the next sentence, these same people are 
referred to as "Communist militants," and we are told that "The right . . . 'is 
now composed of a very big part of the (Communist) party apparatus. . . .' " On 
the other hand, we find that people in the Soviet Union who wish to move toward 
democracy and the free market are called "liberals," "progressives" and "the 
left." 
</P>
<P>
People who are in favor of socialism, Communism, Marxism, etc., have always 
been, and should always be, identified as members of the "left." Extremists on 
the "right," however, have always been linked with fascism. This is not the 
time to switch references at will, depending on which country is being 
described.

SHEVARDNADZE'S RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jewish community is very concerned over the resignation of Shevardnadze. 
His actions reflect the deepening political crisis confronting the Soviet 
Union, which coincides with economic chaos and rising nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
His speech demonstrates how serious the situation is at this time. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has been seen as the primary agency within the Soviet 
government which has pushed for freer emigration and increased rights for the 
Soviet Jewish community. Shevardnadze and his associates have been the 
principal interlocutors with whom the Reagan and Bush administrations have 
dealt on issues related to Soviet Jewry. At the very least, the severity of the 
criticism of Soviet foreign policy, Shevardnadze's move and the rapidly 
deteriorating situation within the Soviet Union suggest that there could be 
some ominous clouds on the horizon for the progress made on religious freedom 
and the emigration of Soviet Jews.

WATER WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
LIQUID LOOPHOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) will try again next year to close 
a loophole through which big, mostly corporate, farms get cheap water that 
Congress meant only for family farms. 
</P>
<P>
His proposal, which sailed through the House last year by a 3-to-1 margin, 
makes sense in a couple of ways. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, the federal government got into the irrigation business in 
the early 1900s to encourage settlement of western lands. The only farms that 
could qualify for subsidized water were those of 160 acres or less. 
</P>
<P>
During the Great Depression, Washington took over California's Central Valley 
Project, because the state could not afford the dams and canals that turned the 
San Joaquin Valley into one of the world's richest farmlands. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Congress redefined a small farm as one under 960 acres. That left a 
loophole under which corporate farms carve themselves into 960-acre trusts or 
partnerships, each of which qualifies for subsidized water. 
</P>
<P>
The price of irrigation water depends on the costs of pumping it to a farm, but 
the most expensive subsidized water costs less than half what unsubsidized 
water costs. 
</P>
<P>
A second cause to cheer Miller's bill on is less direct, but no less important. 
California, in its fifth year of drought, must re-examine water pricing 
policies. The Metropolitan Water District did that recently when it changed the 
allotment to its water-agency customers and announced a penalty price for water 
that exceeds the allotment. Miller's bill would help spread the word, the pain, 
or both, to rural water users.

SHEVARDNADZE'S RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shevardnadze is a master of psychology. 
</P>
<P>
His dramatic resignation is forcing the Soviet legislature and the people to 
recognize the power of the military reactionaries. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation will surely force Gorbachev to resist the "boys with the 
colonel's epaulets" who are twisting his arm. The resignation was a master 
stroke.

THE WORLD SHOULD FEAR BITTER-ENDERS; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN AS MANDELA QUESTIONS SANCTIONS, THERE ARE THOSE WHO SEEK ONLY VENGEANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY JR., William F. Buckley Jr. is a syndicated columnist in 
New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Nov. 27, Michael Johns, the policy analyst for Third World and African 
affairs for the Heritage Foundation, testified before the U.N. Committee on 
Apartheid. He did not meet with a critical reception because Johns has for many 
years been a voluble critic of apartheid, so that it was not thought necessary 
to pass much time on the disavowalist rituals. What Johns pleaded for, and 
flatly predicted, was that the West would remove its sanctions against South 
Africa "as early as in February or March." 
</P>
<P>
This would have sounded very rash, except that from inside South Africa we hear 
now from Nelson Mandela, widely accepted as the patron saint of economic 
sanctions. What Mandela is saying is that perhaps the time has come to 
"reconsider" their appropriateness. For him to say even that much dilutes the 
moral absolutism of the call to sanctions, the kind of thing that Bishop Trevor 
Huddleston of Britain has made his militant cause for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Johns recited statistics that were not effectively challenged by the U.N. 
committee. He said that "combined unemployment and underemployment figures for 
South Africa's black majority now stand at 47%, largely because South Africa -- 
an export-driven economy -- has been denied access to many foreign markets." He 
then went on to cite the latest Gallup poll addressed to South Africa's black 
majority: Do you oppose sanctions as a means for ending apartheid? Opposed: 
82%. 
</P>
<P>
In South Africa today, most political forces are harnessed to move toward a 
general election. The exact shape of the new constitution is not yet 
established, but President Frederik W. de Klerk has said that it will include 
"a universal franchise: No domination (of one race by another); equality before 
an independent judiciary, (and) the protection of minorities as well as of 
individual rights." 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether the Boer voters of South Africa, who are the 
backbone of what is left of apartheid, will feel that the new constitution will 
secure their lives, liberty and property. There will be heavy debate within the 
white community when the time comes. 
</P>
<P>
This much we know, but we have not reflected on the debate that is bound to 
engage the black community. And that community's two principal leaders are 
Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha movement. And obviously Mandela is asking 
himself whether he wishes to engage in a voting contest against a black leader 
who opposes sanctions at a time when almost one-half of the black population is 
unemployed or underemployed. 
</P>
<P>
The events of the past year or two in South Africa have been almost as dramatic 
as those in Eastern Europe, and they are by no means unrelated to those events. 
As long as the ANC was thought by the white population and the white government 
to be the arm of a Soviet state systematically engaged in oppression, violence 
and subversion, the congress was rightly suppressed. The decision to free 
Mandela coincided with the conviction that the steam had run out of the 
communist revolution and that the ANC's continuing link to international 
communism was something on the order of sentimental historical formality, 
unrelated to any potential to do revolutionary damage. It could be said that 
when the wall went down in Berlin, so it did in South Africa, between the 
government and the primary black party of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
What we have to fear is the bitter-enders who would really prefer a 
non-peaceful end to the South African story. Three years ago in London, Bishop 
Huddleston, the honorary chairman of the anti-apartheid movement, said, "I 
would never suggest civil war is welcome; I say it is inevitable." The hatred 
of apartheid and of its sponsors has not been entirely appeased by the collapse 
of apartheid. There is sentiment among such as Bishop Huddleston for vengeance. 
One way in which that vengeance could be satisfied is by a constitution that 
has the effect of jeopardizing the security of white-owned property. Another 
would seek that civil war of which the bishop spoke. 
</P>
<P>
In the next months, the debate will open on sanctions. It will be interesting 
to see how the fundamentalists react. Will Harvard reinvest in South Africa? 
Will the Third World powers in the United Nations heed the revised judgment of 
Mandela? Or will he be branded an opportunistic Uncle Tom? Worth watching, 
particularly by those who do not believe that a civil war in South Africa would 
please anybody this side of the good bishop.

<TEXT>
<P>
My family and I went to Cook County Jail on Christmas morning, as we do every 
year. We went to share the promise of the Messiah's birth. We departed with our 
hearts heavy at the sight of hundreds of African-Americans sentenced to jail 
for crimes committed mostly against other African-Americans. They missed the 
hope of the new life. They're still locked out of the inn, condemned to the 
stable, bearing the scars of occupation and rejection. 
</P>
<P>
These men look physically strong, but they are emotionally wounded, casualties 
of hard lives with limited options. Too many African-Americans grow up 
sentenced to premature death. Young men in Bangladesh are more likely to reach 
the age of 40 than black males in Harlem. Almost half of all African-American 
babies are born into poverty, many scarred by low birth weight and inadequate 
nutrition and medical care. If they survive, they enter a culture that 
glorifies crime and violence. Homicide is the largest cause of death among 
young African-American males. 
</P>
<P>
There are more black men in prison than in college. For many, jail is a step up 
in life. It offers heat, food, medical care, a roof over their heads. They live 
with some discipline, without guns and with less chance of dying. 
</P>
<P>
There is a terrible sense of permissiveness about black-on-black crime. Black 
murder is becoming acceptable, unalarming, even among blacks. For example, when 
30 unarmed Ku Klux Klansmen marched in Washington a few weeks ago, they 
attracted 3,000 angry protesters, mostly black. It cost the police $900,000 to 
guard the Klan's right to march. If one of those Klan members had killed a 
black man in Washington, angry protests would have been ignited across the 
country. It would have been a federal crime. Yet the jails are filled not with 
Klansmen who kill blacks, but with blacks who kill blacks. These killings are 
accepted as routine. There are no marches against them. They are not a federal 
offense. They don't make the news. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot allow killing to become routine. When a black is killed by a black 
wearing a black jacket, it must be as offensive to the government and the 
community as when a black is killed by a white man wearing a white sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Who will stop the killing? In the end, only African-Americans can break this 
cycle of violence. During slavery, the burden of emancipation fell upon the 
enslaved. During colonialism, the colonized Ihad to fight for independence. 
During segregation, the protest movement was forged by the victims. To stop the 
killing and the drugs, the burden is on those who suffer the most. 
</P>
<P>
Against the odds, African-Americans must make tough life choices with few 
options. Many do without the acclaim that they deserve. For example, 
African-Americans are a disproportionate number of those brave men and women 
whose lives are on the line in the Saudi desert. The military option offers a 
way out. 
</P>
<P>
"You were born to lives with limited options," I told the Cook County inmates, 
"but that is no excuse. In football, when a runner is surrounded three yards 
short of a first down, his options are limited. It is unacceptable to run out 
of bounds or to run backward or to fumble the ball. We expect him to put his 
head down and drive, to make the hard choice. Killing each other is not the 
tough choice; escaping on drugs is not the tough choice." 
</P>
<P>
Too many of these strong young men have crushed egos, zero-based self-esteem. 
If "I ain't worth nothin' then my death means nothin'." Zero from zero makes 
zero. If "I ain't worth nothin', you ain't worth nothin' either," so shooting 
you or making a baby with you and abandoning it means nothing. Nothing from 
nothing makes nothing. Yet it is these men who are essential if the killing is 
to end. "You are the veterans and the victims of this culture of guns and 
drugs," I told them. "You are needed. The young headed this way need you to 
warn them to change direction. Your babies need you. Your mothers terrified of 
violence need you. I need you. If you were not drugged up or killing each 
other, you would be fighting for your dignity. If you won't claim it, no one 
will hand it to you." 
</P>
<P>
As the new year dawns, things are getting worse for the young born to hard 
lives. As a country we could offer help. We could stop the race-baiting that 
preys on the misery. We could make certain that jail does not offer the best 
housing, the only medical care or job training. In the end, however, no one 
will act to end the plague of black-on-black violence unless African-Americans 
resolve to end it. What better resolution for the new year?

Q &amp; A / DAVID FROST: BACK . . . ON AMERICAN TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British broadcast journalist David Frost is back in America and PBS has him. On 
Wednesday, the Emmy Award-winner kicks off his new series, " . . . Talking with 
David Frost," with an in-depth interview with President Bush and his wife, 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Talking With David Frost" will consist of six monthly specials. 
Subsequent interview subjects include former British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher and actor-comedian Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, in good spirits despite suffering from a bad cold, talked with Susan 
King about his new series via telephone from his office in London. 
</P>
<P>
It's great to have you back on American television. 
</P>
<P>
It's very, very exciting. It's what I want to be doing. The long form or the 
hour-long interview does seem to be something of an endangered species, and 
it's a terrific opportunity because a PBS hour is a real hour -- or at least 57 
1/2 minutes -- which is longer than a commercial hour. 
</P>
<P>
That does give you the emotional elbowroom to try and draw people out. You want 
to make news when you can, of course, and make sense all of the time, but the 
thing that fascinates me is what makes people tick. 
</P>
<P>
Do you tape several hours with a subject and then edit it down to an hour? 
</P>
<P>
If you can do two hours basically to produce a one-hour program that is pretty 
good. Of course, you can do more, but in general it's good to do a lot of your 
editing before you do the interview rather than afterward. Obviously, in 
certain circumstances, if you are dealing with someone who is shy and doesn't 
give interviews, you might want to let the tape roll a bit longer. 
</P>
<P>
What are your interviewing techniques? 
</P>
<P>
You can't know too much about anybody. Also, you want to know what they have 
said before, so you know when they are saying something for the first time. And 
obviously, you want to find a new angle or facet as well. 
</P>
<P>
I think what makes an interview work is that you turn it into a conversation 
and a dialogue and that depends on eye contact and just sort of rapport. 
</P>
<P>
Then you are asking questions that interest the person enough to make them want 
to give as good an answer as possible. That gets them absorbed in the 
conversation, so they forget the artificiality of having lights in the room or 
whatever it is. 
</P>
<P>
You are opening the series with an interview with President and Mrs. Bush. Are 
politicians more reticent to talk than actors? 
</P>
<P>
One of the interesting things President Bush shares with Margaret Thatcher is 
that they give a straight answer to a question. It is very refreshing because 
there are many politicians who play safe. The most fearless thing they will do 
is come out against road accidents or attack litter. Ask them their favorite 
color and they will say plaid. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Bush can do it is because he is so well-briefed and up to 
speed on anything you throw at him. 
</P>
<P>
There are a plethora of talk shows on American TV and many are sensationalized. 
Are you dismayed as to what has happened to talk shows? 
</P>
<P>
I think fads and fashions come and go . . . the sensationalized chat show is a 
phase that won't last very long. 
</P>
<P>
I love diversity and variety, and in this new series " . . . Talking with David 
Frost" we are going to try and have that diversity. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Talking With David Frost" premieres Wednesday at 8 p.m. on Channel 28, 
9 p.m. on Channel 50.

SIMI VALLEY: THE RESIDENTS SAY TRASH UNDER THE LOTS IS DECOMPOSING, CAUSING THE

<P>
Patricia and Doyle Boatwright looked forward to the day they could sell their 
Simi Valley house and retire to Oklahoma, where they could be near their 
children and other family members. 
</P>
<P>
But whether they will be able to recoup their investment and realize their 
dream will depend on a judge and jury. 
</P>
<P>
The Boatwrights and the owners of six other Simi Valley homes are suing 
Larwin-Southern California Inc. and its subcontractors for $1.4 million plus an 
unspecified amount in punitive damages for allegedly failing to disclose to 
them that their houses in the 1100 block of North Currier Avenue were built 
atop a garbage dump. The homeowners contend that trash under their houses was 
never removed and over the years has decomposed, resulting in shifting and 
sinking foundations that have caused major structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners allege that Larwin knew about the dump but deliberately 
concealed the information from home buyers. Larwin attorneys, however, said the 
developer had hired subcontractors to remove the debris and was convinced that 
this had been done when it began building the 75-house tract in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Larwin, which is based in Los Angeles, the suit names soil 
consultants Robert Stone and Associates Inc., based in Woodland Hills; grading 
contractor C.A. Rasmussen Inc. of Simi Valley; the defunct engineering firm of 
Jensen-Thompson Associates Inc., formerly based in Ventura; the city of Simi 
Valley and the Simi Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
After years of delays and several attempts to settle the matter out of court, 
the case has finally been scheduled for trial in Ventura County Superior Court 
on Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was originally filed in 1986, about a year after structural 
problems at the houses began to appear, said Mark Herskovitz, one of the 
attorneys representing the plaintiffs. Besides the Boatwrights, the plaintiffs 
include Albert and Nina Obuch; Ronald and Linda Hoglund; Robert and Betty 
McBride; Bahauddin and Kamellah Durrani; Boris and Elaine Pribich; and Sheldon 
Ksionzky. 
</P>
<P>
Herskovitz said the area where the houses were built used to be a ravine, which 
nearby farmers used as a dumping ground. He said a soil consultant hired by the 
homeowners has found metal pipe, bricks, plastic, glass bottles, aluminum cans, 
barbed wire and various farm implements buried 10 to 15 feet below each of the 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything the farmers had no use for, they dumped in the ravine," Herskovitz 
said, gesturing toward a wheelbarrow piled high with debris that had recently 
been dug up in the Boatwrights' back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Herskovitz said the developer was required by law to have all the trash removed 
before starting to build. Instead, he said, the trash was covered with a thin 
layer of topsoil on which the houses were then built. 
</P>
<P>
But Ronald White, a Larwin attorney, said the developer's original soil and 
grading consultant said he had removed the trash before construction. 
</P>
<P>
"All the reports reflect that they did everything to professional standards and 
conduct," White said. "The records show that they did the work, and we relied 
on that." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the soil and grading consultants did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
White acknowledged that the foundations of the houses are deteriorating and 
that trash apparently has been found under each of the plaintiffs' dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no denying that the homes are suffering distress," he said. "But I 
strongly disagree with the characterization that there was some kind of 
intentional cover-up. There was no fraud. No one intentionally concealed the 
debris." 
</P>
<P>
White said the developer has offered to give the homeowners enough money -- a 
total of $350,000 -- to repair their houses, but they have declined to accept 
the payment. 
</P>
<P>
"That's insulting," Patricia Boatwright said of the developer's offer. "That is 
totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Herskovitz and his clients said the houses are beyond repair and need to be 
rebuilt. But first, they said, the houses need to be razed and the trash 
underneath excavated. 
</P>
<P>
Herskovitz said debris from the dump is apparently concentrated in one area of 
the neighborhood, and that is why only a few houses along North Currier Avenue 
have been affected. The lawsuit accuses the city and the Simi Valley Unified 
School District of contributing to the subsidence of the houses by continuing 
to allow the use of a drainage ditch that runs along the west end of nearby 
Madera Elementary School. The suit says runoff from the ditch empties into an 
open field directly behind the houses. 
</P>
<P>
Herskovitz said water from the ditch has accelerated decomposition of the 
debris under the dwellings, thereby contributing to their shifting and sinking 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
Korman Ellis, an attorney for the school district, said that because the school 
and the drainage channel were there long before the houses were built, the 
plaintiffs' argument has little merit. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like building your home next to a sewer or an airport, then complaining 
that it stinks or it's too noisy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dilando, another attorney for the homeowners, said the city and school 
district are still liable because they have refused to rechannel the water from 
the drainage ditch despite the homeowners' complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Boatwright said she and her husband bought their two-story, 
six-bedroom house in the clean, well-tended middle-class subdivision in 1984 
for $137,500. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time we bought the house, it was appraised at $144,000, so we thought 
we were getting a bargain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
About a year after the couple moved in, dozens of hairline cracks on walls and 
ceilings throughout the house began to appear, she said. Since then, the cracks 
have led to the separation of walls, cracked slabs and sloping floors. Damage 
in most of the houses is similar, with some cracks measuring more than an inch 
across. 
</P>
<P>
Boatwright, 55, said she and her husband, who is 64, have had to delay their 
plans to move to Oklahoma. She said her husband, an engineering manager at 
Litton Industries in Moorpark, will keep working until the case with Larwin is 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
She said the couple do not want to think what will happen if they lose the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have an answer," she said, trying to hold back tears. "We don't have 
time to recover from this. If we were in our 40s or 30s, it would be different. 
But my husband can't continue to work forever." 
</P>
<P>
"You work all your life, and you got all you money tied up in your house . . . 
it's tough to lose it," Doyle Boatwright said. "It's tough at 64." 
</P>
<P>
The couple said they feel trapped because they cannot even borrow against their 
house, much less rent it or sell it. They are also concerned about their safety 
and what effect an earthquake might have on their house as it continues to 
deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
They said they hope the lawsuit will prevent the same thing from happening to 
others in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you live in a situation like this, you can't appreciate what it's 
like," Patricia Boatwright said. "We never want to see anyone go through this, 
ever."

NAVY TAKES STEPS TO ERASE FOOTPRINTS; 
</P>
<P>
NATURE: AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM IS UNDER WAY TO RETURN MUCH OF SAN NICOLAS ISLAND 
TO ITS PRISTINE STATE AND PRESERVE ITS FRAGILE ECOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A tiny island fox, once a cherished pet of aboriginal Indians on San Nicolas 
Island, has emerged as a symbol of the Navy's effort to restore the desert 
island to its pristine state. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of many threatened creatures that the Navy wants to bring into 
balance with the 225 Navy personnel at the island's missile tracking station. 
About 65 miles southwest of Point Mugu, the island is also home to the 
threatened island night lizard and provides rare breeding grounds for the 
Western gull, the Brandt cormorant and protected sea lions and seals. 
</P>
<P>
With no natural predators to fear, the tame foxes spent years crowding around a 
slop trough behind the Navy's galley, waiting for table scraps. Ecologists 
stopped the daily feeding in the mid-1970s when they realized the handouts had 
swelled the fox population far beyond what the 3-by-9-mile island could 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Forced to return to a diet of insects, vegetation and bird eggs, hundreds of 
the red, furry foxes died of starvation. Only recently have their numbers 
returned to a high of about 800. 
</P>
<P>
The ecologists fear that the island fox, a unique subspecies of its mainland 
cousin, may face another threat introduced by mankind. Averaging only four 
pounds, the fox has disappeared from parts of the island inhabited by 
once-domestic cats that have reverted to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no documentation they kill foxes, but they are twice their size," said 
Ronald Dow, chief ecologist at the Point Mugu Naval Air Station who also is 
responsible for the island's environment. "A big fox is five pounds, and we 
have found cats that are 12 and 13 pounds. And the cats are totally 
carnivorous." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Dow hopes the fox can outsmart the feral cat, or at least outlive it. 
</P>
<P>
He and other Navy ecologists have decided to concentrate on other aspects of an 
ambitious program to return much of the island to its natural state and 
minimize the Navy's imprint on the island's fragile and unique ecology. 
</P>
<P>
In coming months, the Navy will close its landfill on the island. It will burn 
paper waste and recycle the rest of the trash produced, dispatching it aboard 
barges to the mainland. The Navy also has plans to engage the California 
Conservation Corps to sweep the island for miles of wire cable, abandoned 
building materials and other military refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the rusting shrapnel and other hardware is left over from an earlier 
era when the Navy had other plans for the island and the Army used one end as 
an artillery range. "We've got a lot of stuff to clean up," said Lt. Cmdr. 
Steven Buske, commanding officer of the island naval station. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most painstaking tasks planned by ecologists, Dow and his staff 
hope to eradicate every non-native plant from the island and stop new species 
from arriving or taking root. Principally, they want to protect rare plants, 
including four species found only on San Nicolas Island, from being choked out 
by more aggressive plants from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, senior ecologist Thomas W. Keeney uprooted a tumbleweed 
near the ramp for unloading barges from the mainland. "They come in on the 
tires of trucks and equipment," Keeney said, looking at the tumbleweed, also 
known as Russian thistle. "Once Russian thistle gets started in a windy area, 
it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
Keeney said he has proposed that trucks and equipment from the mainland be 
cleaned before being allowed on barges headed for the island. 
</P>
<P>
The ecologists have plans to fill in some deep gullies caused by runoff from 
the Navy's 10,000-foot runway and other projects. They also hope to stop 
erosion by replanting barren land overgrazed by herds of sheep in the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries. To hold the soil and propagate rare plants, they plan 
to collect the seeds of native flora, grow them in nurseries and reintroduce 
the seedlings in new patches. 
</P>
<P>
Although the island is already restricted to Navy personnel and invited guests, 
ecologists hope to add further restrictions on breeding grounds for 25,000 
California sea lions, 15,000 elephant seals and 1,000 harbor seals. Any human 
presence, they said, causes seals and sea lions to stampede for the water, 
abandoning -- if not trampling -- their pups during the winter pupping season. 
</P>
<P>
They also want to prevent the island's few visitors from disturbing the nests 
of the Brandt cormorant or the Western gull -- two birds known to abandon their 
young when startled. 
</P>
<P>
To some Navy employees, the ecologists' high-minded plans seem out of place for 
a Navy base that tests the latest and most deadly missiles. But support for 
their environmental work stretches to the top, with each commander at Point 
Mugu's Pacific Missile Test Center in recent years voicing heightened concern 
about the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. William E. Newman, ranking officer on the base, has emphasized his 
commitment to reinforce the Navy policy of good stewardship of its natural 
treasures. "Let it be known that those are my personal sea lions out there," 
Newman told base officials when he assumed command last month. 
</P>
<P>
That mandate also extends to conserving Indian relics on San Nicolas Island. 
The 16-member environmental staff includes a resident archeologist who has 
marked and catalogued 95% of the Indian sites on the island. 
</P>
<P>
"The earliest site we have out here is 6000 BC," archeologist Steven Schwartz 
said. "On the mainland we don't have any well-documented sites earlier than 
3000 BC." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the mainland, the island has excellent research potential because 
its desert climate preserves artifacts, and it has no gophers or other 
burrowing animals to disturb buried relics, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about the Nicolenos, the tribe that kept foxes as pets when it 
inhabited the island. Despite the tribe's mystery, the plight of its last 
surviving member is well known. The woman, who was marooned alone there for 18 
years, provided the inspiration for the popular children's book "Island of the 
Blue Dolphins." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, San Nicolas was chosen as a new home for a colony of sea otters. 
Introduced to the island by the U.S. Department of Fish and Game, the otters 
were relocated as part of a program to preserve the species by establishing an 
independent colony. It is feared that the main otter population between Point 
Conception and Monterey could be wiped out in the event of an oil spill.

COUNTY LOANS STRIKE A BLOW AGAINST HOMELESSNESS; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: THE 4-YEAR-OLD PROGRAM, WHICH HAS A 45% DEFAULT RATE, HAS 
HELPED 174 PEOPLE FIND OR KEEP HOUSING.

<P>
John Reyes thought he had no place to turn when he was temporarily laid off 
from work recently at a carwash in Simi Valley and his landlady started to 
pressure him about the rent that was more than a month late. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes said he wanted to ask his family for help, but they were also going 
through hard times and could not spare the $900 he needed. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, who has a wife and two young boys, appealed to welfare officials for 
help and learned from them about a county program that provides no-interest 
loans to prevent evictions and to help homeless people pay for such move-in 
costs as security deposits. 
</P>
<P>
After Reyes filled out several applications and completed an interview, 
officials with the Ventura County Homeless Revolving Assistance Program wrote 
him a check for $900, which he used to pay his first month's rent on a new 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"I was relieved," he said. "I was not sure where I was going to go." 
</P>
<P>
Reyes is one of 174 county residents since 1986 who have received about 
$111,000 in loans and grants through the program operated by the Ventura County 
Commission on Human Concerns. 
</P>
<P>
That the program is still assisting people such as Reyes is a surprise, 
according to state and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
They point out that a program in Orange County, which was used as a model for 
the Ventura County program, failed in 1987 with a 75% default rate and $90,000 
in outstanding loans. A similar program in Placer County is still operating but 
struggling with a default rate of about 80%, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
While the default rate for the Ventura County program is about 45%, state and 
county social services officials say that any loan program for the needy that 
sustains a default rate of 50% or less can be considered a success. 
</P>
<P>
The average loan is about $650, said John Servis, a supervisor who helps manage 
the program. To qualify, applicants must provide financial statements, 
references and a monthly budget, including an income projection and an 
anticipated expense budget, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants are then interviewed by a county employee before the loan is 
considered by a loan committee. The entire process takes about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Servis said if a person defaults on a loan, the loan committee can turn the 
matter over to a collection agency or forgive the loan altogether. There are no 
interest penalties for a default or a late payment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The counties of Ventura and Placer are the only two agencies that use state 
grants to provide no-interest loans to fight homelessness, said May Waite, 
programs operations manager for the State Department of Economic Opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
But only the Ventura County program can be defined as a success, Waite said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good point is that it doesn't just forestall evictions, it avoids them," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Waite said she doesn't know how many cities in the state use local funds to 
operate similar loan programs. But because such efforts have had poor track 
records, Waite said she believes many cities shy away from operating loan 
programs for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Housing Authority in Orange County decided in December against 
operating a loan program and instead began a grant program to help homeless and 
low-income people avoid evictions and pay move-in costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We just knew that the default rate was high," Nan Huff, the city's housing 
operations coordinator, said. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Mendoza, a senior staff analyst for the Orange County Community Service 
Agency, said she recommended that the Orange County Board of Supervisors reject 
a proposal to begin such a loan program. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just seen too many programs go under," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Homeless Revolving Assistance Program hasn't always run 
smoothly. When the county initiated the effort in 1986, the loan program had a 
default rate of about 75%, Servis said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, county officials have modified the loan qualifications to 
reduce the default rate to 45%, Servis said. Among the modifications was a 
change to expand eligibility guidelines to include anyone making up to 80% of 
the median income of Ventura County, Servis said. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, applicants had to be below the 50% mark to qualify, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Servis said the application process has become much tougher over the years and 
sometimes includes co-signers. 
</P>
<P>
The default rate has also been reduced because cities such as Ojai and Oxnard 
have this year donated money to be used solely as grants for the needy, Servis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The most common recipients of the one-time-only loans are single mothers, 
low-income families or elderly people on fixed incomes, said Christy Bell, a 
resource developer for the county. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Delfoss, a single mother who recently lost her job as an insurance 
customer service representative, said an $800 loan from the program helped her 
avoid being evicted from her residence in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The program saved my home because my landlord wanted my money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Delfoss said the loan gave her an opportunity to look for a part-time job and 
enroll in classes at a local community college to improve her employment 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bell, loan applicants are considered homeless if they live with 
relatives or rent a room in a motel. Most applicants, such as Reyes and 
Delfoss, request money to pay rent because they have been financially caught 
off-guard by a one-time crisis, such as a layoff or a death in the family, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The money used for the loans comes from the cities and the county, which 
annually receive state grants to help fight homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities, such as Oxnard, Ojai and Simi Valley, have required that the money 
be offered only to residents of those cities. Servis said the program now has 
about $37,000 for residents in Simi Valley, Camarillo and Thousand Oaks.

AVOID ROAD TO RUIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a terrible shame that the lives of two more individuals have been taken on 
the train tracks of North County. The heartfelt sadness and support of every 
San Diego County resident surely go out to their families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
But for public officials to take this, or any other, opportunity to seek $736 
million in our money to build underpasses and other "grade separations" can 
only be viewed as a monument to the arrogance and sleepiness of those in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Who are those officials who have failed to notice that our governments at every 
level have spent themselves, and each one of us as their sources of funds, into 
undeclared bankruptcy over recent years. Can they be so asleep at the switch as 
to go ever onward down the same road to ruin, learning nothing and making no 
changes as they go? 
</P>
<P>
Surely some pedestrian barriers and signs would solve these troubles for about 
$735 million less than those officials have proposed spending. 
</P>
<P>
This rail project is another example of short-sighted, self-inflating 
politicians and bureaucrats at work.

RILEY'S SHORT LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to Tony Perry's column about the dogs from the pound 
who "march for their lives" at the La Jolla Christmas Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the claim made by Sally Hazzard, the director of the Department of 
Animal Control, "mistakes" like the one that killed Riley are not the 
exception, but the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Our organization regularly receives complaints from angry and despairing 
members of the public who have had bad experiences at the pound. "Mistakes" at 
the pound are many and varied; ranging from owned animals put to death before 
their "time is up," to animals who have "holds" placed on them, like Riley, but 
thanks to computer error, get the needle and death instead of a loving home and 
life. 
</P>
<P>
At the county pound, decisions are made based on cost, not on caring; and 
"mistakes" are repeatedly blamed on "computer error." It's time for a change: 
to make animal control humane, and a pound become a shelter, management must 
operate out of compassion. In spite of the valiant volunteer efforts of Friends 
of County Animal Shelters to improve conditions and increase adoptions, our 
pound continues to be the shame of San Diego.

WAIT IN LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your "Anti-Immigrant Sentiment Protested" article of Dec. 10, you only once 
stated that the two major groups trying to bring the border problem to 
attention in Washington, D.C., are concerned about "illegal immigration," not 
those who do the paperwork and wait in line like other honest citizens of all 
nations of the world. 
</P>
<P>
I give "open arms" to any immigrant who enters this country through the border 
checkpoints for people, autos, aircraft or ships. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone entering this country illegally, I support giving the chance to plead 
his or her case to the government as to why he or she had to enter the country 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
But I also support the right of this nation to throw out all those who fail to 
register with the U.S. government after they enter illegally or after a hearing 
are found without a defense in why they should be allowed to stay in this 
country when millions of other honest citizens of all nations of the world wait 
in line.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
</P>
<P>
3 CHURCHES TO JOIN IN WORLD PEACE PRAYER

Three Ventura County churches plan a local gathering in connection with a 
worldwide prayer for peace early Monday at Camarillo Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
The World Peace Prayer was started five years ago by John Randolph Price of the 
Quartus Foundation, a nondenominational research group in Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo Church of Religious Science, the Center Church of Religious 
Science, and the Ventura County Church of Religious Science have joined the 
event since its beginning in 1986. The Rev. William Curtiss of the Camarillo 
Church said about 2 billion people worldwide are expected to participate in 
this year's prayer at noon, Greenwich Mean Time, which is 4 a.m. in California. 
</P>
<P>
Curtiss said that because of the Persian Gulf situation, he expects a bigger 
crowd this year than the 200 to 300 people who showed up in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Curtiss said the prayer supplies an spiritual element that had been missing in 
world politics before its inception. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what brought the Berlin Wall down," Curtiss said. "I think that's a 
direct result of that." 
</P>
<P>
Curtiss said people will gather at 3:30 a.m. for the event, which also will 
feature a music program and refreshments. Curtiss said the prayer is 
nondenominational and the public is invited. JAMES E. FOWLER

AN ONLY CHILD NO LONGER; 
</P>
<P>
AT AGE OF 48, CARSON WOMAN LEARNS SHE HAS A BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For 48 years, Joan Reiner thought she was an only child. 
</P>
<P>
Then, four months ago, she received a letter from a man in Wisconsin who said 
he believed that she was his long-lost sister. Until then, she hadn't even 
known that she had been adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read it, I just couldn't talk," said Reiner, a Carson parks and 
recreation supervisor. "I was devastated. My husband comes in and asks what's 
wrong and I just pointed at the letter." 
</P>
<P>
The letter, written by Patrick Benish of Prairie du Chien, Wis., had been 
forwarded to Reiner by Social Security officials. Enclosed was a copy of a 
10-page letter, written by an aunt in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
The aunt's letter, found by Benish's daughter five years ago in an old book, 
detailed how two children born during World War II to a woman named Bernice 
Thorpe had been taken at different times from their mother by California 
authorities and placed for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Although Benish had learned three years earlier that he had a sister, the 
letter gave him clues that might help him to find her. Benish, who knew he had 
been adopted, recognized himself as Patrick Thorpe, one of the children 
mentioned in the letter. The other, Norma Jean Thorpe, would be his sister. 
</P>
<P>
Benish had made some earlier inquiries about his sister but now he began his 
search in earnest. His five-year quest finally ended on Aug. 31, when Reiner 
received his letter. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, who has two grown sons and an adopted 17-year-old daughter, was at 
first reluctant to call Benish. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had all these questions," Reiner recalls. "How did this happen? When 
you're somebody for 48 years, and you find out that you even had another name, 
how do you know this is true?" 
</P>
<P>
Reiner overcame her initial anxieties and exchanged phone calls and letters 
with Benish and with two half-brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Reiner met Benish for the first time when he flew to 
California with his wife and one of their three children. They had an emotional 
reunion in the front yard of Reiner's Carson home. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first met, we just sat there and cried for about a half-hour," said 
Benish, contacted by telephone at his home. "We didn't even go in the house." 
</P>
<P>
Benish, now 51, and his family visited with Reiner for about a week, meeting 
her children and filling in missing pieces of family history. Benish brought 
Reiner a photo album, containing pictures of their mother and two 
half-brothers. Reiner has met one of the half-brothers, a Marine gunnery 
sergeant who was recently ordered to the Middle East. The other lives in Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still hard to believe," Reiner says. "It's like I'm going to wake up and 
it's just a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said the experience has also enhanced her relationship with her 
daughter, who was adopted when she was 9 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"It's made us closer." 
</P>
<P>
The saga began to unfold in January, 1985, when Benish's daughter, Wendy, was 
cleaning out her grandfather's garage in Prairie du Chien. An avid reader, she 
said she was struck by a box of old books. One of the books, a novel called 
"The Silver Chalice," contained folded-up letters. Among them was the 10-page 
letter, dated July 17, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
It was addressed to Benish's adopted mother, who also happened to be his aunt, 
and was written by another aunt. She described how state authorities had ruled 
that Thorpe was an unfit mother. 
</P>
<P>
Although Benish was told when he was 12 that he was adopted, it was later in 
life that he found out the circumstances of his adoption. He also learned that 
he had two half-brothers, born to his mother in a later marriage. In 1982, he 
learned that he had a sister but no one could tell him how to find her. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Benish found the letter, his adoptive mother had died. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought the letter to my father and he said, 'Let it be,' " Benish said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Benish was in touch with his natural mother a few times over the 
years, she was unable to help him, and she died a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
But Benish says he was determined to find out the truth. 
</P>
<P>
The letter from his aunt said his sister had been baptized at St. Aloysius 
Church in Los Angeles and that her name was changed to Joan Yvonne Dodson when 
she was adopted. So, Benish tried calling all the Dodsons listed in Los 
Angeles-area phone directories. 
</P>
<P>
It was a futile effort. Joan's adoptive parents, Elmer and Vera Dodson, had 
lived in Compton, but Vera Dodson had remarried after her husband, a well-to-do 
executive with Texaco, died in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Benish began his search, Reiner had married and was living in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, Benish tried to locate his sister through the Social Security 
Administration. Because of the circumstances, agency officials agreed to 
forward a note from Benish along with the letter from their aunt. But they 
insisted on several conditions: The agency would not disclose Reiner's address, 
nor would officials tell Benish if she had received the letters. It would be up 
to Reiner to determine whether to reply. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner received the letter on Aug. 31, when she returned home from vacation. At 
first, she thought it was a cruel joke. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like reading a book, and you really get into the book, but you're the 
main character," Reiner said. "I didn't know what to believe." 
</P>
<P>
Her adoptive mother had died in 1983. Reiner called her mother's cousin, who 
confirmed the letter's contents, but advised Reiner not to call. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said she spent a sleepless night wrestling with her emotions. But she 
called Benish the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
Said Reiner: "His daughter answered and asked, 'Who's calling?' I said, 'My 
name's Joan Yvonne Dodson,' and she started screaming, 'It's her, it's her.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, now 49, says the news of her adoption was difficult to accept. 
</P>
<P>
"The first month, it was very, very hard for me to talk about because my whole 
life was just turned completely upside down," Reiner said. "But the letter 
helped me understand that somebody wanted me and cared about who got me. And it 
was a good choice of parents. But it is very strange."

JUE SALUTED ON LEAVING HAWTHORNE'S TOP JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it had been left up to Hawthorne City Manager R. Kenneth Jue, he would have 
walked out of City Hall quietly when he retires Monday, spiriting away nearly a 
quarter-century of memories in a few boxes. 
</P>
<P>
But the self-effacing Jue wasn't allowed to slip away without a fitting 
tribute. At a banquet Thursday at the Cockatoo Inn, nearly 300 co-workers and 
friends honored the man who has run the city for the past 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Jue, 58, grew up in Hawthorne and never strayed farther than Inglewood 
throughout his career. He came back to Hawthorne as director of public works in 
1967 and was promoted to city manager 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
At the fete Thursday, Jue was showered with proclamations, embarrassed by a 
belly dancer and celebrated with a heartfelt rendition of "Auld Lang Syne." 
</P>
<P>
Speakers attributed his longevity in a notoriously unstable line of work to his 
lightheartedness and apparent lack of ego. 
</P>
<P>
In his 24 years with the city, Jue saw Hawthorne change from a sleepy, 
residential town with about 48,000 predominantly white residents to an 
ethnically mixed city with a population of about 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
Once evenly divided between single-family homes and apartments, Hawthorne saw 
its stock of apartment units grow by 70% in the 1970s and 1980s. With higher 
densities came higher crime and a greater need for public services. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hawthorne remains a blue-collar community with income levels slightly 
above the county average, money spent on city services has increased more than 
500%, from $4 million in 1966 to $25 million today. 
</P>
<P>
Associates praise Jue for his stewardship in the face of those changes. 
</P>
<P>
In his dual roles as city manager and head of the city's redevelopment agency, 
Jue oversaw three projects that combined commercial and residential 
redevelopment. He helped the city win economic development grants that paid for 
the new City Hall. He also played a significant role in upgrading Hawthorne 
Boulevard -- the city's commercial heart -- and creating its Senior Citizens 
Center. In 1989, he was named Citizen of the Year by the Hawthorne Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Jue always kept the door of his office open. He enjoyed the support of the 
police and firefighters' unions and the Hawthorne Municipal Employees Assn. 
Among his legacies, many say, is a close-knit network of highly paid, competent 
department heads who work well together. 
</P>
<P>
But detractors say Jue's easy-going, self-effacing demeanor created a 
leadership vacuum at City Hall. They accuse him of running a fat operation, 
rewarding old friends with jobs and depending too much on redevelopment rather 
than cutting expenditures to pay the city's bills. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jue was personally well liked, critics say he lacked the political 
clout and credibility to win public support for revenue-boosting tax measures 
he proposed. As examples, they point to the failure of three tax measures he 
and the council supported over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Jue's style was "not making waves, going with the flow, letting things drift," 
said George Walter, who headed the November campaign against Proposition D, a 
property tax measure to raise money for more police. "As far as I'm concerned, 
he wasn't an aggressive city manager." 
</P>
<P>
But others praise Jue for bringing the city through political turmoil. After 
voters recalled three City Council members in 1982, Jue "was able to keep 
things going and able to come through it working with everyone," Mayor Betty J. 
Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Jue, who earned $120,000 this year and will retire with a pension of about 
$76,000 a year, will be succeeded by Public Works Director James H. Mitsch. 
</P>
<P>
Jue's recommendation of Mitsch, with whom he owns an Inglewood apartment 
building, is one of several appointments that critics describe as cronyism. 
Supporters call it nurturing talent within the city. 
</P>
<P>
Many said Jue's ability to hide his emotions allowed him to provide leadership 
despite an often contentious five-member City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"He consults everyone, makes everybody feel good that they're part of the 
plan," Ainsworth said. "He appears to be humble, but nobody gets ahead of him. 
When somebody has thought of something, you can tell he has already thought of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Arseneau, president of the Hawthorne Municipal Employees Assn., is another 
fan of Jue. "He's the number one dude in my book," Arseneu said. "There's 
nothing bad you could ever say about the guy." 
</P>
<P>
But the problems of the city loom large. 
</P>
<P>
Although sales taxes provide the largest portion of the city's revenue, its 
biggest commercial center, Hawthorne Plaza, is not thriving. 
</P>
<P>
The mall, which opened the year Jue became city manager, was expected to 
demonstrate the benefits of redevelopment. But it never met those expectations. 
Plans to build two office buildings near Hawthorne Plaza collapsed, and the 
mall was left with a largely empty parking lot, crime problems and 
disappointing sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling was that the mall would be a catalyst to get other redevelopment 
going, but it never really did," Jue admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he defends the three other redevelopment projects started during his 
term as city manager, which are in various planning stages. He says 
redevelopment is a painless way of increasing revenue and the city's "only 
means of overcoming our economic shortfalls." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Plaza's mixed success left the city with a no-growth budget in 
1989-90. The city is unable to beef up its Police Department, despite a rising 
crime rate and one of the lowest ratios of police officers to residents of any 
city in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of those problems, some, such as Councilman Steven Andersen, would 
have welcomed a little more aggressiveness from Jue. 
</P>
<P>
"Kenny tends to be non-confrontational -- even his closest friends will tell 
you that," Andersen said. "The positive is that Kenny allows the council 
majority to make the decision and work it out. The negative is sometimes you 
need to be confrontational" to get things done. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Hawthorne since the age of 5, Jue attended Leuzinger High School. 
His father, who emigrated from Canton, owned a grocery store. His uncle grew 
asparagus and corn on a 150-acre lot that is now part of Hawthorne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
After a knee injury kept him out of the Navy in 1951, Jue became a civil 
engineer. He worked in Inglewood as an assistant engineer before taking over 
the Public Works Department in Hawthorne in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, stocky bachelor, Jue became known as an honest, reliable, hard-working 
official who always returned phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
He is extremely private. Except for a few plaques recalling victories by the 
city softball team, his office walls were always bare. His desk was all 
business; he stacked it with papers and reports, but kept photographs of his 
family and his St. Bernard hidden in a drawer. 
</P>
<P>
But among his friends in the Rotary Club, where he has been an active member 
since 1967, Jue is known for being able to make people laugh. And friends who 
share his passion for motorcycles say he sheds his quiet exterior when he 
mounts his Honda Gold Wing, which he hopes to ride around the perimeter of the 
United States after he retires. 
</P>
<P>
Several city department heads, asked to come up with embarrassing anecdotes at 
Jue's retirement party, found it difficult to roast their even-tempered boss. 
</P>
<P>
But several council members obliged, joking that Jue's endurance was due to 
sleep apnea, a disorder that occasionally caused him to nod off during council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When council members Andersen, Charles Bookhammer and David M. York greeted him 
at the retirement bash with a chorus of snores, Jue joked about the affliction, 
which was diagnosed in 1983. "I'll have you know that sleep apnea is an asset 
for a city manager," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the party, attended by officials from around the South Bay, Jue 
was presented with a set of golf clubs and a $200 gift certificate for a golf 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Jue, who had told friends that he looked forward to golfing during his 
retirement, thanked those who organized the event, saying he was overwhelmed by 
the warmth of their friendship. "Believe you me, I will never forget this 
evening," he said. "I really don't think I deserve it."

TRANSPORTATION: THE OLD ANSWERS -- MORE ROADS AND MASS TRANSIT -- MAY HAVE 
REACHED A DEAD END. BRAINSTORMERS HAVE COME UP WITH SOME SURPRISING TWISTS AND 
TURNS TO UNTANGLE OUR URBAN GRIDLOCK.

The fanciest new ideas for making our lives better may surprise you. 
</P>
<P>
They include no place to park, lots of apartment houses and a ban on 
neighborhood parks that lure families onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
These and other planners' dreams were on view earlier this month at UC Irvine. 
Transportation experts from around the country met under the auspices of the 
National Academy of Sciences to swap cures for an ill that is hardly new to the 
San Fernando Valley -- the fact that Americans are driving more all the time, 
and neither road-building nor mass transportation seems able to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year since 1960, the federal government has consistently forecast a 2.5% 
increase in driving, and the actual increase has consistently been 3.5%," Alan 
E. Pisarski, a transportation consultant and author of "Commuting in America," 
said at a meeting of more than 50 planners. 
</P>
<P>
The conferees' conclusion can be fairly summed up as, "The sky is falling." 
</P>
<P>
What's happening on the streets is like heart trouble. Arteries are clogged, 
and disaster is imminent. Easy mobility, the lifeblood of suburbia, may soon 
disappear unless the link between the single-family house and the private 
automobile is broken. 
</P>
<P>
It's particularly bad for those living in more distant bedroom communities such 
as those in the Antelope Valley, "exurbs" in the planners' argot. As the 
streets fill to capacity and beyond, the theory goes, houses in these distant 
zones might become so unattractive that prices would drop. That point was made 
by Daniel Brand, a Boston-based consultant, when he told his colleagues that 
congestion is close to the point where it "threatens the value of our recent 
massive increase in private investment in suburban and exurban housing and 
land." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, one participant said, the would-be suburbanites of the future may 
be "forced by economics or local zoning policies to forget the big back yard 
and maybe even the single-family house itself." 
</P>
<P>
The grids are locking fastest in California and other high-growth states, but 
almost no area is immune. The population of greater St. Louis declined nearly 
4% in the 1980s, but driving increased 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are numerous. The cure, according to these experts, lies not in 
building freeways or subways -- there simply is not enough money to keep up 
with the demand -- but in changing the way cities are arranged. 
</P>
<P>
With remarkable agreement, the planners argued that housing of the future 
should be high-density, a far cry from the one lot-one family American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
Planners repeatedly cited a landmark study by the California Department of 
Transportation, which concluded that a doubling of residential density results 
in a one-third drop in driving. 
</P>
<P>
For present and future suburbs, the brainstorming sessions produced a regimen 
that, like a healthy fibrous diet, will strike some as repellent and others as 
thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any good news for those who hope to continue driving at will," 
said Frederick W. Ducca, a Federal Highway Administration planner. "The 
statistics tell us that those days can't go on much longer."

25 LIQUOR STORE CLERKS CITED FOR SALES TO MINORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
An underage Los Angeles police employee was able to buy beer at 25 of 67 liquor 
stores in the northwest San Fernando Valley that were targeted in a two-day 
crackdown on illegal alcohol sales, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Two clerks were arrested on outstanding warrants and citations were issued to 
the remaining store clerks who sold beer illegally to the 19-year-old police 
employee during the undercover operation, Sgt. Ken Kreider said. The operation, 
which included stores in Granada Hills, Northridge and Chatsworth, was 
conducted Dec. 21 and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Selling alcohol to people under 21 years of age is a misdemeanor in California. 
</P>
<P>
"The stores we targeted were locations that had a general reputation of making 
sales to minors," Kreider said. "We got the word from direct complaints about 
the sales and from previous violations." 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified woman arrested at a Granada Hills liquor store during the 
operation had an outstanding warrant from a previous arrest for selling alcohol 
to a minor, Kreider said. "This is the fifth time in six months that she's sold 
alcohol to a juvenile," he said. She was arrested on charges of failing to 
appear at a previous court hearing on an illegal sales charge. 
</P>
<P>
A man who also sold beer during the undercover operation was arrested on an 
outstanding warrant unrelated to illegal alcohol sales, Kreider said. 
</P>
<P>
Kreider said it will take more such undercover operations to reduce the 
percentage of stores that apparently sell alcohol to minors. He said the 
practice is not only illegal, but it also endangers the lives of both the 
youths who consume the alcohol and of local residents. 
</P>
<P>
"During Christmas, Easter and summer vacations, all of our available time is 
consumed by the shenanigans and carrying on of young people around here who buy 
alcohol and then race around in their parents' expensive sports cars," Kreider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related operation, undercover officers attempted to buy ammunition from 10 
area gun stores last week. But none of the clerks at the stores violated the 
city ordinance that prohibits the sale of ammunition for the seven days prior 
to Jan. 1. The law is an attempt to reduce the number of people who discharge 
weapons into the air on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no violators, but a couple of the stores referred us to the cities of 
San Fernando and Simi Valley," Kreider said, where the ammunition sales 
prohibition would not apply.

In diagnosing congestion, experts are finding out, everything matters -- even 
the number of teen-agers driving to high school. 
</P>
<P>
Steering your own four wheels to class -- long a part of the Southern 
California lifestyle -- has become a nationwide practice, say transportation 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
With congestion slowly engulfing the nation, transportation planners have begun 
focusing on high school driving and other once-overlooked factors, including 
trips to the video store, friends sharing a car to get to a concert and short 
runs to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not all long commutes," said Frederick W. Ducca, a planner with the 
Federal Highway Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"There are dozens of little reasons why Americans are driving more, reasons 
that we've all but ignored." 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, motorists drove nearly 40% more total miles in 1990 than a decade 
earlier, experts say; in Southern California, the decade-long increase exceeded 
50%. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent conference at UC Irvine, planners and transportation experts 
compiled a list of little-noticed factors that contribute to today's traffic 
malaise. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: more families with both spouses working; more households created -- 
each with a wage-earner -- as divorce flourishes; more cars per household as 
prosperity spreads; more short drives to the store; more houses in distant 
suburbs forcing longer drives to work. 
</P>
<P>
Alan E. Pisarski, author of several books on commuting, said he thinks most of 
these factors stem from a single demographic development: In the 1980s, the 
Baby Boom generation came into the work force and into its prime driving years. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these thirtysomething motorists "are prosperous young parents now, and 
they drive because they have to in order to get around in suburbia," Pisarski 
said, "but also because it's almost second nature to them to get behind the 
wheel" rather than walk or take a bus. 
</P>
<P>
Higher numbers of teen-agers driving to high school, Pisarski said, "reflects 
increased prosperity and the car as status symbol among the young." 
</P>
<P>
"Our parking lot is always full," said Joan K. Elam, principal of James Monroe 
High School in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-space parking lot at William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills 
starts filling up at 7 a.m., an hour before the first class, said Leon Mason, 
assistant principal. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't get a spot flood surrounding streets with their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Since school officials don't control off-street parking, said Mason, "We don't 
know if there are more driving or not. But there are a lot of students with 
cars, I can tell you that." JIM QUINN

COUNCIL LEAVES DOOR AJAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After five years of watching Ventura Boulevard explode with development and 
traffic, the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan came within an eyelash of final 
approval on Dec. 18. Ignoring the pleas of homeowners and the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn., Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores withheld her crucial vote, a 
highly unusual move, thus delaying further City Council action on the plan 
until Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
This could allow time for other developers with out-of-scale projects to squeak 
through. One project in particular is the proposed 3-story, 85,000-square-foot 
full city block building of developer Jacky Gamliel. The people of the Sherman 
Oaks Homeowners Assn. have been struggling to mitigate this inappropriate 
development for 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
For what possible reason could Flores, whose constituency is not even in the 
plan's district, want to withhold her vote on this plan, which has been in the 
works for so long? Flores said she was "concerned about builders and projects 
nearing approval" and thought "it was unfair to subject them to a new set of 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
One infers from this kind of thinking that Flores thinks that the intentions of 
the plan were a big secret to developers and builders. Many developers were on 
the panel created to devise the plan, including Gamliel's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' "touching empathy" for the developers and builders is a blatant example 
of a politician who prefers to serve the needs of builders and developers 
rather than the needs of the people. 
</P>
<P>
The inordinate five-year time frame on the plan's development has already 
allowed many developers to squeak their out-of-scale projects through. Thanks 
to Flores, the door to this overdevelopment is still not shut.

COMMUTER RAIL SCHEDULE SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commuter rail service through the San Fernando Valley has moved a step closer 
to reality with an agreement between the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission and the Southern Pacific Railroad Co. on the initial hours of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Two rail routes will be reserved for commuter service from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 
4 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays under the agreement reached last week, said John 
Rinard, chief engineer for the transportation commission. 
</P>
<P>
The trains would run about once an hour during those periods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As demand increases, the trains would be allowed to share the tracks with 
freight trains during other times of the day and night, Rinard said, although 
the slower freight trains could cause delays. 
</P>
<P>
One route is between Moorpark and downtown Los Angeles, with stops planned in 
Simi Valley, Chatsworth, Northridge, Van Nuys, Burbank and Glendale. The other 
is between Santa Clarita and downtown, with stops in San Fernando, Burbank and 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the commission agreed to pay $450 million to buy the right of way 
to 175 miles of tracks and to purchase nearby land for stations and parks. 
Commuter rail's advantage over other rail services is that it uses existing 
tracks and therefore can begin quickly, in this case by 1992.

Antelope Valley College Jazz Ensemble members will take their Dixieland swing 
to the land of its birth Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 19 ensemble members, ranging in age from 18 to 65, will be in New Orleans 
for a week to play at hotels and local festivals. 
</P>
<P>
The musicians already are veterans of the New Orleans ragtime scene. They also 
have played as far away as Jamaica and Nassau. This summer, they hope to bring 
some cool musical relief to the warm shores of the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be playing at the Le Meridien Hotel in New Orleans, and we'll be at some 
of the local festivals also," said Lee Matalon, the ensemble's band director. 
"We're looking at Italy for the next trip, which should take place this 
upcoming summer." 
</P>
<P>
Band members said they hope to return from New Orleans with more than they took 
with them, including some of New Orleans' magical musical moments. All are 
students at the college. STEVE DELANEY

ROBERT F. GENTRY ON OFFSHORE OIL SPILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ROBERT F. GENTRY, Robert F. Gentry is a city councilman and former mayor of 
Laguna Beach.

<TEXT>
<P>
Feb.7, 1990 , will be a day that Orange Countians will remember for some time 
to come. On that day, approximately 400,000 gallons of oil began spewing from 
the American Trader, an 800-foot tanker operated by British Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
The disaster is the worst oil spill in the history of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
We are fortunate that mother nature looked favorably upon us, playing a very 
important role in the clean-up operation. 
</P>
<P>
It is amazing that in 1990, with the kind of technology this country has 
utilized in many areas, we still have quite primitive ways of recovering oil 
from the water. Technology has not been developed to handle a spill even the 
size of this one, and that, to me, is deplorable. 
</P>
<P>
We should not be offering the leasing of tracts off Orange County when we are 
unable to effectively clean up from a disaster that oil development and the oil 
industry may produce. 
</P>
<P>
The main lesson learned in this disaster is that we need much stricter laws 
governing the transport of oil near our shores and we need to take a very hard 
look at the expansion of this industry in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
I believe the area between the Orange County coastline and Catalina Island 
should be designated a National Oceanic Park. That plan already has the support 
of half of the cities in the county and the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The people must realize that the strong oil lobby has produced a situation 
where the checks and balances just are not there.

HENRY N. PONTELL ON A NEW COUNTY JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY PONTELL, Henry Pontell is a UC Irvine associate professor and an 
expert on jail overcrowding. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Orange County Board of Supervisors has focused its attention (and 
ours) on building new facilities as the panacea to jail overcrowding, efforts 
to resolve the problem could be moved in a different direction that would 
result in more realistic expectations regarding the use of punishment resources 
and the enhancement of public safety. 
</P>
<P>
Before embarking on a dramatic jail construction program, a detailed and 
balanced examination must be made not only of the incredible economic 
consequences, but also of other sentencing methods (for example, expanding and 
initiating such mechanisms as work furlough, community service, electronic 
monitoring and intensive supervision) and better coordination in the criminal 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Serious attention to prevention and education will go a lot further in reducing 
crime than will incarcerating criminals. 
</P>
<P>
A crisis mentality regarding jail overcrowding will do more harm than good, 
both fiscally and socially, and should be abandoned. Only then will 
policy-makers be able to seriously consider crime and its punishment -- and 
develop effective long-term policies.

ONE CITY'S CONSERVATION SHOWS THE WAY; 
</P>
<P>
* OTHER ORANGE COUNTY AREAS MAY END UP AS PRESSED FOR WATER AS SAN CLEMENTE WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Metropolitan Water District recently announced that it would impose 
rationing on water districts next year, most local authorities in Orange County 
said they have no immediate plans to impose mandatory restrictions on 
businesses or residential customers and anticipate no rate increases in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
That was possible because Orange County in general has done a satisfactory job 
of responding to voluntary calls for conservation, and because the northern 
part of the county benefits from good luck: It is blessed not so much by its 
efforts to save water as by its location. It sits atop an underground lake that 
supplies a good deal of water. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a different story in the southern cities, which have had high growth 
in recent years and are most dependent on imported water from the MWD and other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
One of those communities, San Clemente, has just completed a full year's 
experience with mandatory water rationing. The results are heartening for other 
communities that might end up as pressed as San Clemente was; it simply had to 
act because it was running out of water. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the experience of cracking the whip for a year are that -- 
despite an increase in both residential and commercial customers -- San 
Clemente has dropped to about 62% of last year's consumption. And by the way, 
San Clemente has positioned itself well for the new water rationing ahead. 
Because the city has already undertaken a water conservation program, the water 
it has saved so far will be credited against the water reduction quota that 
will be imposed by the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente during the past year, a building moratorium was imposed, lawn 
watering was allowed only during certain hours, and on assigned days, and water 
wasters were subject to fines. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also voted to contribute $723,000 to help install water-saving 
plumbing fixtures in homes built before a state law went into effect requiring 
those devices. And most important, individual residents have been inspired to 
do such things as remove grass from back yards and install brick and cactus. 
Creating the atmosphere for water conservation where residents take it upon 
themselves to find ways of saving is a plus that can pay off for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
If the drought continues, other county communities may have to impose more 
severe curbs. For them San Clemente has shown the way in the first year.

When I first came to Orange County in 1975, there was not much visible poverty 
here. Yes, there were poor people, but they were well-hidden. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County was known for its wealth. It truly had become the "Promised Land, 
the land flowing with milk and honey." 
</P>
<P>
What a difference 15 years has made. 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that Orange County's 1990 poor are no longer hidden. They are on 
our streets, in our neighborhoods. Many want them to become invisible again. 
</P>
<P>
My concern is a creeping attitude of isolationism here in the Promised Land. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that we can learn from the generations that have gone before us, who 
cared for the less fortunate, that care for the poor is the true mark of 
humanity, the measurement of the integrity of a people. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot and must not in Orange County turn our backs on our brothers and 
sisters who happen to be poor. We must not try to make them invisible again by 
refusing to acknowledge their presence. 
</P>
<P>
We must not let an attitude of "me-first" or "let them take care of themselves" 
become a part of our community attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to the Promised Land? The place to look for the answer is 
within. Our attitude, our involvement, can make the difference.

LACK OF DONATIONS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN

I am the mother of a 7-year-old Tiger Scout (Boy Scouts of America). He 
participated in the Scouting for Food Drive. 
</P>
<P>
After distributing more than 70 bags to homeowners to use to donate canned 
goods, we returned a week later, as indicted by instructions printed on the 
bag, to collect the donations. My son distributed the bags with excitement, 
hoping he would collect many cans that would be given to hungry people. 
</P>

It is hard for me to explain to him why, out of the more than 70 bags we 
distributed, only seven generous people put out donations. It is even harder 
for me to understand because these bags were distributed in the area where we 
live -- an affluent, planned development in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that people are not so calloused as to have no desire to help others. I 
hope they are not blind to the fact that it is possible for any family to some 
day need help from others. 
</P>
<P>
But what I hope the most is that people realize that our children, when grown, 
will be responsible for taking care of us. If values and compassion to others 
are not honored now, we cannot expect to receive it later.

Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, is expecting federal government assistance 
to build roads and solve traffic problems in Anaheim or Long Beach before he 
can consent to building a new Disneyland Park. 
</P>
<P>
This is a charming idea. Since we in Orange County are unable to find federal 
money to solve our existing freeway problems, Eisner, if successful in 
obtaining federal money, might consider sharing Disneyland profits -- so we can 
solve our traffic problems.

SOME QUESTIONS ON HEALTH-CARE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is wrong with this picture? On July 25, the budget for the next fiscal 
year was presented to the Orange County Board of Supervisors. It called for a 
5% across-the-board cut. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the public safety portion of the budget was followed 
immediately by eloquent appeals from the district attorney, sheriff and public 
defender. They all pointed out the devastating consequences of such a cut on 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
This was followed by the health-care budget, also reduced by 5%. There was not 
one single comment from any member of the Health Care Agency. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
Is there room for a 5% cut while still providing adequate health-care services 
to the residents of Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
Is this not the county that lost one its trauma care centers this year and now 
must send Orange County trauma victims to Los Angeles County? 
</P>
<P>
Is this not the county where there is virtually no provision for non-emergency 
care for indigent adults? 
</P>
<P>
Is this not the county where poor children with serious health problems must 
wait weeks, or even months, for appointments to overcrowded clinics? 
</P>
<P>
If this is that county, why the deafening silence from the Health Care Agency? 
</P>
<P>
Is there a relationship between these problems, the silent Health Care Agency, 
and the more than 20 individuals who rose to speak when public comment was 
requested? 
</P>
<P>
What do the Orange County Medical Assn., Hospital Council, Share Our Selves, 
California Health Decisions, United Way, the March of Dimes Birth Defect 
Foundation, and UCI Medical Center (and 16 other health-care providers and 
consumer groups) know that the county of Orange does not know? 
</P>
<P>
I am left wondering which conveyed the loudest message: the public outcry or 
the county silence?

RON KOVIC AND HIS CLAIM TO LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hope the recent movement by some to import Ron Kovic into our 38th 
Congressional District to oppose Robert K. Dornan fails. Such a confrontation 
might sell newspapers but has no other useful purpose. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when Dornan can and should be defeated, there are those who would run 
a person who hopefully could not be elected. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic is a man who apparently grew up with a distorted fantasy of war and a 
thirst for combat. During his second tour of combat in Vietnam, he was gravely 
wounded. Reality would not compromise. His once-beloved fantasies became the 
enemy of his new, distorted view of the world around him. 
</P>
<P>
Now Kovic wants to come to my district and represent me. He states he has the 
same view on Central American that he had for Vietnam. Like Gen. Benedict 
Arnold before, Kovic has long since used up his leadership status.

HEA We Could Use a 'Mr. Smith' NowIn the 1939 movie "Mr. Smith Goes to 
Washington," a young Jimmy Stewart faces congressional corruption and wins the 
day with an avalanche of mail from ordinary citizens fed up with the status quo 
of greed and back-room politics. 
</P>
<P>
As I read in The Times, a Rev. Louis Sheldon now goes to Washington, both on an 
entirely different pilgrimage with a distinctly odious agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas "Mr. Smith" fought for the rights of all Americans to fair and decent 
government, Sheldon brings hostility, polarization and downright hatred to the 
capital in his zealous crusade against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
As a heterosexual married father of three wonderfully mature children, I find 
Sheldon and his Traditional Values coalition offensive and certainly 
nonrepresentative of my values. 
</P>
<P>
My values include tolerance, understanding and compassion. Unlike Sheldon's, 
they do not include bigotry, bias and self-aggrandizement. Washington deserves 
any Mr. Smith and would be wise to shun the hatemongering Sheldons of this 
world. Jimmy Stewart, where are you when so needed by the reasonable?

ABORTION-RIGHTS MALE FELT SLIGHTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being a pro-choice advocate is not an easy job when you happen to be a male. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I attended another pro-choice rally, this time at a Fullerton clinic. 
</P>
<P>
As I stood there with my buttons and sign, I listened to the women around me 
talking to each other. The conversations were full of derogatory statements 
about men. Now don't get me wrong, women are justified in having many ill 
feelings about men for the oppressions they've suffered through the ages. 
</P>
<P>
But I think the women in the pro-choice movement should try and be more aware 
of the men who are standing side-by-side with them on this issue, not to 
mention putting their bodies on the line for women's rights for reproductive 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure that most would agree that the pro-choice movement would attract more 
men if men felt more welcome. Also, I'm sure that more men in the movement 
would surely be a benefit.

DAVE DISTEL: TEXAS A&amp;M TOOK A PAGE FROM BYU'S PLAYBOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you thought your ticket to the Holiday Bowl bought you a look at defense, 
you were in the wrong store. 
</P>
<P>
You get defense at the Holiday Bowl like you get a mink coat at an auto parts 
store or a watch at a fast-food joint or a sound system at a grocery store. 
Defense comes with the Holiday Bowl like mint juleps come with New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Some, maybe most, of the past scores look like price tags at Neiman-Marcus. The 
first 12 games included scores such as 38-37, 46-45, 38-36, 39-38, 62-14 and 
50-39. Joe Paterno, stodgy old black shoes, was involved in that last one, 
which is a little bit like Ronald Reagan voting Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
When Texas A&amp;M and Brigham Young squared off Saturday at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium, the smart money -- the bookmakers -- knew what to expect. They 
set the over-and-under at 62 1/2 points, meaning they expected the total point 
to be in that neighborhood and you could take your pick and bet it either way. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who considered going with the under was crazy. You don't study form or 
teams or coaches. You bet the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
If my calculator is correct, the total was 79 points. The only surprise was how 
it was split. No one outside of College Station, Tex., meaning no one with any 
sense, figured the Aggies to be 65-14 winners. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M was going to take the conservative military approach, like these 
cadet types would fight a war . . . the Civil War. Air, to them, was for 
breathing, not travel. The Aggies would take the weapons that got them here and 
win or lose with them. 
</P>
<P>
They would run Darren Lewis wide and Robert Wilson up the middle and Bucky 
Richardson wherever he could find the six-inch opening he needed to get 
through. That would be it. 
</P>
<P>
Boring? Of course. But effective. 
</P>
<P>
If that was what you (or BYU) expected, that was not what the Aggies brought to 
the party. They came wearing lamp shades and masks. They must have thought this 
was New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
These guys averaged 152 passing yards a game this year. They had 680 yards from 
scrimmage Saturday night, but what was really significant was that they had 190 
passing yards in the first half. One of those passes as thrown by running back 
Lewis to quarterback Richardson, naturally for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need to know a whole lot more about the game other than the fact that 
the halftime score was 37-7 . . . and how it got that way. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies used a 25-yard first-down pass from Richardson to Gary Oliver to set 
up their first touchdown. Admittedly, it was the only pass of the drive, but 
BYU should have taken the cue that this was to be an unconventional game plan 
from the other side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
The next A&amp;M drive was kicked off on a reverse run by wide receiver Shane 
Garrett off a handoff from Lewis. It was Garrett's second carry of the game. 
For the record, he carried four times all year. 
</P>
<P>
There was more. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Pavlas, the Aggies' backup quarterback, came into the game for one play 
in the second quarter . . . and Richardson stayed in at running back, as if 
Lewis and Wilson didn't give them enough firepower already. Richardson ran the 
ball on a reverse to the right and went in from the five-yard-line for a 
touchdown. This made the score 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
And there was more. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there was Lewis taking the handoff from Richardson and then throwing back 
to Richardson for 22 yards and a touchdown. That came two plays after 
Richardson completed a BYUesque 55-yard pass to Cornelius Patterson, who caught 
eight passes for 143 yards all year. 
</P>
<P>
Which team had BYU's playbook, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Flash forward to the Aggies' last possession of the half. They take over first 
and 25 because of a dead-ball personal foul after a change of possession. No 
problem, not with the playbook they brought to San Diego. Richardson simply 
threw for a gain of 30 to Mr. Oliver, thank you. Moments later, first and 20 
after a holding penalty, A&amp;M promptly got all 20 yards on a scramble by Mr. 
Richardson, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett made a diving touchdown catch on the next play and that was it for the 
half . . . 37-7. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to BYU? You can catch excerpts from that first half at your 
nearest video store. Look under football follies. 
</P>
<P>
Ty Detmer, Mr. Heisman, threw a pass off one of his offensive linemen for an 
interception. A BYU receiver, Scott Charlton, inadvertently ran out of bounds 
before catching a pass for what would have been a gain of 46 yards to the 
A&amp;M one. Detmer lateraled to an offensive lineman, Neal Fort, for a loss of 
12. Punter Earl Kauffman had a snap go over his head for a safety. Detmer lost 
38 yards -- yes, you read it right -- on a sack. 
</P>
<P>
That was in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
What BYU needed was a miracle, but what it got were shoulder separations. Two. 
Both to Ty Detmer. First, his left shoulder. Then, his right shoulder. That 
left him with no shoulder upon which to carry the burden of what would have to 
have been a miraculous comeback anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies, those fun-devils, were just too clever to catch.

HART ENJOYS ITS OWN PARTY FOR A CHANGE

<TEXT>
<P>
For 19 years, Hart High has played host to a tournament. And for 19 years, Hart 
has watched someone else pick up the championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
With eight second-place finishes, the Indians had more reason to claim No. 2 
than Avis. 
</P>
<P>
That all changed Saturday when Hart beat East Bakersfield, 55-54, to win the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"Between my teammates and coaches, we'd heard it too much," Hart forward Ali 
Peek said of Hart's inability to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Greg Herrick had a different point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no monkey off my back," he said. "I won this tournament twice while I was 
at Cleveland (1983, 1984). But it is unusual that a school doesn't win its own 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
And the Indians (9-5) have Marty Downen to thank. Downen stole an inbounds pass 
under his own basket with three seconds left to preserve the win. 
</P>
<P>
Downen, who scored 10 points, was named the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Peek added 12 points and five blocked shots, and Tony Valenzuela 
contributed 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Saugus 61, Antelope Valley 42 -- Saugus went almost seven minutes without 
scoring in the first quarter, and fell behind, 9-1, in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Centurions (10-4) went on a 22-9 spree in the second period to take a 
lead they did not relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills 60, Rio Mesa 55 -- Jonah Naulls scored 23 points to pace the 
Normans in the consolation championship. Rio Mesa (3-7) got 16 points from Greg 
Bellman and 10 from David Halvorsen. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 70, Calabasas 57 -- Jerry Armen scored 22 points in leading the 
Dynamiters (9-5) in the fifth-place game. Greg Waugh had 13 points for the 
Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale 68, Cabrillo 42 -- Jason Grimes scored 18 points for the Falcons in a 
consolation-bracket game.

THOUSAND OAKS RIPS BUENA, 103-66

Don't be surprised if the Ventura tournament becomes a fixture on Thousand Oaks 
High's preleague schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers, who first played in the tournament in the mid-1970s then won the 
consolation championship last season in their second appearance, blasted Buena, 
103-66, in the title game Saturday night at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
With tournament most valuable player Chris Loll scoring 34 points and Buena 
getting into early foul trouble, Thousand Oaks controlled the tempo after the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancer defense also slowed down Bulldog guard Lance Fay, holding him to 17 
points after he scored 31 in a semifinal win over Lompoc on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our No. 1 concern coming into the game," Thousand Oaks Coach Ed 
Chevalier said. "We must have said his name in practice 50 times today. And I 
think the kids got the message." 
</P>
<P>
The win was the fifth in a row for Thousand Oaks (9-1) and gives the Lancers 
plenty of momentum as they head into their Marmonte League opener against 
Newbury Park on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"That was important to us," Chevalier said. "We stressed that with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Loll, who made 14 of 20 shots from the field and five of six free throws, also 
had nine rebounds, three blocked shots and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Loll with 99 points in three games, Thousand Oaks set a tournament 
record for total points with 282, breaking the previous best of 256 by Ventura 
in 1968. The Lancers' total against Buena was a school record. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Andrew Borg scored 15 points and senior guard Brian Capella, an 
all-tournament selection, added 11 for Thousand Oaks, which won its own 
tournament two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Bortolin, Fay's backcourt mate, scored a team-high 19 points for Buena 
(6-4), the two-time defending tournament champion. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo 74, Lompoc 67 -- David Harbour and David Nathaniel each scored 17 
points for Camarillo (5-2) in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Harbour, who made only seven of 21 shots from the field and three of nine free 
throws, scored 14 of his points after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands 66, Ventura 61 -- Marlowe Durmiendo scored a game-high 20 
points and Noe Noyola added 15 as Channel Islands (8-2) won the consolation 
championship. Jon Seiler led Ventura (4-5) with 18 points.

Before the basketball season began, Pepperdine power forward Geoff Lear changed 
his uniform number from 3, his high school number, to 34 as an indication, he 
said, of his new attitude toward the game. 
</P>
<P>
Lear said that he probably should be wearing No. 6 because he wanted to play 
twice as well this season as he did in his first two years in college. But he 
chose No. 34, he said, because that is the jersey number of his favorite 
professional player, Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the style of Barkley, Charles the Great," Lear said. "If I can do 
everything as well as he does, I'll be happy with my performance." 
</P>
<P>
By that standard, Lear has been happy at times and unhappy at others. And 
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury has felt the same way about Lear. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-8 junior, the only returning player named to last season's All-West 
Coast Conference team, must have been overjoyed in his team's first three 
games. Pepperdine opened with victories over Montana State, Fresno State and UC 
Santa Barbara and Lear averaged an impressive 15.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But Pepperdine went 2-4 in its next six games and Lear's rebounding has dropped 
off. He is still his team's top rebounder with a 10.1 average and is averaging 
a team high 17.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lear's numbers are more than respectable, but occasionally he does not live up 
either to his own expectations or to those of Asbury. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, Asbury said that Lear has been inconsistent in the past but 
that this season he had "practiced harder and more consistently than in his 
first two years." But he added that Lear's role has changed from that of a 
supporting player to that of a leading actor, a role that calls for consistency 
in games as well as in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go from a support player to the go-to guy, it becomes increasingly 
difficulty to compile big numbers," he said. "Then it's just a matter of what 
point in time in your career do you become the go-to guy. I think he's ready 
for it; he's demonstrated at times that he's ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
He was not ready in a recent game, particularly on defense when the player he 
was guarding scored 12 points in the first half. At halftime, Lear said he was 
lectured by Asbury for his soft defense. 
</P>
<P>
"In the locker room, Coach Asbury bawled me out; he was on my rear end a lot," 
Lear said. "I guess I blocked it out; most guys would have crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
"If you let it get to you, it can affect your performance. You've got to be 
ready to play and block out everything." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Lear held his man to two points. 
</P>
<P>
Lear said he thinks he understands why Asbury gets on his case when he does not 
play well. 
</P>
<P>
"He's trying to make an example out of me to the younger guys," he said. "He 
doesn't want the younger guys going half-speed or being lackadaisical, but to 
play up to their potential." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury also wants intense performances from Lear night after night. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands that he is sometimes being outplayed by some inferior players. 
He understands that he has great ability." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury thinks that Lear is capable of being a dominating player. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's what he wants and has worked hard for over the years," Asbury 
said. "He's willing to step up and be that guy. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is not his scoring; he will get his points. We don't need 25 points 
(a game) from him, but we do need 10 rebounds. We need him to be a dominant 
rebounder." 
</P>
<P>
Lear realizes that Asbury is counting on him as a team leader, "and I'm glad 
I'm in that position." 
</P>
<P>
Lear remembers when the roles were reversed and he was watching from the bench 
as Asbury lectured the starters. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the horses, and it was no skin off my nose," Lear said. "It's hard 
to accept blame, but I'd rather accept it than put it on somebody else. I 
figure if I put my mind to it, I can get 16 or 17 rebounds every night." 
</P>
<P>
Levy Middlebrooks, Pepperdine's career rebounding leader, figures the same way 
about Lear. 
</P>
<P>
Middlebrooks is taking classes at Pepperdine and hopes to finish work on his 
degree soon. Last season he played professionally in Spain, but he tore an 
Achilles' tendon and has taken a year off from basketball to recover. 
</P>
<P>
Middlebrooks, who was instrumental in recruiting Lear for Pepperdine, said he 
thinks Lear is capable of replacing him as the school's career rebounding 
leader. He said he attended one of Lear's games at Bishop Amat High in the hope 
that his demonstration of interest would convince Lear to come to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
The visit by Middlebrooks worked. 
</P>
<P>
"Levy Middlebrooks had the most influence on me when he came to one of my 
games," Lear said. "No other (college) player did that. That act spoke louder 
than any words." 
</P>
<P>
Lear said this season's team may be young and inexperienced, but that it has 
talent. It also has harmony, something that may have been missing from the team 
in his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the guys are closer this year," he said. "There is no animosity on the 
team, which makes it more fun to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not see us staggering in the league. I'm confident we can win this 
thing."

<P>
COLLEGES: DIONNE VANLANDINGHAM DIDN'T START PLAYING BASKETBALL UNTIL THREE 
YEARS AGO, BUT SHE HAS BECOME A DOMINATING FORCE INSIDE FOR CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ 
HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago Dionne Vanlandingham didn't know much about basketball. She 
spent most of her time practicing modern dance routines as part of the Long 
Beach Poly High drill team. At the end of the week she and her fellow Polyettes 
performed during halftime shows at football games. 
</P>
<P>
Vanlandingham didn't play basketball until her senior year at Poly, but she 
quickly learned the game. In only her third season of competitive basketball, 
the sophomore center is a dominating force inside. She leads Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in scoring (13.2 points a game) and rebounding (12.7). 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman last season, she earned All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
second-team honors. She also led Dominguez Hills in scoring and was named the 
team's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Van Girard, the third-year Lady Toro coach, said Vanlandingham is probably the 
best natural athlete on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to keep getting better," Girard said. "Her skills are already more 
developed and polished than they were as a freshman. I knew when I recruited 
her that her improvement would be down the line, not right away." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said Vanlandingham makes up for a lack of size with quickness. Most 
CCAA centers are taller and huskier than Vanlandingham, who is only 6-foot and 
155 pounds. Her agility however, is better than the big and strong players she 
often competes against. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a lot quicker than most people at the post," Girard said. "She's just a 
great athlete with great ability. She's a player that other teams in the 
conference will have to contend with." 
</P>
<P>
Vanlandingham is still adjusting to all the attention. She said basketball is a 
lot of fun so it's difficult to take it seriously. Earlier this week she 
strutted into the Dominguez Hills' gym giggling for an interview. She wore a 
stylish black leather jacket and large hoop earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Her easygoing demeanor and soft-spoken style make it difficult to imagine how 
tough she is in her cardinal and gold basketball uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lot more aggressive than I was last year," she said. "I learned right 
away that if you're not aggressive in this game, you won't get anywhere. Last 
year I got knocked around a lot, but not anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Vanlandingham still show signs of a young and inexperienced player, but her 
overall performance has led Dominguez Hills to its best start (10-2) since 
1984. That season the Lady Toros started 11-1 under then-Coach Alice Textor. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe Vanlandingham, 19, will be one of the league's top players by her 
senior season. Her talent made a strong impression on Darlene May, who coaches 
Cal Poly Pomona, Dominguez Hills' CCAA rival. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got great skills and she's going to be a good player once she gets more 
experience," said May, who has led the Broncos to three national championships 
and nine CCAA titles. "We would like to have her here. She runs very well and 
she can jump. She's a real nice player." 
</P>
<P>
May is keeping a close watch on Vanlandingham since Dominguez Hills is 
predicted to be Pomona's toughest CCAA opponent this season. The Lady Toros 
should be one of the forces in the six-member league since Cal State Northridge 
left to play Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills' strength is undoubtedly inside. Cheri Bullet, a 6-foot 
transfer from El Camino, is Vanlandingham's front-court partner. 
</P>
<P>
"They really make a big difference on this team," Girard said. "Two solid post 
players like Dionne and Cheri gives us a true inside game, which we haven't 
really had before." 
</P>
<P>
Vanlandingham brought success to Poly during an impressive senior season. She 
prepared for her high school debut by attending a girls' summer basketball camp 
at Cal State Long Beach after her junior year. 
</P>
<P>
When the camp ended, she spent a lot of time shooting baskets at a nearby park 
with Poly teammate Letoyia Gray, a sophomore guard at Dominguez Hills this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
By the time school started, Vanlandingham was more than prepared. She helped 
the Jackrabbits go undefeated in the Moore League and reach the second round of 
the CIF playoffs. She led Poly in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots, was 
named Moore League MVP, was selected to The Times' all-star team and was named 
to the All-CIF second team. 
</P>
<P>
"I surprised myself," she said. "I guess I was just born with athletic 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
John Anderson, who runs the Olympic Girls Development League, has watched 
Vanlandingham play for the past three years. He said her progress has been 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"She was tentative at first, but once she got started she did real well," he 
said. "When I first saw her play I knew she had the ability to be a good 
player. She runs the court real well and she has great offensive skills." 
</P>
<P>
But Vanlandingham didn't exactly have college scouts lined up at her doorstep. 
She was recruited by San Jose State and Oregon State, but chose Dominguez Hills 
because it was 10 minutes away from the Carson home she shares with her mother, 
stepfather and two younger siblings. 
</P>
<P>
Her only regret is that she didn't start playing basketball sooner. The prelaw 
major said however, that she got just as good a workout practicing dance 
routines with the drill team.

DOMINGUEZ HILLS WINS IN TWO OVERTIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is it about National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletic schools that brings 
out the best and the worst in the Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball 
team? 
</P>
<P>
Despite shooting 33% from the field Saturday night, the Toros used 10 
three-point shots to come from behind and take an 81-74 double-overtime victory 
over host Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth consecutive victory for Dominguez Hills (8-4), but only the 
second in five games against NAIA opponents. It was also the first overtime 
victory for Dominguez Hills this season. The Toros have played five. 
Ironically, four of those have been against NAIA opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time we got one of these," said Toro Coach Dave Yanai, who guided 
Dominguez Hills back from a 16-point second-half deficit. After an 0-3 start, 
Dominguez Hills has won eight of nine games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for these players to understand that they can go into a road 
situation and step up under pressure and go home with a game like this," Yanai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills made only 28 of 84 field goals, but connected on 15 of 20 free 
throws. It opened the game by missing 12 of 13 field goals and trailed, 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Bennett's three-point shot with 8:06 to go gave the Toros a brief 22-21 
lead, but then the Cougars opened the second half with a 19-4 run. Azusa 
Pacific led, 53-36, with 12:34 to play in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
But Azusa got careless with the ball, committing five turnovers in the closing 
minutes of regulation. That was enough for Dominguez Hills, which played a 
patient game, to rally despite its poor shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Junior center Mike Moore played his finest game as a Toro. Moore, a 6-foot-7 
walk-on and one of three Toros to transfer from a Division I school, made five 
three-point shots. He scored 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was even more effective in key situations when he didn't score. He took a 
charge from Mike Bateman with 4:20 left. That was in the middle of a 22-6 Toro 
run that would eventually cut that 16-point Cougar lead to 59-58. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by three points with 22 seconds left, Moore passed to John Brown, who 
tied the game with a three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
And when Azusa thought it had rebounded to win the game, Moore got offensive 
again, tipping in a missed three-point attempt by Keith Billingslea at the 
buzzer to send the game into the first overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The first overtime ended at 70-all, but in the second overtime, Dominguez Hills 
took control, 73-72, on Moore's fifth three-point basket. 
</P>
<P>
"The last two or three games Mike has played very well for us," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who did not start, has led the Toros in scoring five times this season. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills has shot only 40.8% from the field this season, but has made 
34% of its three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
As for playing so many NAIA schools in the preseason, Athletic Director Dan 
Guerrero felt it will actually help the team's character. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the NAIA schools have more scholarship money than we do and they 
provide some excellent competition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros are finding that out.

PREPS: SOME SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE 1991 A BETTER YEAR FOR PREPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the new year approaching, here are some things we would like to see in 
1991: 
</P>
<P>
* Fewer athletes jumping from one high school to another; 
</P>
<P>
* Stricter rules regarding transfers; 
</P>
<P>
* Stiffer penalties handed out to athletes involved in fights; 
</P>
<P>
* More coaches with the dedication and class of Carson's retiring Gene 
Vollnogle; 
</P>
<P>
* A smooth transition for Peninsula High; 
</P>
<P>
* A basketball team for Rolling Hills' Cliff Warren to coach; 
</P>
<P>
* The revival of the Inglewood football program; 
</P>
<P>
* A change in the L.A. City Section's year-round rescheduling plan, which would 
eliminate soccer and shorten the basketball season; 
</P>
<P>
* Fewer Southern Section divisions, especially in football; 
</P>
<P>
* Scrapping the Southern Section's everyone-makes-the-playoffs basketball 
format; 
</P>
<P>
* Expanding the ridiculously small 12-team L.A. City Section 4-A football 
division; 
</P>
<P>
* A new football coach at Leuzinger who will carry on the solid tradition 
established by Steve Carnes; 
</P>
<P>
* Parity in girls' basketball; 
</P>
<P>
* A league that can provide regular competition for El Segundo's baseball team; 
</P>
<P>
* A league where Narbonne's football team, loser of 17 consecutive games, could 
play without embarrassment; 
</P>
<P>
* A South Bay team to break the San Fernando Valley's stranglehold on the L.A. 
City 4-A baseball title; 
</P>
<P>
* A return to the basketball court for two talented juniors -- Carson center 
Khary Stanley (injury to lower back) and Palos Verdes guard Julius Coleman 
(suspected heart defect); 
</P>
<P>
* Two more years of Morningside's talented sophomore, Stais Boseman. Then 
again, opposing football and basketball coaches might disagree; 
</P>
<P>
* Fewer Proposition 48 athletes; 
</P>
<P>
* A Bishop Montgomery football team that plays at the level of Coach Steve 
Carroll's enthusiasm; 
</P>
<P>
* Competent officials for every event; 
</P>
<P>
* A reduction in run-and-gun, Loyola Marymount-style basketball; 
</P>
<P>
* Serra football Coach Leo Hand to underestimate an opponent; 
</P>
<P>
* A stable coaching situation for South Torrance's baseball team; 
</P>
<P>
* NCAA sanctioning for Mira Costa's volleyball teams; 
</P>
<P>
* Another group of speed demons for Hawthorne track Coach Kye Courtney; 
</P>
<P>
* Another CIF Player of the Year for St. Bernard baseball Coach Bob Yarnall; 
</P>
<P>
* The end of Banning's seven-game losing streak to Carson in football. 
</P>
<P>
(It's taking the suspense out of the series); 
</P>
<P>
* The dignified closing (finally) of Miraleste; 
</P>
<P>
* Another look at the face of a new visitor to Chadwick's bubble gym; 
</P>
<P>
* A healthy enrollment for tiny Mary Star; 
</P>
<P>
* A return to prominence for the North Torrance athletic program; 
</P>
<P>
* Success for the Redondo baseball team under Coach Tim Ammentorp; 
</P>
<P>
* A second state wrestling title for West Torrance heavyweight Josh Gormley; 
</P>
<P>
* Another shot at an elusive L.A. City title for veteran San Pedro baseball 
Coach Jerry Lovarov; 
</P>
<P>
* A league title for Westchester basketball Coach Ed Azzam. (Strange as it 
seems, he's never won one); 
</P>
<P>
* Continued success for Torrance's two-sport standout, quarterback-catcher 
Jason Kendall; 
</P>
<P>
* Relief for Mike Sakurai, the football and baseball coach at Gardena; 
</P>
<P>
* Free food and drink for sportswriters at all events; 
</P>
<P>
* Happy New Year. 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a year makes. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger was beaten so soundly by Narbonne, 73-49, in the championship game of 
the Torrance basketball tournament last season that Coach Phil Sherman said of 
his team: "We don't have that many big-game players." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman can't make that complaint today. Not after the Olympians defeated 
Narbonne, 77-68, Friday night in the Torrance tournament final at West High. 
</P>
<P>
One of the big reasons for Leuzinger's improvement this season has been the 
play of 6-foot-8 senior forward Frank Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in the Torrance title game, Willis scored only five points, three 
coming in the waning minutes. It prompted Sherman to say of Willis: "In the 
last three games, he's been absent." 
</P>
<P>
Willis made is presence felt Friday. He scored 17 points and earned the 
tournament's most-valuable-player award. Forward Tyrone Merriweather also had 
17 points for Leuzinger, which improved to 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman said Willis has become a more effective player because he is taking 
more high-percentage shots than he did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He's totally changed his game," Sherman said. "Last year, he couldn't score 
inside. Everything was a 15-footer. This season, I don't think he's even made a 
15-footer. We changed the offense to take advantage of his body. Now he works 
for position, catches the ball and has a clear path to the basket." 
</P>
<P>
But Sherman was quick to point out that Willis, who signed early with New 
Mexico, is by no means doing it alone. 
</P>
<P>
He also praised the efforts of sophomore point guard Antoine Lewis, who 
averaged 14 assists a game in the tournament, and off-guard Robert Northern, 
who scored 13 points in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a little better in this tournament," Sherman said. "I think before, 
I was putting a little too much pressure on them. Now my attitide is, 'Play all 
10 and whatever happens, happens.' A lot more guys are involved and team morale 
is better." 
</P>
<P>
One of the pleasant surprises has been forward Rayne Mack, a 6-1, 270-pound 
senior who is playing his first year of prep basketball. Mack was an offensive 
lineman on Leuzinger's Bay League co-champion football team. 
</P>
<P>
"He holds his own," Sherman said. "He even dives on the floor for loose balls." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's victory makes Leuzinger two-for-two in tournaments this season. The 
Olympians won the championship of the El Segundo/Kiwanis Tournament two weeks 
ago. Last year, they lost to Bishop Montgomery in the El Segundo final. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger opens Bay League play Friday night with a tough game at Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman conceded that Narbonne isn't as good as it was last season, but he was 
impressed with Gaucho forwards Wil Weir and D'Mitri Rideout, both of whom made 
the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
"Weir did something I've never seen before," Sherman said. "He caught a long 
rebound coming in, turned his body sideways to the basket, and reversed dunked 
it. He was seven, eight, nine inches over the rim. The ref called over the back 
(on Weir), but our guys didn't know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our forwards, Derrick Plum, jumps pretty good. But these two kids (Weir 
and Rideout) are in another stratosphere."

WESTERN HAS OFF NIGHT, LOSES, 70-39

<TEXT>
<P>
For the past three weeks, the Western High School boys' basketball team turned 
hustle and hard work into 10 consecutive victories -- tops in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, hustle didn't cut it as Western lost, 70-39, to Long Beach 
Millikan in the championship game of the Katella Klassic at Katella High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
For Western (10-1) it was a big-time plummet. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very well for 10 straight games," Western Coach Greg Hoffman said. 
"But these are only high school kids. When they fell, they fell hard." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, no team challenged Western as Millikan did Saturday. Before the 
game, Hoffman said he was concerned about the Rams' quickness, height and 
tenacious defense, and all proved true. 
</P>
<P>
Although they played well in the first quarter -- the Pioneers matched Millikan 
basket for basket, ending the quarter tied, 12-12 -- the second quarter 
signalled the beginning of the end. 
</P>
<P>
Millikan (12-3) outscored Western, 16-7, on six points each by Jamie Davis and 
Dante Powell. Then Western became plagued by shots that bounced in and out of 
the net, several turnovers and mental mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the second half did in Western. Trailing, 28-19, entering the third 
quarter, the Pioneers did not make a field goal until midway through the fourth 
when Josh Byrd scored inside. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, though, Millikan was putting on a show and took a 54-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Before Byrd's basket, Western had missed 20 consecutive field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers finished six of 31 in the second half, 13 of 61 (21%) in the game. 
Millikan shot 27 of 52 (52%) from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not unhappy with my players," Hoffman said. "Millikan's the best team 
we've played -- definitely." 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
Katella 66, Inglewood 60 -- Roger Arias (22 points), Vince Encarnacion (12), 
Kevin Carlson (11), Brian Carlson (11) and Eric Martinez (10) all scored in 
double figures for Katella. Encarnacion made six of seven free throws in the 
final minute. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation championship: 
</P>
<P>
Servite 52, Bishop Montgomery 47 -- Adam Anderson scored 25 points for the 
Friars, who led, 24-23, at halftime. Greg Jacobus had 15 points and Bill Butier 
14 for Bishop Montgomery.

Consistency kept the Sunny Hills High School boys' basketball team out of the 
championship game of the Brea-Olinda Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Consistency at the right times helped Sunny Hills (9-5) clinch third place with 
a 69-60 victory over Brea Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"At times we look real good and at times we look real bad," Sunny Hills Coach 
Steve White said. "We're just not executing very well right now, but we'll be 
there once we get our timing down." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Sunny Hills (9-5) has split two games with Brea tournament 
finalist Gahr (a 70-67 preseason victory and a 78-53 loss Friday in the Brea 
semifinals). 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Sunny Hills' height advantage was the difference. 
All-tournament selection Terry Mann, Sunny Hills' 6-foot-7 junior forward, 
scored a game-high 26 points before fouling out with 5:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills guard Dominic Carnesi added 11 points and swingman Matt Hopkins, 
who had nine points, made nine of 10 free throws down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Brea (4-9) was led by guard Matt Savala, who scored 12 points off the bench, 
including two three-point baskets. A three-pointer by Savala gave Brea a 51-49 
lead at the end of the third quarter before Sunny Hills pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Drew Hubbard and Doug Yeo each had 10 points for Brea. 
</P>
<P>
In other consolation-round games: 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 68, Whittier Christian 66 -- Guard Ryan Kaneko scored 15 to lead La 
Habra to an overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
Compton 78, Sonora 60 -- Wilson Huang led Sonora with 23 points, but Compton 
had four players in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
St. John Bosco 78, El Dorado 68 -- Brett Tomko of El Dorado scored 22 points in 
the consolation championship and had 116 in the tournament. Brian Loyd scored 
11 for El Dorado (6-6).

With six minutes remaining and Buena Park leading by 10 points, El Modena's 
struggling offense got a second wind Saturday night in the championship game of 
the Carl's Jr. Century Basketball Tournament at Century High School. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena found new life when Buena Park began to commit a rash of turnovers 
that allowed the Vanguards to tie the score at the end of regulation and beat 
the Coyotes, 52-46, in overtime for the tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked up defensively and did some things really different offensively," El 
Modena Coach Tim Tivenan said. "Buena Park shut off our passing lanes really 
well and stopped us most of the game, so we started doing more screening and 
setting things up a little better." 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park (8-5) led the entire game behind center Richard Harvey, who finished 
with 23 points on 11 of 14 shooting, and with help from guards Prentice Johnson 
and Chris Stone, who plugged up the Vanguard offense. 
</P>
<P>
As the Coyotes led, 39-29, El Modena (9-5) started capitalizing on the Coyotes' 
fourth-quarter turnovers and trailed, 44-42, after Bob Baytosh's three-point 
basket with 36 seconds remaining. After another Buena Park turnover, Mike 
Terry's eight-foot baseline jumper at 1:01 tied the score, 44-44, to send the 
game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Terry hit the first basket with 1:20 remaining in overtime and added a pair of 
free throws with 38 seconds left for a 50-46 lead. Terry was named MVP for the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 80, Loara 67 -- Fullerton (7-6) relied on balanced scoring to offset 
the firepower of Loara's Tes Whitlock to capture the third-place title. Pete 
Quis scored 17 points and Craig Olsen and Chris Hartshorn had 16 points each 
for the Indian. Whitlock scored 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul 58, Westminster 52 -- Greg Gomez and Brandon Ertle scored 16 points 
each to lead the Swordsmen (4-7) over the Lions, who were led by Jesse Gomez 
(15) in the consolation championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Century 66, Newport Harbor 64 -- The host Centurions (7-4) upset the Sailors 
with 27-point burst in the fourth quarter. Sophomore Darvin Thompson led 
Century with 30 points. Huy Nguyen and Justin McIntee led the Sailors (8-6) 
with 35 and 21 points respectively.

Rancho Santiago College began the week as the top-ranked men's basketball team 
in the state, but figured to face two strong challenges over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons withstood both and fortified their ranking with a 109-84 victory over 
Los Angeles City, the state's No. 10 team, Saturday in the championship game of 
the Rancho Santiago Holiday Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (18-1) rolled past No. 13 Santa Monica, 103-84, in one 
semifinal Friday night. L.A. City (15-3) beat No. 2 Long Beach, 97-91, in the 
other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Rancho Santiago went on a 14-0 run to take a 14-2 lead that 
established the tone and left L.A. City stunned. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City recovered a bit and cut the lead to 16-8, but got no closer. Rancho 
Santiago led, 51-36, at the half and just kept rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Every Rancho Santiago starter was in double figures as the starters combined 
for 89 points. Erik Martin, the tournament's most valuable player, led the team 
with 22 points and Corie Blount added 21. Blount had 13 rebounds and Martin 
added 10. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Greene and Brett Pagett scored 17 each and LaVern Broadnax added 12. 
Greene and Blount also were picked to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons shot 59.2% (42 for 71) in the game and tied a school record with 12 
three-pointers in 20 tries. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation championship game: 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 74, Mt. San Antonio 64 -- Edmond Johnson made six free throws and 
Ray Ankton four in the final two minutes for Saddleback (9-7). 
</P>
<P>
Mt. San Antonio had cut the lead to 62-61 with 3:46 left, but didn't score 
again until there was 14 seconds left in the game. Ankton had 17 points, Matt 
Thompson 15 and Johnson 14 for the Gauchos. STEVE KRESAL

AGGIES ACKNOWLEDGE THEY RAN UP SCORE ON COUGARS

Keith McAfee, Texas A&amp;M running back, dashed toward the Brigham Young 
sideline Saturday night after the Holiday Bowl, laughing and waving his arms, 
imploring the Cougar players to stay around for the award ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, ya'll, where are you going?" he said. "Stay around for your trophy. 
Don't be like that." 
</P>
<P>
The BYU players just glared at him and the rest of the Aggie players and kept 
on walking to the locker room. Only a few bothered to stop and offer 
congratulations, but when they did, a Cougar assistant yelled at them, "Hey, 
(bleep) those guys. Don't shake hands. Get in here." 
</P>
<P>
So while the Holiday Bowl officials smiled, handing out trophies, the Cougars 
were in the locker room, steaming. 
</P>
<P>
When you get beat 65-14, suffering the worst defeat in school history, watching 
the Aggies throwing passes and pulling out trick plays late in the fourth 
quarter, you tend to get a little irritated. 
</P>
<P>
Even Brigham Young Coach LaVell Edwards, normally a gracious man in victories 
as well as defeats, wasn't quite in the congratulatory mood either. He never 
shook hands with R.C. Slocum, Texas A&amp;M coach, and instead spoke only with 
Bob Toledo, offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Just what exactly did he say? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say he didn't have a very good Mormon word for me," Toledo said. 
"Even if I told you the word, it wouldn't get in your newspaper anyway." 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing to get beat; it's another to be embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
And the Aggies, humiliating BYU in every phase of the game, weren't going to 
win friends by trying to score every time they touched the ball. If they had 
another 15 minutes, there's little doubt Texas A&amp;M would have tried to 
score 100. 
</P>
<P>
So, did the Aggies deliberately try to run up the score? 
</P>
<P>
You better believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we heard about when we got here was how good BYU was, and how 
we were lucky to be here," said Aggie linebacker William Thomas, the defensive 
MVP of the game. "Well, we wanted to prove that a team like BYU doesn't belong 
on the same field as Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think we proved that, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
Oh yeah, no one among the crowd of 61,441 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium will 
ever dispute that. The Aggies compiled 680 yards compared to the Cougars' 185. 
They had 356 yards rushing and the Cougars had minus-12. And Texas A&amp;M even 
had more passing yards, 324-197? 
</P>
<P>
"That's all we heard about was Ty Detmer this, Ty Detmer that," Thomas said. "I 
don't know about everybody else, but I got pretty sick hearing about that guy. 
</P>
<P>
"So we decided to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Thomas separated Detmer's left shoulder with a 
devastating hit. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, linebacker Anthony Williams took care of the other 
shoulder. Not even Ty Detmer can do much with two separated shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer wound up completing just 11 passes in 23 attempts for 120 yards. It was 
his lowest yardage total since his freshman year, when he passed for 45 yards 
in 1988 against San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he would have done anything if he stayed in the game," Toledo 
said. "We had him running for his life as it was." 
</P>
<P>
Said Chris Crooms, Texas A&amp;M defensive back, who had the responsibility of 
covering Cougar All-America tight end Chris Smith: "He didn't show me anything. 
All the receivers in our conference are faster than these guys. It was pretty 
easy. No surprises." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kevin Smith, Croom's sidekick: "Really, once we got on the field, they 
were easy." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic, the Aggies ain't. But if BYU was upset about their manners, Toledo 
explained, the the Cougars should have kept their own mouths shut. 
</P>
<P>
"We read in the newspapers how they said they wanted to play a more formidable 
opponent than us," Toledo said. "They said they wish they were playing one that 
was ranked. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a mistake. That was a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"R.C. reminded them about that every chance he could. You might say we were 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
Said Slocum: "There was a lot of talk about us not being good enough to be in 
this bowl game. The Holiday Bowl showed a lot of confidence in us by inviting 
us. Well, we didn't want any doubt." 
</P>
<P>
And for those that were critical of the Aggies' rout, Slocum began reciting 
some of BYU's blowouts this season and took a rip at the Cougars' tactics in 
helping Detmer pad his stats during his Heisman Trophy campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched games with Ty Detmer," Slocum said, "and there's been a bunch of 
stats that Ty Detmer got in games that, in my opinion, were out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Said Edwards: "I'm not going to get into all that, but we got our butts kicked. 
No one's ever going to argue that."

RODEO STORY: LATEST SIGN THAT RICH GETTING RICHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Rodeo Drive stores apparently aren't among the retailers worrying about 
holiday sales, "The R Word? Rodeo, Dahling," (Dec. 14.) 
</P>
<P>
Is that a surprise? Isn't it a fact that the rich are getting richer and the 
poor are getting poorer! The Reagan legacy of the '80s.

COMPUTERS AREN'T CURE-ALL, BUT THEY CAN DO SOME EDUCATIONAL TASKS BETTER THAN 
TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Schrage's tirade includes so much misinformation that the validity of 
his conclusion was probably lost. 
</P>
<P>
He accurately assessed the error of computer junkies' obsession with the 
machines as education's panacea. The problem is exacerbated by the hype that 
computer skills must be taught if the work force is to be "competitive in the 
global, technologically driven economy." Computerphobia is the greatest 
impediment of technology. But the generation born in the 1960s was the last to 
have computerphobes in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Though they are attractive to students, it will be years before machines with 
the capability to interact comprehensively with students will be available at 
reasonable costs. Beyond costs is the question of desirability. 
</P>
<P>
I manage a computer lab and I believe that students should always be grouped at 
computers, never interacting alone with the machine. 
</P>
<P>
Computer labs are rarely given the extras that Schrage associates with them: 
"teaching assistants, community volunteers, software company representatives 
and bright-eyed graduate students." These extras are generally assigned to the 
classrooms based on need determined by class size, teacher proficiency, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Both Schrage's examples of technological failure are probably wrong. I believe 
that language labs and calculators are successful, but often are incorrectly 
applied (or not used at all in the case of calculators). I am a product of the 
language lab, and I'm extremely comfortable with my knowledge of German as a 
result. I wish more teachers had the foresight to see the freedom from tedium 
calculators offer. 
</P>
<P>
Using the SAT as a reference point indicates Schrage's misunderstanding of that 
test. The SAT is not based on enduring standards of performance, but changes in 
content depending on the scores on previous exams. It essentially gets tougher 
as time goes on. To accommodate the "best" performers, it creates a larger gap 
between the "best" and the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
Schrage states that computers "don't quite fit into the hurly-burly 
interactions of a class filled with 25 children of different talents and 
temperaments." Not true. They fit quite well -- even in classes of up to 40 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Great programs exist that teach basic skills such as writing and access vast 
quantities of information in minimal time -- the primary consideration for the 
use of the computer.

CULVER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUITS FAIL TO HALT CONSTRUCTION OF MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight-foot-tall construction barricades are going up, and the former helicopter 
factory is being demolished at the site of Marina Place, a regional shopping 
mall planned on Washington Boulevard, just east of Lincoln Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The demolition is proceeding despite lawsuits aimed at blocking the project at 
the western tip of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles and the Venice Town Council last week appealed a 
judge's ruling in October that Culver City had complied with the California 
Environmental Quality Act in approving the $160-million mall. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and the Venice community group say Culver City did not adequately 
consider the mall's impact on traffic and air quality, particularly in the Los 
Angeles neighborhoods that are on three sides of the development. 
</P>
<P>
A second lawsuit, by the Coastal Area Support Team, says the 
1-million-square-foot mall will restrict access to the coast. The COAST board 
and the developers plan to meet in January. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Bowen, attorney for the Coastal Area Support Team and the Venice Town 
Council, said that a key objection is the traffic that would be generated by 
the mall. According to an environmental impact report, Marina Place will 
generate 31,000 vehicle trips on weekdays, 40,030 trips on Saturdays and up to 
56,000 on Saturdays during the Christmas shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the demolition of the vacant buildings will occur after the New Year 
and will take about 3 1/2 months, according to the developers, Prudential 
Insurance Co. and Melvin Simon &amp; Associates. The 2 1/2-year construction 
process could begin in the fall if legal challenges are resolved, Marina Place 
spokesman Carl Haglund said.

MERCHANTS DONATE TO POLICE BIKE PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fledgling police bike patrol program in Hollywood has received a boost from 
local merchants and property owners, who have contributed more than $17,000 to 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
The contributions, raised at a December fund-raiser, will go toward buying 
bikes, outfits and other gear for the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood 
Division bike patrol unit. 
</P>
<P>
The donations will provide funds for at least 14 members of the unit to pedal 
on and around Hollywood Boulevard at least five nights a week, according to 
Nina Greenberg, a consultant to area merchants. 
</P>
<P>
A similar program is under way in West Hollywood and other parts of the 
Westside.

LAWSUITS FLY OVER CIVIC CENTER COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legal battles over the cost of the final phase of the Beverly Hills Civic 
Center have only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief filed just before Christmas, the J.A. Jones Construction Co. said 
that it has been paid just more than $61 million on costs of almost $75 million 
to build the library, police station and a set of outdoor courtyards. 
</P>
<P>
The firm blamed the city for extensive delays and changes that eventually drove 
the total cost of the Civic Center to an estimated $120 million, more than 
twice original projections. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in December, the city filed its own claim for $8 million from Jones, 
charging fraud, negligence and breach of contract on the part of the general 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides are talking with a mediator to try to resolve their dispute, 
which is expected to take years before it gets to court.

CHANNEL GATEWAY SUFFERS SETBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After racing to win government approvals this year, the $400-million Channel 
Gateway project near Marina del Rey has been slowed by unsettled economic 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic shoemaker L.A. Gear, which last summer was negotiating a long-term 
lease for all of Channel Gateway's office space, has abandoned those plans. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's third-largest athletic shoe company has reported lower profits 
this year despite higher sales. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Ventrudo, L.A. Gear's chief financial officer, said last week that 
leasing the high-rise office building was "not advisable at this time" because 
of the economic environment and changes in bank financing. 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, Channel Gateway developer Jerome Snyder said that in the 
spring he plans to start lining up other tenants for the 314,000-square-foot 
office building. Snyder has said that having long-term leases is critical to 
obtaining the financing to build the office complex. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder also is looking for financing to build the first of two 16-story 
condominium towers planned for the Lincoln Boulevard site. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, construction crews have been working to drive pilings that 
will support the project's 544-unit apartment complex. The four-story apartment 
buildings are being built with $67 million in tax-exempt financing. Twenty 
percent of the units have been reserved for low-income tenants.

"In the early 1980s, I devoted several years to doing street murals in the 
south of France," Elliot said. "I was commissioned by the city of Cannes to do 
something with an environmental theme, and I did a mural on air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"An artist's mind is always open to people and problems," he said, "but it's 
sometimes difficult to work in urban settings because of noise, traffic and 
pollution."

THEY'RE OLDER AND SLOWER BUT SOFTBALL KEEPS THEM GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So how have the Long Beach Snappers been doing in the city's over-55 slow-pitch 
softball league? 
</P>
<P>
"Terrible," their worried, chain-smoking skipper Walt Downen said one Saturday 
afternoon at Joe Rodgers Field. "Same old guys. But we're all older, slower and 
don't hit as good." 
</P>
<P>
The Snappers, with a 4-8 record, are getting ready to play their big rival, Joe 
Bravo's, who seem pretty formidable even with a long-bearded second baseman who 
looks like Methuselah. 
</P>
<P>
"I better warm up," says Iz Perrucio, 70, the Snappers' pitcher, a retired 
hairdresser whose own wavy silver hair gives him the appearance of an aging 
film idol. 
</P>
<P>
Perrucio and most of his teammates have been with the Snappers since the league 
was formed eight years ago. They know that a fate worse than the disabled list 
always looms. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had one pass away every year," the pitcher says. 
</P>
<P>
"Who passed away last year?" Downen, 71, asks him. 
</P>
<P>
"Moe Schiller," Perrucio answers, mentioning an outfielder who was 64. 
</P>
<P>
And Joe de la Cruz, a graceful outfielder even in his mid-70s, died of a heart 
attack two years ago while putting on his uniform to go to a batting cage with 
his grandson. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they might have died sooner, had it not been for this," Perrucio 
suggests. "This league is the best thing that ever happened to us. 'When I 
play, I think, 'Geez, I can't be 70, no way.' Who knows, if we weren't out 
here, we might feel 70." 
</P>
<P>
This year-round league has 12 teams from around Southern California -- six, 
including the Snappers, in the minors division where the players are mostly in 
their 60s and 70s, and six, including Long Beach's Joe Bravo's, in the majors 
division, where most of the players are barely 55 and still strong enough to 
hit a ball 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Some teams are said to have big egos and play for blood, but the Snappers are 
not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"An umpire asked me before one of our games if we were going to kick butt," 
Perrucio says. "I don't think about that. I play ball, have a good time and 
thank the Lord I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of spectators have gathered, so business is not booming in the 
snack shack run by Red Meairs, longtime owner of the famous Long Beach 
Nitehawks fast-pitch team. 
</P>
<P>
Meairs sells coffee and soft drinks, but a feisty old-timer named Maui Batson 
prefers beer, which he brings in a cooler. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of beer and baseball keep you young," maintains Batson, 75, who manages 
the league's Maui Bombers and like most of the men has been a lifelong 
ballplayer. "I play ball and then get drunk." 
</P>
<P>
He drinks from a Budweiser can and watches the Snappers warm up. The sun pours 
in at enough of a slant to get under the bill of this former tool-and-die man's 
soiled cap and into his bloodshot eyes. 
</P>
<P>
He closes these eyes, reliving the memory of playing as a kid in Chicago under 
the elevated trains, with sponge balls stolen from Kresge's. "We'd play in 
vacant lots," he says. "We'd ask the owner if we could tear down the weeds and 
set up a ball field. Then two weeks later they'd sell the lot and we had to 
find another one." 
</P>
<P>
Batson is upset because teams like the Snappers must play major teams like 
Bravo's and the games are often called after five innings for being more than 
15-run mismatches. "You might get to bat only twice, so some guys don't show up 
because they don't want to waste a Saturday," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But on the other side of the backstop that Batson leans against, the Snappers 
are set to try to make this Saturday memorable. Wearing blue and white jerseys 
and red hats, they select their bats. 
</P>
<P>
"We're outmatched," says third baseman Tom Mackie of Lakewood, whose face has 
the color and texture of a well-worn fielder's glove. 
</P>
<P>
Mackie, "too damn old" at 66, jokes that he can't hit or field. Then, as the 
game's leadoff batter, he lines a single into the all-dirt outfield, starting a 
rally that gives the Snappers a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The only spectator in a little section of blue bleachers behind the backstop is 
Eddie Masters of Whittier, wife of Sid Masters, the oldest Snapper at 75. She 
sits bundled up under a suddenly sunless sky and keeps score. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only (wife) who usually shows," she says. "I figure why stay home? I 
haven't missed many of his games in the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
She records a Bravo's base hit, then goes on: "We have seven grandsons and . . 
. Get it, Sid! (as he catches a fly ball in left field) . . . seven 
great-grandsons and three great-granddaughters." 
</P>
<P>
Bravo's takes the lead with four runs in its half of the first inning, causing 
Eddie to observe, "Oh, boy, are they ever hitting us." 
</P>
<P>
But the Snappers keep hitting back and hold an 8-4 lead midway through the 
fundamentally sound game. Mackie triples, running with a swiftness that belies 
his years. When he eventually scores, he receives simple handshakes that seem 
outdated in an era of high fives. He then puts on a blue jacket and smokes a 
Pall Mall, which he cups between drags as if trying to get away with something. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Snappers smoke, but none more than Downen, the manager, who needs 
to calm his nerves because with his team, he knows no lead is safe. 
</P>
<P>
With the Snappers leading 10-4, Perrucio is bailed out by a double play in the 
sixth inning. There is something hopeful in watching two 60-year-olds turn a 
DP, and shortstop Carl Ashford and second baseman Charlie Sarver do this with 
crisp precision in the bottom of the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Downen had the good sense to add Ashford and Sarver, both former minor league 
baseball players, to the roster. "When you make a play like that, it's the same 
feeling you had as a kid," Ashford says when he returns to the bench. "You 
can't imagine how much fun this is." 
</P>
<P>
The Snappers are still ahead, 10-4, with three outs to go. Perrucio takes the 
mound for the bottom of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
It turns cold and begins to rain. Batson, out of beer, leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Masters drops a fly that allows Bravo's to start a rally. The lead is 10-8 with 
a runner on first. But a base hit to left gets by Masters, who has to chase it 
to the wall while the batter goes all the way to third. It is 10-9, and then 
10-10 when the next batter gets an infield hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn," says Downen, but Perrucio gets the third out and the game goes to extra 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Snappers come out swinging -- Mackie gets his fourth hit, Ashford his 
fifth, then Leroy DeHaven, who lost a lung to cancer, triples. Dick Heath 
singles, Sarver triples and, following an error, it is 15-10 with, again, three 
outs to go. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo's comes back with a run and has two runners on with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
Downen is so cold and nervous and his hands shake so wildly that he gives up 
trying to light one final cigarette. He looks out to center field and sees Dave 
Lambert spear the final out. 
</P>
<P>
The Snappers shake hands with the team they have defeated for the first time in 
four years, then grab their bats and disperse quickly. They need no lengthy 
celebration, just Perrucio's parting words: "The old men still have it."

A squad of ROTC students at Cal State Long Beach spent a recent Tuesday 
preparing for war. 
</P>
<P>
They attended classes on military history and troop management, then stood at 
attention in a campus quad to hear announcements and salute their superiors. 
After marching in formation out to an athletic field, they performed a series 
of exercises, including push-ups and sit-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, the cadets and officials of the Reserve Officer Training Corps 
have been under verbal attack -- from an outspoken group of students and 
professors who want the program banned from campus because it discriminates 
against homosexuals, a violation of university policy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the critics, Jack Munsee, a physics professor, recently persuaded the 
campus Academic Senate, an advisory group of elected faculty representatives, 
to initiate proceedings that could eventually result in the program's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want it said of me that I was silent over this injustice," Munsee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
ROTC officials, most of whom are in the military, say they are following 
Defense Department rules banning gays from military service. Homosexual 
students are allowed to take ROTC classes for academic credit at Cal State Long 
Beach and most other colleges, but they are not eligible for the $100-per-month 
stipend that most upper-division participants receive. They also are not 
allowed to become regular cadets in their third year, the time when most 
participants promise to become military officers upon graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"We serve two masters, a civilian boss on campus and a military boss in 
(Washington)," said Lt. Col. Andrew Peterson, a professor of military science 
and director of the university's Army ROTC. "What we have here is a conflict 
between the Department of Defense and the university, with the ROTC in the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear which master has more clout. "I have to enforce government 
policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
ROTC students and administrators said their program provides a valuable service 
and ought to be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson pointed out that the ROTC contributes a stream of liberally educated 
officers with roots in civilian life. ROTC students and administrators also 
argue that an ROTC ban would discriminate against students who depend on the 
program for scholarships and to pave the way for a military career. Many of 
these students are minorities, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The ROTC controversy first erupted at Cal State Northridge, then spread to 
other California State University campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge Faculty Senate voted to eliminate the ROTC program 
there because of its adherence to the Defense Department's anti-gay policy. 
Northridge President James W. Cleary eventually rejected the recommendation, 
citing an opinion by university lawyers that there was no legal basis for doing 
away with ROTC. 
</P>
<P>
Cleary wrote that, although he personally found the anti-homosexual policy 
"deplorable" and worthy of abolition, "banning an academic program simply 
because we are in disagreement with a policy of a profession which is serviced 
by this program is antithetical to the nature of an open university." 
</P>
<P>
The issue then was taken up by the state Academic Senate, consisting of faculty 
representatives from all 19 California State University campuses. The group 
adopted a resolution condemning the Defense Department and urged faculties of 
each campus to begin taking steps to remove the ROTC if the department policy 
is not rescinded by Jan. 1. Local ROTC officials say they have received no 
indication the department plans to change its policy. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty groups at Cal State Hayward, Cal State Pomona and Cal State Bakersfield 
have also passed anti-ROTC resolutions. One private institution, Pitzer College 
in Claremont, banned ROTC earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, each university president will decide ROTC's fate. 
</P>
<P>
Campus officer training programs throughout the country were attacked in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s by opponents of the Vietnam War. Some programs were 
closed, and others experienced dwindling enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
The first ROTC programs were established only six years ago at Cal State Long 
Beach, however. About 150 students participate in Army and Air Force ROTC 
programs on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Physics professor Munsee led the ROTC protest, and found support among members 
of the campus Gay and Lesbian Student Union, who cited studies that they said 
indicate that the presence of homosexuals in the military would not hamper 
national defense. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as there is discrimination going on for one person or small group of 
people, then it's possible for discrimination to go on against others," said 
Heather Haskell, the organization's treasurer. "We should fight discrimination 
on all levels." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, after a spirited debate, the campus Academic Senate approved 
the resolution endorsing the state faculty's position and initiating the 
procedure for discontinuing ROTC. 
</P>
<P>
In accordance with university procedure, the group voted to form a committee to 
hold hearings on the issue and submit a report next fall to university 
president Curtis L. McCray, who will make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
McCray says he has an open mind on the subject. "We are attempting to give 
everybody an equal shake and if any of our programs, either directly or de 
facto, have impact on students because of their differences, then (those 
programs) have to be looked at." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the ROTC students continue their program. Although many say 
that they would have no personal qualms about serving on military duty with 
open homosexuals, opinion is somewhat divided on whether the government's 
anti-gay policy ought to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're a legitimate minority," said Joe Ingram, a 26-year-old 
political science major in the last semester of the four-year program. "These 
people have chosen to be a minority and therefore shouldn't receive the kind of 
benefits that legitimate minorities receive." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Pantano, a 28-year-old fine arts major who already has been commissioned 
as an Army lieutenant, disagrees. "Personally, I don't think sexual orientation 
should have anything to do with it," she said. "There are already a lot of 
slime-ball heterosexuals in the service." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cadets acknowledge, however, that they are a bit concerned about 
ROTC's uncertain future on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"If worse comes to worse," said Joselito Sto Thomas, 28, "we'll just go to UCLA 
and drill over there. (But) that would be a major hassle."

THE DARK KNIGHT OF THE GRAPHIC NOVEL RETURNS; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARTIST-WRITER TEAM OF FRANK MILLER AND LYNN VARLEY TOOK THEIR TIME WITH 
"ELEKTRA LIVES AGAIN" BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BREAK AWAY FROM SOME COMIC BOOK 
CONVENTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, Colker is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last novel by the team of Frank Miller and Lynn Varley sold more than 1 
million copies. Critics called it "revolutionary," "groundbreaking" and 
"beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
But even if you are an avid bibliophile, there's a good chance that you have 
never heard of them. Miller and Varley work in the genre known as the graphic 
novel, a grown-up term for the comic book. Their last book, the revisionist 
"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns," was by far the best-selling graphic novel 
ever. It was an anomaly in a field where almost all sales are made in specialty 
comic book stores and even the most successful books rarely sell more than 
200,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a mass audience, and it is probably better that way," said Miller, 
who is the better-known half of the team. He creates the story lines and does 
the key drawings; Varley does backgrounds and color work. "If we were working 
in a mass media like film or television, we would probably not have the freedom 
to do things the way we want," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
"This new book -- our first together since 'Dark Knight' -- is a very personal 
piece of work. For better or worse, it is exactly what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Their new book is "Elektra Lives Again," the third volume featuring the Elektra 
character created by Miller in 1980. Published by Epic Comics, the book hit 
stores earlier this month in a hardcover edition costing $24.95. It's in a 
larger format and on paper of far better quality than regular comics. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the most lavishly produced graphic novel we have ever done," said Carol 
Kalish, vice president of direct sales at Marvel Comics. Marvel puts out the 
Epic line, aimed at an audience much older than the traditional comics buyer. 
"The most expensive, too. We have used a luxurious paper, an odd size to 
accommodate the artwork best, expensive inks and a production process that was 
costly." 
</P>
<P>
The initial print run of about 75,000 was conservative, Kalish said, because of 
fears about the weakening economy. But "we have had an unbelievable advance 
reaction," she said, noting that the book in hardcover will be sold in a 
handful of Waldenbooks outlets, in addition to the comics stores. Some 
retailers had so many advance orders that they were asking about a second 
printing even before the first was shipped. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Liebowitz, owner of Golden Apple, a Melrose Avenue shop specializing in 
comics, said that two weeks before the book was scheduled to arrive, he already 
had orders for 300 copies. "We usually sell a total of only 50 or 100 copies of 
this kind of book," Liebowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, a clerk behind the main counter at Golden Apple was fielding one 
of the many calls that day asking when the book would be in. "Hey, Bill!" the 
clerk called out. "Can we mail-order to Australia?" 
</P>
<P>
Miller, the object of all this cult attention, is a soft-spoken, slight, 
chain-smoking man with short-cropped hair who grew up in Montpelier, Vt. Except 
for a few art classes in high school, he is mostly self-taught. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years ago, he arrived in New York determined to work in comic books. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been reading, drawing and writing comic books as far back as I can 
remember," said Miller, 33, sitting on the patio of the Hollywood Hills home to 
which he and Varley have just moved. "When I got to New York and started to do 
a little work, I just bugged successful cartoonists to look at my work and 
comment on it. One of them, Neil Adams, who was a really big name in the field, 
spent a lot of time with me." 
</P>
<P>
Miller got occasional work as an artist at some of the smaller comics houses, 
doing work on stories in the "super-hero" mold. "When I started, just about all 
anybody was doing was guys in tights," he said with a laugh. The outlook for 
the business was not bright. "The common wisdom I must have heard 100 times was 
that comic books would be around only three or four more years," he said. 
"Sales were dreadfully low." 
</P>
<P>
But the comic book business took an upturn, mostly, Miller believes, because it 
tossed off stringent censorship rules that had been instituted during the 
1950s. In 1979, he got his first big job at Marvel Comics, writing and drawing 
stories for a series starring Daredevil, a super-hero who had been accidentally 
exposed to a big dose of radiation at a young age. The exposure blinded him, 
but it heightened his other senses to superhuman levels. (When in his 
super-hero mode, Daredevil wears red tights.) 
</P>
<P>
It was Miller's work on that series -- in which he employed arresting graphics, 
an imaginative use of panels and story lines steeped in martial arts mysticism 
-- that brought him to the attention of comic book aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
Into that series he introduced Elektra, a beautiful Greek woman, as Daredevil's 
lover. Their affair was broken off when Elektra, shaken by the murder of her 
father by terrorists, turns bad and joins a band of ninjas to become an 
assassin-for-hire. 
</P>
<P>
The stories were collected in a paperback book, "The Elektra Saga." 
</P>
<P>
"I was influenced by samurai movies," Miller said. "And Japanese comics." 
</P>
<P>
Those influences were even more apparent in "Ronin," a series he created for DC 
Comics about a 13th-Century samurai who is reborn into the 21st Century. The 
series was not a big success, but it did mark his first teaming with Varley. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked together before we were a couple," said Varley, taking a break from 
staining some bookshelves for the living room. "I had worked with other 
writers, but I could never get as elaborate as I could with Frank." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Miller revived the Elektra character for a strange and dreamlike 
series. Illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz in a lurid and highly varied style that 
ranged from arch realism to sketchy drawings, these dense "Elektra Assassin" 
stories expressed an apocalyptic vision of a world contaminated by greed and 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as pessimistic but far more successful was his 1986 "Batman" series, 
illustrated by Varley and Klaus Janson. When collected and sold as a paperback, 
it became, by far, the most successful graphic novel of all time and one of the 
few to cross over into mainstream book chains. (Marvel hopes to ship "Elektra 
Lives Again" to book chains in volume when it goes into paperback, probably 
late next year.) 
</P>
<P>
The stories feature a middle-aged, slightly gone-to-seed Batman who rallies for 
one more major battle against the forces of evil. Although Miller had no 
official connection with the 1989 "Batman" film, several critics suggested that 
the filmmakers had been influenced by his dark view of the super-hero. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" did, however, get Miller into the film business. The producer of 
"RoboCop 2," who was a fan of "The Dark Knight," hired him to write the movie. 
It got less than a welcome reception from critics, but Miller enjoyed the work 
and was hired to write a draft of "RoboCop 3," which is scheduled to begin 
shooting in Los Angeles next month. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, word spread through the comic book world that Miller was resurrecting 
Elektra for another book. "If you know the comic book market," Kalish said, 
"you know that from the day of the announcement on, fans started to go into 
comic book stores to ask when it would be coming out. The anticipation started 
to build. It was like 'Star Wars' fans waiting for the sequel." 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Varley took their time with "Elektra Lives Again." They wanted to 
break away from some comic book conventions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Daredevil is a major character in the plot, but he is only shown 
as his mundane, everyday alter ego, Matt Murdock. "He never puts on the 
tights," Miller said. "I only wanted one element in the book that was 
fantastic, and that was Elektra. She is the one who is colorful, an icon 
running all through the story." 
</P>
<P>
The plot was less rooted in martial arts lore and more driven by the emotional 
makeup of the characters. And the drawings, although vivid and complex, were 
more subtle, less flashy. One example is a full-page panel that shows, from 
above, Murdock rising from his bed and descending a long, winding staircase. 
</P>
<P>
To show the passage of time, his image is repeated at several different points 
on the stairway. This also conveys a disturbing feeling that Murdock is 
descending ever closer to a fateful encounter with his archenemies. 
</P>
<P>
"It took seven layers of drawings to get the right perspective," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest breakthrough came in the use of color. "By the time we did the 
book, Lynn and I had done about 600 pages together," he said. "We knew each 
other so well that there was a trust and encouragement that gave her room to 
work in terms of the lighting, characters, flesh tones." 
</P>
<P>
Miller only did the line drawings of characters and settings. "When people see 
my drawings, they are surprised to see how little there is to them," he said. 
"Lynn added everything else, and that changed the scenes in a major way, 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the storyteller, that's his job," said Varley, who did the book 
primarily in watercolors. 
</P>
<P>
The colors are luminescent at times but not garish. And the overall look is 
clean, uncluttered. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I would get caught up in the paintings and make them too 
complicated. It would get in the way of the story," she said. "I would go back 
later and take some of the complications out." 
</P>
<P>
Varley, who is far less famous in comic book circles than Miller, is described 
by friends as being shy about her work. But as she put down her staining brush 
and looked at a galley copy of "Elektra Lives Again," she obviously viewed it 
with pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to work with anyone else but Frank," she said. "Maybe I'll do 
some painting now, for myself. This gives me the confidence to go ahead and 
try." 
</P>
<P>
Miller goes to his drawing table, set up amid boxes in the dining room, where 
he has turned out the first two pages of their next graphic novel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a film noir kind of story," he said, "the kind I had always wanted to do. 
When I started in this business, it didn't seem there would be a chance to do 
it. But things have opened up so much." 
</P>
<P>
The series, with its epic angles and strong cityscapes that are Miller 
trademarks, is called "Basin City." 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," he said, "that is the name of a fictional city where it takes 
place. But when you see it on a sign, the 'B' and the 'A' will always be 
blocked out."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Deukmejian was a governor who insisted on sticking to his campaign 
promises, but otherwise his agenda seemed limited. 
</P>
<P>
He was committed to courts, prisons and fiscal frugality but he fought with 
schools and cut human services. 
</P>
<P>
He was honest in an era of glaring corruption, but he was not a strong leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I often wondered why he was in politics because he wasn't your classic 
politician," said Steven A. Merksamer, a close friend and former chief of staff 
to Deukmejian, whose tenure as California's 35th governor ends Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a man of tremendous virtue, a man of tremendous personal integrity, a 
man who says what he means and means what he says. Because he's personally 
honest, he was reluctant to engage in deal-making. If the world were full of 
George Deukmejians, it would be a better place." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the world is not that way. Especially the political world. 
Merksamer, in a few succinct sentences of praise, touched on the flip side of 
Deukmejian: His unwillingness to compromise. So the verdict is split on his 
legacy as governor. 
</P>
<P>
As he had promised voters, Deukmejian built more prisons to lock up more 
criminals, toughened sentences and appointed tough judges, resisted tax 
increases and held down spending. He also poured more money into public 
schools, as promised, but his funding commitment gradually declined. Critics 
contend that his Administration failed to adequately prepare California -- 
including its schools, health care, social services and water systems -- for 
the demands of a booming, sprawling, increasingly diverse population. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. No" he is sometimes called, largely a reference to his record veto of 
2,298 bills, roughly one in every six passed by the Democratic-controlled 
Legislature during his two terms. None was overridden. He also vetoed nearly 
1,700 budget items. The Republican governor nixed about $7 billion in proposed 
spending, mainly from health, welfare and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene C. Lee, political scientist at UC Berkeley and a longtime student of 
California government, summed up the retiring governor's legacy this way: 
"George Deukmejian might have been a very good governor in a stable state that 
required basically maintenance government. But a state like California demands 
much more -- a governor who can anticipate problems and address the challenges 
of the future. . . . Californians in the year 2000 will look back and wonder 
where was the leadership in the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian responds to critics by saying they have judged him by their 
standards, not his or the voters', who twice elected him governor. 
</P>
<P>
"They (critics) seem to think you're going to get elected and then you're going 
to carry out their agenda, rather than your own agenda," the governor said in a 
recent interview. "Then they beat up on you when you're just doing what you 
said you were going to do." 
</P>
<P>
As for the common complaint that he lacks vision, Deukmejian said when some 
people "don't see great, big, new, expensive-type programs with big, fancy 
labels on them, they say there's no vision. Well, that's not true. . . . I 
measure progress and success based on the number of opportunities you create 
for people. That doesn't mean you need to have a lot of new programs." 
</P>
<P>
The governor particularly is sensitive to being described as "thin-skinned" and 
"stubborn." A case study came last summer when the governor and the Legislature 
became mired in the longest state budget stalemate in history before 
negotiating a package of higher taxes and spending cuts. The process proved a 
debacle for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I don't feel that I'm stubborn," Deukmejian said. "I try to stick by my 
position and stick by my principles and I feel that's what a leader is supposed 
to do. . . . That's being determined, it's being resolute." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said his biggest success as governor was "staying the course" he set 
as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"Deukmejian is the first governor -- and maybe the last -- to make a strong 
commitment to prisons, to locking up these miserable (criminals) and separating 
them from society, those who otherwise would be breaking into your bedroom 
tonight," said Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), a former Los Angeles police 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
The state had not opened a new prison in 18 years when Deukmejian took office 
in 1983. He quickly launched the biggest prison construction program in the 
nation's history, spending $3.3 billion to build eight penitentiaries -- going 
from 12 to 20 -- and making seven major additions to existing institutions. The 
number of locked-up felons tripled, from about 35,000 to nearly 97,000, leaving 
cells more overcrowded than when Deukmejian began the building. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than any other governor in recent times, Deukmejian will leave a 
lasting imprint on the California judiciary. His most significant legacy as 
governor, many believe, was the reshaping of the state Supreme Court from one 
of the nation's most liberal to a panel solidly controlled by conservatives. 
Not only do his appointees hold five of the seven Supreme Court seats, they 
also fill 55 of the 88 positions on the Court of Appeal. In all, Deukmejian 
named about 1,000 judges. Nearly half the state judiciary is made up of his 
appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Deukmejian's initiatives, the crime rate has barely budged. Critics 
contend the correctional system has gobbled up precious tax dollars that could 
have been spent attacking such root causes of crime as inadequate education, 
health care and job training. 
</P>
<P>
Spending for operation of prisons climbed 310% under Deukmejian, while school 
expenditures increased 115% and allotments for health and welfare programs rose 
98%. Overall, the state budget more than doubled -- as it also had under the 
three previous governors -- rising during Deukmejian's eight years in office by 
120%, from $25.3 billion to $55.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
There is a historical lesson in this: Exploding populations, demands for 
government services and mandated funding guarantees, coupled with inflation, 
force each governor to be a record "tax and spender," no matter how 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian is leaving state government in a financial shambles, reminiscent of 
the way he inherited it from Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. That is casting a 
personal pall on his retirement celebration, intimates say. 
</P>
<P>
When Deukmejian took office, he faced a $1.5-billion budget deficit. He 
adroitly erased it with spending cuts and legislation that authorized private 
borrowing, shoved half the red ink into the next fiscal year and created a 
standby sales tax increase. Californians were spared the tax hike because the 
nation's economy boomed and bailed out Deukmejian with a rush of revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is deja vu. Gov.-elect Pete Wilson is facing a deficit of roughly $1 
billion, plus $6 billion or more of red ink during the next fiscal year. Blame 
the economic slump, not Deukmejian. By the same token, credit the economy -- 
not Deukmejian -- for being the real hero of the state's financial rescue seven 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, never a wordsmith, always enjoyed telling audiences that he had 
brought the state "from IOU to A-OK." A current joke in Sacramento is that 
Wilson is inheriting "an SOS." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, as the governor insists, nobody should have been surprised by his 
actions -- or inaction -- if they had paid attention to his first gubernatorial 
campaign against Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in 1982, or had read anything 
about his one-term stint as attorney general or his 16 years in the Legislature 
before that. Through it all, he was a partisan conservative not given to 
compromise or schmooze, and concerned primarily about law-and-order issues, 
especially the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1982 campaign, Deukmejian emphasized he believed in a government 
that "keeps within its means," "makes protection and safety of its citizens its 
primary task," and allows people "to pull themselves up not because the 
government is there, but because government gets out of their way." He also 
repeatedly opposed raising taxes. It was Ronald Reagan's philosophy without the 
style. 
</P>
<P>
There also was another crucial difference between those two Republican 
governors. Reagan was more pragmatic and more inclined to compromise. He pushed 
through the largest tax increase in the state's history his first year as 
governor in order to resolve an inherited budget crisis. He even talked 
then-Sen. Deukmejian into carrying the legislation. Reagan was a salesman, 
whether his target was a single freshman senator or a statewide television 
audience. Deukmejian as governor seldom tried to sell anything, or so it 
seemed. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the explanation, he didn't lead," said Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan 
(D-Fresno), chairman of the Assembly Health Committee. One after another in 
interviews, legislators portrayed Deukmejian as stubborn, uncommunicative and 
disengaged, though decent and honest. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor did not like to bargain. A vote trade offended his sense of 
integrity," said Senate Minority Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, probably the 
Legislature's most influential and respected Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was Deukmejian aloof, he did not use the "carrot and stick" powers of 
his office. There was little rewarding of friends and punishing of enemies. 
Sometimes, friends felt they were punished. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy is a good example. He was one of only a handful of legislators who 
endorsed Deukmejian over the party establishment candidate, Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, 
in a close race for the 1982 gubernatorial nomination. Ordinarily, that would 
have bought Maddy a small pipeline into the new governor's office. But "no one 
-- and I mean no one -- in the Legislature became an insider after he was 
elected," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never wanted to come out and say I didn't have any clout," the Republican 
leader added. But Maddy acknowledged that he really did not have any with 
Deukmejian. He even had trouble securing gubernatorial appointments to county 
fair boards for his local political allies. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators covet personal attention, particularly from a governor. When they 
did not get much of it from Deukmejian, potentially valuable relationships 
never developed. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't take advantage of the office and people's susceptibility to being 
corrupted by the power and the glory and the glamour of a governor," observed 
Sal Russo, an early Deukmejian adviser who now is a political consultant. "He 
wasn't a personality type, a mingler. His idea was to have a fruit salad at his 
desk and get something done rather than have lunch with some blowhard 
legislator." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Deukmejian, Reagan occasionally invited small groups of legislators over 
to his house, just to play Ping-Pong or hear him tell old Hollywood stories. 
Jerry Brown did not entertain, but often mingled with lawmakers at a couple of 
their nighttime haunts around the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Asked during the interview why he did not socialize more, take legislators to 
dinner, invite them down to his office to chat, or drop by their office -- 
Deukmejian replied: "First of all, we had (mass) dinners every single year for 
legislators. And mind you now, somebody has to pay for these." As for 
"one-on-one stuff," he said, "I don't know how any governor can go one on one 
with 120 legislators. It's just impossible, time-wise." 
</P>
<P>
Because Deukmejian had been a legislator, his sorry relationship with lawmakers 
as governor greatly surprised people -- Deukmejian more than anyone. "I no 
sooner got off the inaugural platform and they were opposing me. It just seemed 
like they went out of their way to be hostile." 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, the Democratic-controlled Legislature sold the governor's 
residence, forcing him to hole up for awhile at a downtown Holiday Inn and then 
reside for 17 months in a modest apartment while commuting on weekends back 
home to his wife and children in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was insulting to the governor to be treated that way," Russo said. Finally, 
a nonprofit foundation bought a ranch-style tract house for Deukmejian to use. 
Now, Wilson will live there. 
</P>
<P>
"The straw that broke the back" for Deukmejian, according to former top aide 
Merksamer, was when the Senate denied confirmation of the governor's choice for 
state finance director, Michael Franchetti. It also rejected Deukmejian's 
appointments of two other cabinet members, although both had been former 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Democrats, in the beginning, had extended any degree of cooperation or 
friendship or anything, I think we would have been able to work a lot more 
cooperatively," Deukmejian said. "And they probably would have wound up, maybe, 
doing better than they feel that they've done." 
</P>
<P>
In his second term, Deukmejian did develop an occasionally successful working 
relationship with the four major legislative leaders. He preferred meeting with 
this group, rather than lower-ranking legislators individually, reasoning that 
these four were the only lawmakers who had enough clout to get bills passed. 
</P>
<P>
Out of such "leadership meetings" came the $18.5-billion, 10-year 
transportation improvement plan -- financed mostly by a 9-cents-per-gallon 
gasoline tax increase -- that voters endorsed last June. Wedded to his anti-tax 
philosophy, "The Iron Duke" had to be "dragged kicking and screaming" -- in the 
words of several people -- into supporting the plan after dwindling revenues 
forced an embarrassing six-month moratorium on all new highway construction. 
</P>
<P>
One highway program that fell victim to Deukmejian's frugality was earthquake 
retrofitting. Short on money, Caltrans initially gave higher priority to other 
projects. Consequently, the strengthening of overpasses and bridges moved at a 
snail's pace, just as it had under the Brown Administration. After the Nimitz 
Freeway collapsed during the Oct. 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake, killing 42 
people, Deukmejian stepped in and ordered Caltrans to give top priority to a 
massive retrofitting program. 
</P>
<P>
"Deukmejian leaves office with a better record in transportation than Jerry 
Brown, but that's primarily because he rallied in the last two years of his 
Administration," said Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin L. Kopp 
(I-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
The governor consistently cut funding for the state Coastal Commission, 
promised more than he delivered on toxic waste cleanup, watched as ground water 
supplies became increasingly contaminated and took a pro-agriculture view of 
pesticides. The governor did negotiate a major legislative package to control 
the growth of solid waste, or garbage. 
</P>
<P>
On the fight against AIDS, opinions are mixed. California's program of AIDS 
research, education and treatment is widely recognized as the finest in the 
world. But some AIDS activists complain that Deukmejian was unwilling to spend 
what was needed. After several years of dramatic increases in AIDS funding, the 
state reduced its spending this fiscal year by 13%. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few social programs launched by Deukmejian was an innovative 
"workfare" project that provides education, job training and work experience 
for welfare recipients. But faced with severe budget problems in the last two 
years, he cut back state funding for this much-vaunted endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian repeatedly slashed state funds for family planning when abortion 
opponents complained that the money was going to clinics that performed 
abortions. "I think it was handled poorly," said the governor's own health 
services director, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer. "I never understood how folks who are 
anti-abortion can also be anti-family planning." 
</P>
<P>
It would be hard to cite a major issue that was handled more poorly than 
education, at least from a political and public relations standpoint. 
Deukmejian came to office proclaiming education to be his top budget priority. 
Schools did fare well during the early years of his Administration. The 
governor signed and funded a landmark education reform bill sponsored by Sen. 
Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill 
Honig. 
</P>
<P>
In his second term, the usually reserved governor got into a caustic, 
name-calling feud with the outspoken, combative schools chief. That, in large 
part, led to successful sponsorship by Honig and the education establishment of 
Proposition 98, guaranteeing elementary and high schools, plus community 
colleges, 40% of the state's general fund. Deukmejian has been attempting to 
dismantle Proposition 98, and Wilson is expected to try. 
</P>
<P>
"There was probably a time when the governor needed to love Honig to death and 
he didn't," said ex-aide Russo. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said bitterly of the debilitating battle: "There was increased 
funding, there were reforms and we were building on that, but despite this, 
Honig comes along and he just keeps saying, 'That's not enough. That's not 
enough. We have to have more. We have to have more.' There was no end to what 
he was demanding. . . . And, of course, all he has to look at is education. He 
doesn't have to consider the demands for all other state services. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you, if you talk to any governor, I don't care who it is, any 
governor, they will tell you that you can never satisfy the educational 
establishment. No matter how much you try, they constantly whine and complain. 
. . . It's very, very unfair treatment." 
</P>
<P>
During Deukmejian's tenure, spending per pupil in elementary and high schools 
rose 13.2%, when adjusted for inflation. Practically all that increase came 
during his first term. By the final two years of his Administration, funding 
per student was declining. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian had a much better relationship with higher education. "We really had 
some very fine budgets," said William B. Baker, a UC Berkeley vice president 
for fiscal matters. Deukmejian recently exempted UC and state universities from 
a $1-billion austerity program he imposed on most of state government. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also is praised for helping to enact legislation banning 
military-style assault weapons and influencing UC and public employee pension 
funds to sever their financial ties with firms doing business in South Africa. 
In each case, Deukmejian dramatically showed that he was capable of reversing 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian is criticized for standing back and watching automobile and health 
insurance premiums skyrocket without really joining the struggle -- so far 
unsuccessful -- to come to grips with the problem. On a smaller scale, he did 
push through legislation creating an earthquake insurance program for 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The business community benefited from Deukmejian, according to California 
Chamber of Commerce President Kirk West. West said the state again became 
hospitable to entrepreneurship after Jerry Brown's shaky "era of limits." West 
lauded Deukmejian for establishing five foreign trade offices and appointing 
judges more sympathetic toward business. 
</P>
<P>
Organized labor generally detested Deukmejian. "Utterly barren of social 
conscience, a man with a 19th-Century mind," is how Jack Henning, crusty head 
of the California Labor Federation, described the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Labor scored a big victory over Deukmejian when he tried to destroy Cal/OSHA, 
arguing that federal occupational safety regulators could fill the void. Labor 
responded by winning passage of a ballot initiative restoring the state agency. 
In Deukmejian's final year as governor, he beat labor on a major issue: gaining 
voter approval of an initiative authorizing the state to lease inmate workers 
to private industry. 
</P>
<P>
Labor, business, the governor and the Legislature all got together for a rare 
period in 1989 to negotiate a sweeping overhaul of California's system for 
compensating injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
When historians look back on Deukmejian, aside from assessing the ups and downs 
of his Administration, they will note a unique political phenomenon: He was the 
only modern California governor who did not want to be president, or even vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Now 62 and hoping to make big money in private enterprise, most likely as a 
lawyer, Deukmejian insists he has no regrets about his gubernatorial adventure. 
"There was never a time when I wasn't ready and desirous of coming to the 
office," he said. "I just thoroughly enjoyed it very, very much. . . . I feel 
very good, very satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
But intimates say he has been counting the days for months and can hardly wait 
until Jan. 7 for some peace and privacy.

BLACK TOWN COUNCILORS SEE A VITAL ROLE FOR THEMSELVES, BUT ACTIVISTS SEE THEM

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let the record show that Joe Mphokeng did not want to be a township councilor 
in the first place. He was closing in on retirement, living comfortably, and he 
did not need the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of black councilors and their families had been killed over the years by 
young radicals who said the councils were puppets of apartheid. But by 1988 the 
government had locked up its opponents, the townships were quiet and Mphokeng's 
friends persuaded him to run. 
</P>
<P>
As he coasted to victory, Mphokeng vowed to use his seat on the Mamelodi Town 
Council to do some good. At first, as he helped constituents caught in the web 
of apartheid and fought development deals that put gold watches on other 
councilors' wrists, Mphokeng thought he was succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
Then the African National Congress was legalized, and it thought otherwise. 
Anti-apartheid leaders in Mamelodi summoned Mphokeng to a meeting in June to 
demand his resignation and, to their surprise, he showed up. But he refused to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, as the Mphokeng family was watching "Dallas" on television, 
a hand grenade crashed through the living room window, rolled under a sofa and 
exploded. Mphokeng's wife, Thembi, and their 12-year-old son, George, were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing left intact that night was Mphokeng's resolve to remain a 
councilor and a wall hanging that read: "Our home is open to God's friends, 
guests and sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Eve, though, after months of threats and fear, Mphokeng 
regretfully resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Black town councils across South Africa are increasingly under siege. Of the 
1,867 black councilors elected in 1988, nearly half have resigned, most of them 
in recent months. This year, six councilors have been assassinated and the 
homes and property of 87 others attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Councilors say that if they leave, whites will quickly take over the townships 
and blacks will be deprived of any say or experience in local government. The 
ANC wants the council system to collapse, arguing that it is based on apartheid 
and ultimately controlled by whites. 
</P>
<P>
ANC-aligned "civic associations" this month urged blacks to boycott businesses 
owned by township councilors, shun councilors and their families and stage 
protests outside councilors' homes. The associations say they are not 
advocating violence, but some of their supporters have not gotten the message. 
</P>
<P>
Mphokeng, a slightly built 59-year-old with graying beard and wire-rimmed 
spectacles, was not a brave man so much as a stubborn one. Weeks ago, he 
admitted privately that it was probably a mistake to run for office in the 
first place. Of his vanquished election opponent, he said ruefully, "She must 
be feeling very happy." 
</P>
<P>
The Mphokeng family spent two years of restless nights listening for more 
trouble. But the councilor always said that he would not be cowed. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, people," Mphokeng told a hostile crowd a few months ago, "I was elected 
democratically. I could understand if the people who elected me told me to 
resign. But you are not the people who elected me. And I cannot disappoint 
them." 
</P>
<P>
He had held on a long time, longer than most. 
</P>
<P>
The people who elected Mphokeng and those who wanted him to resign live 
together in a crowded township wedged into the base of a short mountain range, 
15 miles east of the clean, jacaranda-lined streets of the capital, Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Mamelodi has a pretty name, which means "birds whistling," but a dusty and 
characterless facade. Older residents call it simply "the location," as most 
ghettos in South Africa were once known. 
</P>
<P>
Mamelodi's wood-paneled council chambers resemble that of any medium-size U.S. 
city and the coat of arms carries the generic slogan: City of Progress. The 
seat of government is a single-story brick building surrounded by stone walls 
frosted with rolls of razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
The Mamelodi councilors are guided through their monthly agenda of zoning 
changes and building permits by Mayor Sydney Mokone, a bulky man with three 
large, shiny rings. ("One of my secretaries will give you my business card," he 
told a reporter.) 
</P>
<P>
Mphokeng worked in Room 54, one of the dimly lit offices assigned to the newest 
of the 14 councilors. The desk was covered with a plastic tablecloth, in a blue 
and red floral print. His brown felt hat rested on a peg on the wall, and 
visitors sat on two wooden benches. 
</P>
<P>
"I stepped into the furnace, and I hadn't expected it," he said in his office a 
few weeks ago. "I thought I was going to help the people, not knowing that they 
would start this nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating, you know," he added. "You want to do a good job, and we are 
doing a lot. But the 'civics' are interrupting us. And if we don't do their 
thing, they come and petrol-bomb us. This is democracy?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Mphokeng made an ideal candidate. He was widely known as Pae-Pae 
(pronounced Pie-Pie), a character he played in a popular dramatic series on an 
African-language television station. A father of five and grandfather of two, 
he was well liked by neighbors, went to church regularly and sang in a 
community choir. 
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of Mamelodi's voters turned up on election day, and Mphokeng 
won, 2,200 to 950, over a nurse in Ward 4. He read his victory as a sign that 
Mamelodi wanted new, honest councilors. Then, while under attack from new 
enemies, he was shunned by many of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I ask myself all the time: 'What have I done wrong? Why my 
family?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mphokeng knew from the beginning that his was a dangerous, nearly impossible 
job. Local elections have been widely boycotted, and black councils, being 
segregated from the large tax bases of the next-door white communities, are 
perennially starved for funds. As a result, many councils are corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Blood has been spilled on both sides of the issue. During 1984-86, some 
councilors were murdered by angry mobs in fiery "necklaces" of gasoline-soaked 
tires. Police killed 13 blacks in Mamelodi during a march to demand that the 
council resign. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1989, a year after his election, a gasoline bomb came through the 
Mphokengs' bedroom window as they slept, setting fire to the curtains and 
carpet next to their bed. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt that time and Mphokeng continued his work, drawing the monthly 
council allowance of 720 rand (about $290). He began an unofficial small claims 
court for domestic disputes in his office, deciding cases on noisy neighbors, 
disobedient children and cheating husbands. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 350,000 Mamelodians are poor, earning less than $1,000 a year on 
average, and housing is scarce. Crime is rampant; unemployed and unemployable 
young men hang out at the local taxi rank. The next generation's prospects are 
not much better; political disputes kept the schools closed for many weeks this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In council meetings, Mphokeng criticized private developers who, under 
lucrative contracts signed with the council, were building houses that, at 
$20,000 each, were well beyond the resources of most Mamelodians. Some 
councilors privately began to think of Mphokeng as an irritant. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe is not an easy man," admitted his wife, Thembi. "He doesn't just agree 
with everything. He is a hard nut and you must convince him." 
</P>
<P>
Mphokeng thought the country's troubles were over in February, when President 
Frederik W. de Klerk legalized the ANC and freed Nelson Mandela. Mphokeng 
recorded Mandela's first Soweto speech, and he pasted a photograph of Mandela 
into the family scrapbook. 
</P>
<P>
But the new era of political freedom caused even more problems for Mphokeng. 
Anti-apartheid leaders resurrected the civic associations, ANC-inspired 
alternative governments that had been crushed by arrests and banning orders in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The most pressing matter was the rent boycott that the civic associations had 
launched five years earlier to protest the township government's high fees and 
poor services. Now residents were prepared to resume payments to the town 
council, but they wanted the arrears, which amount to more than $500 million 
countrywide, erased from the books. 
</P>
<P>
The associations also resumed their dormant campaigns to pressure township 
councils to resign. Their goal is to send a message to the government before 
negotiations for a new constitution begin: Blacks will refuse to participate in 
anything less than democratic, multiracial local governments. 
</P>
<P>
When Mphokeng refused to step down in June, one young anti-apartheid activist 
warned him that a "black car" would one day run over the obstacles to black 
liberation, obstacles such as Mphokeng. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Mphokeng's son, George, overheard several women in the 
street saying that all the township councilors would soon be killed. He ran 
breathlessly into the house. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they are going to kill us and kidnap me," he told his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, the hand grenade was lobbed over the Mphokengs' brick fence and 
through the living room window. George dived for his mother, knocking her into 
a hallway as the grenade exploded. A three-inch piece of shrapnel lodged in 
George's abdomen and another shard seared Thembi's leg. Relatives rushed the 
two to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Mphokeng watched glumly as his living room burned and delighted 
young activists danced in the street outside. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible scene," Mphokeng said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasty Malefo, an ANC activist and civic association leader who lives in 
Mphokeng's neighborhood, came to the house later to offer his sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Malefo remembers Mphokeng asking: "What am I dying for? I'm not making money on 
this council." 
</P>
<P>
Malefo did not think any civic association members were behind the attack, but 
he acknowledged that the angry youngsters in his organization can be difficult 
to control. 
</P>
<P>
"Much as we regret this, we can understand why they (councilors) are being 
attacked," Malefo said. "And as much as we'd like to stand up and say, 'Stop 
attacking councilors,' we can't do that unless we can stop the attacks by the 
police on our comrades as well." 
</P>
<P>
Mphokeng was not sure whom to blame, but he was wary of the civic association's 
sympathy. "A python licks the victim's face very smooth, only to prepare for 
the swallowing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Malefo said Mphokeng "may have good intentions. But he is very misguided. Even 
the dumbest of these councilors must realize these councils don't work." 
</P>
<P>
Like the angry youth of today, Mphokeng has deep emotional scars from a 
lifetime of being black in a country controlled by whites. He was born in a 
grass hut on a white man's farm in 1931, just as dawn turned the vast African 
sky golden. On the same day, a son was born to the farmer, who decided to give 
his and his farmhand's sons the same name -- Josiah Horace van der Merwe. 
</P>
<P>
The black young Josiah started school on the farm, going to classes for six 
months and spending the rest of the year in the fields of maize, peas, potatoes 
and fruit trees. Children of black farmhands were expected to work without pay, 
and white farmers discouraged workers from attending school. 
</P>
<P>
Josiah and his 14 brothers and sisters wanted to go to school full time in 
town, and their father agreed. But the children were harassed by white farmers 
on their way to school each day. Mphokeng still has a scar on his leg from the 
whip used by one of those men. "It is a mark I don't ever forget," Mphokeng 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mphokeng's father, the third generation to work the Van der Merwe farm, moved 
to the nearby township and took a job carving tombstones. It was there that the 
black Josiah Horace van der Merwe took his father's last name and became Josiah 
Mphokeng. 
</P>
<P>
After high school, Mphokeng studied at a teachers college and moved to Pretoria 
in search of work. At first, he scrubbed floors, washed dishes and worked in 
the garden for a white family, earning about $1 a month. 
</P>
<P>
One day, he remembers, he discovered a letter that was addressed to him but had 
been opened weeks earlier by his employers. It was from the Native 
Commissioner's Office, offering Mphokeng a job. He went to work as an 
interpreter for the native commissioner, who traveled the country meeting with 
African chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, Mphokeng joined the South African police and quickly rose to the rank 
of sergeant. He soon became disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
"The law says you can arrest a person, any person, who is committing a crime in 
your presence," Mphokeng said. In practice, black officers could not arrest 
whites. He decided to quit after a judge dismissed charges against a white man 
because Mphokeng, a black man, was the arresting officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'This is nonsense,' " Mphokeng remembered. "Then I just woke 
up one morning and I said, 'Resign.' " 
</P>
<P>
He went to work on an African-language radio station run by the South African 
Broadcasting Co. He quit to help his wife start a driving school in their home. 
He still works part time as a radio and TV actor. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life we blacks have been told to carry out instructions and not given a 
chance to think," Mphokeng said. "Every black man is against apartheid. But as 
far as I'm concerned, any black person who lives in this country works for the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
He has learned, though, to bury his bitterness. In the 1970s and '80s, when the 
townships were in flames, "we wanted to say something," he said. "But once you 
talked bad about the government, you got detained. I didn't want to see myself 
behind bars." 
</P>
<P>
Not a day went by this year that Mphokeng did not think about stepping down. 
Several township councils near Pretoria collapsed and he had begun to feel like 
the only target left. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the only ones still holding on," he said two weeks ago. "And these 
people will definitely attack us." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the people who pushed Mphokeng to run for office had fallen silent. 
</P>
<P>
"He was their favorite before the ANC was unbanned, but now people have backed 
away," Thembi said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that they are against us," Joe Mphokeng said. "But they are afraid of 
being victimized themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Mphokeng had wanted to stay on because he did not like the alternative. If the 
council resigned, he pointed out, a white administrator would just run the 
township with residents' money. Would not it be better, he asked, for honest 
black men to work for change from within the system? 
</P>
<P>
Malefo, the civic association official, considered that question for a long 
time. "I see his point," Malefo said. "But if he's on the people's side, he 
should do what the people want him to do." 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Eve, Mphokeng was warned that another hand grenade attack was 
imminent. Within hours, he and eight other councilors decided to announce their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, it has been quiet around the Mphokeng home. Mphokeng says his 
convictions have not changed, but they do not seem worth the price anymore. He 
laments the death of representative government in Mamelodi, and predicts that 
township conditions will get worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Please tell the people that Josiah was forced to resign," he said regretfully. 
"It was the only way to save my life and my family's lives too." 
</P>
<P>
Next: The black policeman.

<P>
The trout fishermen and the bird lovers and the eco-scientists -- they won the 
battle of Two Forks Dam. 
</P>
<P>
Among them, they scotched one of the biggest water projects in the American 
West, maybe the last from the age of big dams, a plan 50 years in the making. 
</P>
<P>
The project would have created a reservoir about half the size of Pasadena, fed 
by two branches of a great river, serving the bathroom taps and garden hoses of 
Denver and its satellite cities for decades to come. The water behind the 
555-foot-tall dam was to be the formula on which the infant cities around 
Denver could feed and grow. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency heeded the environmentalists and the 
fishermen and boaters and its own staff advice, and last month vetoed the plan 
to fill picturesque Cheesman Canyon, 30 miles south of here, with 359 billion 
gallons of river water -- the largest non-federal water project in the West. 
</P>
<P>
And to the victors belongs . . . the next fight. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for water did not disappear with the plans for the dam. Where will it 
come from now? 
</P>
<P>
Part of the answer is, you buy other people's water rights. In Colorado, as the 
sardonic old saying goes, water does not run upstream, except to money. 
</P>
<P>
"The denial of Two Forks has been like dropping a bag of marbles on the floor," 
says Denver water attorney Bennett Raley. "All the people who had expected it 
to go through and supply their needs have scattered all over and are now 
looking for their own water." 
</P>
<P>
For several years, some of Denver's growing suburbs have been buying up rural 
water rights. And now that it's pretty much every suburb for itself, more 
communities that had counted on Two Forks are flipping open their checkbooks 
and looking at rural water with something of the same covetousness with which 
Saddam Hussein must have eyeballed Kuwait and its oil. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Nature Conservancy, a national environmental group that buys up land 
for wildlife and habitat, is in the market for water rights as well, to 
preserve streams and wetlands, but with a far smaller purse. 
</P>
<P>
The organization "doesn't say a market approach is the only way to protect 
land," says its Colorado lawyer, Robert Wigington, "but we are able to protect 
some pieces of land other groups and agencies are not." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the rush to buy land and water rights is raising new concerns 
that market forces devoted to water consumption will disrupt the state's 
balance among recreational, agricultural and urban needs. 
</P>
<P>
Dairy farmer Mike Roskop, president of the Weld County Farm Bureau, has seen 
the land on either side of his bought up for its water rights. Farmers needed 
that money; he can't quarrel with that. Yet there is a lot of conservative 
Angst over this -- against interfering in private enterprise, but anxious that 
water not be bought and sold as blithely as used cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We're treading on thin ice," Roskop says. "We very strongly believe in the 
right (to sell); how can you come up and say 'Don't sell to these people, all 
they want is the water off your land?' " 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said: "Farmers are saying, 'Hey, we need to be careful. We 
can't allow ourselves to be dried up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Weld County, near the Wyoming border, is the richest agricultural county in 
Colorado, and because "rich" means "wet," some agricultural water rights in 
this accessible region north of Denver have already been bought out. And 
farmers like Roskop fret that prosperity will gurgle away with the water, as it 
did in parts of Crowley County, near the southeast corner of the state, touched 
by the desiccating hand of water purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley County is every farmer's cautionary tale, where 20 years of water 
rights purchases have left "more thistles and tumbleweeds blowing around this 
county than you've ever seen in your life," says 64-year-old Ruben Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, Bauer has farmed in Sugar City. He saw neighbors sell water rights, 
saw the town dwindle into "a pathetic thing." The water companies "offered to 
buy us out but I wanted my boys here. I wanted them to make a living here, but 
I'm sorry now I didn't let them sell." 
</P>
<P>
Bauer says his farm, near the end of the water ditch, gets about a third less 
than he is entitled to, because of selloffs upstream. In consequence, his two 
sons can farm only 100 acres, a fourth of what they cultivated three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost a lot of our tax base," said Rob Keenan, director of Crowley 
County's department of social services. "If the urban areas want to grow, let 
them grow. Then they can eat their own bluegrass lawns instead of the crops we 
used to grow," Keenan said angrily. The Denver suburb of Aurora has bought up a 
lot of water rights out toward Crowley County. Tom Griswold, Aurora's utilities 
director, says the city paid farmers "a lot more than they'd ever get as a 
return from agriculture." And "much of this land was going out of agricultural 
production prior to our purchases." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Young is a Colorado State University professor of agriculture who 
doesn't have any problem with water sales. "Many people feel that buying out 
agriculture is buying out Colorado's birthright," he says, and "shouldn't be 
subject to market forces. But my own feeling is that Denver's metro demand 
isn't growing so fast that it'll make a difference." With nearly 90% of 
Colorado's water still going to agriculture, some think the concern is 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
But Raley, who represents the Northern Colorado Water Conservation district, up 
toward Weld County, said: "We do not want to become a Crowley County or an 
Owens Valley to feed Denver's growth . . . it's not just the water (at risk), 
it's the whole fabric of life." 
</P>
<P>
All of this has complicated Colorado's already convoluted water rights system. 
</P>
<P>
In Craig Harrison's office in Ft. Collins is a relief map, 20 feet by 5 feet, 
with Pike's Peak in snowy white -- the water rights on the Front Range, updated 
constantly with overlays. Harrison is one of those water brokers who buys and 
sells water rights. 
</P>
<P>
Like a paddle wheel, "the growth business is what drives the water business," 
he says. "The water's probably got to come from agriculture, whether we like it 
or not. The veto of Two Forks is another sign that if you don't build new 
supplies, you have to work with old supplies." 
</P>
<P>
On this point some environmentalists speak up: Whatever the advantages of a 
free market, safeguards are needed, a recognition that water is not a 1964 VW 
beetle, to be paid for and driven off the lot without a backward glance. The 
National Wildlife Federation, for example, is pressing in court for a public 
interest review to be made a part of Colorado's water regulations, much as 
water levels were ordered to maintain Mono Lake in California. 
</P>
<P>
The priorities of Colorado's ironclad water regulations, sprung from frontier 
days, generally rank "consumptive" water uses, for cities and industry and 
agriculture, ahead of any others. 
</P>
<P>
Such priorities, it is being argued, are outdated in an era when recreational 
and tourist and ecological uses are golden. Pioneers could not have conceived a 
day when guys with fly rods or backpacks could actually constitute big 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Two Forks alliance of trout fishermen and environmentalists, there is 
another joining of interests -- a second date, if not a wedding -- who want to 
see that cities do not elbow everyone aside on the way to the water trough. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Bratton, who for 30 years has represented the Upper Gunnison River Water 
Conservation District on the Western Slope of the Rockies, is "not used to 
riding this environmental horse . . . but we're talking about loss of economy. 
We're fighting for our lives down here" against Aurora and Arapahoe County 
claims on water that Bratton says is now used in his district for profitable 
boating and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken the position that recreation is a beneficial use of water," he 
said. "We think we're entitled to it. We're saying that is our economy." 
</P>
<P>
Bratton's unlikely partner on this dance card is the Rocky Mountain Biological 
Lab. Since 1928, the lab has done world-class biological field research amid 
wild streams and high meadows near Crested Butte. Some studies are of 20 and 30 
years' duration; a model to study global warming has just been set up in a 
meadow on lab acreage. 
</P>
<P>
The lab, like Bratton's group and some individuals downstream, is ranged 
against urban thirsts to keep intact what they won in the 1970s, when they 
became virtually the only private citizens in Colorado to hold rights to 
in-stream water. 
</P>
<P>
"We're facing disaster," says lab director Susan Allen. "It's our assumption 
they're going to (try to) invalidate our water rights." Even a claim to 
secondary water is dangerous, says Allen; in these dry years, there is no water 
to spare. "Taking water from headlands here is a travesty for the whole state." 
</P>
<P>
State Rep. Tim Foster, a Republican from the Western Slope, has introduced 
legislation that would put recreational and environmental needs in the 
hierarchy of water use considerations. "You've got to create a process," he 
says, "that recognizes the environmental impact, the socioeconomic impact."

MILITARY GETS TO THE GULF 'FASTEST WITH THE MOSTEST';

LOGISTICS: THE BITTER LESSON OF VIETNAM SPURS LARGEST MOVEMENT OF TROOPS AND 
EQUIPMENT IN U.S. HISTORY.

<P>
When the Army's 1st Infantry Division at Ft. Riley, Kan., was ordered into 
action Nov. 8 as part of the second wave of U.S. troops bound for the Persian 
Gulf, the clock started to run on a deployment that is still under way nearly 
two months later. 
</P>
<P>
The Army spent two weeks repainting 6,000 vehicles from the traditional 
three-pattern green to a new desert camouflage. Twenty-nine trains, each a mile 
long, were loaded for a two-day trip to the Port of Houston. The equipment was 
transferred to 14 ships in two days. 
</P>
<P>
By last Friday, three cargo ships had arrived in Saudi Arabia and more than 
3,200 of the division's 11,500 troops had flown in by plane, picked up their 
equipment and moved to the front. 
</P>
<P>
To strategists at the Pentagon, the American buildup in the Persian Gulf is an 
effort to take advantage of one of the most bitter lessons that the United 
States learned in Vietnam -- that use of a massive force, rapidly deployed, is 
the key to victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that drives this buildup, differently from Vietnam, is the 
military's commitment to using overwhelming force and getting this thing over 
as fast as possible," said a ranking Army officer who served in Vietnam and is 
planning gulf strategy. 
</P>
<P>
But overwhelming force cannot be assembled overnight, and the seemingly slow 
pace has created the impression that logistic snags may prevent President Bush 
from carrying out his threat to attack if Iraq doesn't pull out of Kuwait by 
the United Nations' Jan. 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, told Bush last week that the troops will not be ready to move 
until weeks after the deadline -- largely because of the time needed to get 
equipment to the region. 
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns about the Jan. 15 deadline -- set for political reasons that 
are independent of the Pentagon's military timetable -- military leaders say 
that the largest movement of troops and equipment in American history actually 
has been an enormous success. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with some marginal problems, we have moved a helluva force faster than 
anybody else has ever done in history," said a senior Pentagon official who is 
analyzing the deployment. "This will be compared to Hannibal crossing the 
Alps." 
</P>
<P>
The sheer numbers are staggering: 
</P>
<P>
Three million tons of equipment had been moved into Saudi Arabia by 
mid-December, with troops arriving at a rate of about 4,000 a day. Thousands of 
military and commercial trucks, rail cars, ships, barges and airplanes are 
ferrying troops and weapons to an isolated desert. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to interviews with military officers, the few real hitches have 
been relatively minor: early delays in readying some of the reserve fleet for 
the sealift, a shortage of some specialized ships, a logjam at some Saudi ports 
and small weather problems. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 60 days of the buildup, nearly five times as many troops were 
moved into Saudi Arabia as were sent to South Korea in the first two months of 
the Korean War. More than twice as much military equipment was delivered to the 
desert kingdom in that period as was deposited in Vietnam in the first two 
months of that war. 
</P>
<P>
The mobilization of the 1st Infantry Division -- known as the Big Red One 
because of the scarlet number on the unit's shoulder patch -- illustrates the 
challenge that the military transportation experts face. 
</P>
<P>
Troops at Ft. Riley, which once served as home to Lt. Col. George Armstrong 
Custer, first learned that they were bound for the gulf when Bush and Cheney 
went on television Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the announcement came over the airwaves, three shifts of painters 
began transforming vehicles -- painted green for disguise in the forests of 
Northern Europe -- into equipment that would be easier to conceal in the 
deserts of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Among the vehicles they painted were the division's 232 M-1 tanks -- the 
mainstay of any ground attack against Iraq's fortifications in Kuwait -- 108 
Bradley fighting vehicles, lighter tanks capable of carrying up to six 
infantrymen, and 33 Apache and Blackhawk helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment was loaded onto 29 leased railroad trains. Each piece, from 
howitzer to tank, received a tiny bar-code sticker like the ones on groceries 
in the supermarket, so it could be tracked by computer until it was turned over 
to U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
When the trains reached the Port of Houston, the equipment was loaded onto 14 
commercial and military vessels provided by the Military Sealift Command. The 
tanks and Bradleys went aboard ships known as RO-ROs (for "roll on, roll off"). 
</P>
<P>
There is a worldwide shortage of RO-ROs because they are not as profitable to 
operate as container ships. But the monster tanks are not suited for transport 
by container ships. 
</P>
<P>
"RO-RO is always much easier," said Lt. Col. William G. Byrne Jr., who was 
supervising the loading of military goods bound for the gulf on a 
Cypriot-flagged container ship in Bayonne, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Although an overnight snowstorm had delayed work, just as similar storms have 
caused minor delays in Northern Europe, Byrne was upbeat: "It's been hectic," 
he said Friday. "It's been frantic, but it's been paced." 
</P>
<P>
The logistics of this massive movement have been carried out by a triad of 
military units under Air Force Gen. H. T. Johnson, chief of the U.S. 
Transportation Command at Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The elements of the triad are the Military Airlift Command, the Military 
Sealift Command and the Military Traffic Management Command, which gets troops 
and equipment to ports and airports for the other two units. 
</P>
<P>
The MSC is using 248 ships in Operation Desert Shield, including 112 vessels 
leased from foreign-flag operators. About 95% of the military cargo from the 
United States and Northern Europe is going by sea. 
</P>
<P>
Voyage time varies depending on the vessel and weight of its cargo. Most ships 
make the 8,700-mile trip from the East Coast in 23 to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has eight fast sealift ships that can make the voyage in two weeks, 
and Army officials said they would like eight to 12 more of these. An MSC 
official said that building more is financially impractical and said that the 
Army needs to develop lighter weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Even fast ships are not immune to problems. One of the eight broke down on its 
first gulf voyage and had to be towed to Gibraltar, where it is undergoing 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The others are moving Army goods to the gulf from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 
and Antwerp, Belgium, so the Big Red One's equipment in Houston was loaded 
aboard a slower armada of vessels, the last of which won't leave Houston for 
another few days. 
</P>
<P>
As the first of those ships approached Saudi ports earlier this month, the 
Military Airlift Command began flying the initial contingent of Big Red One 
troops to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, the MAC had flown 282,000 troops to Saudi Arabia. Nearly 
two-thirds of them were carried under contract by American commercial lines. 
The airlines have longstanding commitments to provide planes and crews in a 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But airplanes have transported only a fraction of the military equipment to the 
area of operations because air cargo is not cost-efficient. Even the largest 
military cargo plane, the C-5, can accommodate only a small amount of the 
materiel that can be loaded on a ship. 
</P>
<P>
"A C-5 can carry two M-1 tanks, but it would have to be refueled immediately 
after takeoff," said Sgt. Chuck Jones of the MAC. 
</P>
<P>
Linking troops with their equipment in Saudi Arabia depends on fairly precise 
timing in a process called "marrying up." Commanders do not want troops on the 
ground before their equipment arrives because there would be little for them to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment is offloaded into staging areas, where troops claim what is 
theirs and move to assembly points away from the port. Saudi highways have been 
augmented to enable U.S. troops and weapons to move to the battle lines in the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
"People lose sight of what a tremendous challenge it is to move a 60-ton tank 
200 or 300 miles into the desert," said Army Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, 
deputy commander of all U.S. forces in the gulf. "It's not something you do 
with the snap of a finger." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. commanders in Saudi Arabia have blamed logistic logjams on the fact that 
planners initially gave priority to putting combat forces in place. As a 
result, support operations lagged far behind. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, until recently, the United States relied almost entirely on a 
fleet of leased cargo trucks for the distribution of goods within Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 U.S.-owned trucks have begun to operate to supplement an estimated 
1,000 vehicles leased from Saudi contractors, Army Maj. Gen. Dane Starling, 
logistics chief of the U.S. Central Command, told reporters at a briefing in 
Riyadh last week. 
</P>
<P>
While the process of moving troops and equipment to the gulf is still not 
completed, Pentagon officials said the military has demonstrated that it can 
build up a massive force in a short time. 
</P>
<P>
And resupplying U.S. forces through the same process should be continuous and 
smooth. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you have opened the pipeline this way, you can sustain activity and you 
have effectively solved your logistics problems in a large sense," a senior 
Pentagon official said.

TIME PICKS DOMESTIC, FOREIGN BUSH AS 1990 'MEN OF THE YEAR'

Time magazine named "The Two George Bushes" as its annual Man of the Year, 
noting in its announcement Saturday that he "seemed almost to be two 
presidents." 
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Bush "was a study in resoluteness and mastery" while 
domestically he was "just as strongly marked by wavering and confusion," the 
magazine said in the cover story of its Jan. 7 issue, due on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The cover carried the headline "Men of the Year" rather than Man of the Year, 
and a Janus-like portrait made up of two photographs of the President was 
captioned "The Two George Bushes." 
</P>
<P>
The two faces of Bush, Time said, "were not just different but also had few 
features in common." 
</P>
<P>
Bush narrowly defeated Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for the Man of the Year 
title, which recognizes the person "who, for better or worse, has had the most 
impact on the year's events." 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't we pick Saddam? The answer in the end really is that invading a 
little country is not enough to make you man of the year," said Time Managing 
Editor Henry Muller. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine praised Bush for "midwifing" a new world order that has had a 
decidedly favorable impact on the course of events. In painfully sharp 
contrast, Bush has affected domestic news decidedly for the worse, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"What could have been more baffling, at times ludicrous, than Bush's 
performance on taxes?" it asked. "His domestic policy, to the extent he has 
one, has been to leave things alone until he could no longer avoid taking 
action."

Hundreds of American Indians arrived on foot and horseback at this massacre 
site to commemorate the 100th anniversary Saturday of one of the saddest days 
in their history. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 horseback riders and another 100 people watched as Indians conducted 
a spiritual ceremony in sub-freezing temperatures Saturday morning at the grave 
site of Sioux Indians killed by U.S. soldiers a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Means, an activist member of the militant American Indian Movement, 
blocked the entrance to the cemetery when Gov. George S. Mickelson showed up to 
pay his respects. The governor made no effort to get past him. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be an insult (for Mickelson to enter) because we live in the racist 
state of South Dakota and he is the governor," Means said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't let me in," the governor said later. "He said I wasn't welcome. He 
wants to make a mockery of all that has occurred in reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson declared 1990 the Year of Reconciliation as part of state efforts to 
improve relations between Indians and non-Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Of Mickelson's proclamation, Means said: "It is an empty word utilized by the 
governor for political purposes. It sure helped him in the November election." 
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies were conducted in temperatures of 21 below zero and a wind chill 
of 60 to 70 below. The crowd later went to a school seven miles away for other 
ceremonies at which Mickelson and others spoke. 
</P>
<P>
"The massacre at Wounded Knee is one of many dark moments in American history," 
Mickelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson said he was "pledging my own commitment to learn from our past in 
order to build a future for all South Dakotans regardless of race or culture." 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he will keep trying to persuade federal officials to create a 
national monument at Wounded Knee. The site should be preserved according to 
the wishes of Wounded Knee descendants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Sioux men, women and children were killed by U.S. soldiers at 
Wounded Knee in an event that some historians said signified the end of the 
Indian wars. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 horseback riders and others on foot endured wind-chill temperatures 
as low as 50 degrees below zero Friday on their way to the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
They ended what for some was a two-week, 220-mile trek retracing the final 
journey of Chief Big Foot and his band before they were killed at Wounded Knee. 
</P>
<P>
The riders assembled their horses in a circle at the massacre site Friday and 
prayed for peace within the Sioux Nation and throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We pray for peace and unity, and we look at it as global, because the whole 
world needs it," said Arvol Looking Horse, a Sioux spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
Means and Dennis Banks, another American Indian Movement activist, joined the 
riders last week. Some said they were bothered by the participation of those 
associated with the armed takeover of Wounded Knee in 1973, which led to two 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Accounts differ as to who fired first and how many died in 1890 at Wounded 
Knee. The federal government says about 150 Indians died; the Sioux say as many 
as 400 were killed.

TROLLEY DRIVER'S ALCOHOL LEVEL OVER DRUNK LIMIT, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year transit veteran who operated a Boston trolley that crashed into 
another rail car had an alcohol level above the Massachusetts drunk driving 
limit, transit officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators worked into the weekend to learn the circumstances of the Boston 
accident, which injured 33 people, and a New York subway fire, which injured 
150 and claimed a second life Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Both occurred underground Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
New York Mayor David N. Dinkins said he expected city workers to have a report 
on his desk by Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities blamed melting slush for short-circuiting a transformer, which 
exploded and caused a smoky fire that stopped a Manhattan-bound train. 
</P>
<P>
One passenger apparently suffered a heart attack and was pronounced dead 
Friday. Another rider died early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, transit officials said the trolley's brakes and signals functioned 
properly, but the operator said he had trouble braking. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication that we know of at this time that alcohol was used on 
the job," said Peter Dimond, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority. He said officials believe the operator drank before 
starting his shift. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials were trying to determine whether the operator involved in the 
crash was the one a passenger had called to complain about just a half hour 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a message that there was abusive language, that the driver was not 
behaving properly, but there was no indication that there was a safety risk," 
Dimond said. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Herald reported that a rider telephoned transit police and told a 
fare collector that a driver was cursing and had sped through a curve, knocking 
passengers from their seats.

STATE'S LIBERALIZED ABORTION LAW SETS OFF DEBATE IN MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
LATIN AMERICA: CATHOLICS LEAD BARRAGE OF CRITICISM OVER MEASURE IN CHIAPAS THAT 
EXPANDS RIGHT TO CHOOSE. 
</P>

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mexican state of Chiapas, a traditional province with a large Indian 
population and strong Roman Catholic roots, has quietly adopted the nation's 
most liberal abortion law. 
</P>
<P>
So quiet was the Chiapas legislature's decision to legalize abortion upon 
demand two months ago that few residents realized such a law had been passed 
until it was published and put into effect Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
But the vote to adopt Gov. Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido's proposed reform of the 
state criminal code has set off a nationwide debate on abortion and a barrage 
of criticism from Catholic leaders, who threatened to excommunicate legislators 
who supported the measure. 
</P>
<P>
They also have called on President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to overturn the 
state law "before this degenerates into a national sickness." 
</P>
<P>
Catholic and fundamentalist Protestant leaders are supporting protest marches 
in Chiapas this month and next month organized by the antiabortion group 
Pro-Vida, according to state residents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is absurd, a stupidity," Bishop Genaro Alamilla, a spokesman for the 
Mexican Bishops Conference, told reporters in Mexico City. "There is no valid 
reason for suppressing human life. Animals respect the life of their progeny. 
The governor and members of the legislature have put themselves below animals." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper La Jornada published Friday, Interior 
Secretary Fernando Gutierrez Barrios called the Chiapas vote "a sovereign 
decision" and said a national dialogue is warranted to determine whether to 
change Mexico's federal abortion law. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican federal criminal code prohibits abortion, except in cases of rape 
and when the mother's life is endangered. In practice, it is extremely 
difficult to obtain a legal abortion, because the law does not specify who must 
authorize the procedure or who may perform it. 
</P>
<P>
A few states are more lenient, with laws allowing for abortions of deformed 
fetuses and, in Yucatan, for economic hardship. The Chiapas law goes furthest 
in permitting abortion for "reasons of family planning or by common agreement 
of the parents" within 90 days of conception. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Gonzalez Garrido said in an interview with Proceso magazine that "the 
religious debate should be between those who, under the law, decide to abort or 
not to abort. The law does not encourage (women) to abort but makes it possible 
for them, with freedom of conscience, to decide whether or not to do so." 
</P>
<P>
While Pro-Vida and the right-of-center National Action Party attacked the new 
law, feminist groups lauded it as a historic advance for women in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an attempt against the life of anyone," said Walda Barrios, of 
Anzetik, a women's group in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. "It is simply 
an extreme necessity that women may abort legally and not as delinquents. . . . 
This doesn't mean women will be aborting every minute. But it is an option in 
extreme cases." 
</P>
<P>
Guadalupe Cardenas, of Women of San Cristobal de las Casas, added: "This will 
allow for abortions under more secure conditions. It is an undeniable reality 
that there are unwanted pregnancies and women who, as a last resort, turn to 
abortion. This law will mean that abortions will no longer be a cause of 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Health experts disagree about the number of illegal or clandestine abortions 
performed in Mexico each year. Estimates range from 800,000 to 2 million, with 
an unknown number of deaths resulting from unsanitary and inexpert operations. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of an illegal abortion in Chiapas is $680 to $2,000, according to 
Barrios. Doctors in Chiapas noted that middle-class women, usually married and 
often members of the Catholic Church, are the ones who most often can afford an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
How the new abortion law came about in Chiapas is a mystery to most political 
observers. Gonzalez Garrido told Proceso that he acted at the urging of 
organizations defending women's rights, but the feminist groups said they had 
never petitioned him to legalize abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts speculated that Gonzalez Garrido may have initiated the abortion 
law at President Salinas' behest as a trial balloon for national abortion 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Garrido is a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
or PRI, which holds a majority in the legislature that approved the law. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI, however, does not stand to make any obvious political gains in a state 
with a liberal intellectual elite, but also with a large population of Indians 
and peasants who are heavily influenced by the conservative Catholic and 
Protestant churches. The party won the 1988 presidential election in Chiapas 
handily, largely with the votes of this conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the PRI imagined this was the state to experiment, to see the reaction," 
said Dr. Jesus Gilberto Gomez Maza, a pediatrician who ran for governor against 
Gonzalez Garrido in 1988. "They dropped this little bomb to see what happens, 
and depending on the response, they will act in other states or not." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez opposes abortion, although he noted that Chiapas has a 5% annual 
population growth rate -- nearly twice the national rate. He acknowledged that 
sex education and family planning are difficult in such a poor state, where the 
average level of education is three years of primary school and the illiteracy 
rate is 40%. 
</P>
<P>
"Independent of morality or ideology, what I object to is that no one was 
consulted on this law," Gomez said in a telephone interview. "It was approved 
by legislators who don't understand pregnancy and abortion and did not consult 
the public opinion in general." 
</P>
<P>
The measure's harshest criticism, however, has come from the Catholic Church. 
Although Protestants have made great inroads in Mexico, and particularly 
Chiapas, most people in the country still are professed Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas has vowed to modernize the government's relationship with the church, 
which has no legal standing under the Mexican constitution. He broke with 
tradition by inviting bishops to his inauguration and received Pope John Paul 
II earlier this year during the pontiff's Mexico visit, which included a stop 
in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
But Alamilla of the bishop's conference seemed to blame the administration for 
the new abortion law: "I want to believe in the political will of the 
president, who wants to make fundamental changes in our country, and we hope 
that he does. I want to believe in his honesty, but morality is not in the line 
of modernization. The commandment not to kill is absolute." 
</P>
<P>
Feminist groups, meanwhile, were buoyed by the Chiapas law and vowed to push 
for the liberalization of abortion laws nationally.

A former British defense minister accused President Bush on Saturday of 
treating the Persian Gulf crisis like a schoolboy fight with Iraq's Saddam 
Hussein and risking a disastrous war with "Rambo" remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor Party politician Denis Healey said Bush's hard-line stance on 
the gulf crisis and his eagerness to come across as a strong leader could end 
up dragging a reluctant world into war. 
</P>
<P>
"What is really worrying is that the fear of appearing a wimp has made him act 
as a sort of ersatz "Rambo," pushing an unwilling world into disaster," Healey 
said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be an impartial gesture of peace: Two women, one wearing a 
T-shirt labeled Iraq, another labeled United States, would pour water on an 
olive sapling newly planted on Iraq's border with Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraqi authorities on the site insisted that one of their soldiers stationed 
nearby do the watering, his rifle on his shoulder, to heighten Iraq's 
visibility at the demonstration. "This is not what we had in mind," said Angelo 
Gandolfi, one of a group of international peace activists setting up camp on 
the border. "We don't want to be controlled." 
</P>
<P>
Gandolfi, who returned from the border, and about 30 other activists are housed 
on a Tigris River island that is someday supposed to be turned into an 
amusement park. They plan to join about 19 of their contemporaries at a camp in 
the desert between opposing armies of Iraq and an allied force led by the 
United States. It is a gesture meant to avert war, the activists say. 
</P>
<P>
But even among the most fervent, there is suspicion that they are becoming 
pawns in a propaganda game. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to stop this war. We are ready to die!" said Gandolfi, a social worker 
from Italy and one of several activists from the United States, Britain, 
Australia and other countries gathering in Baghdad and on the border. 
</P>
<P>
"We are afraid Iraq has something else in mind," Gandolfi said. "A show." 
</P>
<P>
Show or no, the give-and-take demonstrates the difficulties of taking a neutral 
stand in a country looking for an edge in hard-nosed diplomatic dealings 
abroad. Iraq faces a Jan. 15 U.N. deadline to pull out of Kuwait or face attack 
from about half a million American and allied troops gathering in and near 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Iraq is putting great stock in nurturing anti-war sentiment 
abroad as part of its strategy to avert attack from the United States and its 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials say they are convinced that, given time, the Bush 
Administration will wilt in the heat of public opposition to war with Iraq, 
either before shooting breaks out or, in the event that it does, if the 
conflict lasts for more than a few days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein complained to a Mexican television 
interviewer that the Western press had distorted Iraq's image abroad but that 
still "there are tens of thousands of people in France, the United States and 
Britain who march demanding the withdrawal of troops from the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis made much of reports that U.S. and British naval personnel on 
embargo duty used force to board an intercepted vessel carrying sugar and 
female passengers. Newspapers and radio called the boarding "piracy." 
</P>
<P>
For apparent morale boosting purposes, foreign peace demonstrations are given 
exceptional attention on Iraqi television and in newspapers. Visiting peace 
activists also receive extensive write-ups that sometimes border on the zany. 
</P>
<P>
The state-run Baghdad Observer newspaper ran a letter purportedly written by 
British anti-war activists lampooning a recent military call-up of British 
reservists for duty in the gulf. "You may shortly be given orders to depart for 
Saudi Arabia, where you will join the 3rd Battalion, Queen's Own Suicide 
Conscripts," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue of the Observer, Masami Uno, identified as a Japanese writer, 
blamed his country's support for the anti-Iraq alliance on what he called an 
international Jewish conspiracy. According to the newspaper, Uno is the author 
of a book called "If You Comprehend the Jewish Zionist, You Will Have Insight 
Into the World." 
</P>
<P>
The border peace camp was the idea of the Gulf Peace Team, a London-based group 
that professes a neutral goal of wanting to prevent war in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
About 19 peace proponents are living in tents on the border near an Iraqi 
military position and not far, returning activists say, from an allied force on 
the Saudi side of the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been given permission to stay at the camp until mid-February, 
when the Iraqis will consider whether to let them continue. If war breaks out 
before then, the peace group has vowed to stay in the firing line. 
</P>
<P>
"They will have to go to war over our peace camp," said Pat Arrowsmith, one of 
the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
The camp is designed to house 150, but it is not clear when or if that many 
will ever reach Iraq. The government has been reluctant to grant visas 
liberally. Iraq is not a country accustomed to free-lance displays of political 
will. 
</P>
<P>
The campers say they are paying their own keep to remain independent of the 
Iraqi authorities. They also want to set up a twin camp on the Saudi side of 
the border, but they say that Riyadh has refused to let them do so. 
</P>
<P>
In a burden not unlike one shouldered by American soldiers stationed over the 
horizon, the peace group is taking pains not to offend local Muslim 
sensibilities. According to a peace camp Code of Conduct, consumption of pork, 
alcohol or "nonprescribed drugs" should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Sex is out. "Separate sleeping arrangements will be made for men and women, and 
culturally appropriate clothing is strongly advised," the code says.

President Bush, in a Time magazine interview to be published Monday, said he 
has a "gut" feeling that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will withdraw from 
Kuwait, even at the risk of being toppled from power by disenchanted Iraqi 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle left Washington for the Persian Gulf, where he is to 
meet with Saudi officials today and visit U.S. troops on Monday and New Year's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq denied reports that it may agree to withdraw from Kuwait by the 
U.N. deadline of Jan. 15 if it is assured that it will not be attacked by the 
U.S.-led coalition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Front: 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders of Congress probably will move to cut off funding for 
Operation Desert Shield if President Bush orders an attack against Iraq without 
congressional approval, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) 
declared. He urged that economic sanctions against Iraq be given at least 18 
months to work before any military action is taken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
British Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton threatened massive retaliation if 
Iraq uses biological or chemical weapons against allied forces in the gulf. He 
said his country has begun stockpiling medicine for the possible inoculation of 
British troops.

The U.S. government announced it is seeking the extradition of the mayor of 
Zacapa, Guatemala, and two other men arrested in Guatemala's largest cocaine 
seizure. Police on Thursday arrested Mayor Arnoldo Vargas Estrada, 52, Otto 
Evelio Quiro Davila, 34, and Victor Enrique Escobar Arias, 37, and seized 5,000 
pounds of cocaine. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City said the Justice 
Department wants to prosecute the three on charges of smuggling and 
distributing drugs in the United States.

COLD RECORDS FALL IN WEST AS EAST POSTS RECORD HIGHS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A winter storm battered the Pacific Northwest on Saturday as temperatures 
plunged to record lows in six states across the West. 
</P>
<P>
Wind-chill temperatures, which reflect how wind-driven cold feels to the skin, 
dropped lower than 60 below zero in at least four cities, including a 
wind-chill reading of 70 below zero at Pierre, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
"It's colder than the devil," said Bill Joseph, owner of the Pepper Mill Cafe 
in Valentine, Neb., the coldest spot in the state at 20 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people's cars won't start today," he said. "Some people had theirs 
plugged in (to heaters) and it still wouldn't start." 
</P>
<P>
The second winter storm that hit Washington state in two weeks battered beaches 
as well as inland areas and emergency officials said as many as 10 waterfront 
homes on Puget Sound have been destroyed or damaged by storm waves. About three 
dozen more were threatened by water after bulkheads were washed out. 
</P>
<P>
The water damage was part of the windstorm that whipped into Washington on 
Friday with frigid temperatures and some snow. One woman on Vashon Island was 
killed by a falling tree. 
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 utility customers in western Washington were without electricity 
at one time. 
</P>
<P>
Puget Sound Power &amp; Light spokeswoman Heidi Dunlap said 52,000 customers 
were still without power Saturday morning. She said crews hoped to have service 
restored by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Since no power meant no heat, authorities set up three shelters. About 300 
people spent the night in them. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 28 East Coast cities broke or tied records for high temperatures. 
Among them, Cape Hatteras, N.C., was 75 degrees Saturday, breaking a 1984 
record for the date of 71. 
</P>
<P>
One day after Pennsylvania residents struggled with snow up to 16 inches deep, 
they encountered another hurdle to driving -- fog. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole state's pretty much blanketed in fog," Doug Young, a meteorologist 
with the National Weather Service, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The fog is produced by warm air moving over the cold snow, causing the snow to 
evaporate, he said. Visibility in many places ranged from half a mile to zero. 
</P>
<P>
"It could make driving hazardous, especially since there's a lot of slush on 
the road already," Young said. "Everything seems to be the same color." 
</P>
<P>
In south-central Pennsylvania, freezing rain caused numerous accidents, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-year-old Chambersburg, Pa., boy was killed and his brother was critically 
injured in a traffic accident caused by ice on the road Friday night before the 
fog set in. 
</P>
<P>
Icy roads in Oklahoma were blamed for the deaths Saturday of four people, 
including a Houston man, in three car crashes. There have been more than 90 
weather-related deaths since the wave of cold began Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
By afternoon in Pennsylvania, the fog thinned, and temperatures reached the 40s 
and 50s, melting most of the snowpack. More rain also was forecast, raising the 
possibility of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
In Arkansas, fears of more rain provoked the National Weather Service to issue 
a flash flood watch for the southeastern two-thirds of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service issued a flood warning Saturday for northwest, 
north-central and west-central Indiana.

SULLIVAN PROTESTS PROPOSED CUTS IN HHS BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan says millions of sick, 
elderly or poor Americans will suffer if proposed cuts in his budget are 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions would leave Sullivan's agency unable to maintain current 
services in programs like Medicare and Social Security, the secretary said in a 
letter to the White House protesting the Office of Management and Budget's 
proposed cuts. He said the result would be longer processing times for claims. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's letter said also that the OMB proposal would provide inadequate 
funds to turn more attention to prenatal care and expansion of programs to 
combat lead poisoning, breast cancer, tuberculosis and AIDS, as the department 
wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press, was sent last 
week to OMB Director Richard G. Darman. 
</P>
<P>
A department budget official said that during the past week much progress had 
been made in negotiations with OMB, but he declined to give specifics. The 
negotiations are continuing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said that cuts in funds for administration of the Health Care 
Financing Administration, which handles Medicare and Medicaid, and the Social 
Security Administration could hurt "our ability to respond to the needs of 50 
million aged and disabled beneficiaries." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Moley, HHS assistant secretary for management and budget, said that while 
the figure of 50 million was correct when the letter was written a week ago, it 
is "far fewer today than last week, and we expect to resolve those issues by 
the time we announce our budget." 
</P>
<P>
Moley declined to say how much money was in dispute, and the letter did not 
spell out the total. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's letter of appeal is part of the annual budget-making process. After 
a department drafts a budget request, OMB reviews it, makes changes and sends 
the resulting proposal, called a "pass back," to the department. The department 
then negotiates with OMB and, if still not satisfied, may appeal to the 
President himself. 
</P>
<P>
OMB's "pass back" to HHS would cut Medicare by $2.7 billion in addition to the 
nearly $6 billion agreed to in the deficit-reduction package approved by the 
Administration and Congress in October.

A disputed creche survived the holiday season. But Civic Club members who 
removed the life-size Nativity figures from the City Hall lawn on Saturday 
under a judge's order said they don't know whether it will be displayed next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like a lot of trouble over nothing. In our club, we don't preach 
anything, no politics, no race, no religion," said Evelyn Hinckley, a 
spokeswoman for the Monterey Civic Club, which sponsors the Nativity scene. "We 
are law-abiding citizens. We did not mean to start a tempest in a teapot." The 
City Council on Friday ordered the creche removed or reassembled with secular 
displays, such as a Santa Claus or reindeer. The vote was taken after a U.S. 
judge temporarily barred the scene because it violated the constitutional 
requirement of separation of church and state. The Civic Club decided against 
reassembling it. The American Civil Liberties Union sought the temporary 
restraining order on behalf of several plaintiffs, including 13-year-old Victor 
Ringel; Unitarian Church ministers Fred and Margaret Keip and the Rev. J. Kevin 
Phillips, an Episcopal priest. U.S. District Judge William Ingram, who issued 
the temporary restraining, gave the city three days to decide what to do.

IN THE 9TH, RECALLING LINDSAY'S LONG REIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cornelius Green was sitting in a barber's chair the morning he heard of his 
benefactor's death. As the scissors snipped his snowy hair, Green remembered 
the day he met Gilbert Lindsay. Had it really been 35 years? 
</P>
<P>
Green had been laid off at the old General Motors plant in South Gate. He 
needed a job, so his wife suggested he talk to Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn, who was known for helping people down on their luck. 
</P>
<P>
Green went to Hahn's office and met with one of his aides, Gil Lindsay. Next 
thing he knew, Green had a job as a gardener at a county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Had he worked on Hahn's campaign? Did they owe him? 
</P>
<P>
"Nope. They owed me nothing," said Green, now 72. "I can't say he did this for 
other people -- but he helped me." 
</P>
<P>
People who lived and worked in downtown Los Angeles and the neighborhoods that 
Gil Lindsay considered his empire remembered the late councilman in ways good, 
bad and indifferent. The first black to serve on the Los Angeles City Council, 
the short, blustery, cantankerous "Emperor of the 9th District" had been a 
political fixture for generations before his death Friday at the age of 90 
after a crippling stroke Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
He was the janitor who rose to become one of Los Angeles' premier power 
brokers; the orator who seemed to appear at a different church each Sunday; the 
name the guys at Eddie's Barber Shop invoked when they needed a pothole fixed; 
the patron of a shoeshine parlor who had a thick roll of cash but didn't bother 
to tip. 
</P>
<P>
"This Sunday a lot of preachers will be talking about him," said the Rev. 
William Herron of the Third Baptist Church, waiting his turn at Eddie's. Herron 
is 73. "I'm sorry he passed, but that's a vacation we'll all have to take." 
</P>
<P>
Even though some of Lindsay's constituents were unhappy with their 
deteriorating neighborhoods, most still voted for him. They spoke 
affectionately of him. 
</P>
<P>
When Greta Bell heard the news, she was hurt, she recalled. "I liked him 
because he was feisty." The proprietor of Greta's Place, a restaurant on 
Central Avenue, said even people who often disagreed with Lindsay "liked him 
because he spoke his mind." 
</P>
<P>
"He did a lot of good things. I mean, I want to balance out the negative and 
the positive," said a shoeshine man who requested anonymity. "But he was 
cheap!" 
</P>
<P>
Central Avenue offers a stark viewpoint of the contrasting Lindsay legacy. To 
the north rises the downtown skyline that Lindsay's allies call a monument to 
the councilman's vision of economic growth and critics suggest is a reflection 
of his cozy dealings with big developers. But Central itself, once the vibrant, 
stylish main boulevard of Los Angeles' black community, has deteriorated into a 
graffiti-scarred stretch where small businesses like Greta's struggle alongside 
vacant storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
No one disputes that Central has gone downhill. How much Lindsay was to blame 
was a matter of some debate. 
</P>
<P>
"They're spending money downtown refurbishing everything," another shoeshine 
man complained. "They need to spend $7 million or $8 million on Central 
Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
He was among a few people who suggested that Lindsay lost sight of his duties 
after Theresa, his wife of 48 years, died in 1984. "He was good when his wife 
was living," the shoeshine man said. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Williams, a 37-year-old auto mechanic for the Southern California Gas 
Co., said critics were too hard on Lindsay. Over lunch at Greta's, he 
remembered how his congregation at McCoy Memorial Baptist Church always looked 
forward to a visit from Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd say he was just an extension of the people, a voice for them," Williams 
recalled. "People who never really knew him, never heard him speak, they might 
have negative things to say." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the lobby of Mt. Zion Towers, a seniors' housing complex, Azlee 
Ross, 66, sought a middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was young he did a beautiful job," said Ross. "He did. But he has let 
this area go down." 
</P>
<P>
But, Ross said, it wasn't just Lindsay's fault. A lot of people are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
If people didn't always agree with his policies, they mostly liked his style. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked his style in council meetings," said William Patton, a barber at 
Eddie's on Jefferson Boulevard. "If he heard something he didn't like, he'd 
just jump up and speak out -- 'Hey, hey, hey!' " 
</P>
<P>
Patton laughed with the memory. "Sometimes he was wrong, sometimes he was 
right. But he spoke out." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie's Barber Shop isn't even in Lindsay's district, but just across the 
district boundary. Yet barber C.M. McNeal remembered that when the shop had a 
problem getting public works to fix a pothole outside, the barbers mentioned 
Lindsay's name. Soon, the pothole was fixed. 
</P>
<P>
The last few years were sad ones for Lindsay, the Rev. Herron suggested. He 
remembered working on Lindsay's campaigns early in his council career. Lindsay 
was a positive force who lost something as the years marched on, Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
"As he got older, like all of us, well, you lose sight of a lot of things," the 
preacher said. The controversy over Lindsay's property, some of which he had 
deeded to a 39-year-old girlfriend, was a symptom, the preacher said. "An old 
man like that wanting a young woman like that," Herron muttered in disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a pretty good job. . . . A lot of people thought he didn't do a good 
job for the neighborhoods. But remember, he wasn't a young man when he got on 
the council. He started out as a janitor and worked himself up to the City 
Council -- that's something. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry he died," the preacher repeated. "But we all must travel. There's no 
getting around it."

2 MOTHERS HELD IN BEATING OF CHILDREN TO DRIVE OUT SATAN;

Children as young as 4 were whipped with telephone cords or belts until they 
screamed "Demon anger, be out of me!" as part of a small religious group's 
chastisements, said police, who have arrested the mothers of several of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Ten children, some bruised and scarred with welts, were picked up from across 
the Los Angeles area on the day after Christmas and placed with relatives or in 
protective care, said Los Angeles Police Officer Victor Williams. And on 
Friday, police arrested two women on suspicion of willful cruelty to children, 
a felony, said Cmdr. William Booth. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Okongwu and Deloris Porter, both 31, were being held Saturday on 
$20,000 bail each. Okongwu is the mother of four of the children, and Porter is 
the mother of three, police said. They belong to "some group called Jesus 
Cathedral," said Booth, a group that held its religious services in a rented 
conference room at an airport motel. "They punish their kids by beating the 
devil, Satan, out of them in a manner that's really too harsh." 
</P>
<P>
"These kids were led to believe these beatings were the will of God," said 
Williams, who with his partner Loretta Smith interviewed the children they 
picked up and saw their scars. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were being selfish or mischievous or angry, the parents would write 
these words on a piece of paper -- 'Demon anger, be out of me!' " -- and beat 
the children until they screamed what the adults had written down. "These kids 
thought these beatings made them a better person." 
</P>
<P>
The beatings were "by far the worst I've ever seen in my 10 years on the Police 
Department," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two weeks before Christmas, Williams said, Wilshire Division police 
had gotten calls about children's crying coming from the beige stucco, boxlike 
duplex, home to three or four families who other neighbors say had moved in 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
But no one would answer the door, and the complaining neighbor left no phone 
number, Williams said, so police could do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 26, Williams said, one of the girl's aunts "apparently saw bruises on 
the girl's back and decided she had to do something about it. They knew from 
talking to the kids that it stemmed from the church beatings," he said. "That's 
where (the aunt) drew the line." 
</P>
<P>
Police picked up 10 of the 11 children they knew of, all ages 4 to 14, and 
"placed them in protective custody, interviewed the parents and the minister, 
whoever we could talk to," Williams said. Three children were found in a house 
in El Monte, he said, and one was found at the motel conference room where 
services were held for what appeared to be the group's small, mostly female 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
There, Williams and his partner spoke with the minister, Chester Newvine or 
Newbine, Williams could not recall which. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he anointed the parents' hands that they may do God's work. But he 
never said he anointed them specifically to beat their kids," Williams said. 
"Ironically, when we were leaving, I could hear this guy preaching there was 
nothing wrong with whipping your kids. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents were wholeheartedly participating," Williams said. "They felt 
their minister wouldn't steer them wrong." When one child was beaten, "all the 
other kids were brought into the room and made to watch." 
</P>
<P>
The older children were punished with telephone cords, Williams said, and the 
younger ones with belts. If a child bore marks or bruises, Williams said, he 
was told "that child was kept out of school until it could go back to school 
with no scars." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 26, one woman, a member of the religious group and mother of at least 
one of the children, was arrested for outstanding traffic warrants, Williams 
said. On Friday, police came back and arrested Okongwu and Porter. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of the kids did not believe that what was going on was right," 
Williams said. "They do not want to be returned to their parents."

GIRL FATALLY SHOT AS SHE WATCHES TV IN HER HOME; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: TANYA CADLE, 13, DIES HOURS AFTER HER PARENTS HAVE HER DISCONNECTED 
FROM LIFE SUPPORT. POLICE CALL THE INCIDENT AN APPARENT DRIVE-BY SHOOTING.

<P>
A 13-year-old girl was fatally shot through her family's South Los Angeles 
living room window early Saturday as she watched television, a special occasion 
in which her normally strict mother had allowed her to stay up late because a 
friend was spending the night. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Cadle was rendered brain dead by a single shot to her head and died hours 
later at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after her parents had her disconnected 
from life-support systems, a hospital spokesman said. There were no other 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear the shots, I just heard my son shouting, 'Get down! Get down!' " 
said Tanya's mother, Eleanor Cadle, a devout Seventh-day Adventist. "Then we 
came out here and found (Tanya's girlfriend) on the floor and my daughter on 
the sofa." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police described the crime in the 3000 block of South Hillcrest 
Drive as an apparent drive-by shooting. They had made no arrests Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Cadle, a security officer at USC, said that she and her husband, Dean, 
a chemical technician for a wheel manufacturer, had no idea what led to the 
shooting but that they resented early news reports implying that the crime was 
gang related. "No one here is affiliated with the gangs and we have nothing to 
retaliate about," she said firmly, as friends and fellow church members crowded 
her small home. 
</P>
<P>
The family, originally from Belize, moved to the quiet street of 
well-maintained bungalows about two months ago in the belief that it was a step 
up from their home on South Catalina Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for something better and it's better than where I was," Eleanor 
Cadle said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was one of a number of shootings that took place over the weekend, 
including a 13-year-old who was shot to death in Pomona while he slept. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cadle home in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles, grim family friends 
shook their heads in disbelief and anger as they took in the enormity of the 
violence. Bloodstains were visible on the brown sofa where Tanya had been 
watching television, across from a brightly lit Christmas tree. Lace and 
peach-colored curtains adorned the bullet-shatterred window and a well-thumbed 
Bible was on the coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya was a B student at Forshay Junior High School and had just returned from 
a church youth meeting when she asked to stay up late watching a video, her 
mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a very nice family and they try to bring their kids up as best they 
can," said Clarine Davis, a friend. "It's a respectable family -- that's why it 
hurt so much when they said it was related to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand. We're just baffled. We try to do things with our kids to 
keep them off the streets; we're family people. You get to the point where you 
feel like you're doing the best you can, and then the kids aren't even safe 
when they are home." 
</P>
<P>
In other weekend violence: 
</P>
<P>
* A 13-year-old boy was fatally shot as he slept on a sofa in his grandmother's 
house in Pomona. Adrian Ferrusca of Claremont was killed about 1:30 a.m. 
Saturday when three suspects entered and left through the kitchen door, Pomona 
Police Officer Megan Blehr said. 
</P>
<P>
Although police said the victim was not a gang member, they described the 
shooting as retaliation for the deeds of relatives, calling the home a "known 
gang location." The family could not be reached for comment. No arrests have 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
* A 45-year-old candy vendor was found shot to death in his van in the 1500 
block of West 84th Place on Friday evening. Antonio Guerrero of Huntington Park 
was an apparent robbery victim, said Los Angeles Police Officer Roger Burton. 
No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
* Five alleged gang members were wounded -- one critically -- when they 
ventured into hostile territory in east Valinda and were ambushed with an AK-47 
rifle, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. The incident occurred about 
11 p.m. Friday near Gemini Street and Sandalwood Avenue in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Two suspects, ages 13 and 14, were being questioned Saturday afternoon but no 
charges had been filed, said Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified as Michelle Frondina, 18, of La Puente, listed in 
extremely critical condition at Queen of the Valley Hospital with wounds to her 
chest and back, and Edward Guerrero, 19, of La Puente, in serious but stable 
condition at County-USC Medical Center with multiple wounds to his upper torso. 
In stable condition were John Salazar, 18, of La Puente, at County-USC Medical 
Center; and two juveniles, ages 17 and 16, at Brea Community Hospital and 
Whittier Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
* A 24-year-old alleged gang member, suspected of fatally stabbing a mother of 
four during a Thursday night crime rampage, surrendered to police in Long Beach 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Darin Percy of Los Angeles was booked on suspicion of murder. Police allege he 
is the "actual knife-wielder" responsible for the death of Tomasa Rivas, 44, 
who was robbed as she returned from a grocery trip with her husband, Jesus 
Rivas, 52. Seven other suspects have been arrested in connection with the 
incident.

DEPOSITION: KIMBLE GOT MONEY, TOO; 
</P>
<P>
LOYOLA: ATTORNEY FOR GATHERS FAMILY SAYS PLAYER ALSO RECEIVED FUNDS FROM ALBERT 
GERSTEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Fagel, the attorney for the family of Hank Gathers, said Saturday that 
Loyola Marymount University officials not only knew Gathers was receiving 
improper cash payments when he was on a basketball scholarship to the school, 
but they encouraged the "deal" by ignoring it. Speaking from Hawaii, where he 
is vacationing, Fagel also implicated Bo Kimble, saying that Gathers' mother, 
Lucille, saw Kimble receive money from Albert Gersten, the booster she says 
also gave money to her son. 
</P>
<P>
"In Lucille Gathers' testimony, in her deposition, she says she saw Albert 
Gersten going around a dinner table after a game, peeling off money and giving 
it to the players," Fagel said, adding that Lucille told him the incident 
occurred after an NCAA tournament game in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she saw Gersten give money to Hank and to Bo, but then the attorneys 
started going down the list of players, asking Mrs. Gathers who else received 
the money, and she wouldn't identify any others." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said Lucille Gathers' testimony was taken in connection with a wrongful 
death suit filed by Gathers' family against Loyola and 13 other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, reached at the Los Angeles Airport, said he would not comment on the 
allegation. "I have been advised by my attorney not to give a comment because 
of pending litigation," Kimble said upon returning from the Clippers' game 
Saturday in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Fagel was reacting to a Times story, reported Thursday, which quoted from 
depositions. His statement Saturday came from additional information from other 
depositions. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Thursday that Lucille Gathers testified under oath that she 
received $2,000 in cash from her son, plus gifts, while he was attending 
Loyola. She said Gathers bought the gifts with money he received from Gersten, 
a Loyola Marymount alumnus and Beverly Hills real estate developer. Gersten is 
the main contributor to the university gymnasium, named for his father. 
</P>
<P>
He has previously denied allegations that he gave Gathers money. Gersten could 
not be reached Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Such gifts to a player are violations of NCAA rules, and if the accusations 
found are true, Loyola will face penalties by the NCAA and the West Coast 
Conference, Loyola's league. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers collapsed March 4 at Gersten Pavilion while playing in a conference 
tournament game and was pronounced dead 1 hour 40 minutes later. An autopsy 
determined the cause of death to be cardiomyopathy, a heart disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers' mother, brothers Derrick and Charles, and an aunt, Carol Livingston, 
filed a $32.5-million suit claiming negligence, conspiracy and wrongful death. 
The suit has been consolidated with another filed by Gathers' 6-year-old son, 
Aaron Crump. 
</P>
<P>
Fagel seeks to prove that Lucille Gathers was being supported by her son to sue 
for wrongful death, the strongest cause of his suit. A motion to decide the 
issue will be heard in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Fagel issued a statement on behalf of the family in response to The 
Times report, saying: 
</P>
<P>
". . . The family does not accuse Albert Gersten of doing anything except being 
Hank's friend and helping the Gathers family survive financially before Hank's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"After Hank's death, both Gersten and his wife were there to provide moral 
support for the family. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Al Gersten did nothing wrong then or now. The real villains in this story are 
not Lucille or Hank for accepting money or Al Gersten for giving it, but rather 
Loyola for encouraging a deal involving Hank Gathers, then reaping all the 
benefits of that deal. And now they are trying to deny the existence of a deal 
which flies in the face of all the facts which are known about Hank Gathers 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said the "deal" was a way to keep Gathers in school instead of turning 
professional after his junior season, in which he led the nation in scoring and 
rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no written contract, but Hank knew that his mother's disability 
payments (for hepatitis) were about to run out, and that his statistics in his 
junior year would put him in the top 10 in the NBA draft," Fagel said. "His mom 
wanted him to stay in school to get his degree, but Hank also wanted to take 
care of himself and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"So then Gathers decides to stay in school, and the next thing he moves into a 
$1,100 a month apartment of which he pays the entire rent. He gets a brand new 
car and has enough cash to do his thing, and if that meant going to the (horse) 
track then he could, and he has enough money to take care of his mother. And 
there are several components to this deal that clearly had to involve people 
beyond Gersten and (then head coach Paul) Westhead." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said that Westhead, in his deposition, denied knowing anything about 
Gathers receiving money from Gersten. "But I think that is the reason Westhead 
left the school, because he knew what was coming down and he didn't want to 
bear the brunt of an NCAA investigation," Fagel said. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead left Loyola to become coach of the Denver Nuggets of the NBA. "I knew 
nothing of what he was talking about (the alleged payments)," Westhead said 
Saturday from Washington, where the Nuggets played the Bullets. "His 
assumptions (that an NCAA investigation played a part in his leaving Loyola for 
the Nuggets) are erroneous. Beyond that, I have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
In his senior year, Gathers drove a new Mercury Cougar leased from Southwest 
Leasing and Rental Company in Los Angeles. It was returned to that company in 
July by Derrick Gathers, Gathers brother. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was co-signed by a business associate of Al Gersten, who had no 
affiliation with Loyola, but had no reason to co-sign other than that he was 
close to Gersten," Fagel said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Quinn, Loyola's athletic director, has repeatedly denied the allegations 
and said he was satisfied with Gathers' explanation that he obtained his new 
car by getting a loan from a friend in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said Saturday: "Hank wanted to live off campus and he received the 
stipend for room and board (around $600), and that is normal. A lot of our 
athletes want to live off campus. It sounds to me that Mr. Fagel wants to try 
the case in the newspaper instead of the court system. Let this go and be 
decided through the proper legal system." 
</P>
<P>
For Loyola's basketball program, that legal system is the NCAA, which has not 
commented specifically on the case. Fagel and Lucille Gathers say that Derrick 
Gathers also received money directly from Gersten. 
</P>
<P>
"In Derrick's deposition testimony, he says that he used to go to Gersten's 
house with Hank to pick up money," Fagel said. "At first, Derrick said Hank 
would go upstairs and return with the money, and they would leave. Then Gersten 
became comfortable with Derrick and would hand Hank the money in front of him. 
After a while, Derrick said Gersten would give him cash, too." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear if Cal State Northridge, which Derrick attended on a basketball 
scholarship, could be penalized by the NCAA if Gersten gave money to him 
directly or indirectly. Northridge is filing a report to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that penalties Loyola might face have nothing to do with the 
suit the Gathers' family is pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
". . . The family does not consider NCAA rules to be appropriate under these 
conditions," Fagel said.

TABLES TURNED ON THE RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER WATCHING THE CHIEFS BEAT BEARS, THEY MUST BEAT CHARGERS TO 
WIN THE AFC WEST TITLE AND ITS PERKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after the Chicago Bears offered quarterback Mike Tomczak's five-for-23 
performance to Kansas City at Soldier Field, the Chiefs settle around their 
televisions to await their futures and protest the quarterback shenanigans 
involved in today's now all-deciding game between the Raiders and San Diego 
Chargers at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in two weeks, the Chiefs postponed the outcome in the AFC 
West with a victory, beating the Chicago Bears, 21-10, on Saturday. Now Kansas 
City's fate rests in the hands of a Charger team that has perhaps abandoned the 
spirit of fair play with the decision to start rookie quarterback John Friesz 
against the Raiders in his NFL debut. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (6-9) reserve the right to play out a lousy season any way they 
choose, but is this any time to hold a tryout camp? It depends on which side of 
the Rockies you take center snaps. If the Raiders win, the division crown is 
theirs, along with its first-round playoff bye. So, bring on the John Frieszes 
of the world and any other player buried on San Diego's depth chart. If the 
Raiders lose, Kansas City wins the West and the Raiders advance to the playoffs 
as a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Chiefs lodge complaints. They can't believe San Diego would throw 
Friesz to the Raiders with a perfectly healthy Billy Joe Tolliver on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders might argue their consciences are clear considering that the Chiefs 
were handed the gift of Tomczak, who surely couldn't have played any worse in 
Saturday's loss to Kansas City than Friesz might today against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
You think the Raiders didn't want to clinch the AFC West in their living rooms? 
</P>
<P>
Well, they claimed all week they were out to beat the Chargers, no matter the 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to play as if we are in the playoff chase," defensive end Greg 
Townsend said. "Because that's what we're getting ready for, going into the 
playoffs. We need a win so that we have that attitude for winning. We need to 
get ready for other things." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders don't mind that San Diego has chosen to start Friesz, except that 
he hasn't left much of a celluloid trail. Football coaches are movie hounds, 
notorious for filming anything that moves on a football field for the purposes 
of later scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Friesz has few football fingerprints, unless you're satisfied in breaking down 
four passes he threw in exhibitions. Oh, don't forget that summer scrimmage he 
played at Flagstaff, Ariz. "There's not a whole lot," Raider Coach Art Shell 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
What the Raiders know: Friesz is right-handed, 6-foot-4 and 209 pounds. He 
looks like a quarterback. He passed for more than 10,000 yards at the 
University of Idaho, a division I-AA school, so apparently he can locate the 
seams on the ball. The Chargers selected him in the sixth round, so this isn't 
Troy Aikman. San Diego stashed Friesz on injured reserve Sept. 4 for future 
considerations, never thinking they would be considering this soon. 
</P>
<P>
If Friesz seems rusty, it's because he did not take a snap with the first-team 
offense until this week, and then it wasn't a pretty picture. Let's just say 
the Raiders' leading sacker, Townsend, did not lose sleep this week worrying 
about Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was good, and I'm not saying the guy's not good, but if he was good 
enough to give us a lot of problems, they would be playing him (before today)," 
Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
Even San Diego Coach Dan Henning admits Friesz is "raw as an egg." 
</P>
<P>
So is this a future quarterback or the makings of an omelet? That's what 
Henning intends to find out at the expense of one regular-season NFL football 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Henning thought he had his future quarterback in Tolliver, but Tolliver has 
exasperated his coach so thoroughly in recent weeks with crippling mistakes 
that Henning, with all the tact of a schoolmarm, rapped him on the knuckles 
this week and sent him to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver's final mistake was an interception thrown last week with 1:48 
remaining in a 24-21 loss to Kansas City. The Chargers were driving for what 
could have been the winning touchdown when Tolliver launched a throw that 
passed 15 feet over the head of the nearest Charger into the waiting arms of 
Chiefs' safety Deron Cherry. 
</P>
<P>
"I fully believe Billy has made excellent progress," Henning said. "He has to 
get over that propensity he's had in the last few weeks of making a rotten 
throw that takes a drive away that could win the football game." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Friesz's performance today will help determine the future of the 
franchise, which is asking a lot of a rookie who is just learning the playbook. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's ever easy," Henning said. "You have to start somewhere. . . . It 
behooves us to find out as a franchise and as a team . . . whether he is 
legitimate competition as we develop Billy Joe Tolliver. If he's not, then we 
have to find other and more competition." 
</P>
<P>
The move doesn't bode well for immediate backup Mark Vlasic, who might be 
charting his last game from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said the Friesz experiment is not some one-series ploy to complicate 
Raider preparations. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be in there as long as we can compete," he said. "If I think he's being 
a detriment for us competing, then we'd go back to Billy. If we're in there, 
and we're in the ballgame, he stands to play the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Entering the last game of the regular season, receivers Willie Gault and Mervyn 
Fernandez are tied for the team lead with 49 receptions each. Gault needs 45 
receiving yards today to surpass 1,000 for the first time in his career. . . . 
Tight end Ethan Horton has established his career high for receptions with 31. 
. . . Quarterback Jay Schroeder needs 313 yards passing today to surpass 3,000 
for the season. Schroeder's nine interceptions are the fewest he has thrown 
since part-time work during his rookie season in 1985. He has thrown twice as 
many touchdown passes, 18, in 1990. Schroeder had thrown 13 more interceptions 
than touchdowns entering the season but has cut the gap to 68 touchdowns versus 
72 interceptions. . . . In the race for the team rushing championship, Bo 
Jackson leads Marcus Allen, 670 yards to 652. . . . The Raiders lead the series 
against San Diego, 38-21-2. . . . Because of a foot injury, Charger fullback 
Marion Butts has lost his NFL rushing lead to Buffalo's Thurman Thomas, who has 
gained 1,297 yards to Butts' 1,225. Butts was inactive for last week's game 
against Kansas City and is not expected to play today. Neither is defensive 
lineman Burt Grossman, who suffered cracked ribs last week.

Harold Miner watches the little guy in the black-and-white movie, weaving in 
and out, in and out, dribbling and driving, dribbling and driving. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Cousy always kept his teammates happy. That was his specialty. And he was 
never satisfied. Cousy always tried to elevate his game to another level. I try 
to incorporate that into my own style of play." 
</P>
<P>
And now Miner watches a taller guy in another old movie, working over a 
defender, making his move, making his shot, making his man look bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Oscar Robertson, now he was a consummate basketball player. Watch him back the 
guy guarding him toward the basket, use his body and his strength to his 
complete advantage. I'm built more like Oscar. I'd like to be more like him." 
</P>
<P>
Miner pops still another cassette into his VCR. He watches poetry in motion. He 
watches an artist at work. He watches Julius Erving. 
</P>
<P>
"Now with Doctor J, it was more like ballet. It was grace and style. He turned 
basketball into an art form. Everything Julius Erving did on that court was a 
thing of beauty." 
</P>
<P>
And finally the films are in living color and current and hi-fi'd and Dolby'd. 
And the star of the show is a guy from Chicago, a guy with his tongue hanging 
out, a guy who makes other guys' jaws drop. And this guy looks amazingly like 
Harold Miner, only older. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Jordan? Well, the only word that I can think of to describe Michael is 
greatness. You know, people try to compare me to Michael, and I just laugh and 
laugh at that. I'm no Michael, no way, no how. God, well, He doesn't make too 
many Michaels." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Miner, 19, already has become something of a basketball historian. He is 
a student of the game, this USC sophomore who has developed into one of the 
nation's top scorers. He raids the video stores and book shops, checking out 
every videotape or volume that has anything to do with basketball, past or 
present, from Naismith to Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Miner is much like Mike Tyson, who even in his teens had 
committed to memory details and facts from the fights of Jack Dempsey, Gene 
Tunney, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali and others before and after. 
Miner studies basketball players like homework, oldies and newies. He's 
different from other guys his age who wouldn't know Bob Cousy from Bing Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
Has it paid off? Well, it hasn't hurt. Miner almost certainly will break John 
Block's quarter-century old USC record for points in a season. Already this 
season, the 6-foot-5 guard has lit up Notre Dame for 35 points and nine 
rebounds, made Digger Phelps regret not landing him as a recruit and moved Dick 
Vitale to refer to Miner as "the best thing to happen to USC since football." 
</P>
<P>
He keeps playing the way he's playing, some day they'll make movies about him. 
</P>
<P>
With George Raveling's Trojans only now venturing into the taller weeds of 
their schedule, beginning Wednesday night at UCLA, Miner has become the 
Pac-10's player to watch, the conference's leading returning scorer from last 
season. He is building a Miner cult following. A fan club. Harold examiners? 
</P>
<P>
His nickname is Baby Jordan. Like Michael, he shaves his head, rubs his fingers 
together like a dice shooter, floats to the hoop with his tongue in a droop. He 
says he sometimes has dreams at night in which he leaps for a dunk from the 
free-throw line and jams the ball through the basket backward. 
</P>
<P>
Miner is so infatuated with Michael that he thought about enrolling at North 
Carolina, just for a shared experience. Even his number is 23. Harold 
identifies with him so, he probably pours Diet Coke over his Wheaties. 
</P>
<P>
Also like Jordan, however, Miner would sacrifice some of his personal success 
if only USC could establish itself as more of a force in college basketball, 
after having losing records over five consecutive seasons. The Trojans were 
49-95 during that span. 
</P>
<P>
He could lead them out of the hoop wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Miner is one of the best players in the country," Phelps said after 
Notre Dame's 105-95 loss to USC at South Bend, Ind. "We really wanted him here, 
and you can see why. He's going to be one of the greatest scorers the game has 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing about Miner picking USC: One of the main reasons he did so was to 
play closer to his family in Inglewood. Then his father, Melvin Miner, a 
computer programmer for IBM, was transferred to Colorado. So, when Harold 
scored 24 points in USC's 74-67 victory on Dec. 8 at Colorado State, it was the 
first chance his father had to see him play in a collegiate game. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attendance is growing at USC home games, as both Miner and the team 
get better and better. 
</P>
<P>
No matter who is out there watching him, Miner is a performer suitable for 
children or adults. He is a sensation with the critics, even if he is not yet 
big box office, and we definitely give him thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it doesn't matter if it's a hundred people," Miner said. "When Doctor J 
was playing at Massachusetts, he was always playing in front of empty crowds."

AGGIES HANG DETMER ON TROPHY WALL; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY BOWL: BYU'S HEISMAN WINNER SUFFERS SEPARATIONS OF BOTH SHOULDERS AS 
TEXAS A&amp;M ROMPS TO 65-14 VICTORY. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An option quarterback who leads a team with the nation's fourth-leading rushing 
attack stormed into Brigham Young's winter home Saturday night, grabbed the 
Cougars by the throat and seized a healthy dose of respect for Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies blitzed furiously enough to separate both of Heisman Trophy winner 
Ty Detmer's shoulders, quarterback Bucky Richardson and the rest of the offense 
executed with near perfection and Texas A&amp;M dismantled No. 13 BYU, 65-14. 
It was the most lopsided game in the 13-year history of the Holiday Bowl and 
the most lopsided loss in BYU history. 
</P>
<P>
The blowout, which came before 61,441 in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium -- the 
second-largest crowd in Holiday Bowl history -- surpassed Oklahoma State's 
62-14 rout of Wyoming in the 1988 game. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (10-3), who have played in nine of 13 Holiday Bowls, suffered their 
worst defeat in the game since a 47-17 loss to Ohio State in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, it was our most complete football game," Texas A&amp;M Coach 
R.C. Slocum said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson completed nine of 11 passes for 203 yards and a touchdown, rushing 
12 times for 119 yards and even catching a 22-yard touchdown pass from halfback 
Darren Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
His passing yardage was the biggest surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't throw a lot, they just threw it effectively," BYU Coach LaVell 
Edwards said. "Very effectively. Their play-action -- when you get that running 
and attack as well as they did. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They did about what they wanted to and kept doing it." 
</P>
<P>
All of those numbers, and Richardson didn't even play a full game. He left 
after the first series of the fourth quarter with the Aggies ahead, 51-14. 
</P>
<P>
He was the first quarterback since BYU's Steve Young in the 1983 Holiday Bowl 
to catch, run and pass for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like that was the best game of my career," said Richardson, a 6-foot-1, 
214-pound junior. 
</P>
<P>
He almost quit the team last spring because Aggie coaches were running a 
straight passing game, and he didn't see any place in the scheme for an option 
quarterback. This is a guy who missed all last season with a bad knee. 
</P>
<P>
The option? The Aggies (9-3-1) ran only 16 option plays all of last year and, 
when this season started, had only two option plays in their playbook. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, their game plan ran the gamut. They started with the option, worked 
in some key passes and delivered the knockout punch with some trick plays. They 
used the halfback pass and reverses . . . nearly every trick play from their 
playbook. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept them on their toes all night long," Richardson said. "Offensively, 
that's what you try to do, and that's what we did. We know we're a good team, 
and we hadn't gotten the respect we deserve. I think we proved tonight we can 
play with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M scored the first touchdown, watched BYU tie the game, 7-7, then 
reeled off 30 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing worse than the final score may have been the final statistics. 
The Aggies, averaging 319 rushing yards, rolled up 356 against BYU. The Cougars 
had minus-12. The Aggies, not exactly known as a passing team, threw for 324 
yards to BYU's 197. 
</P>
<P>
As for total offense, Texas A&amp;M had 680. BYU checked in with 185. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me we did anything as easy as we did," Richardson said. "We 
executed all night long." 
</P>
<P>
Detmer was forced to leave the game early in the third quarter. He suffered a 
partially separated left shoulder when William Thomas sacked him just past the 
midway point of the second quarter. Detmer went into the BYU dressing room and 
had it numbed, then returned to finish the half. 
</P>
<P>
But with 11:58 left in the third quarter and BYU trailing, 37-7, he was sacked 
by Anthony Williams and landed hard enough to separate his right shoulder. 
Detmer went to the sidelines, paced, picked up a ball, threw one pass and then 
kicked his helmet several yards in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt to raise (the right shoulder)," he said. "When I had the previous 
shoulder injury, it didn't hurt to raise it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to leave a game unless I can't throw or run. It hurt to throw." 
</P>
<P>
He finished with 11 completions on 23 attempts for 120 yards and a touchdown. 
For the first time all season, he didn't pass for 300 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of that was because Texas A&amp;M's blitz, led by outside 
linebackers Marcus Buckley and Thomas, was effective all night. Detmer was 
sacked twice for minus-45 yards, and backup Joe Evans was sacked three more 
times for minus-27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we were so successful tonight was because we kept getting a lot of 
pressure on them," Thomas said. "We set out to get a lot of pressure, and 
that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
Said Edwards: "We figured they would try to come after us with the blitz. We've 
had success against it, but we didn't tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The blitz kept BYU off-balance and allowed Texas A&amp;M to take the 30-point 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing really surprised us," BYU linebacker Alema Fitisemanu said. "They just 
ran it down our throats. The reverses, halfback pass . . . we were probably 
out-coached and out-manned tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Large deficits are nothing new to BYU. The Cougars came back from a 45-26 
deficit against Southern Methodist in 1980 to win, 46-45, in one of the wildest 
Holiday Bowl games ever played. 
</P>
<P>
But not this time.

<P>
IT WASN'T DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE THE BEST OF 1990 
</P>

<P>
Rarely in recent years has it been as easy to select golf's players of the year 
as it was in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Faldo, Lee Trevino, Beth Daniel and Phil Mickelson stood out like beacons. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo played only seven events on the PGA Tour, but the tall Englishman won the 
Masters for the second year in a row and the British Open for the second time 
and failed by only a stroke of making the playoff for the U.S. Open title. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA of America recognized his feats by making him the first foreigner to be 
named its player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman was the tour's leading money winner with $1,165,477 and the Vardon 
Trophy winner for having the year's lowest scoring average, but when it came to 
a head-to-head showdown against Faldo, Norman failed miserably. 
</P>
<P>
On the Old Course at St. Andrews, where Faldo and Norman were tied for the lead 
after 36 holes of the British Open and in a match-play situation, Faldo shot a 
67 and Norman a 76. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Levi of the United States won four tournaments -- two more than anyone 
else on the American tour -- and more than $1 million but was never a factor in 
a major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Hale Irwin, 45, whose dramatic playoff victory over Mike Donald made him the 
U.S. Open's oldest champion, won the next week in the Buick tournament, but 
that was it for him. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, in his first year on the Senior PGA Tour, made more money than Norman, 
earning $1,190,518 in 29 events. Trevino won seven tournaments, including three 
of his first four, to become the first senior to collect more than the leading 
money-winner on the PGA Tour -- even though the senior circuit offered about 
$18 million less in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, the other senior rookie, won two of the four events he entered. 
In the U.S. Senior Open, Nicklaus needed to make a three-foot birdie putt to 
have a chance of catching Trevino and forcing a playoff. The putt set up one of 
the most prophetic lines of the sports year on TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack has a habit of peeking on these," Trevino said from the TV tower. "And 
when he does, it goes (to the) right." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus peeked, and the ball drifted right of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel won seven tournaments, including the LPGA Championship, was the leading 
women's money-winner with $863,578 -- which would have been good enough for No. 
6 on the men's list -- and also took the Vare Trophy for low scoring average of 
70.54. 
</P>
<P>
Her only challengers were Patty Sheehan, who won five tournaments and was 
runner-up in earnings, scoring and player-of-the-year points, and Betsy King, 
who won two major titles -- the Dinah Shore and the U. S. Open -- but only one 
other tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The most dominating of all was Mickelson, the San Diego left-hander who won the 
U.S. Amateur title and his second consecutive NCAA championship, then said that 
instead of turning professional immediately, he planned to remain at Arizona 
State two more years and get his degree. 
</P>
<P>
Only Nicklaus, when he was 21 and a senior, had won the Amateur and the NCAA in 
the same season. Mickelson did it as a sophomore of 19. 
</P>
<P>
"College golf is my No. 1 priority; I plan on staying all four years," said 
Mickelson, who became the first left-hander to win the Amateur when he defeated 
his former high school teammate, South African Manny Zerman of Arizona. 
Mickelson and Zerman both attended University High in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson also won the Pacific 10 title, the Porter Cup (shooting a record 63 
in the final round), the USA-Japan Friendship matches and the Rebel tournament 
and was low amateur in the U. S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Next April, in the first round of the Masters, there will be a pairing of 
6-foot-3 champions when Mickelson and Faldo tee off together. And a couple of 
months later, Mickelson will attempt to be the only collegian to duplicate Ben 
Crenshaw's three consecutive NCAA titles, which Crenshaw won in 1971-73. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson will open the 1991 season with a sponsor's exemption into the 
Shearson Lehman Brothers Open Feb. 14-17 at Torrey Pines, a course Mickelson 
played during the Optimist Junior World Championships a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman will make his only 1991 Southern California PGA Tour appearance in 
the Infiniti Tournament of Champions, which starts Thursday at La Costa. Norman 
plans to return to Australia afterward and will play only in the AT&amp;T 
tournament at Pebble Beach before rejoining the tour in Florida in late 
February. Norman finished third, fourth and fifth in three previous tries at La 
Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Addis III, head professional at Singing Hills CC in El Cajon, is on course 
to become president of the PGA after his election as secretary during the 
association's 74th meeting at the La Quinta Hotel. At the same meeting, Dick 
Smith of Williamstown, N.J., succeeded Pat Rielly of Pasadena's Annandale GC as 
president. Addis, 45, was twice named SoCal PGA professional of the year, and 
two years ago received the National Golf Foundation's Joe Graffis Award for 
outstanding service and dedication to the advancement of golf. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden State Tour, which has grown from nine tournaments in 1983 to 
encompass 175 days of golf this year, will open its ninth season Jan. 7 on the 
Eisenhower course at Industry Hills. Owner/operator Doug Ives has more than 150 
one-, two-, three- and four-day events scheduled in 1991 for his 900 members, 
who are almost equally divided among professionals and amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Smith, a three-time president of the SoCal PGA in 1964, 1968-70 and 
1974, is the newest member of the SCPGA Hall of Fame. Smith, operator of the 
Green River and Riverside GC courses, was national professional of the year in 
1965 and received the same honor in the SoCal district four times between 1963 
and '69. Also honored by the SCGA were Scott Bentley of Mt. Woodson CC, as 
player of the year; Perry Dickey Jr. of SeaCliff CC in Huntington Beach, as 
professional of the year; Andy Gustafson, executive director of the SoCal Golf 
Assn., as recipient of the President's Award, and Gerald Ford and Dinah Shore, 
as honorary life members. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach city courses have been cited by the National Golf Foundation for a 
public golf achievement award. Also honored were Menifee Lakes CC, Marriott's 
Desert Springs Resort in Palm Desert and Rancho Bernardo Inn in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more unusual winners during the year was Grace Blevens of Hacienda 
GC, who teamed with club champions Millie Stanley of Wilshire, Mosako Iqushi of 
Friendly Hills and Marg Cryan of Hacienda to win a tournament on her home 
course. Mrs. Blevens, who was 46 before she held a golf club, was 91 at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Pemberton, a USC senior, used an eight-iron to make a hole-in-one on 
Lakeside's 15th hole in a USC Alumni tournament. It was his second ace on the 
same hole in two months.

BOWL GAMES SURVIVE KING CONTROVERSY, BUT ARIZONA SUFFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TEMPE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When last we left it, the Grand Canyon State was in a state of turmoil. The 
voters had rejected two propositions that would have established a paid state 
holiday to honor Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven states have such a holiday, and Arizona became a national symbol, 
albeit a reluctant one, when on Nov. 6 it became the first state to vote on and 
reject the paid holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The gestation period for controversy, among the shortest for all calamities, 
broke records with this issue. Overnight, racism was again the subject of 
national debate, and Arizona was its focal point. According to a large segment 
of national opinion, the state was a social backwater and its residents were 
racists. 
</P>
<P>
As reaction grew more serious -- in the form of millions of dollars in lost 
convention business and the threat of losing the 1993 Super Bowl -- Arizonans 
dug in. "Leave us alone; why pick on us; don't mix sports and politics," they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While the controversy might linger elsewhere, it seems to stop at the border. 
On the eve of Monday's Copper Bowl in Tucson and the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe on 
New Year's Day, two major sporting events thought to be heavily hit by King Day 
fallout, the mood is upbeat and relentlessly cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
And while no one denies that the two bowls will experience financial 
shortfalls, that could as easily be attributed to the nation's troubled economy 
as to the King Day mess. The poor ticket sales have likewise been assigned 
causes other than the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
There is a stubborn and rather uniform refusal to acknowledge that the holiday 
issue has in any way harmed the state. This view dovetails nicely with the 
state's I-told-you-so stance. There has been no hint of protest at either bowl 
site. The teams -- California (6-4-1) and Wyoming (9-3) in the Copper Bowl and 
Louisville (9-1-1) and Alabama (7-4) in the Fiesta Bowl -- have not been 
bothered. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbert Nelson, president of the Phoenix chapter of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, said his group has no plans to boycott, picket 
or protest the Fiesta Bowl and its events and is unaware of any groups planning 
to disrupt the Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It has been so quiet that when something does percolate through the ooze of 
public disinterest, it is received with a mighty bang. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of the Letter to the NFL, which was front-page news in Phoenix 
last week. The president of the American Indian Bible College in Phoenix sent a 
letter to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue asking the league to force the 
Washington Redskins to change their name. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are sincere about your anti-racist concerns, why do you not recommend 
to the owner that the name be changed?" Moore wrote to Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
This story was gleefully repeated around Arizona as a kind of 
taste-of-their-own-medicine shot at the NFL and its threat to pull the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the issue of a paid holiday for King is taken lightly or even 
dismissed altogether. Gov. Rose Mofford is still attempting to have Arizona's 
legislature deal with the issue again. However, her efforts to rally support 
for a special session on the paid holiday issue failed when, two weeks ago, no 
lawmakers would agree to meet Mofford for lunch to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
The matter apparently will be dealt with when the Arizona Legislature convenes 
in its regular session next month. However, even then there is no assurance the 
King Day issue will be settled. The state must still organize and stage a 
run-off for governor, another matter that was not settled Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Mofford, who is not in the runoff, has made the King Day issue her personal 
crusade. She led a delegation of state officials that met with Tagliabue 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Their intention was to persuade the commissioner to reconsider his decision to 
urge NFL owners to move the 1993 Super Bowl to another state. The meeting, 
while described as cordial, failed to sway Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the loss of the Super Bowl can be converted to a loss of 
$200 million in income to the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona landscape is littered with the economic fallout from the election. 
Tourism, the state's No. 2 industry, has been hit with an estimated $30-million 
loss from conventions that have moved to other cities. Dozens of companies have 
changed plans to relocate to Arizona, citing the King Day controversy as one 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
And the Fiesta Bowl, which last New Year's Day brought in an estimated $30 
million to the state, is not likely to set any profit records. The bowl is 
$691,000 in debt, and ticket sales have been sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
The teams have bought about 5,000 tickets each and may not sell all of them, 
according to John Junker, the Fiesta Bowl's executive director. The game will 
not be a sellout, and Junker said he is considering a local television 
blackout. 
</P>
<P>
Junker said he can trace the slow sales to at least one event, the Nov. 6 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"November is our No. 1-selling ticket month, and that's when all this King 
controversy came down," he said. "Take this controversy to any other bowl and 
see how many tickets they sell." 
</P>
<P>
Copper Bowl sales have been worse. Merle Miller, executive director of the 
Tucson event, said the generally slow economic climate is a factor. The Copper 
Bowl expects about 35,000 in 56,000-seat Arizona Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said each team was allotted 10,000 tickets; Cal has sold nearly 8,000, 
but Wyoming has sold only 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wyoming ticket manager Louie Krutsch, the university has an 
agreement with the Western Athletic Conference to pay jointly for the 7,000 
unused tickets. Priced at $27 each, that amounts to $189,000. 
</P>
<P>
Melva Miller, Cal ticket manager, said the university expected to donate 
unbought tickets to needy persons in the Tucson area. 
</P>
<P>
Some problems proved too sticky for even the perky, yellow-coated Fiesta Bowl 
officials to smooth over. Take, for example, the problem of finding two teams 
willing to play in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
While Fiesta Bowl officials are not willing to state categorically that the 
King Day controversy was responsible for teams such as Notre Dame, Virginia and 
Mississippi going elsewhere, it's difficult to imagine what other factor would 
cause a university to turn down the Fiesta Bowl's $2.5-million payout. 
</P>
<P>
After Alabama accepted the Fiesta Bowl's invitation, university officials had 
to scramble to quash criticism from within. Various ad hoc committees met and 
argued, and the upshot was that the school will set aside $100,000 from its 
bowl receipts to improve academic programs relating to minority issues. Alabama 
also agreed to reactivate an advisory committee for minority affairs "to 
promote full representation by African-Americans in the life of the 
university." 
</P>
<P>
The Copper Bowl, with its $600,000-a-team payout, had an even smaller spectrum 
of teams from which to select. On the politically aware Berkeley campus, the 
idea of going to Arizona for a football game was disgusting to some. The Golden 
Bear players met, however, and voted to accept the bid. 
</P>
<P>
There was little or no controversy reported in Wyoming, whose players have been 
delighted to be anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
While sensitive to the appearence of caving in to national opinion, there is no 
doubt that bowl officials have made efforts to temper the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, however, something had to go wrong. The first problem came when 
the Fiesta Bowl announced it would set aside $100,000 for each participating 
school to establish minority scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Executive director Junker said, in announcing the offer, that the Fiesta Bowl 
wanted to "make a positive statement about what a football game and a community 
can be." 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had the offer been made than Michael Williams, assistant secretary of 
education, ruled that such exclusionary scholarships violated the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act. Fiesta Bowl officials were not alone in their anger at this. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was called on the carpet by his boss, President Bush. The Department 
of Education quickly issued a clarification that only served to further confuse 
everyone. The bottom line for the Fiesta Bowl is that Louisville and Alabama 
will get the money for minority scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
The two bowls also have included more than a nod to the issue of civil rights 
and King's life. Indeed, both will have halftime programs that appear to be 
more like civics lessons than the usual baton-twirling, band-marching, 
flag-waving extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl's halftime show will be a tribute to King. NBC-TV has agreed to 
air up to 5 1/2 minutes of it. The Alabama band and football team will wear 
shoulder patches in King's honor, and the school will present a portrait of 
King to the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl's pregame show will be dedicated to the 200th anniversary of 
the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Copper Bowl is locked into a Salute to the Armed Forces theme for its 
halftime but will include certain King elements. Near the end of the halftime 
show, an excerpt from King's famous "I have a dream" speech will be played over 
the public address system. The players from both teams will come onto the field 
and stand in opposite end zones. A drill team will form the letters MLK on the 
field. At the end of the excerpt, the band will play "God Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
The players have been struggling to walk the politically correct line in the 
midst of the controversy. On the one hand, there is the symbolism of coming to 
Arizona after it voted down a paid King holiday. None of the schools, and 
certainly none of the players, wanted to appear to condone the vote. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there is the compelling athletic consideration of being 
invited to a bowl game, with the attendant hoopla and exposure that it brings. 
None of the schools, and certainly none of the players, wanted to miss that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people blew it out of proportion," said Stacy Harrison, a 
safety on Alabama's football team. "They tried to bring the football team into 
a political aspect. We won the right to play in this bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, along with other Alabama players, has had the initials MLK shaved 
into the back of his closely cropped hair. He said that not coming to the 
Fiesta Bowl "would take away from what we've earned. I'm not saying a boycott 
couldn't be right, but we've earned the right to come here. It's a big-time 
bowl." 
</P>
<P>
That's about the extent to which the players are addressing the King 
controversy, by now a tired subject for them. 
</P>
<P>
And while no significant demonstrations or disturbances are expected, there is 
always the possibility of an isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
The Copper Bowl's Miller said his sponsor, Domino's Pizza, has experienced an 
unorganized, spotty boycott. But he expects a quiet New Year's Eve, except for 
the group that has announced it will picket outside the stadium, protesting the 
building of a hazardous-waste dump site in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we are just the staging area for the protest," Miller said. "Oh well, 
it could be worse, I guess."

MIRER, NOTRE DAME'S QUARTERBACK, ISN'T EASILY UNNERVED

<P>
Uh, oh. Dick Vitale, two o'clock high. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick MIRER!" bellows Vitale, who knows no other volume. "I knew you when you 
were a NOBODY! Come here YOU! I want you to meet some PEOPLE!" 
</P>
<P>
With that, the Notre Dame quarterback is led to Vitale's two daughters, one of 
whom plays tennis for the Irish. Photos are taken. Handshakes are exchanged. 
Backs are slapped. 
</P>
<P>
Vitale is such a Notre Dame fan that he has hotel reservations for every Irish 
home game during the next four years. Of course, he has to be at Saturday's 
Orange Bowl media day. Dressed in shorts, a light-blue Notre Dame shirt and 
Notre Dame baseball cap, Vitale follows Mirer around as if it were Florida law. 
</P>
<P>
Mirer, bless his heart, simply smiles a lot. Then again, that's the Mirer way. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm flexible," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows how these things happen? One moment, you're a kid from tiny Goshen, 
Ind., population 20,000. Next thing you know, America's loudest basketball 
analyst is dragging you away for a family portrait. Or Bill Walsh, the former 
San Francisco 49er coach, is picking your brain about the Irish offense. Or a 
teammate is brazenly comparing you to another Notre Dame quarterback, Joe 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Mirer, a sophomore, doesn't seem to mind. If this is the price you pay for 
calling signals for the fourth-ranked Irish (9-2), then Mirer happily obliges. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, few things unnerve Mirer, who is completing his first full season as a 
starter. When Sports Illustrated put him on its cover earlier this season, he 
shrugged. When Montana sent him an autographed photo and a note of 
encouragement before the Miami-Notre Dame game, Mirer simply said 'Thank you.' 
When the Irish were upset by Penn State last month, Mirer was one of the few 
Notre Dame players who answered questions about the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to be myself," he says now. 
</P>
<P>
It must be the Goshen in him. The little town, about 25 miles from the Notre 
Dame campus, has always been home for Mirer. Once, when asked to describe it, 
Mirer began, "Well, all the roads are paved." 
</P>
<P>
Another time, he confessed to a small criminal streak. The offense? He and some 
buddies climbed on the roof of a building. 
</P>
<P>
Quick, alert the proper authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Mirer's father, a former high school coach, taught him the game. When Mirer was 
growing up, he idolized Bo Schembechler's Michigan teams. He even attended one 
of Schembechler's football camps where, legend has it, Mirer approached the 
coach and said, "You stick around and someday I'll be here." 
</P>
<P>
Mirer was 10. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Schembechler found himself sitting in the Mirer family den eight 
years later, offering Rick a scholarship. Choosing with his head rather than 
his heart, Mirer picked Notre Dame, where the forward pass was more than a 
rumor. Nor did it hurt that the Irish campus was only 30 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
Last season was spent as Tony Rice's apprentice. Mirer played all of 36 minutes 
as Rice, the senior, led Notre Dame to an Orange Bowl victory against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
When Rice left, it became apparent that Mirer would be Coach Lou Holtz's next 
choice as starter. The players knew it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We all knew about his ability," wide receiver Tony Smith said. "But nobody 
knew how he'd do under game pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Leave that to Holtz, who specializes in building a player up and then tearing 
him down. Build up . . . tear down . . . up . . . down. 
</P>
<P>
Mirer was no different. At times, Holtz banished Mirer to the sidelines or out 
of practice altogether if a play was botched. Once, he summoned George Poorman, 
a Notre Dame free safety, to replace Mirer in a drill. Poorman hadn't taken a 
snap since high school. 
</P>
<P>
This, however, is the Holtz way. To handle the pressures of guiding the Notre 
Dame offense, you must first handle the tantrums of Holtz, which can be 
considerable. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship reached its critical point shortly before the season began, 
when Holtz angrily pulled Mirer out of a scrimmage. Rather than stand on the 
sideline, Mirer followed Holtz around the field, asking him again and again to 
explain what was wrong. At practice's end, Holtz took Mirer aside and patiently 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever was said, it worked. During the team's final preseason scrimmage, 
Mirer's performance was nearly error free. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a scrimmage is one thing, a season opener against Michigan is 
another. If all went well, Notre Dame coaches wanted Mirer to do little more 
than perfect his handoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Irish struggled, forcing Holtz to junk his running game in the 
final minutes and depend on a first-year starter. Mirer responded with a 
76-yard touchdown drive that gave Notre Dame a 28-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The next week, Mirer led the Irish to a 20-19 comeback victory against Michigan 
State. The winning score came with 34 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"You never see him nervous, never big-eyed," receiver Smith said. "As the 
season progressed, he played like a veteran. By the time he leaves here, he'll 
be one of the great quarterbacks to come from Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
That's when he leaves. For now, running back Ricky Watters defines Mirer's 
duties as such: "All his job is right now, is not to get us beat." 
</P>
<P>
Mirer understands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surrounded by a great group of athletes," he said. "The quarterback 
doesn't need to do a whole lot . . . to make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but even in a reduced role, Mirer's season has been impressive. If 
you compare his first 11 starts to those of the six Notre Dame quarterbacks of 
the past 25 years, you find Mirer with more yards (1,824) and completions (110) 
than anyone, including Montana, Joe Theismann and Steve Beuerlein. Only Blair 
Kiel had fewer interceptions and only Theismann had a higher completion 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't set a lot of goals," Mirer said. "I don't dwell on that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mirer brings to the Irish, however infrequent, a passing attack. Rice 
might have been a great option quarterback, but he couldn't hit the side of the 
Convocation Center with a ball. Mirer gives Notre Dame a true option: an 
offense that doesn't rely entirely on the run. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Colorado players have seen the change. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we knew all they could do is run and hit you with the big play," 
linebacker Kanavis McGhee said. "Now they have a lot to hit us from." 
</P>
<P>
"(Rice) was the type of player who could hurt you on the ground," linebacker 
Greg Biekert said. "Mirer, I think, is a little more dangerous of a player. He 
has a little better throwing arm and he reads (defenses) better than Rice." 
</P>
<P>
There are other improvements. No longer does Mirer stare a hole through his 
intended receiver. Colorado cornerback Dave McCloughan noticed that while 
watching Notre Dame game films. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he's looking off guys," he said. "After 11 games, he's come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
That he has. And still, Mirer is Mirer, which is to say, as unassuming as a 
wallflower. Vitale should be so lucky.

THESE RAMS MANAGE TO WIN IN ANAHEIM; 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM: EARLE BRUCE'S COLORADO STATE TEAM GETS A 32-31 VICTORY WHEN OREGON'S 
TWO-POINT CONVERSION FAILS BY INCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They lifted Earle Bruce to their shoulders, victorious, as another, more famous 
team had three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State raised Bruce high Saturday night. A team that was 1-10 two years 
ago beat favored Oregon, 32-31, in the Freedom Bowl at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams hadn't been to a bowl since 1948, when they lost to Occidental in 
Fresno's Raisin Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's victory wasn't easy, and it never seemed sure or even likely 
until 1:01 remained and a two-point conversion attempt by Oregon barely failed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McClellan caught Bill Musgrave's pass with his feet in the end zone, 
but the ball never crossed the plane of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
And then, in a reprise of the day when Ohio State's players marched onto the 
field carrying their fired coach after a victory over Michigan in his final 
game with the Buckeyes, Colorado State celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I gotta tell you, I'm just so proud of those young men," Bruce said. "It's 
unbelievable. It's really unbelievable that they just won the Freedom Bowl. I'm 
so proud of them. They showed what hard work and a little bit of wanting can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State's victory before 41,450 came despite a spectacular effort by 
Musgrave, who passed for 392 yards and three touchdowns in his final game for 
Oregon, completing 29 of 47 passes without an interception. His best receiver 
Saturday night was McClellan, who caught nine passes for 148 yards in his first 
game after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery during the season. 
</P>
<P>
But McClellan's failure may live longest in the minds of Oregon fans hoping for 
the first back-to-back bowl victories in school history. 
</P>
<P>
After closing the score to 32-31 on Sean Burwell's one-yard run that capped a 
masterful drive by Musgrave, Oregon went for two points-after-touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never kick an extra point in that situation, absolutely not," Oregon 
Coach Rich Brooks said. "I like to win football games. It's pretty simple. We 
didn't come to a bowl game to tie. I've never gone for a tie in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The play worked to perfection -- almost. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowning blow was the two-point play," Brooks said. "We didn't run the 
route deep enough. We were about half a yard short of where we should have been 
to win the football game. I thought his feet were in. And the ball? I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks led at halftime, 17-14, but played a messy second half that included 
a botched handoff in the end zone for a Colorado State safety, two fumbles by 
tailback Burwell and a nullified punt after officials ruled that punter Tommy 
Thompson's knee touched the ground as he fielded a snap. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave you an exciting football game, by golly," Brooks said. "Dropped balls, 
penalties, mistakes. You've got to give Colorado State credit. They took 
advantage of our mistakes. Unfortunately we played most uncharacteristic of the 
way we played all year." 
</P>
<P>
Colorada State cut the lead to 17-16 in the third quarter on a safety when 
Oregon's Bud Bowie fell on the ball in the end zone after Musgrave and fullback 
Ngalu Kelemeni collided. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a checkoff play that I'd called one way all game and called the other 
way," Musgrave said. "We didn't have good communication and we botched it up." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State led, 19-17, after Mike Brown's 35-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
But Musgrave brought the Ducks back, 25-19, with a 44-yard touchdown pass play 
to McClellan, who duck-walked through the end zone. Musgrave hit Burwell for 
the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State came back with a big play of its own, a 49-yard touchdown pass 
play to Greg Primus from Mike Gimenez, one of two platooning quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State added to that 26-25 lead with the most unlikely touchdown a of 
all, a 52-yard run by fullback Todd Yert, the Rams' bulldozing, short-yardage 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"I was running and I thought I gotta put on a move," Yert said. "Usually 
fullbacks run straight ahead. It was now or never." 
</P>
<P>
That touchdown, with 4:59 left, gave Colorado State a 32-25 lead after the kick 
was blocked by Marcus Woods. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the drama of Oregon's final attempts to save itself. 
</P>
<P>
The game had begun with a touchdown drive by Colorado State, as Verdugo took 
the Rams to a first down at the six, and then, his part done for the moment, 
gave way to Gimenez, who took the ball in on fourth down for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon drove right back up the field to tie the score on Musgrave's pass to 
Anthony Jones, who scampered most of the final 10 yards of a 16-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave completed five of six passes on the drive, including several off his 
back foot. With the touchdown, Musgrave broke the 8,000-yard passing mark for 
his career, finishing at 8,343, the third best in Pac-10 history behind 
Stanford's John Elway and Oregon State's Erik Wilhelm. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon took a 10-7 lead on a 23-yard field goal by Gregg McCallum. Then, just 
as it seemed the momentum was sliding Oregon's way, Brian Brown fumbled a punt 
reception, and Colorado State's Adolf Renaud pounced on it at the Oregon 33. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Tony Alford's one-yard run gave Colorado State the lead again at 
14-10. 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave went back to work, finishing with a seven-yard pass to a wide-open 
Burwell for a 17-14 lead with 23 seconds in the half. 
</P>
<P>
That lead didn't last, and Colorado State changed what has been the sorry 
history of Ram football. 
</P>
<P>
"Earle Bruce made us believe in ourselves," said linebacker Eric Tippeconnic. 
"We proved it now against a very worthy opponent."

<TEXT>
<P>
After four days of basketball, Long Beach Jordan High School was running on 
reserves Saturday night. But even with tongues hanging, it had enough to get to 
the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers survived one last run by Edison for a 61-59 victory to win the 
championship of the Coast Christmas Classic at Estancia. It was the sixth 
consecutive victory for Jordan, but it was a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"Four straight nights of this can really wear down a team," Jordan Coach Ron 
Massey said. "Fortunately, we now get a week off." 
</P>
<P>
Neither team appeared fresh, as both had played overtime games the previous 
night. However, Jordan had enough energy to build a 49-39 lead after three 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But in the final two minutes, the Panthers had to hang on by their fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (10-3), who had managed to stay within striking distance all 
night, trailed by seven, 55-48, with 2:35 left when they made their final move. 
</P>
<P>
Edison went on an 8-3 run, capped by Greg Miller's three-pointer, to cut 
Jordan's lead to 58-56. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had a chance to tie the score after a Panther turnover. However, 
Todd Harrell missed the first end of a one-and-one and teammate Brandon Jessie 
missed a layup on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally Brandon dunks that ball, but he was very tired tonight," Edison Coach 
Jon Borchert said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he was fatigued, Jessie managed to keep his team in the game. 
Despite defenses designed to deny him the ball, he scored 22 points and grabbed 
13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Twice Jessie came out of the middle of the pack for dunks on offensive 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Said Massey: "We started in a box-and-one and that didn't stop him. Then we 
went man-to-man and that didn't stop him. Then we tried to double-team every 
time he got near the ball and that didn't stop him. The only thing that stopped 
him was the clock." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Harris, the tournament's most valuable player, harassed the Charger 
guards throughout the game. He had four steals and 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 59, Estancia 46 -- Tustin dominated a game between two of Orange 
County's top teams. The Tillers (12-2) outscored the Eagles, 18-10, in the 
second quarter to take a 34-21 lead. Thomas Clayton scored six of his 14 points 
in the second quarter. Estancia (12-3) never got closer than 10 points in the 
second half. Brian Reider scored 16 points and David Beilstein 15 for Tustin. 
Matt Fuerbinger scored 12 points to lead Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation final: 
</P>
<P>
Banning 78, Corona del Mar 76 (OT) -- Jabarl Anderson scored 36 points, 
including nine in the overtime, for Banning. The Pilots made 12 of 14 free 
throws in overtime. Jon Upham scored 34 points for Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
In consolation games: 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 60, Dana Hills 49 -- John Molle scored 30 points to lead Irvine. Jaime 
Todd scored 20 points for Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 60, Mission Viejo 51 (OT) -- Brian Matsen scored 16 points to lead 
a balanced attack for Laguna Hills. Mike Lugo scored 15 points, Justin Ross 13 
and Paul LaMott 10 for the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 69, Pomona 66 -- Bryan Chang scored 22 points and Mustapha 
Abdi 21 to lead Huntington Beach.

SOFTWARE: TO PROVE IT'S NO ONE-TRICK PONY, THE SAUSALITO COMPANY IS PURSUING 
SOME ESOTERIC TECHNOLOGIES THAT MOST ESTABLISHED FIRMS WON'T GO NEAR.

SAUSALITO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When John Walker and some fellow computer programmers launched Autodesk Inc. in 
1982, they had a clear plan for every aspect of the business except one: the 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Walker figured that with top-flight programming talent and the voracious demand 
for software spurred by the success of the International Business Machines 
personal computer, the company could just try a bunch of things and hope one 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
And one, a computer-aided design package called Autocad, not only worked, but 
also quietly became one of the most successful software products in history. 
Sausalito-based Autodesk earned a remarkable $43.6 million on sales of $175.6 
million for the nine months ended Oct. 31, and Autocad has spawned a $1-billion 
industry of software developers, equipment vendors and dealers devoted to 
making personal computers better tools for designing everything from houses to 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Autodesk faces the dicey task of proving that it's not just another 
one-trick pony in an industry that already has a string of them. And in trying 
to move beyond near-total dependence on a single product -- a goal that has 
eluded most software powerhouses, including Lotus Development, Ashton-Tate and 
Wordstar International -- Autodesk has pursued some esoteric technologies that 
most established companies won't go near. 
</P>
<P>
Although Autodesk's diversification strategy differs dramatically from the 
acquisition-oriented approach of Lotus and other firms, it must overcome the 
same basic problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Software companies get mesmerized by their market niche," says John Rossi, a 
PC software analyst at Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco 
investment bank. "All their efforts are very focused, very specialized, so it's 
hard to send the whole thing down a different track." 
</P>
<P>
But if any software company is in a position to do things differently, it might 
be idiosyncratic Autodesk. Founded as a cooperative, Autodesk never accepted 
venture capital funding, and it thrives on an informal, egalitarian management 
style that's almost unheard of in American business. 
</P>
<P>
Alvar J. Green, the modest and cheerful British native who serves as chairman 
and chief executive, occupies his post because Walker and the other company 
founders prefer to focus on programming. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as if I tell people what to do or anything," he declaims, sitting in 
a barren 10-by-12-foot office with a cheap wooden desk and parking lot views. 
"You have to rally people around an idea here." 
</P>
<P>
It's fitting, perhaps, that Autodesk's brand of consensus management has 
yielded an approach to new markets that is thoroughly consistent with Walker's 
original theory: try a few things and see what works. "We're looking for 
technologies that have unlimited upside potential, but where we know what the 
downside will be," Green says. 
</P>
<P>
The company even launched a new-business development unit this month and 
invited "interesting project concepts and business plans from any legitimate 
source." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Autodesk has identified a handful of such technologies. The most 
mainstream of them is multimedia computing, the integration of sound and video 
into the personal computer. Many personal computer companies expect multimedia 
to be a major growth area, and Autodesk has set up a new division to market its 
multimedia products, which so far have met with limited success. 
</P>
<P>
On the more daring side is Xanadu, conceived some 20 years ago by computer 
visionary Ted Nelson as a new way of navigating through a forest of 
information. In a Xanadu "hypertext" database, the information -- including 
text, video or any other type of data -- would be linked conceptually by the 
system, allowing the user to skip freely from one information source to another 
without using keyword searches and other traditional database methods. 
</P>
<P>
Xanadu Operating Co., based in Palo Alto, had struggled for years to get a 
product out the door, and few in the business took it seriously. But Autodesk 
did and purchased the company in 1988 for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm L. Davies, Autodesk's senior vice president for marketing, jokes that 
when Xanadu products are finally shipped -- and the goal is sometime next year 
-- the company will apply to the Guinness Book of World Records for the 
longest-running software development project in history. But if Xanadu 
succeeds, the potential market is enormous, because it will vastly simplify and 
humanize the task of finding computerized information. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly out on the edge is Autodesk's cyberspace, or artificial reality, 
project. The concept, being pursued in varying degrees of intensity by many 
large firms, is to create a completely computer-generated environment. A 
current version includes a mask with two small television screens and a set of 
electronic gloves; one can actually navigate around a seemingly 
three-dimensional room and use one's hands to pick up and move objects. 
</P>
<P>
Autodesk aims to produce a basic artificial reality operating system, and then 
software developers would use it to create "environments" for entertainment, 
physical fitness or education. Such a system could also have links to Autocad, 
allowing an architect, for example, to walk around inside a building that 
exists only as an Autocad design. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a simulation technique that complements Autocad," said project director 
Randal Walser. "We believe an industry is about to emerge." 
</P>
<P>
Autodesk has also purchased minority interests in several small software 
companies with interesting product concepts and last year acquired a competitor 
in the low-end computer-aided design business. But even with $150 million in 
cash, Autodesk is not interested in buying established firms to get into 
mainstream software markets, such as word processing or spreadsheets. That's in 
distinct contrast with other big software firms, such as Lotus, Ashton-Tate and 
Wordstar, which have tried -- and mostly failed -- to diversify by acquiring 
going businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Ill-advised acquisitions, however, are hardly the only reason that most big 
personal computer software companies have only one major product. W. Frank 
King, senior vice president at Lotus, notes that dependence on a single product 
-- Lotus gets 65% to 70% of its revenue from the 1-2-3 spreadsheet package -- 
tends to be self-perpetuating. "When you have that kind of franchise, you spend 
heavily to protect it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lotus, he added, has at times been too focused on diversification. And with 
1-2-3 products bringing in some $500 million a year in revenue, any new 
business has to get awfully big to make a dent. 
</P>
<P>
To meet its goal of gaining only half its revenue from computer-aided design 
products within five years -- the figure is over 90% -- Autodesk will need new 
businesses that generate hundreds of millions a year. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Cook, president of Intuit Software, suggests another, more disquieting 
reason that software companies tend to be dependent on one product. 
</P>
<P>
"They got lucky the first time around," he suggests. "Instead of victory 
through internal process and people doing things right, they got lucky, got 
there first and got a dominant share." 
</P>
<P>
The key ingredients to systematic success, Cook emphasizes, is being close to 
the customer and close to the market -- something it's intrinsically difficult 
to do in a new business. Autodesk has been famously successful in developing a 
dealer channel for Autocad and grasping the needs of the computer-aided design 
user, but Green admits that the company made key mistakes in pricing and 
targeting the multimedia products. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the two big software companies that have succeeded in spreading 
their wings -- Microsoft and Borland International -- are firms that made their 
initial splash with system software and programming languages, respectively, 
rather than applications software for performing particular tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hallman, chief operating officer at Microsoft, attributed some of his 
company's success in building many types of products to the fact that 
"Microsoft always took a broader view of itself, with a mission to be a 
broad-based software company," and thus didn't get trapped into 
over-specialization. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he maintains, the company is aided by the "uniting theme" of the graphics 
interface, which governs its popular Windows program -- which Microsoft 
considers an operating system -- and its applications programs, such as Word 
and Excel. But Hallman couldn't say whether operating system expertise had 
proved more "transportable" to other products than specialization in particular 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Although Autocad is an applications program, it has through the years developed 
certain resemblances to a systems product. A primary reason that Autocad has 
been so successful, in fact, is because of an "open" architecture that allows 
third parties to customize the program with specialized hardware and software. 
</P>
<P>
And Autodesk, from its early days, has also viewed itself as a broad-based 
software company, although most industry analysts consider it a computer-aided 
design company. Over the next few years it will become clear who was right.

BAY AREA HAS NEVER SOURED ON SOURDOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD: ALTHOUGH THE SYMBOL OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS FAILED TO TAKE OFF ELSEWHERE, 
THE LOCAL MARKET IS BOOMING, THANKS LARGELY TO A REVIVAL OF "VILLAGE BAKERIES."

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the streets of San Francisco -- and in Berkeley and Emeryville as well -- 
neighborhood bakeries are springing up to feed the local passion for sourdough 
bread. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger and more established bakers have grander ambitions: To broaden the 
existing market with new products and to eventually turn what has been a 
regional mania into national taste. 
</P>
<P>
"Sourdough is caught up with the whole mystique of San Francisco -- the fog, 
the cable cars and sourdough bread," said Art Silverman, deputy press secretary 
to Mayor Art Agnos. "Better that than Rice-A-Roni." 
</P>
<P>
Sourdough bread might be as inextricably linked with San Francisco as the 
Golden Gate Bridge, but no one knows exactly how it came to California. Some 
trace the origins to an obscure conflict in Mexico known as the Pastry War of 
1838. 
</P>
<P>
The skirmish grew out of a claim by a French pastry chef whose shop had been 
destroyed and its wares devoured by rampaging Mexican soldiers. After a French 
fleet blockaded the port of Veracruz, the Mexican government finally agreed to 
pay up, and the baker moved to San Francisco, where his sourdough took on a 
distinctive flavor that some attributed to the fog and sea air. 
</P>
<P>
Gold Rush diaries show that '49ers took their dough on the road. Gold-panning 
tins doubled as bread pans, and, on cold nights, the miners curled up with the 
pots holding the starter dough. Occasionally, prospectors used the gloppy 
mixture to patch holes in cabins, treat wounds and shine belt buckles. They 
weren't called sourdoughs for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, Bay Area residents -- and millions of visitors -- have hankered 
like few others on Earth for the tangy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
All the lip-smacking by travelers aside, sourdough bread may be a hard sell in 
the rest of the country. True San Francisco sourdough flavor is tough to 
reproduce elsewhere, and many consumers in other regions seem content to trade 
off taste for the convenience of mass-produced, sliced brands that keep for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, sourdough bread baking is an art best practiced on a modest scale, 
putting the big "white bread" companies uncharacteristically at a disadvantage 
(although they've recently begun taking a big slice of the market with "light" 
sourdough lines touting reduced calories). 
</P>
<P>
But the sourdough tradition is alive and booming in the Bay Area, thanks in 
large part to a revival of "village bakeries." Like Napa Valley wines, the 
hand-crafted breads from boutique operations such as Acme, Semifreddi's, 
Gayle's, Bakers of Paris, Metropolis and Tassajara (named for the Zen Buddhist 
monastery near Big Sur) have begun garnering international reputations out of 
proportion with their regional followings. 
</P>
<P>
At fine Bay Area eateries, the sourdough batards and pains au levain often get 
more attention from food junkies than the free-range chicken and the Sonoma 
baby lamb. Some restaurants sell loaves of their bakery-bought sourdough to 
savvy customers who know to ask the bartender. 
</P>
<P>
Dock workers, lawyers and secretaries debate the merits of this or that 
baguette. And it's the rare corner grocery or upscale supermarket that doesn't 
offer a basketful of flour-dusted hearth breads, poking up like so many spikes 
of wheat in their crisp, white bags and costing two to four times as much as 
mass-made loaves. 
</P>
<P>
Information Resources Inc., a Chicago-based research firm that analyzes grocery 
store data, says Bay Area residents eat three times more French and Italian 
bread, including sourdough, than the national norm. And that doesn't take into 
account purchases at microbakeries by walk-ins. 
</P>
<P>
Such breads made up about 23% of the Bay Area's $130 million in retail bread 
sales for the year ended Nov. 3, 1990, according to A. C. Nielsen Co.'s 
Scantrack research service. By contrast, these products nationally accounted 
for only 10.5% of the nation's $6 billion in bread sales. 
</P>
<P>
The microbakeries might not be able to trace their starters to the Gold Rush, 
but they are firm believers in hands-on baking, even if their equipment is far 
more sophisticated than what the first sourdough bakers used in the Middle East 
in 7000 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Steve Sullivan was making bread for Alice Waters at her renowned Chez 
Panisse restaurant in Berkeley when the demand for special breads prompted him 
and his wife, Susie, to open a small bakery. 
</P>
<P>
"I baked it all, and my wife delivered it," said Sullivan, who wears his long 
salt-and-pepper hair in a ponytail. On many days, his Acme Bread Co. in 
Berkeley would run out of bread by noon. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Sullivan resisted expansion for seven years, fearing a compromise on 
quality. With a second plant, opened in 1989, the company now churns out as 
many as 7,500 loaves a day -- all molded at least partly by hand -- for 120 
groceries and restaurants, including Chez Panisse. One small Sacramento grocery 
chain sends a driver to Berkeley to pick up loaves seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining the precious sourdough starters or "mother doughs" -- pungent 
mixtures of flour and water that bubble and grow in large plastic buckets as 
they react with wild yeasts in the environment -- is a full-time job. On 
holidays, Sullivan totes starter around in the back of a station wagon, using 
flour and water to keep the mixture alive. 
</P>
<P>
Almost unknown in San Francisco 16 months ago, Semifreddi's, with $1 million in 
annual sales, operated for five years in a 450-square-foot space in Kensington 
in the East Bay, making 5,400 loaves a week for a few customers close by. In 
June, 1989, it opened a 5,000-square-foot plant and cafe in an industrial part 
of Emeryville. Production has grown to 25,000 loaves a week for 90 customers in 
San Francisco and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike bread from big bakeries, which contains commercial yeasts and is turned 
out in as little as two hours, Semifreddi's bread takes 10 hours for mixing the 
starter with the dough, initial shaping, resting, final molding and fermenting 
before baking. (The longer the dough ferments, or proofs, the sourer it gets. 
The process is unpredictable, subject to changes because of weather and 
temperature.) 
</P>
<P>
"Sourdough is like wine," said Tom Frainier, a former Clorox Co. accountant who 
co-founded Semifreddi's with his sister, Barbara Frainier Rose, the head baker, 
and brother-in-law, Michael Rose. "If you try to make it in a microwave, it 
doesn't taste very good." 
</P>
<P>
Although the newcomers have made inroads, four venerable brands with colorful 
histories and fans among natives and tourists alike -- Boudin, Toscana, Colombo 
and Parisian -- still maintain a lock on the market, producing 2.5 million 
loaves a week. Not incidentally, the four lines are all owned by one company 
whose Oakland headquarters location didn't discourage it from using the name 
San Francisco French Bread Co. 
</P>
<P>
Isidore Boudin (pronounced Bo-deen), the wronged baker of the Pastry War in 
Mexico, opened San Francisco's first French bakery in 1849. Other 
immigrant-owned bakeries followed: San Francisco's Parisian Bakery, in 1856, 
and Toscana and Colombo in the East Bay. 
</P>
<P>
After Boudin's death, the family sold the bakery in 1945 to Steve Giraudo, an 
Italian immigrant who can recall delivering door to door in the early days, 
hanging the loaves on a nail near each front door. At 77, Giraudo still 
immerses himself in the bread making, arriving at Boudin's 10th Avenue bakery 
by 5 a.m. But the business today is owned and run by his sons, Steve and Louis, 
and Sharon Duvall, formerly with the Coopers &amp; Lybrand accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Giraudos bought Toscana, Colombo and Parisian, which had earlier 
been forced by high costs and competition to merge. San Francisco French Bread, 
however, preserves the identity and recipes of each because of strong brand 
loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco French Bread, with yearly sales of $120 million, is slowly 
extending the reach of Boudin with a 75,000-customer mailing list and combined 
shops and bakeries in Chicago and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Duvall, Boudin's president, said the company hopes to develop new markets and 
become a national brand "within 10 years." If the Bay Area flavors are to be 
preserved, she pointed out, that will mean frequent dispatches of starter to 
faraway markets. Once in another city, the mother dough mutates and the flavor 
changes within a few weeks. (A few years back, with much fanfare, the Giraudos 
insured some Boudin sourdough starter for $1 million and flew it first-class to 
San Diego for the opening of a bakery.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Bay Area's reputation as a culinary trend-setter, Boudin might find 
it tough to win over customers in the South and Midwest whose tastes are tamer. 
"Someone in Savannah, Ga., or Tulsa, Okla., may say this isn't what I want to 
eat," said Bernard Pacyniak, managing editor of Bakery Production and 
Marketing, a trade publication in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
With its Bay Area market maturing, Parisian, the brand sold in white, red and 
blue bags in airports, also just opened a 30,000-square-foot bakery in San 
Diego, envisioned as a launch pad for expansion into Los Angeles and Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Giraudo, a labor lawyer who serves as president of the San Francisco Police 
Commission, said Parisian breads in San Diego have already wrested away 35% of 
their category, primarily from Oroweat, a General Foods line. A General Foods 
spokeswoman said the company would not comment on sourdough. 
</P>
<P>
To the chagrin of some sourdough purists, but apparently to the delight of 
calorie-conscious consumers, mass marketers such as Continental Baking Co., a 
Ralston Purina unit that makes Wonder Bread, and Campbell Taggart, a subsidiary 
of Anheuser-Busch Cos. that produces Earth Grains, have begun capitalizing on 
the sourdough craze with reduced-calorie lines to which the sour flavor has 
been added. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced last year in the West, Wonder Light Sourdough quickly captured about 
5% of the Bay Area market. Earth Grains will bring out its light line in the 
Bay Area early next year. 
</P>
<P>
To counter the attack, San Francisco French Bread plans in January to begin a 
campaign noting that sourdough bread is naturally low in calories and 
cholesterol-free. Janet Greenlee, a spokeswoman, said the so-called light 
sourdoughs have twice as much fat as any San Francisco French Bread loaves with 
shortening. The company intends soon to eliminate even that limited amount to 
be able to claim that its breads are free of fat. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, aficionados continue to debate just what constitutes authentic San 
Francisco sourdough bread. Some maintain that the flavor can't be reproduced 
anywhere else, but, in 1969, Leo Kline, a microbiologist, analyzed the starters 
of several local bakeries and discovered a bacterium that he named 
lactobacillus sanfrancisco. He then patented products that he contended could 
be used anywhere to produce San Francisco-style sourdough from scratch.

Kline, who in 1986 sold the patents to the Giraudos, maintains that they 
defaulted on an agreement to market his products; they deny it. 
</P>
<P>
But Kline's thinking gets some support from Ed Wood, a self-styled sourdough 
expert in Cascade, Ida., who sells starters from all over the world by mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I know all sorts of people in Denver who pay $5 a loaf to have it UPS-ed from 
San Francisco," said Wood, author of "World Sourdoughs From Antiquity." "We 
started our cultures in Puget Sound and moved to Idaho, where they are as fine 
and consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hype," he said of the persistent notion that San Francisco has the 
monopoly on special sourdough. "It's called marketing, I think."

MUTUAL FUNDS: RESALE MARKET PROPOSAL FOR FEE-SHY INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, the distinction between load and no-load mutual funds has 
become increasingly blurred. If Jack White has his way, investors will find it 
even harder to tell one from the other. 
</P>
<P>
White, president of Jack White &amp; Co., a San Diego-based discount brokerage, 
is working to create a resale market where fee-shy investors can purchase load 
mutual funds without paying the standard sales charge. If this market develops 
as he hopes, people who have traditionally gone the no-load route might start 
nibbling at various load products too. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, White's plan involves matching a person who wants out of a load 
fund with another individual who wishes to purchase those shares. The buyer 
pays the 'net asset value' or NAV, as he would when investing in a no-load, 
plus a flat $100 transaction fee, regardless of the size of the order. The 
seller gets the NAV price, plus a portion of that transaction fee (most likely 
$25) as an inducement to unload shares in this manner. 
</P>
<P>
All this comes as a welcome development for fee-conscious investors. For while 
load funds as a group don't perform any better than their no-load counterparts, 
there are certainly individual standouts that would make a nice addition to 
anyone's portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
White's brokerage has already started to match load-fund buyers and sellers on 
a limited scale. To get greater exposure and bring in more buyers and sellers, 
the company has applied for listing on the OTC Bulletin Board, a new electronic 
quote system operated by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Through the Bulletin Board, stockbrokers around the country would be able to 
instantly look up bid prices on funds their clients might want to sell. "It 
will increase the size of the market by making our bids visible to the entire 
industry," says White. "(Brokers) won't have to call us to get a price." His 
company expects to receive listing approval by the end of January; the NASD 
confirms the application is under review. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming White gets this approval, he next needs to secure the cooperation of 
brokers, so that they will offer the shares of clients for sale in this market. 
That's where the $25 payment to the seller comes in. Brokers have a fiduciary 
duty to get the highest price for their clients, White argues, and a bid of NAV 
plus $25 would beat what's available by redeeming through the fund company. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, there's some question as to how enthusiastically a broker working for 
a competing company, especially a full-service firm, might want to use the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Also uncertain is how independent load-fund companies, who market their 
products through brokers, will react. The giant Franklin Group of Funds in San 
Mateo, Calif., so far has adopted a neutral stance to White's program. "This 
kind of transaction doesn't show up at Franklin as either a sale or 
redemption," says spokeswoman Virginia Marans. "In our eyes, it's just a 
transfer of assets from one investor to another." 
</P>
<P>
One reason fund companies might not care much is that they generally don't keep 
the load anyway, says Dan Jamieson, editor of Registered Representative, the 
Irvine-based national trade magazine for stockbrokers. "Fund companies pay out 
anywhere from 70% to 100% of that load," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers, who split this commission with their firms, could be hurt if their 
customers suddenly started to shop for load funds on the resale market. 
However, Jamieson doesn't think this will happen to any large degree. "The 
reason people buy load funds is that they need help choosing among different 
investments," he says. "That sales-charge market will always exist." 
</P>
<P>
Others agree. "If you can't fix your car, you go to a mechanic and pay a large 
hourly rate," says A. Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical Services, a 
fund-tracking company based in Summit, N.J. Similarly, people who don't know to 
define their investment goals, select funds and monitor performance go to a 
broker and pay a sales charge. "The load is not a particularly significant 
amount of money if you don't know what you're doing," Lipper says. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, no-load buyers account for only about 36% of all mutual fund sales, 
according to figures compiled by the Investment Company Institute, the mutual 
fund industry group. 
</P>
<P>
White says the people most likely to shop for load funds on the resale market 
aren't the typical clients of full-service brokers but rather sophisticated, 
knowledgeable individuals who like to make their own decisions -- in other 
words, no-load customers. By opening up load products to these cost-conscious 
investors, White predicts his plan could help load-fund groups increase their 
assets under management and thereby boost their fee income. 
</P>
<P>
As good as it all sounds, there are certain limitations that could turn off 
people from purchasing load funds on the resale market. For starters, smaller 
buyers might find the $100 transaction fee more of a hurdle than the regular 
sales load. You would pay just $80, for example, when making a $2,000 purchase 
through the standard channels in the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund, which 
carries a 4% load. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, not all load funds would be available for purchase in the resale 
market -- just those that carry an up-front sales charge. "Back-end load funds 
won't qualify for our trading," says White. And keep in mind that you still 
would have to pay the annual 12b-1 charge if you bought a fund that imposes 
this fee. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the problem of finding what you want. Until the resale market gets 
large, there could be a limited availability of popular funds. It's conceivable 
that some orders could take weeks to fill. 
</P>
<P>
And don't underestimate the possible legal or regulatory challenges to the 
notion of buying load funds without a load. Lipper suspects the idea could run 
afoul of certain securities laws that have governed mutual funds since Congress 
passed the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
</P>
<P>
From the standpoint of investors, however, White's resale idea appears to be a 
good one. Sellers of load portfolios would benefit by receiving a slightly 
better price for their shares. And buyers would enjoy a wider selection of 
funds from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHY PAY A SALES CHARGE 
</P>
<P>
The efforts of Jack White &amp; Co. to open up load funds to no-load buyers 
raises a fundamental question: Why are some people willing to pay a sales 
charge in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 survey of 1,000 fundholders by the Investment Company Institute in 
Washington provides some answers. The ICI asked people to rate various 
attributes in terms of importance when investing in a mutual fund. As this 
table shows, individuals who buy load funds through a stockbroker, insurance 
agent, financial planner or bank tended to rate attributes such as advice and 
personalized service as relatively important. 
</P>
<P>
For example, 33% of the people using brokers considered "initial/ongoing 
advice" as important, and 71% of the individuals buying through banks rated 
"advice on a range of products" as important. By contrast -- and to no surprise 
-- investors who buy no-load funds indicated that they are more fee-conscious.

SIX ECONOMISTS OFFER THEIR VIEWS FOR 1991 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists have been predicting a recession since the mid-1980s. Now, most 
agree, the feared downturn is upon us. But will it last long, and will it be 
severe? 
</P>
<P>
6 Economists Offer Their Outlooks for '91 
</P>
<P>
E conomists have been predicting a recession since the mid-1980s. Now, most 
agree, the feared downturn is upon us. But will it last long, and will it be 
severe? 
</P>
<P>
 For a look at the outlook for 1991, Sharon Bernstein interviewed six members 
of The Times Board of Economists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York. Last 
year Kellner predicted that "at best, (1990) will be a period of stagnation and 
at worst it could resemble something akin to the old-fashioned recession." 
</P>
<P>
We're starting out not only in a recession but in a rather unusual recession. 
Most recessions in the post-war era have begun because the economy overheated. 
Wages went up too rapidly, reflecting a tight labor market; prices went up too 
rapidly, reflecting a tight product market. 
</P>
<P>
This one was a financially induced recession. It occurred even as inflation was 
moderate and wages and product prices were not too high. Commodities, precious 
metals and oil were down, although oil of course shot up with the crisis in the 
Persian Gulf. The seeds of this recession began to sprout in 1987 with the 
market crash. They were planted even earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Technically speaking, we're looking for three quarterly declines in gross 
national product, starting with the last quarter of 1990 and the first two 
quarters of 1991. My guess is that the recession will last about 12 months; it 
began in July or August and will end next July or August. 
</P>
<P>
But the real world will not feel as though it is passed until well into 1992. 
Economists may stop using the R word by this time next year, but the real world 
will still feel glum. 
</P>
<P>
George L. Perry, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution research 
organization in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
We've started a recession, but I expect that it will not be the historically 
large one that some people expect, for two reasons. First, we don't have a 
situation where production has been ahead of sales for a long time, causing a 
convulsive inventory explosion. The weakness in construction has been coming 
for a long time and has gradually brought us down in terms of inventory. In 
business, there has been a lot of concern over the last year, and because of 
that, manufacturing production has been kept pretty much in line with sales. 
Retailers had fairly pessimistic views of how their businesses would go and did 
not overstock. The car makers have been careful not to build inventories and 
have cut their sales predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Second, everyone thought that bank problems would feed back on to the economy 
and deepen the recession. It now seems to me that the problem is a major one 
for banks, but the effect back onto the economy will be modest rather than 
major. 
</P>
<P>
There's no question that some small businesses and some start-up businesses are 
being hurt by the situation, but I think it's going to be something we can 
break out of and ride through. I don't think we're going to get a war that 
would drive the price of oil up sharply and hurt the economy from that side. 
</P>
<P>
Paul R. Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. Last year, Krugman predicted a growing U.S. trade deficit, more 
foreign purchases of major U.S. corporations and the possible avoidance of a 
recession. He now says he was off on all three. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't catch the financial problems that have come on. I didn't realize the 
extent (to which) we were going to have the credit crunch of the banks, the 
real estate slide, the collapse of the Japanese stock market, all of which have 
contributed to the slowdown coming on much stronger than we expected. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest single factor in the economy for 1991 is going to be the recession, 
which is a much steeper downturn than anyone was figuring on. It basically 
caught the Federal Reserve by surprise, so they did not react enough to stop it 
from coming. By the end of 1991 there will be the beginning of recovery, but 
only barely. 
</P>
<P>
The other big piece of news is going to be financial distress, corporations and 
banks in financial trouble. Surely some major banks will be in trouble, 
possibly some insurance companies in trouble, and surely some major 
corporations in trouble. The Milken-Trump hangover, if you like. 
</P>
<P>
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, professor of economics and business administration at UC 
Berkeley and director of its Institute for International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for 1991 seems to be bleak and uncertain. It's uncertain because 
there are a number of imponderables that no one can predict, and those all 
revolve around the Persian Gulf crisis. I say bleak because even in the absence 
of the events in the Gulf, the United States faced economic slowdown, and the 
events in the Gulf can only intensify that. 
</P>
<P>
The standard view right now is that the recession will be short-lived. Even if 
that's true, my concern is that when we exit from the recession we're going to 
be on a long-term down trend. The United States has a number of unresolved big 
problems that it must confront in the 1990s, and they stem from everything from 
the savings and loan crisis to profound problems in our educational system to 
profound problems in our social structure -- including drugs -- and we are the 
only advanced industrial society to have this set of problems. We stand out for 
having a foundation for an economy in this decade that is much weaker than the 
foundations in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, this is a precarious decade, a decade of diminished 
prospects. We can get out of it, but to get out of it we face a very difficult 
task, because having lived off our wealth in the 1980s, we are going to have to 
confront these tasks from a poorer position. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Weidenbaum, director of the Center for the Study of American Business at 
Washington University in St. Louis. Last year, Weidenbaum correctly predicted 
that the widely publicized cuts in defense would not be a major cause of 
economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
We're starting off in recession, and a recession that hasn't bottomed out yet. 
It looks like it will last at least through the middle of the year. A lot will 
depend on what happens in the Persian Gulf. A quick and successful resolution 
would sow the seeds for the beginning of the upturn. The price of oil would 
come down. And there would be less uncertainty in the economy. Consumers and 
businesses would start spending some more. 
</P>
<P>
A long, drawn-out war would increase uncertainty. People would start worrying 
that we might have another Vietnam on our hands. And that would sour the whole 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
What worries me is not just the downturn in production of automobiles and 
housing and defense. Because in the past you could see after a while we'd run 
out of supplies, and orders would come in, and you'd see an upturn in the 
economy. What worries me now is our financial institutions are in very fragile 
condition. And you have to worry that a recession with a lot of defaults, 
especially in real estate, will really bring down some of the financial 
institutions in sort of a snowball effect. 
</P>
<P>
Allan H. Meltzer, J. M. Olin Professor of Political Economy and Public Policy 
at Carnegie Mellon University and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise 
Institute. Last year, Meltzer said that if the Federal Reserve acted quickly 
enough to loosen the money supply, the nation could avoid a recession. Now, 
looking back, he points out that the Fed didn't do that. 
</P>
<P>
The two big questions are what's going to happen to monetary policy and what's 
going to happen in the Persian Gulf. If we assume that there is either no war 
or a very short war, then you don't get very much of an after-effect. If it 
turns out to be a long war with substantial destruction of oil supplies, then 
it puts a wrench to the world economy for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The other question is what happens to Federal Reserve policy. The classic 
mistake people make in times like these is to think that because interest rates 
are coming down, monetary policy is easier. In fact, interest rates are coming 
down because the Fed is following. The market is very weak, the rates are 
following and the Fed follows them by lowering interest rates. Money growth 
remains very slow. Money is not easier, it's just that the economy is weaker 
than expected, and the Fed has been following it down. 
</P>
<P>
I assume that that will change, that money growth will begin to pick up during 
the early part of next year. The Fed will move to an extent that's sufficient 
to get money growth up again. They have a history of having only two speeds, 
too fast and too slow. A concern should be that we don't shift from too slow to 
too fast. The reason for that concern is that the next inflation starts often 
in the present recession, when money growth becomes much too fast and gets the 
economy stimulated -- but then in a couple years leads to higher inflation and 
another ecession to bring the inflation down.

NCR CHAIRMAN HAD 13 MERGERS FAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NCR Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. likes to point to his own experience -- the 
13 acquisitions he has participated in during his 36 years in the computer 
business -- as evidence that high-tech mergers don't work. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end," he now says, "they all turned out to be a waste of time and 
money." 
</P>
<P>
In testimony for state and federal officials and in numerous press conferences, 
Exley has repeatedly cited American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's dismal attempts 
to become a powerhouse in the computer industry and said its intentions of 
turning its computer business over to NCR to operate can do little but sour 
NCR's own business. 
</P>
<P>
"Having lost an estimated $2 billion and gained virtually no market share, 
AT&amp;T now appears to have thrown up its hands," Exley said recently. "It now 
wants to 'buy' expertise in the form of NCR. The history of failure in such 
mergers has been devastating." 
</P>
<P>
But AT&amp;T got a different history lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging that failures have occurred, AT&amp;T computer systems 
Vice President William O'Shea said the similarities -- from product line to 
business strategy to corporate culture -- between AT&amp;T and NCR are so great 
that the combined entity will not face the clashes and identity crises that 
have plagued other mergers. 
</P>
<P>
Mergers have failed, he said, because the combined entity has been forced to 
support two separate technologies and customer bases while simultaneously 
trying to create a merged product line. That won't happen in this case, he 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to bring NCR in to support their computer capabilities with our 
(telecommunications) networking expertise," O'Shea said. "We're not trying to 
pick them apart to see what fits and what doesn't. We want them to become our 
computer company and to operate our computer company." 
</P>
<P>
Despite AT&amp;T's assurances that the marriage it proposes won't be like any 
other before it in the technology industry, skeptics abound. 
</P>
<P>
Exley's view, shared by many, is that mergers between high-technology companies 
ultimately turn out to be "calamities" because they require so much energy, 
attention and creative powers of managers that little is left over for the 
company's primary business operations. Meanwhile, advances in technology 
continue at their usual pace. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot? "The competition has a field day at your expense," Exley said. 
</P>
<P>
To underscore his point, Exley cites Ben Rosen, the respected technology 
entrepreneur, executive and venture capitalist, who has been quoted as saying 
the "only winners" in a technology merger are the competitors. CARLA

HEATED DISPUTE IN THE LAND OF CHILI PEPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE GAMBOA, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HATCH, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Juan Arreola crouched over a makeshift grill beneath an interstate bridge, 
heating his supper of corn tortilla and chili peppers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the poorest of all the workers, and that's why we are here," Arreola 
says of the chili pickers who sleep under the bridge they call "Hotel Mira 
Estrellas," or "The Hotel Star Gazer." 
</P>
<P>
He and the others can't afford the $2 a night for the alternative, Arreola 
says, a soiled pad atop a metal frame in a dingy laborer's barracks, where one 
toilet and sink must suffice for 20 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Farm workers in the chili fields of New Mexico have demanded an end to what 
they call exploitation. Growers say the pickers' allegations unfairly tarnish 
all of them for the transgressions of a few. 
</P>
<P>
But recent federal investigations support the complaints of the pickers, who 
disrupted this year's multimillion-dollar harvest with protests, strikes and 
demonstrations over substandard living conditions and poverty-level wages. 
</P>
<P>
A back yard garden vegetable 15 years ago, chili peppers now are New Mexico's 
largest cash food crop, and the state is the nation's largest chili producer 
and exporter. Last year's crop was valued at nearly $42 million. 
</P>
<P>
But some workers, who won legal status through a 1986 immigration amnesty 
program, say they haven't shared in the prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
"They think it's a lot of money they're paying us," said Jesus Vasquez of 
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, who has been living beneath the bridge since May. "But 
it's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Marentes, director of the Union de Trabajadores Agricolas Fronterrizas, 
the border agricultural workers' union, said farm workers earn an average of 
$6,000 for a family of seven, $12,000 less than the federal poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal law requires farmers to pay laborers the minimum wage of $3.80 
an hour, pickers are being paid the same rates for a bucket of peppers as they 
were a decade ago, he said. Meanwhile, the size of the bucket has gone from 6 
gallons to 10 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers pay an average 60 cents to 70 cents for every bucket of chilis picked. 
Even if a worker does not pick enough buckets to earn $30.40, the minimum wage 
for an eight-hour day, farmers or labor contractors are required by law to pay 
the hourly wage anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Union organizers and some pickers say farmers aren't complying. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a wage receipt from a lady who worked . . . eight hours, and they have 
four hours on her work receipt. She made $21," said Sandy New-Lopez, a union 
staff member. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers believe that the union has exaggerated the problems of a minority of 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they bring up isolated incidents," said Don Hackey, chairman of the 
New Mexico Chili Commission, which represents many of the state's estimated 400 
chili growers. "They find something that's happened to an individual and then 
portray it as widespread and say that's how we all work. That's absolutely not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
Hackey said he pays 100 to 150 workers picking his 300 acres as much as 80 
cents a bucket. His own survey of workers on his field found the average wage 
was $54 for about eight hours' work. 
</P>
<P>
"The only complaint I hear from my people is, 'Gosh, I wish we had this all 
year,' " Hackey said. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Department investigators sent out in August found 63 cases of violations 
of various federal laws, said Andy Chavez, district director of the Albuquerque 
Wage and Hour Division of the Labor Department. 
</P>

A second investigation of 51 growers and farm labor contractors that ended in 
October found 142 violations. Only six of the 51 were in compliance with laws 
protecting farm workers, many of whom say they were better off before they were 
granted amnesty.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been 10 years since the movie "Urban Cowboy" gave country music its 
greatest commercial boom and, ultimately, its biggest nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the film did for country what "Saturday Night Fever" did for disco. 
Millions of Americans were soon sporting cowboy hats, riding those silly 
mechanical bulls and buying country albums. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bottom fell out. 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the Western craze, people threw their hats into the closet, pulled the 
plugs on the mechanical bulls and, crucially, decided they'd had enough of 
those country records. 
</P>
<P>
The result: The number of platinum (1 million sales) or gold (500,000 sales) 
country albums listed on Billboard magazine's year-end sales chart dropped from 
18 in 1980 to 12 in 1983 -- to just seven in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Nashville was shell-shocked," said Jimmy Bowen, head of Capitol Records in 
Nashville. "People predicted doom. Everyone went around asking, 'What do we do 
now? What do we do now?' " 
</P>
<P>
Today, the good times are back in country music. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to an unprecedented number of new young stars, led by Garth Brooks and 
Clint Black, country is enjoying a commercial run that may even dwarf the 
"Urban Cowboy" days. It is also producing the best records since Willie Nelson 
and Waylon Jennings were leading the Outlaw movement more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
These artists have yet to show an original vision that stretches the boundaries 
of country the way Nelson or Merle Haggard did in the '60s and '70s. But they 
represent a welcome return to classic country values after the deluge of 
characterless, pop-accented recordings of the "Urban Cowboy" period. 
</P>
<P>
Without compromising hard-core country emotion or arrangements, they are 
selling phenomenally well -- not only to the traditional, over-35 country 
audience, but also to a younger, pop-oriented crowd. The number of platinum and 
gold country albums listed on Billboard's year-end charts last week: an 
astonishing 33. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fire in the belly of Nashville again now, more than I've seen in 
almost 20 years," said David Conrad, who oversees the local office of the 
Almo-Irving music publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't just 'Urban Cowboy II.' This is the real stuff. There's more raw 
country excitement than at any time since Willie and Waylon started the whole 
Outlaw thing in the '70s. We've got some honest-to-God good country singers and 
songwriters again." 
</P>
<P>
You get an idea of how fast things are changing in country music when you 
realize that today's two biggest sellers -- Brooks and Black -- released their 
first albums only last year. 
</P>
<P>
They are just the most prominent in a rush of artists who have risen to 
commercial and/or critical acclaim in recent months. Among the others: the 
Kentucky Headhunters, Alan Jackson, Mark Chesnutt, Travis Tritt, Joe Diffie, 
Patty Loveless, Doug Stone, Shelby Lynne and Mark Collie. 
</P>
<P>
This new energy isn't just being felt in the country field, which is expected 
to generate an estimated $500 million in sales this year. The lastest albums by 
Black and Brooks are also in the Top 20 in the pop field. 
</P>
<P>
Nashville's bounty of new talent was dramatized in September when so many 
newcomers performed on the normally veteran-dominated Country Music Awards 
television show. Host Randy Travis -- who is just 31 and has been a star in 
country music for only five years -- seemed like an elder statesman. 
</P>
<P>
The domination of the show by new artists was an eye-opener, even for the 
country Establishment here. 
</P>
<P>
"That show brought it home to me because you had one outstanding performance 
after another from essentially newcomers with a substantial level of artistic 
quality and integrity," said Bill Ivey, executive director of the Country Music 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
If Nashville was impressed, so was the viewing audience. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which registered a higher rating for CBS that night than ABC's 
"Monday Night Football," was widely credited with stimulating record sales of 
the featured artists, especially Black and Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks' "No Fences" album, for instance, sold an estimated 300,000 copies the 
week after the TV show. Total sales since its release in September: an 
estimated 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"To outsiders, it must seem like someone just backed a truck up to Music City 
Row and dumped all these great singers off," said Almo-Irving's Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
"But to me, all this started five or so years ago, when the record companies 
finally woke up and decided they had to find some good new people or country 
music was just going to fade away. The artists were getting up in years and the 
audience was getting there, too." 
</P>
<P>
For most of Nashville, waking up wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
The man whose success is widely credited with re-energizing country music was 
turned down by every record company in town -- in some cases twice -- before 
being signed by Warner Bros. Records in 1985. The knock against Randy Travis: 
He was too country. 
</P>
<P>
Travis was a revolutionary throwback to the fiddle-'n'-steel, honky-tonk style 
of such post-World War II country giants as Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, 
whose music stood as expressions of blue-collar heartache and aspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently described as "the white man's blues," the best country songs of the 
'40s and into the '50s were simple yet passionate tales that had the absolute 
feel of real life. The pop world frequently adopted the best of the songs, such 
as Hank Williams' aching "Your Cheatin' Heart," but only after they had been 
re-recorded by pop artists and given arrangements that smoothed out most of the 
original country rawness. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the '50s, the country music hierarchy began trying to eliminate 
the middle man and make records aimed directly at the pop audience -- records 
that downplayed the rural accents of the singers and highlighted syrupy backing 
vocals and lush strings rather than old steel guitars and fiddles. Outsiders 
with even a touch of country were embraced as part of the family. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the "Urban Cowboy" era is now considered such a dark period for 
country music is that even the songs came to have a heartless, synthetic feel 
as the Nashville Establishment encouraged all of its artists, from Conway 
Twitty and Ronnie Milsap to T.G. Sheppard and Eddie Rabbit, to soft-pedal their 
country roots. 
</P>
<P>
When Travis arrived in Nashville in the early '80s, he was definitely a man out 
of time. The soft-spoken young man got a job singing in a country-music 
nightclub, where he doubled as catfish cook and dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
His manager, Lib Hatcher, lured dozens of record company executives to the 
club, which was in walking distance of the Grand Ole Opry. He represented 
everything they had been trying to forget about country music. Except to Warner 
Bros.' Martha Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in her office recently, Sharp, senior vice president of the label's 
Nashville artists-and-repertoire department, smiled as she was told about the 
current consensus in Nashville that Travis' success was the turning point in 
the revitalization of country. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone around town had been down on pure country music for so long that they 
still didn't trust it after the first album," she said. "They thought he was a 
hillbilly, and they just didn't think there was a place for someone to just 
stand up there and sing great country music. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only after Randy's second album went platinum that people started 
looking around and thinking, 'Well, maybe something is happening here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Travis' first single, "On the Other Hand," is now considered a country classic. 
The subject is romantic temptation, and Travis crooned its clever wordplay with 
such deft sentimentality that Haggard must have been awed. 
</P>
<P>
Sample lines from the song, written by Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz: 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, I count the reasons 
</P>
<P>
 I could stay with you 
</P>
<P>
 And hold you close to me 
</P>
<P>
 All night long . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On that hand, there's 
</P>
<P>
 No reason why it's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 But . . . on the other hand 
</P>
<P>
 There's a golden band 
</P>
<P>
 To remind me of someone 
</P>
<P>
 Who would not understand. 
</P>
<P>
 If the record -- with its soulful, steel-accented arrangement -- were released 
in today's country climate, it would shoot straight to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1985, however, two forces worked against it. First, country 
radio was "artist-driven," meaning that the stations tended to stick with the 
proven stars rather than unknowns, even if the veterans delivered weak records. 
Second, stations avoided anything with a traditional, hard-core-country sound. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some support from disc jockeys around the country, "On the Other Hand" 
got only enough airplay to reach No. 67 on the Billboard country charts. After 
"On the Other Hand" was re-released eight months later, following the success 
of a second Travis single, it broke into the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Listener response to Travis was amazing," recalls Larry Daniels, general 
program manager of KNIX-FM and KCW-AM in Phoenix. "They couldn't get enough of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Sensing the groundswell, Warner Bros. rushed Travis into the studio to record 
an album. It sold almost 2 million copies, making it one of only three debut 
albums in the history of country music at the time to go platinum. 
</P>
<P>
(To illustrate the surge of country at the moment: Three debuts -- by Black, 
Brooks and the Kentucky Headhunters -- have gone platinum in the last 12 
months.) 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Crutchfield, a veteran Nashville producer, recalls the singer's impact. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we were doing great when we sold 500,000 copies on an artist at the 
time," he said, during a break from a recording session with Lee Greenwood. 
"So, it amazed all of us when we looked over and saw Warners was selling all 
these albums with him -- and a lot of them to young buyers, who don't normally 
show an interest in country music. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked young people about Travis and they said they liked him because he was 
closer to their age and he was so believable . . . his voice and his songs." 
</P>
<P>
In earlier decades, country occasionally attracted a young audience. Certainly 
that happened in the '50s, when Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis brought a 
country feel to rock 'n' roll, and again in the '70s, when the Outlaw sound 
offered a restless, rebellious spirit that updated original country-rock 
instincts. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, country was aimed at the over-35 crowd. Young 
people related more easily to rock. But some young country fans -- especially 
in regions where country music has been traditionally strong -- find the music 
of the new country stars more meaningful than the heavy metal that dominates 
commercial rock or the rap and dance styles that represent the pulse of modern 
pop. 
</P>
<P>
Before Travis, there had been evidence of a return to basics in the work of 
Emmylou Harris, Ricky Skaggs, George Strait and the Judds. But Travis was like 
a lighting bolt. 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Crutchfield, "That's when everyone realized that the best way to 
compete with pop wasn't to try to make pop records, but to go back to what we 
did best: Make great country records." 
</P>
<P>
Travis' success sent out a message to songwriters as well. As a music 
publisher, Almo-Irving's Conrad saw the impact. 
</P>
<P>
"The records were all the same after 'Urban Cowboy,' real contrived," he said. 
"When the Travis thing happened, it was like all the writers rolled up their 
sleeves and said, 'I can write from my heart again and there is someone who'll 
sing it.' The day of the ditty was over." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Travis' success inspired hundreds of honky-tonk singers 
around the country -- who had felt alienated by the country sounds of the early 
'80s -- to think there might be a place for them at last in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
So, they started heading to Music City from all over -- places like Tulsa 
(Brooks) and Houston (Black). 
</P>
<P>
They brought with them not only authentic country vocal styles, but a love for 
the type of songs that conveyed genuine emotion -- songs that spoke with humor 
and poignancy about everyday yearnings and disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Brooks and Black are considered the most promising lights in country 
music these days (see story on Page 9) is that their music deals so effectively 
with country's traditional themes. 
</P>
<P>
In a song on his new album, Black speaks about the economic troubles frequently 
addressed in country music. Sample lines from "One More Payment": 
</P>
<P>
 Break my back to make those bank notes 
</P>
<P>
 Payin' on an almost always broken down 
</P>
<P>
 Fix that car nine ways to Sunday 
</P>
<P>
 And it won't start again when Monday rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brooks may be the new artist who best taps the sociology of his audience. 
</P>
<P>
He's an inconsistent writer and turns to others for his best material, but he 
can be wonderfully light when writing about heartbreak ("Not Counting You") or 
disarmingly tender in expressing love. 
</P>
<P>
In "Unanswered Prayers," from his second album, Brooks speaks about a married 
man running into an old high-school flame and remembering that he once spent 
all his time wishing -- even praying -- that she would be his. 
</P>
<P>
But, the song's chorus tells us, he now realizes: 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't quite the angel 
</P>
<P>
 That I remembered in my dreams 
</P>
<P>
 We tried to talk about the old days 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much we could recall 
</P>
<P>
 I guess the Lord knows 
</P>
<P>
 What he's doin' after all. 
</P>
<P>
 And as she walked away and I looked at my wife . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The final piece of the puzzle: A new generation of executives and producers 
was moving into place in Nashville -- people eager to find new artists and put 
their stamp on country music. The signings during the period ranged from such 
independent artists as rock-tinged Dwight Yoakam and Steve Earle to folk-edged 
Nanci Griffith and wry Lyle Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
Capitol's Jimmy Bowen -- whose credits as a producer range from Frank Sinatra 
and Dean Martin to Hank Williams Jr. and Reba McEntire -- is one of the few 
industry leaders here who has anything good to say about the "Urban Cowboy" 
era. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened here during the period was funny in a way and sad in a way 
because it showed how non-creative things were here," Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking about the idea that anyone could think the 'Urban Cowboy' sound 
was going to be their guru. What that (period) did was drop us down so far that 
it forced the record companies to start removing some people who had been 
making decisions, and it led to an influx of people with new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
The most significant breakthrough, however, may have been the changes in radio 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
"Country radio still prefers to stick with established artists to some extent, 
but that's getting less and less," said Bruce Hinton, president of MCA Records 
in Nashville. "With all the emphasis today on listener research and stronger 
playlists, they are more interested in a good song and a good record than who 
sang it." 
</P>
<P>
What's ahead in the '90s? 
</P>
<P>
Tony Brown, named the most successful country producer of 1990 by Billboard 
magazine, offers a note of caution. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger is that Nashville may be climbing on a new bandwagon because of the 
success of all these 'hat' singers that sound like Merle Haggard," Brown said 
in his office at MCA Records. "A lot of guys may start signing people because 
they sound right without taking into consideration whether they are really 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds me of the time in the '60s and '70s when you had some artists who 
had one big hit, bought big buses, filled arenas and then they were gone. That 
may be happening again." 
</P>
<P>
Connie Bradley, who heads the Nashville office of the American Society of 
Composers, Authors and Publishers, also worries about the rapid turnover in 
country music. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at that CMA Awards show and see all the new talent, you realize 
that you are going to rise to fame quicker and fall out quicker, and I'm not 
sure that's best in the long run for the health of country music." 
</P>
<P>
But Capitol's Bowen summarizes the general optimism sweeping Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s is going to be the biggest era for country-music sales and growth. 
You've got a dozen (record executives and producers) in town who are trying to 
kick each other's butts with good records -- Jim Ed Norman, Tony Brown, Josh 
Leo, Barry Beckett. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be looking for gold, maybe a few platinum. Now we're all going 
after multiplatinum, and we've got the artists to get it. We used to always 
rely on two or three superstars, and now we've got a dozen who are contenders. 
A lot of these kids have a chance to be great."

<P>
Garth Brooks, whose underdog anthem "Friends in Low Places" was one of the 
biggest country hits in years, also has some friends in high places when it 
comes to country music. 
</P>
<P>
When Calendar asked 20 country-music leaders to predict who would sell the most 
records over the next seven years (the length of a standard recording-industry 
contract), the 28-year-old Tulsa native finished on top, narrowly ahead of 
another country newcomer, Clint Black, 28. 
</P>
<P>
The runaway success of these two young singers -- both of whom burst onto the 
scene in 1989 -- underscores the current changing of the guard in country 
music. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the enthusiasm for new artists in a field long dominated by veterans 
is so strong that 10 of the artists who finished in the top 20 can reasonably 
be characterized as newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, some of the legendary names in country music -- including Willie 
Nelson, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Waylon 
Jennings -- didn't receive enough support from the panel of recording, radio 
and publishing executives to even make the top 20. The almost universal 
reaction when their names were raised: "It's over for them as major sellers." 
</P>
<P>
The highest-ranking "veteran" in the survey was George Strait, who finished a 
distant third to Brooks and Black. Strait, 38, has only been recording since 
1981, making him a mere pup by traditional country standards. 
</P>
<P>
In the survey, the industry leaders were asked to name, in order, the 10 
artists who they think will sell the most records over the next seven years. To 
encourage candor, the panel members were assured that their votes and comments 
wouldn't be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks registered 166 points -- two more than Black -- in a system that awards 
10 points for every first-place finish, 9 for every second-place mention and so 
forth. Each finished first on seven ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, we are talking 1 and 1-A in terms of potential when we talk 
about Brooks and Black," said one panel member. "To me, Clint is a little 
sexier, feistier -- a little mischievous. Garth is more down to Earth, like the 
Rock of Gibraltar. He looks as honest as the day is long. Who's going to sell 
the most? It depends who'll come up with the best material." 
</P>
<P>
Here are comments on individual artists: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Garth Brooks 
</P>
<P>
* "The first thing you have to understand about Garth is he's a tremendous 
entertainer. He's got showmanship, which you don't see a lot down here. And 
he'll stick around until 4:30 in the morning signing autographs." 
</P>
<P>
* "Brooks isn't just an incredible singer. He also has something to say . . . a 
point of view that people outside of country music can identify with, whereas 
Clint and some of the others seem to sell mainly to a traditional country 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
* "He's influenced by Merle Haggard and Lefty Frizzell, but there's also a pop 
influence in there somewhere, and that may give him a wider audience." 
</P>
<P>
* "Seems like a pretty stubborn fella, which I like. He's willing to stretch 
out there a little bit, which means he'll keep growing as an artist." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clint Black 
</P>
<P>
* "Don't underestimate the charisma and the looks. He's sexy -- not in the 
self-conscious way of Dwight Yoakam -- but in the style of Johnny Cash or early 
Merle Haggard." 
</P>
<P>
* "He has the ability to sing in a bluesy, funky way, which gives him the 
potential to cross over into the pop field without losing his country touch or 
following." 
</P>
<P>
* "One thing I like about his future is that he has sold 3 million or so 
albums, yet most of the pop world still doesn't know who he is. He has done no 
major endorsements or a movie and very little TV. He's just in the beginning of 
his career." 
</P>
<P>
Among the concerns: 
</P>
<P>
* "To me, Black is already wearing thin, and I don't know if he's a good enough 
writer to keep the momentum going. That can be a big problem if he decides to 
just do his own material rather than turn to outside writers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
George Strait 
</P>
<P>
* "He's been around for so long that it's easy to think he came up with Willie 
and Waylon, but Strait is closer in age to the newcomers. That sort of puts him 
between the generations, which is a great place to be because you can appeal to 
both age groups." 
</P>
<P>
* "One reason I'm not worried about his staying power is that he shows no signs 
of taking his success for granted. He's got a great sense of what material 
works for him and he's not overexposed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wynonna Judd 
</P>
<P>
* "In 20 years from now, people may look back on her the way they do today on 
Patsy Cline. She's got a tremendous voice." 
</P>
<P>
* "I think she'll be a stronger act than she would have been if she stayed with 
the Judds. She'll have a much broader range of material to work with. That 
mother-daughter thing kept them bogged down to the wholesome, wholesome, 
wholesome, and there are only so many of those songs." 
</P>
<P>
Among the anxious panelists: 
</P>
<P>
* "There was a lot of magic to that mother-daughter situation. I just don't 
know if that will continue as a solo artist. She's certainly a fabulous talent, 
but talent alone isn't always enough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reba McEntire 
</P>
<P>
* "I just don't care for the direction she is going in. She seems to be too 
concerned with being a pop star, and you know what that can mean. Remember what 
happened to Dolly Parton." 
</P>
<P>
* "I don't think she is over by any means, but I don't know if she can keep 
going at the old pace for seven more years. If they want new voices among men, 
it might be true for female singers, too." 
</P>
<P>
A strong supporter: 
</P>
<P>
* "I've also never seen anyone in country music quite as smart and as dedicated 
when it comes to handling a career." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Randy Travis 
</P>
<P>
* "I think he has peaked. He'll sell a lot more records, but as far as him 
being a dominant force in the '90s, I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
* "We all appreciate his sales and what he has done for this town, but there is 
something that doesn't track for me. If he's got a killer song, he's fine, but 
he can't make an ordinary song seem special. And that's what it takes to be a 
big seller over a long haul." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand: 
</P>
<P>
* "The problem is he had such a tremendous impact on the market originally by 
showing that traditional artists could sell that people tend to take him for 
granted now. But I think he's still the best young singer in Nashville." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alabama 
</P>
<P>
* "They had a great run, but I think it's nearing the end." 
</P>
<P>
* "These guys are real pros. They not only know what it takes to have a hit, 
but they have a great business machine. They also have one of the great country 
voices of all time in Randy Owen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alan Jackson 
</P>
<P>
* "This kid's strength is his sincerity. He's also a fighter. He kept a band 
together for three or four years while he was trying to get a record deal 
around here. A lot of people might have given up." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, saw him as more flash than substance. 
</P>
<P>
* "Sure has good jackets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kathy Mattea 
</P>
<P>
* "She's a versatile singer with the ability to sound kind of on the edge and 
folky like Emmylou Harris, yet also sing pop like Anne Murray." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Headhunters 
</P>
<P>
The pros: 
</P>
<P>
* "They are exciting, wild, new, different and I think there is an audience 
looking for something a little bit crazy, in the best sense of the word." 
</P>
<P>
* "They are aiming for a place in the country market that no one else is going 
after. All those fans who grew up on Southern rock and the Allman Brothers may 
go after them." 
</P>
<P>
The cons: 
</P>
<P>
* "Not sold on them. Too much of a novelty act for my tastes." 
</P>
<P>
"They may just be a Roman candle: A big flash and they drop out of sight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Those Who Didn't Make the Top 10 List: 
</P>
<P>
Here are selected comments on some new or veteran artists who didn't make the 
Top 10 -- or in some cases, the Top 20: 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Van Shelton: "He's another Sonny James. He makes pleasant records, but no 
individuality or depth." 
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams Jr.: "I think he's on the way down and the Headhunters' success 
could make him go down even faster." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Yoakam: "Lots of debate over him in Nashville. Some people think he's 
got too much of a pop and rock mentality, but others admire his independence. 
Most of the town has written him off, but I think he could still be real 
important in building a bridge between country and pop and rock." 
</P>
<P>
Emmylou Harris: "She shaped my tastes and the taste of a lot of people in this 
town, but she's not making records like she used to do. She's lost that eye of 
the tiger." 
</P>
<P>
k.d. lang: "Incredible talent and great presence, but I just don't think she 
and the country audiences are right for each other. She's more of a pop singer 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
Merle Haggard: "Clint and Garth and Alan Jackson are real hot now, but I'd sign 
Haggard before any of them if I had a chance. The reason a lot of others are so 
hot is that they are Haggard soundalikes and country radio is in love with 
Haggard's voice these days. At some point, people are going to say, why not 
just listen to Merle himself? It's like the Coca-Cola thing all over again. . . 
. get back to the real thing."

FOURTEEN YEAR'S AFTER ACTOR PETER FINCH'S DEATH, HIS SON AND EX-WIFE HAVE

It's only a couple of miles from Peter Finch's crypt, which is near Rudolph 
Valentino's in Hollywood Memorial Cemetery, to a street called Camino Palmero 
in the Hollywood foothills where, in recent weeks, a film was being made that 
the late actor might have foreseen. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of what some residents call "The Street of Dreams," because of its 
historical ties to the film industry, Finch's 28-year-old son Charles was 
directing his first Hollywood feature from a script he co-wrote with his 
mother, Yolande Turner -- Peter's wife for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.8-million film, "Where Sleeping Dogs Lie," which will be released next 
year, has nothing to do with Peter Finch's sudden death at the Beverly Hills 
Hotel 14 years ago. It has much to do with his son's life since, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, this was written as a script called 'Imagination,' one of the 
earlier things mummie and I wrote four or five years ago," Finch explained, 
during a break in shooting on Camino Palmero. "It was a comedy about a young 
writer being forced to sell real estate. Eventually this rather whimsical story 
became a much more autobiographical one about a young writer -- me -- not being 
able to sell the things that would keep him alive. He's a screenwriter, a 
playwright, a writer. He comes here trying to make a living but can't (sell) 
the kind of stories he wants to tell. The mechanics of surviving in the world 
are just too difficult to him." 
</P>
<P>
The primary location for "Sleeping Dogs" is a huge Mediterranean-style, 22-room 
house complete with outdoor and indoor swimming pools built at the top of 
Camino Palmero in 1928 by C.E. Toberman, architect of many of Hollywood's 
golden age landmarks (including Sid Grauman's Egyptian and Chinese theaters) 
and often called the "father of Hollywood" because of his development of the 
Hollywood Hills area. Sid Grauman himself reportedly lived there briefly during 
the '30s. 
</P>
<P>
Adjoining the two-acre property is Errol Flynn's old estate. (Flynn's daughter, 
Rory, is the unit photographer on the film and shot the pictures accompanying 
this article.) Down the street is one of the most photographed houses in 
America; it's the one in which Ozzie and Harriet Nelson raised their two boys. 
On the same block, there are houses once owned by Sam Goldwyn, Preston Sturges 
and Al Jolson. Around the corner is the plantation style mansion built for 
Fatty Arbuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredible to see this house," said Turner of the location, which the 
set decorators had turned into a creaking, rotting hulk. "Charles brought me to 
see it on the first day and it stood there more or less as I saw it in my own 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
In the film, the writer Bruce Simmons (played by Dylan McDermott) is convinced 
by his agent (Sharon Stone) to "sell out" and write a highly commercial book 
about a multiple murder that occurred years before. He moves in to the house 
where the crime supposedly took place, takes in a roommate (Tom Sizemore) and 
finds himself smack in the middle of a terrifying mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie is about money, power and fame," said McDermott, "What they do to a 
person, the corruption they entail and how this person rejects them." 
</P>
<P>
Money, power and fame were, in fact, among the elements that nearly destroyed 
Charles Finch's film career at its onset. Six years ago, when he was 23, he 
wrote (with his mother), produced and directed a film in Italy called 
"Priceless Beauty," starring Diane Lane and Christopher Lambert. "They fell in 
love and are very happy," Finch said. "But I made every makeable mistake as a 
director. It was a total disaster. . . . There is not one day that goes by 
without me thinking about that film. It cost me $196,000 -- the only money I 
had -- to try and protect my cut of the film." 
</P>
<P>
What Finch had written and directed was a romantic fantasy. The final cut, as 
re-edited by the Italian investors, was "be-bop on the beach," according to 
Finch, so bad that when he saw it in Cannes he fled to London and was unable to 
write for months. "It broke my heart," he said. "I cried for four months." The 
film has not been released in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
As much as he loathed the final cut of "Priceless Beauty," Finch looks back now 
and sees some threads of a personal style in both that and his current film. "I 
look at the dailies now and see the same sort of baroqueness that I see in 
'Priceless Beauty' . . . the same sort of operatic, passionate style. I guess 
the films I'll make will be like that. Very different and passionate, not 
sexual but about heightened emotion." 
</P>
<P>
McDermott agrees, "I think a lot of filmmakers mistake violence for passion and 
this film has a lot of passion without the violence. . . . It's blood and guts 
of the soul, not of the physical body." 
</P>
<P>
Finch attributes his style to his heritage. "I spent my childhood in the 
Caribbean," he notes of the years living at his father's place in Jamaica and 
while going to Gordonstoun School in northern Scotland, where Prince Andrew was 
a friend and Prince Edward a student at the same time. "There were huge squalls 
and winds and thunderstorms," he adds. "And with a theatrical mother and 
father, I grew up in the elements, if you will, a little like Lear. And I'm a 
Celt and therefore have that very Celtic feel for drama." 
</P>
<P>
His mother concurs: "We were an artistic family, bohemian, vagabondish. You 
hear all show business parents saying they never want their children to be in 
the business, and inevitably it seems that they do." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, a South-African-born actress working on the British stage, married 
Peter Finch in 1959. "As soon as we were married we were on our way to 
Hollywood," she recalled. "He was making 'Rachel Cade' with Angie Dickenson. My 
daughter was conceived here," she adds of Samantha, Charles' older sister, a 
writer living in Paris. "We were here for eight months and here we are again -- 
the story never ends." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, whose West End career included work with Noel Coward with Peter O'Toole 
and "lots" of British television, worked with her husband in 1962's "The Girl 
With Green Eyes." She also wrote and produced "The Day," a 1960 film directed 
by Peter Finch, the Bronze Lion winner at the Venice Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Of her collaboration with her son, she said, "Charles is a wonderful story man. 
He has a brilliant sense of drama." 
</P>
<P>
Says Charles about his mother: "She is the person who has the maturity, the 
talent and the brilliance to give my stories depth. I have these stories I want 
to tell and I jot them down in a rough draft. She takes that and develops it. . 
. . Out of the thin draft of a screenplay, she pours her soul into it and gives 
it colors that make it live." 
</P>
<P>
Turner discusses her relationship with Peter Finch openly, but with sadness. 
She said that after their divorce in 1970, he saw his children only once again, 
during a walk in London's Kensington Park. "I kept his image as their talented 
father alive in the home with photographs," she said, "and sent them letters 
and toys, supposedly from him. It was a harsh judgment on his part not to see 
the children, not that he hadn't had a harsh life as a child himself." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she and Charles heard of Peter's death on the radio in a taxi on 
the way to Charles' entrance exams at the American School in Paris; they 
attended the memorial service in London. "I believe I was the only person in 
the world who knew his deepest heart," said Turner, whose "novelography," 
"Finchy," was published by Simon and Schuster in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
She sees much of Peter in their son: "His great charm and charisma, certainly . 
. . a bright, acquisitive brain, a worldly man with a gentle, poetic side . . . 
exceedingly attractive to women and who adores women -- very like his father 
there. Charles doesn't drink, though. That terrified him, I think. Peter was a 
bit of a tippler." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Charles worked as a stockbroker in London, hated it, and with 
Turner's support moved to America to study with Lee Strasberg during his last 
year. "I thought, God, after all these years of not wanting him to go into this 
miraculous business, that's what he wants to do! He discovered he didn't want 
to be an actor but did want to be a director, a writer, a producer. And he 
hasn't swayed from it." 
</P>
<P>
Charles ended up broke in Hollywood, where he worked on scripts and did odd 
jobs as an assistant to David Puttnam and Peter Guber. 
</P>
<P>
Both McDermott and co-star Joan Chen, who plays the writer's girlfriend in 
"Sleeping Dogs," say that the young Finch is a talented director. "He has all 
the ingredients," McDermott said. "He knows how to deal with actors, which is 
very rare. He knows what he wants and he has control of his set. I want him to 
be my Scorsese . . . I want to work with him all the time." 
</P>
<P>
"He obviously loves words, and he doesn't just want to do a violent piece," 
Chen added. "I see a lot of passion from Dylan and Charles, and, being a 
low-budget film, everybody has a strong personal reason to be there. That gives 
it a spark." 
</P>
<P>
What next? The mother-son team says it is starting on a script for Tri-Star, 
but Finch said he finds it hard to think beyond "Sleeping Dogs," which is 
obviously his big opportunity in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared as hell," he said, as shooting was about to wrap on his second 
film. "I'm as scared as the first day I started, scared of not being good 
enough. When you've made a very bad film, when you've been humiliated publicly, 
you go on, but you also know the pain."

THE WATERBOYS' MIKE SCOTT RETURNS TO ROCK 'N' ROLL AFTER HIS IRISH-ACCENTED 
ACOUSTIC GROUP SPLINTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, Chris Willman writes about pop music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were two bands called the Waterboys in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
One was the seven-piece group that released "Room to Roam," a light, largely 
acoustic album full of reveries of Ireland and one of its lasses, with music 
based on or inspired by traditional Celtic strains played on fiddle, accordion, 
flute, whistle and the likes. 
</P>
<P>
The other was the stripped-down four-piece rock 'n' roll band that played a 
hard-edged set of dark, electric, Dylan-goes-European riffs, augmented by a 
punchy brass section, at the Universal Amphitheatre earlier this month, with 
hardly a jig or reel in earshot. 
</P>
<P>
What these two bands have in common, name aside, is primarily group leader Mike 
Scott. Personnel and style changes can be as expected yet sudden in the 
Waterboys as a rain shower in Scott's precious Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Two other band members, sax player Anthony Thistlethwaite and bassist Trevor 
Hutchinson, made the transition from the former lineup to the current, but the 
group is Scott's baby. Once fiddle player Steve Wickham quit the 
Celtic-flavored version of the band after the recording of the album, Scott 
took that as an omen to change course altogether and decided to lose the other 
traditional instrumentalists in the group as well. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very weird thing, touring a different show than the album that's just 
come out," admitted Scott backstage after the Universal show. "I wouldn't wish 
that on anybody. If the 'Room to Roam' lineup hadn't broken up, I would've been 
happy to tour that lineup. But when that band was over, I went for whatever 
would be good fun, which was rock 'n' roll and the brass section. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started playing electric guitar in the band again, which was about four 
months ago, and all the traditional musicians left the band, that was a pretty 
clear demarcation point -- folk on one side, and rock 'n' roll on the other. 
</P>

"Yeah, it is the end of an era. And I don't know where our music's gonna go. I 
don't think the Waterboys and Celtic music are finished with each other at all. 
It's music that I've been listening to and playing for three years or so, and 
you can't just stop like that. But the high point . . . is probably past." 
</P>
<P>
Though Scott says the traditional musicians of his adopted home, Ireland, are 
quite supportive of anyone taking it to a broader audience, not everyone has 
applauded his move into roots music. In a recent local concert, English singer 
John Wesley Harding parodied "Fisherman's Blues" and its "wish I was a 
fisherman" sentiments, suggesting that Scott should really trade places with a 
fisherman and give him a shot at being a big rock star. "He's not even Irish, 
you know," Harding added derisively about Scott, who is originally from 
Scotland. "He just wears a cardigan." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing his omnipresent Dylan cap during the interview, Scott, 31, seemed 
reasonably gregarious for someone notoriously press-shy in recent years. He 
chuckled freely and mugged madly for a photographer. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most musicians, Scott prefers to talk to the press right after a show -- 
he's still up from the performance, he explained, and any tension that might 
arise in the interview won't affect that night's concert. He spoke of the 
changes in the group nonchalantly, as if it were no big deal to spin into a 
180-degree turn mid-race. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the new edition of the Waterboys brings Scott's creation closer to 
its early-'80s origins, when the group was more likely to be lumped in with U2 
or Echo &amp; the Bunnymen than the Chieftains. And a return to a purer rock 
sound may well restore the commercial luster that lost some of its shine during 
the two-album detour into Celtic sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the record company liked us going into Irish music," Scott 
confessed, "and I know when we were on the verge of recording 'Room to Roam,' 
there were a few comments from people here and there that it wasn't what we 
should be doing. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't pay any attention to that, can I? I'm not sitting there deciding, 
'Well, we're going to do Irish music now.' I'm just doing what the road seems 
to be taking me 
</P>
<P>
on. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I shouldn't even say it's Irish music, because it's not. Most of 
those tunes are Scottish. Scottish music is almost the same as Irish music; the 
Irish music is slightly better. Scottish music is jumpier, where an Irish tune 
will be very smooth and rolly." 
</P>
<P>
If the differentiation seems important to Scott, it may be because of his own 
divided loyalties: Though a Scottish native, Scott has been known to wax 
rhapsodic in song as well as conversation about the healing qualities of 
Ireland since his move there several years ago. "Scotland is my dreaming head / 
Ireland is my heart," he sings in the latest album's "Islandman." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Wallinger, now the leader of the band World Party, was a member of the 
Waterboys circa 1985. When he split to form his own group the next year, 
Wallinger expressed respect for Scott, yet with a whiff of disdain noted that 
he wanted to concentrate on a kind of spiritually themed songwriting that was 
"less esoteric, less up in the air, more down to earth" than the Waterboys' 
sometimes wistful ethereality. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was especially prone at the time to writing about the anticipation of 
something huge and undefined -- the "Church Not Made With Hands" ("that 
precious place unmade by man"), "The Big Music" ("like jazz manna from sweet, 
sweet chariots"), "The Pan Within." 
</P>
<P>
It expressed the hope of the intangible -- idealistic and sometimes dark in its 
unfulfilled longing. A typical lofty lyric from that time: 
</P>
<P>
 Man is tethered 
</P>
<P>
 Spirit is free 
</P>
<P>
 What spirit is man can be. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspects, however, that Wallinger may well like the new Mike Scott better. 
Not that he's necessarily taken his head out of the clouds entirely, but the 
last two Waterboys albums -- "Room to Roam" and its predecessor, "Fisherman's 
Blues" -- have been lighter in spirit and much more specific in personal 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
There are paeans to Irish towns and paeans to the bride who he says is "the 
woman of my dreams" -- including "A Man Is in Love," a ballad of almost 
McCartneyesque simplicity and sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Performing that number on the piano at the Universal Amphitheatre, when the use 
of the third person switched to the first with the climactic line "A man is in 
love, and he's me," Scott threw his arms up in the air just as a giant red 
heart appeared on the screen behind the stage. It was as corny and romantic a 
moment as you could find in a rock 'n' roll show, let alone from this erstwhile 
sour spiritist. 
</P>
<P>
Not to paraphrase Bono, but it almost sounds like Scott has found what he's 
looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I found 'Medicine Bow,' all right, and it was Ireland. And I found the 
woman that I was looking for when I wrote 'Trumpets.' I suppose now that I've 
found all that, I'll be looking for something else pretty soon. There's always 
something else to find and another adventure to be had. 
</P>
<P>
"But probably when I wrote the songs you're talking about, I wasn't 
particularly happy with my lot in life and was kind of lonely as a person, and 
that probably comes out in the writing. But that circumstance isn't the same 
now, so I probably won't write like that now." 
</P>
<P>
Still, lonely or no, the "Room to Roam" album has its share of nods toward 
transcendence, such as the title track, with words taken from a poem by George 
MacDonald, the Scottish novelist and preacher who was considered orthodox in 
his Christianity aside from a controversial belief in universal salvation. 
</P>
<P>
Scott shares MacDonald's belief in "many days and many ways ending in one end" 
and insists that his own lyrical supernaturalism is not just metaphoric. 
</P>
<P>
"I always believed in Jesus and God, but I'm not a practicing Christian or 
anything. I never had any problem with that from the first time that I heard 
about them when I was a little boy. Never any question. Always believed 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
"And I believe in the Indian religion and I believe in Buddhism, and I believe 
all the religions are pretty cool. I'm not sure about the ones they have down 
there in the Gulf now, but the ones that I do know something about, I really 
believe in. And I believe in the human spirit and that what spirit is, man can 
be, and I believe that everything is alive and God is in everything. And I've 
always believed that, and I'm always trying to put it in songs and explain it 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was writing (more recent) songs like 'Has Anybody Here Seen Hank' and 
'When Will We Be Married,' they're pretty down to earth, and I was aware of it. 
But I don't want to stop writing things that are of a different kind of nature 
either. In fact, getting the sort of ethereal things in the skin of words that 
are down to earth -- now, that would be something worth achieving."

So, you thought you had seen your last pop quiz when you got out of school? 
Wrong! There are fewer than 48 hours left until the new year begins, so it's 
final exam time, to see just how close you were paying attention to the news in 
1990. That's right, it's the fourth annual Times Orange County Trivia Quiz. 
Don't bone up on subject areas such as world peace, global warming or the size 
of the federal deficit. You'll be better prepared if you know such important 
facts as the cost of an official souvenir tie at the Richard M. Nixon Library 
&amp; Birthplace ($25), how many times bigger the new John Wayne Airport 
terminal is than the old (12), and what Bishop Desmond Tutu's least favorite 
ride was when he visited Disneyland (Splash Mountain). Answer 35 to 40 right 
and you can rent yourself out to the public library's local history room. Get 
25 to 34 right, and go to the head of the metered on-ramp. Get 15 to 24 
correct, and go to the back of the line of the metered on-ramp. Fewer than 15 
right? Move to Los Angeles County. But don't worry, this is an open-book test. 
So pull out the last 364 issues of the daily newspaper and let's get trivial. 
For answers see B12.

WOMAN DIES FROM BURNS SUSTAINED IN BLAZE; 
</P>
<P>
FIRES: THE INCIDENT IN YORBA LINDA PRECEDED ANOTHER ONE IN IRVINE THAT STARTED 
WHEN A CHRISTMAS TREE BROKE OUT IN FLAMES, INJURING TWO PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 85-year-old Yorba Linda woman died from burns sustained over 70% of her body 
during a fire which led to the evacuation of a senior citizens' apartment 
complex early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, a 4-year-old and his father were injured and their family left 
homeless in Irvine as a result of a fire that started in a Christmas tree and 
engulfed their house. 
</P>
<P>
According to fire officials, the Yorba Linda fire broke out at 5:33 a.m. at the 
Villa Pacifica Apartments, a housing complex for elderly residents in the 18000 
block of Lemon Drive. Matilda Tuohy apparently was asleep in her second-floor 
apartment when her electric blanket caught fire, rapidly igniting her blankets 
and trapping her amid heavy flames and smoke. When firefighters arrived, Tuohy 
was lying on the carpet near her bed, not breathing, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, she tried to get out because she was found on the floor of her own 
bedroom," Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young said. "They (paramedics) found her 
and were able to resuscitate her." 
</P>
<P>
But Tuohy died at 3:44 p.m. at UCI Medical Center's burn unit in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The fire at the complex of two-story buildings forced about 20 elderly 
residents outdoors before dawn while firefighters battled the stubborn blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite frightening," said Joy Barber, who was among those evacuated. 
"Once I got down the steps there were flames coming over the window and up by 
the roof." 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate the fire caused $70,000 in damage, including smoke and heat 
damage to two neighboring apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Young said investigators are trying to determine whether a smoke detector in 
Tuohy's apartment sounded when the fire broke out. He said fire officials have 
not determined what caused the electric blanket to malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the Yorba Linda fire, an Irvine family barely escaped with 
their lives when their Christmas tree caught fire in the living room, creating 
an inferno that engulfed their home within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in the house even had time to call 911," Young said. "(The) mom said 
the fire started in the back of the tree and the whole thing just exploded." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy O'Connor, who was sitting on a couch about 20 feet from the tree, had 
just enough time to grab her 2-year-old son and run outside, fire officials 
said. The toddler had been sitting next to the tree when the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor said he ran to get a garden hose as he watched flames shooting 
from the windows. 
</P>
<P>
"She (O'Connor) was yelling, 'Phil (O'Connor, her husband) is still inside!' 
but then I heard Phil say, 'I'm all right!' " said Lee Ennis, a neighbor. "You 
could just see the flames taking off." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Philip O'Connor, 40, grabbed the couple's 4-year-old son, Philip 
Jr., and climbed out a second-floor window, fire officials said. He suffered 
second-degree burns on his hands and back, while Philip Jr. suffered minor 
burns on his hands. Philip O'Connor received outpatient treatment at the Irvine 
Medical Center. Philip Jr. was being treated at Children's Hospital of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are investigating how the Christmas tree caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
The family lost everything inside the house, including all the newly opened 
Christmas gifts cherished by the children, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
So, on Saturday afternoon, county firefighters delivered a load of belated 
Christmas presents to the two young O'Connor boys. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids were devastated. Their toys were completely gone," Young said. "So we 
delivered these to boost their spirits." 
</P>
<P>
The toys -- including stuffed animals and a tricycle for the 2-year-old, a 
train set and a bicycle for the 4-year-old, and lots of Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtle pajamas and clothes -- came from Operation Santa Claus, an annual 
program that county firefighters run with the county Social Services 
Department. The toys usually are delivered to children at Orangewood, the 
county's home for abused and neglected children, on the day before Christmas, 
but this year there were some late donations at several fire stations, Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the O'Connor blaze, the firefighters rounded up appropriate gifts from 
the late donations. The first delivery, in a firetruck, was made to the 
2-year-old, who was with family friends in the neighborhood. Later, the 
firefighters took gifts -- including a blanket, to replace Philip Jr.'s 
treasured object, which burned -- to the youngster at Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
According to neighbors, the O'Connors' two older children were away in Florida 
visiting grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
"They (O'Connors) said if they had been home they would have never been able to 
get them out," Ennis said. "Their dog got stuck inside and died." 
</P>
<P>
Young estimated damage to the home in the 15000 block of Vichy Circle at 
$465,000. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the blaze was the eighth this holiday season started by a 
Christmas tree catching fire.

'YUKON EXPRESS' BRINGS SPRINKLES, CHILLS TO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fast-moving Arctic cold front delivered a grazing blow to Southern California 
on Saturday before preparing to take a final punch at the Southland tonight. 
</P>
<P>
As it hung around for a second day, the frigid air mass dubbed the "Yukon 
Express" hammered farmers and ranchers already staggering from last weekend's 
record-breaking cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
It was chilly and cloudy in Orange County, with temperatures in the low 50s and 
dropping to the high 40s along the coastal cities, and a few sprinkles of rain 
in some areas. Weekend lows in the county were expected to drop to the high 
30s. Newport Harbor and Huntington State Beach officials said there was no sign 
of the record high tides that are expected to peak on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The cold weather drew the homeless to Orange County's National Guard armories 
for the night. Both the Santa Ana and Fullerton armories expected to fill their 
125 beds by the end of Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-dawn temperatures dipped into the 20s from Bakersfield to Redding, where 
thermometers hit 22 degrees early Saturday, tying the city's record low reading 
for the date. Growers were anxiously inspecting fruit trees and vineyards to 
determine whether the freeze had killed plants. 
</P>
<P>
Although lows were recorded early Saturday of 50 in Los Angeles, 37 in 
Lancaster and 27 at Mt. Wilson, ranchers and residents of inland areas were 
warned to expect colder temperatures tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday night will be colder than Saturday night," said Steve Burback, a 
meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
"There will be a light freeze in the inland areas. The coldest areas will 
probably be around the upper 20s." 
</P>
<P>
But warm winds gusting up to 25 m.p.h. will push daytime temperatures into the 
60s today, Burback said. The warming trend will continue Monday and New Year's 
Day, when a postcard-perfect day is predicted for Pasadena's Tournament of 
Roses parade and Rose Bowl football game. 
</P>
<P>
The picture that residents of California's central San Joaquin Valley awakened 
to on Saturday was one of ice, however. 
</P>
<P>
"There was ice everywhere, on cars, lawns, trees, streets," said Lori Segrue, 
who works at a 900-acre vineyard in Kingsburg. "It's all people are talking 
about. It's affecting everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"People are losing their jobs over it. My husband is a supervisor at an 
orange-packing house and he's gone down to forklift driver because the hourly 
employees are all gone." 
</P>
<P>
In Clovis, workers at the Loring Citrus Farm toiled all night to keep heaters 
and wind machines whirring. They flooded their 40-acre orange orchard with 
72-degree water pumped "from deep, deep in the ground" and managed once again 
to save their orange crop, a spokeswoman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Krauter, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau, said other 
growers lost virtually their entire crop to last weekend's Arctic blast, the 
worst freeze to hit the state since the 1936-37 growing season. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2% of California's citrus growers -- 146 of 7,000 -- are insured against 
frost. 
</P>
<P>
There is no estimate yet on total freeze losses to the state's 
$8-billion-per-year agriculture crop, although some experts feel damage could 
total $1 billion. As a result, shoppers will soon see shortages and higher food 
prices, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz County, Gov. George Deukmejian declared a state of emergency 
because of freeze damage to public water systems, which local officials were 
struggling to repair. 
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters said there were some bright spots on the horizon, however. 
</P>
<P>
For example, today's wind gusts are expected to disappear by Monday, when an 
unusually high tide is expected along the Southland coast about 8 a.m.

AN ARABIAN NIGHTMARE ENDS FOR AIRMAN

<P>
Some wanted war to break out, others just want it to be resolved peacefully. 
(For me), it was just whatever would get me out of there. . . . The waiting, 
that was the fear; the war wasn't really a fear. . . . Not knowing when you're 
going to go home, not knowing when anything's going to happen, that was the 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 -- James Erlick, 48th Tactical Fighting Unit airman 
</P>
<P>
All of 21, Jim Erlick sounds as if he could be auditioning for a part in the 
next flyboy recruiting commercial. Glowingly, he speaks of traveling to distant 
lands, learning a trade, serving as electronics trouble-shooter for the F-111 
bomber, all opportunities offered by the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I've definitely enjoyed it," he says of his ongoing military service, his 
voice falling flat, "up until the last three months." 
</P>
<P>
The last three months. For the graduate of Fullerton's Sonora High School, they 
were alternately "a nightmare" and "an eye-opener." 
</P>
<P>
For his mother, Pauline, they were "three of the most miserable months of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Erlick has spent the last three months in Saudi Arabia, maintaining and 
fixing the electronic tracking systems of the two-seat bombers that may have to 
drop their payloads on Iraqi targets. Through some fortunate military 
scheduling, his temporary assignment with his tactical unit out of Lakenheath, 
England, ended earlier this month, so now he is home in Fullerton for the 
holidays. Then he'll be off to a new assignment in Utah in February. 
</P>
<P>
The airman is one of a handful of military personnel from Orange County who 
have served a stint in Saudi Arabia and already returned. Like most of them, 
Erlick is hoping that he will never have to go back. 
</P>
<P>
He never saw any of the scorpions and lizards that are lore among GIs in Saudi 
Arabia. But Erlick says there were enough other downsides to his stay there to 
ensure that he will not be booking vacation flights to the Persian Gulf soon. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstorms. The endless sea of sandy terrain, virtually devoid of vegetation. 
The dry, 110-degree daytime heat. The 12-hour work shifts to prep the F-111, 
starting at 6 p.m. Sleeping on the floor of the air shelter his first few 
nights there. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all was the boredom. 
</P>
<P>
"The boredom was the toughest part -- not knowing when anything is going to 
happen," Erlick says. "Basically, you're just sitting around; no alcohol, no 
women. It's just monotonous. . . . I couldn't party, couldn't go out and do 
things." 
</P>
<P>
The lifestyle got better over his three months, Erlick says; by the end, his 
base was even known by other units -- some of which stay in tents out on the 
sand -- as the Club Med of the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
The base had a chow hall with a choice of spaghetti, dried fruit, punch mix and 
about a dozen selections in all. Some men still preferred Meals Ready to Eat 
rations. 
</P>
<P>
A base exchange for purchases was set up. And the airmen even got a TV and 
videocassette recorder; "Mississippi Burning" was a base favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow balloons inside and out of the Erlicks' Fullerton home marked his Dec. 
20 return from England. It will be a nice holiday, all say. Erlick plans to 
relax mostly, see some friends, travel a little -- and look into colleges. 
</P>
<P>
He is getting out of the Air Force in a year or so and wants to go back to 
school, thanks in part to the "eye-opening" experience of Saudi Arabia. He says 
he will not miss much about the service, except some friends left behind. 
</P>
<P>
He never did get a chance to see the scorpions, but Erlick's not complaining; 
he missed a possible war.

<P>
Every few seconds, the scream coming from Safety Cell 9 rises to a horrible 
rasping shriek. The young woman inside is disheveled, disoriented, terrified, 
outraged. She pounds on the walls and the thick metal door, wailing for an 
unseen friend to help her, consumed by uncomprehending alcoholic delirium, rage 
and fright. 
</P>
<P>
In the adjacent booking area room, she appears every few seconds on one of 
several small video monitors, then disappears again as the automatic 
surveillance system switches to another camera in another cell. But she keeps 
screaming and screaming. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the booking area and down a short corridor, a thin 
37-year-old man with tangled blond hair sits cross-legged on the bare floor in 
a corner of the male detoxification cell and hugs himself as he sways back and 
forth. His face is bloated, flushed and lined beyond his years and when he was 
brought in nearly two hours before, shaky but conscious, his eyes were blazing 
red, swimming and unfocused. Sealed in the cell behind unbreakable glass, he 
cannot hear the woman's screams. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy's probably a really good candidate for a detox center," says Anaheim 
Police Lt. Ted LaBahn, the officer in charge of what is known officially as the 
city's holding facility -- the jail. "This is a classic alcoholic. He's a drunk 
drunk. He's obviously been through the system. We'd have no problem if they 
were all like him." 
</P>
<P>
He nods toward Safety Cell 9. "But her. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The California Penal Code section is 647f. It explains when public drunkenness 
becomes a crime. It describes a person who is under the influence of alcohol or 
drugs "in such a condition that he or she is unable to exercise care for his or 
her own safety or the safety of others, or . . . interferes with or obstructs 
or prevents the free use of any street, sidewalk or other public way." 
</P>
<P>
LaBahn is more succinct. 
</P>
<P>
"We only enforce it," he said, "if there's a problem or there's going to be 
one." 
</P>
<P>
That means that drunks who are lying in a driveway and are too intoxicated to 
move, or who are staggering insensibly into the street, or shouting 
incoherently outside an apartment building, or passed out in the bushes behind 
a bar are candidates for a night in the drunk tank. 
</P>
<P>
They are brought in every night, but the weekends are the busiest. Every Friday 
or Saturday night, between 15 and 20 people will arrive in handcuffs at the 
Anaheim holding facility in violation of section 647f. They will be booked and 
will remain in jail until they sober up, rarely longer than six hours, LaBahn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim is lucky. It has a jail where public drunks can sober up by themselves, 
in a detoxification or safety cell, and the jail staff can check their progress 
on the video monitors and during a routine walk around the jail every 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ten other Orange County cities, however, have no jail, and officers or watch 
commanders on duty must supervise drunks until they sober up or are released. 
In other cities where facilities are minimal, arrests for public drunkenness 
have been discouraged. And because of overcrowding, no public drunks at all are 
accepted at Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Police would love to be rid of the responsibility for taking care of the 
benign, non-combative drunk, the person whose immediate problem will disappear 
when his body metabolizes away the alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had a place to put these people," LaBahn said, "it would be a godsend." 
</P>
<P>
A task force of city, county and law enforcement officials convened by county 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder would like to see the drunks taken to a series of 
four or five "sobering up centers" that the group has proposed for the county. 
The centers would be staffed by civilian health care professionals, freeing 
police to return to duty immediately after bringing the drunks in. 
</P>
<P>
They brought in 7,352 of them in 1988, according to the task force report. The 
actual figure, however, probably is considerably higher because Anaheim was not 
included (the Anaheim Police Department, said the report, was unable to provide 
a figure because of lack of time to do a "hand search" of its records). Though 
Barbara Foster, one of Wieder's executive assistants, said public drunkenness 
was "an ongoing problem" in Orange County, she added that the city police 
chiefs sitting on Wieder's task force have said they believe that the problem 
is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
A sobering-up center, depending on availability and funding, could be part of a 
hospital alcohol ward, a section of an existing alcohol treatment center or be 
created as a new, free-standing facility, according to the task force report. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Police Chief John Robertson, a member of the task force, said he 
would like to see the centers work in concert with existing facilities that now 
provide long-term counseling and care for alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
"What we end up doing now is basically baby-sitting them," said Robertson. 
"They go into a holding cell, they sober up and then they go out the door. Some 
of them we see night after night." 
</P>
<P>
The sobering-up centers would "give police agencies a place to take people 
where they'll be at least better handled, by health-care professionals who can 
guide them in the right directions. We're not in the business to counsel them. 
Also, if they're in need of acute care right away, the professionals will 
recognize it far sooner than a police officer would." 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the project, Foster said, "is going to be tricky" because of tight 
government budgetary constraints. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as though we're going to approach the alcohol industry directly," she 
said. Letters have been sent to alcohol distributors in the area describing the 
project and soliciting money to fund the centers, she said. The cost of 
starting up and maintaining a center for a year, Foster said, has been 
estimated at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Still, LaBahn said, some drunks must be handled by police. 
</P>
<P>
She had been lying in the dirt behind a bar and was picked up, cuffed and taken 
to Anaheim Jail shortly after 2 a.m. And she conforms perfectly to an 
observation LaBahn had made early in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Words cannot express trying to handle a lady who's drunk," he said. "They 
don't realize their situation. All their lives, it's usually been that if the 
lady doesn't want to do something, the lady doesn't have to do it. But not when 
you're in custody." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the booking cell, the young woman begins to sob heavily and strains and 
thrashes against the cuffs behind her back, ignoring three officers' 
exhortations to calm down. They decide to leave the cuffs on for the time 
being. All three are wearing rubber surgical gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you would be insane to handle the people we have to handle without 
wearing gloves," LaBahn said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers quickly empty the young woman's pockets, removing identification 
and any objects that she could injure herself with in her delirium. She begins 
to scream, over and over. 
</P>
<P>
"Vicki! Please help me! I'm not a criminal! Vicki, please! 
</P>
<P>
She is pulled along the corridor to the padded safety cell, thrashing, 
incoherent, wild-eyed. The cell is about the size of three phone booths, with a 
video camera high in the corner of the ceiling and a small grate in the floor 
that serves as a toilet. The door is solid metal, padded on the inside, with a 
thin observation window that can be closed off and a small port through which 
food can be pushed. Like the rest of the jail, the cell is painted a neutral 
light brown and smells heavily of disinfectant. 
</P>
<P>
It begins to dawn on the woman that she is going to be put in the cell, and she 
begins to kick and scream louder. The officers wrestle her to the floor on her 
stomach and, as two female officers try to calm her before removing the 
handcuffs, a third male officer places a foot across her ankles to stop the 
kicking. 
</P>
<P>
"No!" she shrieks, her voice brutal and gravelly, retching. "No!" 
</P>
<P>
At last the officers are able to remove the cuffs and quickly back away. They 
shut the door behind them. The woman screams louder and louder for Vicki. 
</P>
<P>
"She's thinking how dare you hold her down. How dare you stand on her legs," 
said LaBahn, a 19-year veteran of the Anaheim Police Department. "But it's 
difficult to control people who are out of control. Sometimes it's like turning 
a wild animal loose. Most people never see the sights we do here. Here, you'll 
hear how loud a human can scream when they want to scream." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, LaBahn's "classic alcoholic" -- the blond man who might otherwise 
end up in one of the proposed sobering-up centers, tries to sleep in the male 
detoxification cell. It is a long rectangular room with a stainless steel 
toilet at one end, and the man continues to huddle in one corner. LaBahn peers 
through the large window. 
</P>
<P>
"He's cold, poor guy," he says. "But keeping it cooler in here seems to calm 
them down. This is home for your standard drunk." 
</P>
<P>
This particular drunk, however, needed no calming. Found lying in the bushes 
near an apartment complex about 11 p.m., he had smiled wanly as he stood in the 
tiny booking cell and extended his hand through a small slit to have an 
identifying plastic band clipped to his wrist. Standard questions are asked by 
officers who have done this hundreds of times before. The questions are quick 
and sharp, the answers slow and slurred. 
</P>
<P>
"You a street person?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, for the last couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
"Where's your gear?" 
</P>
<P>
"Lost." 
</P>
<P>
"Forget where you put it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that's pretty much the case." 
</P>
<P>
"Any problems with the DTs?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"Ever been here before?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. Where is here?" 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, he has been there before. A quick computer check reveals that he 
was arrested for violating section 647f in Anaheim twice in 1988. He has 
several convictions for driving under the influence and has had his license 
revoked with the provision he complete an alcohol rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
He is 37, "but his street life age is much older than that," LaBahn said. 
"That's alcohol abuse." 
</P>
<P>
The man's original booking number -- the number assigned for his first offense 
in Anaheim -- shows up during the computer check. 
</P>
<P>
"It's these guys with old, old booking numbers for drunk in public, these guys 
I would envision a detox center would be ideal for," LaBahn said. "It would 
give us someplace to put the true alcoholic." 
</P>
<P>
But chronic alcoholics are not the jail's exclusive customers. Sometimes, 
LaBahn said, a rare bender will land a business-suited man in the drunk tank 
alongside a handful of transients. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, LaBahn said, such prisoners "want us to treat them differently, but 
we won't. Most of them pace when you put them in the drunk tank. They're out of 
their element. It's very uncomfortable for them. Street people will just say 
OK, but for the professional person it can be traumatizing. In a free society, 
when you take away somebody's freedom, it can be dehumanizing. But alcohol 
knows no race, no sex, no social order." 
</P>
<P>
They arrive sporadically throughout the night: The man with the wind-beaten 
face who looks 60 but is probably 40, who stands in the middle of the drunk 
tank while others lie snoring around him and stares malevolently out the window 
into the empty corridor; the young man in camouflage pants with amphetamines in 
his pocket and alcohol on his breath who punched a box boy at a grocery store; 
the man sleeping on his stomach, arms tucked beneath him, across the floor from 
the blond man who continues to rock back and forth in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
A man who could be 55 is picked up lying on the sidewalk at a busy 
intersection. He shuffles down the corridor toward the booking cell, eyes 
liquid, mumbling. Once in the cell, he immediately moves to one corner and 
stands with his face against the wall. The booking officers clean out his 
pockets and steer him toward the drunk tank a few feet away. His legs buckle 
under him, and they must drag him into the cell and roll him onto his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"Night-night," says one of the officers. The man looks up and smiles comically. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you," he lisps. 
</P>
<P>
He does not hear the woman only steps away in Safety Cell 9 as her howling 
reaches another chilling crescendo. She has screamed, almost continually, for 
90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
How long will it go on? LaBahn answers wearily. 
</P>
<P>
"Until she tires herself out."

POSITIVE STORIES OF COMPTON LACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Compton receives high priority from the press on negative and 
superficial issues. However, it's very disturbing as a subscriber to the L.A. 
Times that you fail to print meaningful activities that are taking place in the 
community and certainly are of interest to its citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been vigorously working toward its renaissance, but there is 
clearly a lack of information reflecting these positive steps in your paper. 
Scrutiny is welcome, but fairness should not have to be insisted. For example, 
in July, 1990, the city had its grand opening for the Compton Transit Center in 
conjunction with the Metro Light Rail, and coverage for the multimillion-dollar 
inter-modal project was absent while thunder was present for the light rail 
coverage. On Nov. 19, K mart opened its doors in the Compton Renaissance Plaza 
and has broken sales records since its opening. Once again, no press coverage. 
</P>
<P>
It is baffling that coverage is available for other communities for those types 
of success stories but appears unavailable for Compton. Is that responsible 
journalism or does the L.A. Times subscribe to facilitating the repressive 
state of thought by others by under-representing the activities and 
achievements of this growing community? Your subscribers are entitled to that 
information.

DOWNEY TO PUT ITS PRIDE ON PARADE IN PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
TOURNAMENT OF ROSES: VOLUNTEERS -- NOT CORPORATION OR GOVERNMENT -- MAKE FLOAT 
FOR NEW YEAR'S DAY. 
</P>

DOWNEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kelley Roberts, a 21-year-old Downey resident, spent a recent afternoon working 
on a small papier-mache dinosaur that will slide along the tail of its towering 
mother on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kelsey, 21, spoke about piloting a float down the streets of Pasadena 
his first time as a driver. "This thing's a pain in the butt to parallel park," 
the Bellflower resident joked. 
</P>
<P>
The young men are among scores of volunteers who work each year to bring Downey 
to the world's attention for a fleeting moment, when network television cameras 
focus on the community's float during the Tournament of Roses Parade. 
</P>
<P>
This year's entry, called "Fun 'n' Play in Ol' L.A.," features dinosaurs that 
roamed millions of years ago near what is now Wilshire Boulevard and La Brea 
Avenue in Los Angeles. The mother brontosaurus will lift and move her head and 
tail, and a baby dinosaur will slide up and down the tail. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people worldwide at least once a year know Downey is on the map," 
said longtime volunteer Doris Patterson, spokeswoman for the nonprofit Downey 
Rose Float Assn. "It's prestigious." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a city tradition. The first float was entered in 1920, long before 
Downey became a city. The next entry didn't come until 1955, the year before 
Downey incorporated. Patterson figures that city founders, in part, resurrected 
the float project to help whip up support for cityhood. There has been a Downey 
float in the Rose Parade ever since. 
</P>
<P>
City workers used to build the frame of the float, and association volunteers 
handled the decorating, said Cel Kimberly, who has helped build the floats for 
the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
But after the passage of the tax-slashing Proposition 13 in 1978, city 
officials decided they couldn't afford to pay workers to build floats. The 
Downey Rose Float Assn. picked up the slack by raising more money and 
recruiting more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey float is now a member of a nearly extinct species. In a parade of 
corporate floats that cost as much as $200,000, the Downey entry is one of just 
six floats that are built entirely by volunteers, a Rose Parade official said. 
"It's a tradition that the tournament likes to hang on to," said Rose Parade 
spokeswoman Kristin Tranquada. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is the only other city in the Southeast area that will have a float 
in the parade. But the city pays for the float, which is professionally built. 
The city will spend $95,000 on the float this year, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Downey float rambles down Pasadena's Colorado Boulevard, more 
than 200 volunteers will have pitched in, from welding the metal skeleton and 
installing the hydraulic lifts to affixing thousands of roses, mums, 
carnations, orchids and other flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The association chooses a float design through an annual contest. This year, 
there were about 50 entries suggesting characters ranging from bears to alley 
cats, Patterson said. The chief builder is Roy Long, a longtime Downey resident 
and steam fitter at the county's Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center. The rest of 
the volunteers are adults and students from Downey and surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
Long says he has been putting in 15 to 20 hours a week since last May -- "to 
give something back to the community. It's just a labor of love." Roberts and 
Kelsey say they volunteered because it's just plain fun -- and they might meet 
a pretty girl or two amid the roses. 
</P>
<P>
The materials for the float cost the association about $50,000, which was 
raised through numerous community fund-raisers during the past year. The city 
of Downey provided a $1,000 grant to the float association. 
</P>
<P>
Association members prefer to raise money for materials and build the float 
themselves, rather than having the city or a corporate sponsor foot the bill or 
do most of the work. 
</P>
<P>
"Pride is taken away when things are done for you," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers also have countless memories, some of harried and poignant 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
A welder's torch sparked a fire that devoured the grass mane of a unicorn on 
the 1984 entry. The fire broke out on the eve of the parade, after the flower 
markets had closed, Kimberly recalled. Association members scoured planted 
areas along local freeways and gathered the pampas grass they needed to replace 
the mane. 
</P>
<P>
"Some police officers came by and asked what they were doing," Kimberly said. 
"When they found out it was for the float, they said 'Go ahead.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the 1987 entry, which featured an animated replica of the space 
shuttle. It was a natural because the shuttle is the most famous product to 
come out of Downey. Rockwell International, the shuttle's primary builder, has 
operated a plant in Downey for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Association officials settled on the float design in late January, 1986. A few 
days later, on Jan. 28, the space shuttle Challenger exploded, killing seven 
astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Parade officials questioned whether the entry should be dropped, said 
Kimberly, who was the association's president at the time. "It was a strange 
fluke," Kimberly said. "Our intention was not to play it up (the shuttle 
disaster) but to salute the space program." 
</P>
<P>
The float proceeded as planned and won the Founders' Trophy -- "Most beautiful 
entry built and decorated by volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
Work on this year's float has moved along smoothly so far, Patterson said. 
Volunteers planned to begin applying the flowers Thursday at the warehouse. At 
about 6 p.m. on New Years Eve, the float will be towed along surface streets to 
Pasadena. A local motorcycle club will provide escort for the trip, which could 
take as long as five hours, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
And the association will start preparing for the next float in late January. 
</P>
<P>
But the volunteers face an additional challenge in 1991 -- finding a new home 
for their float. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the float has been stored in a warehouse at the county's 
Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center on Downey's western border. Association 
officials have been given notice that the warehouse will be demolished next 
summer to make way for a business park. 
</P>
<P>
So far, association officials have raised about $40,000 of the $200,000 they 
need to build a new hangar on city property. They are determined that the show 
must go on. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a way of life," Patterson said.

The Queen Mary and Spruce Goose Entertainment Center will host what it claims 
to be the largest New Year's Eve party on the West Coast. "Rock Around the 
Dock" will ring in 1991 with four separate dance parties. 
</P>
<P>
A rock 'n' roll party under the Spruce Goose dome will feature the Bus Boys, 
whose credits include "The Boys Are Back in Town" from the movie "48 Hours," 
and a selection from the soundtrack album of Ghostbusters, "Cleaning Up the 
Town." 
</P>
<P>
The dome also will feature the Untouchables, whose dance beat combines ska, 
soul, rap and reggae. Separating the two dome parties will be a Wall of Videos, 
a high-tech, multi-image video display hosted by disc jockey Jimmy K. 
</P>
<P>
Latin music sensation Poncho Sanchez will perform with his conga drums in the 
Queen Mary Exhibit Hall, and the H.O.U.S.E. featuring Cliff Curtis will 
re-create sounds of the 1960s in the Britannia Salon. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping with the Queen Mary's theme "Voyage to 1939," the Billy May Orchestra, 
directed by Kim Richmond, will relive the Queen Mary heyday with big band 
sounds in the Queen's Salon. 
</P>
<P>
Guests will receive party favors and will be treated to a fireworks display. 
They also will have a chance to win a 1939 Nash Lafayette four-door automobile, 
valued at $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for "Rock Around the Dock" are $39 per person for access to all four 
dance parties. Food and beverage are available at additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Rock Around the Dock," the Queen Mary will offer a New Year's

Thanks, NBC, for "The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story" (Dec. 10). 
</P>
<P>
We felt this rich, moving, quality production was TV at its best-the caliber of 
a Hallmark Hall of Fame program. (John) Ritter's performance was excellent. My 
wife still has a lump in her throat.

As one of the many thousands of hearing-impaired people who are totally 
dependent on closed captioned TV for "hearing" programs, may I offer my 
congratulations to the broadcasters who offer "Arsenio Hall" (KCOP, weeknights) 
as captioned. Also to the TNT Network, which is captioning its new movies. It 
is such a pleasure to be able to participate in watching and understanding what 
is happening.

I would like to comment on Diane Villasana's response (TV Times, Dec. 9) to 
NBC's showing of "The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the show shouldn't have been aired because people were already 
worrying about tensions in the Persian Gulf. The movie's purpose wasn't to 
scare, but to inform. The movie didn't scare me or my friends. Instead it 
helped us better prepare for the big earthquake.

COLUMBO PRO AND CON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Columbo" has an unquestionably winsome main character, to which Peter Falk 
still contributes his unquestionably charismatic star. Also unquestionably, the 
series' plots are so contrived you wonder about Columbo's true sleuthing 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Columbo is always aided in his investigating by an army of imbecilic murderers 
who ignore, inadvertently drop or otherwise flaunt evidence of their doings 
throughout each show (case in point, "Columbo Goes to College," ABC, Dec. 9). 
Considering the extraordinary amount of planning that goes into the murders, 
the ensuing stupidity of the perpetrators is simply perplexing. Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
Columbo is hailed by it creators and the press as one of the world's great 
detectives (he even gets the TV Times cover). The truth is, the series is just 
another average attempt by television to make its audience feel superior to the 
characters in a show. Given questionable cleverness of both killers and 
detective, figure out what they're implying about the audience.

THIS STUNT MAN IS HIS OWN FALL GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a dream vacation vehicle. Everyone dreams of having a beautiful car and a 
beautiful boat. Well, this combines the two. It cruises at 90 mph on land and 
goes 60 knots in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Super Dave Osborne patiently explained to the camera the benefits of his 
amphibious boat-car. Then the daredevil stuntman, gleaming in his patriotic 
star-spangled jump suit and crash helmet, climbed to the captain's deck of the 
modified, twin-fin Cadillac for a demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Belting out Bobby Darin's "Beyond the Sea," Super Dave drove the car to the 
boat launch. But at the last minute, the confounded stuntman realized he had 
taken a wrong turn, and seconds later he and his boat-car crashed off the 
pier's end and plunged to the bottom of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Thus came the payoff for another episode of the cult cable show "Super Dave." 
The half-hour variety begins its new season Saturday night on Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully planned stunts that always backfire have become the sure-fire gimmick 
of "Super Dave," which also features such guest performers as Ray Charles, 
Glenn Campbell, Kenny Rogers and Carol Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of each episode, the Super One usually signs off from a prostrate 
position, his bones broken or his body smashed, always the result of a 
hopelessly complicated stunt gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
In the first episode, to celebrate the opening of Super Dave's new fast-food, 
health-food restaurant, the enterprising stuntman plans to jump 43 
refrigerators loaded with bad meat. 
</P>
<P>
"The moment I come on camera to open the show, you know I'm a dead man," said 
Bob Einstein, 48, the man inside the Super Dave jumpsuit. He sat in his 
dressing-room trailer, having just finished taping the boat-car scene at a pier 
in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives a certain, you know, edge to the show. You're not going to turn it 
off because you know I'm gonna get it." 
</P>
<P>
Standing an imposing 6-foot-4 with a voice that grates like a steel millstone, 
Einstein looks like a real stuntman. And his humor-perhaps influenced by his 
brother, comedian Albert Brooks, and his father, radio comic Harry 
"Parkyakarkus" Einstein-is so dry that one could sit through the entire show 
and not realize he's a fake. Until the end. 
</P>
<P>
In one episode next season, Super Dave takes a 200-foot bungee jump but 
somebody forgets to secure the bungee cord to the bridge. With Super Dave 
sprawled on the rocks below, his faithful assistant Fuji bungees down an 
ambulance- which lands right on top of its injured victim. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what's hysterically funny is a guy who sets himself up as the most 
confident, everything's-perfect, know-it-all, things-are-swell human being and 
then gets wiped out every time," Einstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Dave character first showed up in 1976 on the NBC variety show "Van 
Dyke and Company." Einstein and his longtime partner Allan Blye, who won an 
Emmy for producing the series, wrote a skit about a self-righteous stuntman. 
</P>
<P>
"The character was something we both created as an idea for a piece, based on 
the arrogance of the (stunt) guys who do all that stuff," said Blye, who 
previously worked with Einstein on "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour," where 
Einstein played Officer Judy. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Super Dave saw light briefly on ABC in the variety show "Redd 
Foxx." That's when Einstein added to his routine former USC sportscaster Mike 
Walden, in his loud, clashing sport suits, to conduct post-stunt interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a stunt where I was gonna do something in a car that had never been 
done before," Einstein said. "I'm revving up the engine, and Mike's wishing me 
luck and everything. Then he backs away and a giant steel claw comes in, grabs 
the car, puts it in a car crusher and crushes it. The car comes out in a cube 
and Mike rushes over and interviews me inside the cube." 
</P>
<P>
Super Dave found a home on the Showtime comedy series "Bizarre" (1979-85), 
produced by Einstein and Blye, the first made-for-cable TV series. The spinoff 
"Super Dave" was first shown in 1987 and has been building a cult audience ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
In all of Super Dave's stunts, most of which involve an obvious dummy double, 
there was only one close call. Einstein explained the bit: "I wanted to 
humanize bullfights. I don't like to see animals get hurt. So we tied horns on 
a 40-foot, fast-track tank and I was driving a mini-Cooper (automobile) with 
its top cut off. 
</P>
<P>
"I taunted the tank driver, TIt's not funny enough! You have to get closer!U So 
on the next pass, my car stalled and the tank ran over the back of the car. 
From the camera angle, it looked like I was really dead. My partner, Allan, ran 
to my side faster than Ben Johnson on steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Einstein was fine, and the finished shot stayed in the episode. 
</P>
<P>
Super Dave pulled off his greatest feat to date in October. The idiot stuntman 
joined the ranks of Bo Jackson, Michael Jordan and Andre Agassi as the star of 
a Nike TV-commercial campaign. In one spot, featuring the Super Dave Slam Dunk 
Catapult, Einstein shattered a glass basketball backboard-with his face. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we're on pay cable with fewer viewers, the recognition factor is still 
growing," said Einstein, who is writing a "Super Dave" movie with Blye for 
Columbia Pictures. "Four years ago we had only a cult following. Now, more and 
more people are buying into this fictitious character. And I am real." 
</P>
<P>
"Super Dave" premieres Saturday 11-11:30 p.m. on Showtime, with repeats Jan. 10 
at 10:35 p.m., Jan. 15 at 12:30 a.m. and Jan. 18 at 7:35 p.m.

TNN BRINGS THE COUNTRY INDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Nashville Network is not MTV for country-music fans. TNN's mission is to be 
broader than MTV-to be the source in country music, entertainment and 
information and provide programs that reflect a country lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
For all you city slickers, country music is "taking a big breath of fresh Rocky 
Mountain air and fishing along the stream," said C. Paul Corbin, TNN director 
of programming. "If you listen to the music and lyrics in country music you 
will find pretty well what a country lifestyle is. We want to make sure our 
programs are not the same that are available on the other networks." 
</P>
<P>
While MTV's schedule still mainly consists of videos, TNN has 39 series, 
including flagship show "Nashville Now," a live weeknight music-talk program 
hosted by Ralph Emery and a puppet named Shotgun Red. The show is celebrating 
its seventh anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Other series include: "Grand Ole Opry Live"; "A Conversation with Dinah," a 
talk show hosted by Dinah Shore; "VideoPM," a three-hour weeknight music video 
show; the how-to series "Backyard America"; "Cookin' U.S.A."; "Country Kitchen" 
with Florence Henderson; and a celebrity interview series, "Crook and Chase." 
</P>
<P>
Sports fanatics can catch more than 18 hours of auto racing, rodeos and fishing 
and hunting programs on Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to potential criticism from animal-rights activists, TNN general 
manager David Hall insists no animals are killed on-screen on the "The 
Outdoorsmen" and "Celebrity Outdoors" hunting series. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't kill Bambi," Hall said. "We show the technique and theory (of 
hunting). I have a real thing about that. If they are on a hunting expedition 
and they kill a great elk, it's already (happened) by the time the camera gets 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Based on viewers' reaction, Hall said, "You can kill all the fish you want, but 
you can't kill Bambi." 
</P>
<P>
TNN is a division of Opryland U.S.A. Inc. of Nashville. The network began seven 
years ago as an 18-hour-a-day ad-supported cable service. 
</P>
<P>
"We own the Grand Ole Opry," Hall said. "Long before MTV, we had a good feeling 
for the loyalty and size of the country music audience and fans. We thought 
there was a large enough audience to support a cable TV network." 
</P>
<P>
TNN kicked off with a five-hour live music show from seven cities and came back 
the next morning with a game show, a sitcom, a concert music series and a live 
talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, TNN provides 3,600 hours of original programming, including more 
than 1,100 live hours. 
</P>
<P>
"People love live television," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anyone who does a live variety show every month," Corbin said . " 
'Nashville Now' is a phenomenal program. Our country artists can come and sing 
and Grandma and the kids can watch it without being embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
To get a large viewer base, TNN was originally offered to cable systems for 
free for the first three years and was broadcast to 7 million households. Today 
TNN is the sixth-largest basic system with a subscriber base of 52 million 
households; it's in more than 210 markets and in every state. According to 
Hall, the network is turning a profit. 
</P>
<P>
TNN viewers generally are 25 or older, Corbin said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a youngster, you may reject country music and go to rock music," he said, 
"but in your late teens and early 20s, you take a look at life and your goals 
and your objectives and then all of a sudden, country music means something to 
you. After you reach the age of 25, you are back into country, and it speaks to 
day to day emotions and frankly it deals with life and the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
TNN, he said, has helped boost the popularity of country music. 
</P>
<P>
"Country record sales are just soaring," he said. "This year there were 33 
country albums which have been certified gold, platinum or multiplatinum. 
Particularly with new artists they are succeeding because they get exposure on 
TNN." 
</P>
<P>
"I look on TNN very positively," said Gene Bridges, program director for Los 
Angeles country station KLAC-AM (540). "I don't sit and watch record sales, but 
probably record sales have improved by exposure on TNN. I personally see it as 
a country music partner, helping us spread our message about country music. 
It's my perception that country music is being accepted rapidly all over the 
world, particularly in the United States, and I think that TNN has helped do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
TNN tries to be a homespun cable service. "We really are very much in tune with 
our audience," Corbin said. "We really care about phone calls and letters. We 
respond to each and every letter. Sometimes they write back and we become pen 
pals. It is our way of doing things. We respect this audience and really admire 
them for their involvement."

British broadcast journalist David Frost is back in America and PBS has him. On 
Wednesday, the Emmy Award-winner kicks off his new series "....Talking with 
David Frost" with an in-depth interview with President Bush and his wife, 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"....Talking With David Frost" will consist of six monthly specials. Subsequent 
interview subjects include former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. and 
actor/comedian Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Frost first came to the attention of American audiences more than 25 years ago 
as host of the satirical NBC series "That Was the Week That Was." His 
syndicated talk show "The David Frost Show" won two Emmy Awards in the early 
1970s. He has interviewed such world figures as former President Richard Nixon, 
Robert F. Kennedy, the Shah of Iran, Prince Charles and King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently he hosted the syndicated series "The Next President," in which he 
interviewed candidates for the 1988 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, in good spirits despite suffering from a bad cold, talked with Susan 
King about his new series via phone from his office in London. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It's great to have you back on American television. 
</P>
<P>
It's very, very exciting. It's what I want to be doing. The long form or the 
hourlong interview does seem to be something of an endangered species, and it's 
a terrific opportunity because a PBS hour is a real hour-or at least 57 
1/2-minutes-which is longer than a commercial hour. 
</P>
<P>
That does give you the emotional elbowroom to try and just draw people out. The 
thing that always fascinates me, of course, is you want to make news when you 
can and make sense all of the time, but the thing that fascinates me is what 
makes people tick. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you tape several hours with a subject and then edit it down to an hour? 
</P>
<P>
I usually think if you can do two hours basically to produce a one-hour 
program, that is pretty good. Of course, you can do more, but in general I 
think it's good to do a lot of your editing before you do the interview rather 
than afterward. Obviously, in certain circumstances, if you are dealing with 
someone who is shy and doesn't give interviews, you might want to let the tape 
roll a bit longer. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are your interviewing techniques? 
</P>
<P>
I think you can't know too much about anybody. One of the things you want to do 
is to know what they have said before, so you know when they are saying 
something for the first time. And obviously, you want to find a new angle or 
facet of somebody as well. 
</P>
<P>
I take the view where you can't do too much homework. That doesn't mean that 
the emphasis on the ad-lib moment isn't vital, but I think the more preparation 
you do the more liberated you are to wing it. You know whatever the guy or girl 
goes off into, the more you know about the subject, the easier it is to go with 
it. I think what makes an interview work is that you turn it into a 
conversation and a dialogue and that depends on eye contact and just sort of 
rapport. 
</P>
<P>
Then you are asking questions that interest the person you are talking to 
enough to want to make them want to give as good an answer as possible. That 
gets them absorbed in the conversation, so they forget the artificiality of 
having lights in the room or whatever it is. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You are opening the series with an interview with George and Barbara Bush. 
Are politicians more reticent to talk than actors? 
</P>
<P>
One of the interesting things that President Bush shares with Margaret Thatcher 
is that they do give a straight answer to a question. It is very refreshing 
because there are many politicians who play safe. The most fearless thing they 
will do is come out against road accidents or attack litter. Ask them their 
favorite color and they will say plaid. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons why Bush does that is that he is so well-briefed, that he is 
up to speed on anything that you throw to him. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing about President Bush and Barbara Bush is their sense of humor, 
which irrigates an interview very well. We have done three interviews. Right at 
the beginning of the campaign in 1987 and then on the eve of the election in 
November, 1988, and then his first interview as President in September, 1989. 
So this will be the fourth one. Often, you find when you have more than one 
interview, a relationship develops and you can get into the deeper subjects in 
a relaxed way all the quicker. 
</P>
<P>
Q. There are a plethora of talk shows on American TV and many are 
sensationalized. Are you dismayed as to what has happened to talk shows? 
</P>
<P>
I think fads and fashions come and go. I think that the sensationalized chat 
show is a phase that won't last very long. 
</P>
<P>
We have one or two newspapers here which are a bit like that, where people are 
meeting Adolf Hitler or find Elvis Presley working as a garage mechanic. But we 
haven't had a lot of that on TV. 
</P>
<P>
I do two or three shows here. Every Sunday I do "Frost on Sunday." Brilliant 
title, isn't it? Very original. It took months to work that one out. That's 
with the leading newsmakers of the week. 
</P>
<P>
That is an interview program because there is no audience. And then I do a 
lighthearted panel game show 13 weeks a year, called "Through the Keyhole." And 
then I do satellite specials. 
</P>
<P>
I love diversity and variety, and in this new series "...Talking with David 
Frost" we are going to try and have that diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"....Talking With David Frost" premieres Wednesday at 8 p.m. on KCET; 9 p.m. on 
KOCE. The program will be simulcast on National Public Radio.
