  [Text] Inkatha Freedom party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
said millions of King Zwelithini's followers will not take part 
in the elections unless demands for a Zulu kingdom are met. Dr. 
Buthelezi and King Goodwill today held talks in Ulundi with 
Minister of Home Affairs Danie Schutte. 
  [Begin recording] [Schutte, in English] From our side I can 
just say that the government is committed to an honorable 
recognition for the position of the Zulu king and kingdom in the 
new constitutional dispensation. There are restrictions and 
limitations but we are committed to that, and we will do 
everything in our power to try and bring that about. 
  [Buthelezi, in English] We don't think that it's a matter 
that's impossible to resolve as such because kingdoms exist in 
Africa. There was a kingdom in Uganda -- I think there are four 
kingdoms in Uganda, including the most (?northern) part of 
Uganda. Kingdoms have been accommodated in the colonialization 
period in Africa. [end recording]

  [Text] The summit of Central African heads of state on the 
consequences of the devaluation of the CFA franc has just 
completed its deliberations in Libreville, Gabon. Here is an 
excerpt of the communique issued at the end the deliberations. 
It is read by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui: 
  [Begin recording] Concerning the consequences of the 
devaluation of the CFA franc, the heads of state noted that 
prices skyrocketed and this resulted in a substantial fall in 
purchasing power, as was predicted. They examined the backup 
measures taken for three different purposes. The measures were 
implemented through the Bank of Central African States, BEAC, to 
check rising inflation; the states in the subregion to minimize 
increases in prices of essential commodities; and through 
international financial institutions, including the IMF, with 
whom letters of intent were signed to ensure an influx of funds 
needed to reestablish financial balances and relaunch economic 
activities in our countries. 
  Analyzing the effects of the monetary adjustment on the 
BEAC's balance-sheet, the heads of state noted the negative 
effects that the new exchange rate has had on their transaction 
accounts, all of which are now in debt. They therefore stressed 
the need to rapidly offset this loss. [end recording] 
  This summit, which has just ended in Libreville, began 24 
hours before the meeting of African finance ministers, which 
will examine a very important issue: problems related to the 
financing of development in Africa. This meeting, which is 
their fifth one, is held every two years.

  [Excerpt] Libreville, 28 Feb (AFP) -- The heads of state of 
six Central African countries, meeting on 28 February in 
Libreville at a summit that focused on the impact of the 
devaluation of the CFA franc, asked Gabonese President Omar 
Bongo to mediate between Cameroon and Nigeria, currently at odds 
in a border conflict. 
  According to the final communique read after the session, 
which lasted several hours, by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul 
Toungui, participants "expressed deep concern over the tension 
prevailing along the border between the two sisterly republics 
of Cameroon and Nigeria." 
  "They expressed their wish that the current negotiations 
will 
yield satisfactory results as soon as possible through dialogue 
and that a speedy solution will be found so as to preserve peace 
and African unity," the communique continued. "Thus, in light 
of his experience, they have asked their colleague, President 
Omar Bongo of Gabon, to undertake a mediation mission between 
the two countries." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 28 Feb (MENA)--Ambassadors of the 
countries participating in the central apparatus for the 
mechanism of settling disputes in Africa today discussed the 
implementation of the resolutions passed by the apparatus since 
its establishment at the OAU summit held in Cairo last year. 
  Majdi Hifni, Egypt's ambassador to Ethiopia, chaired the 
meeting because Egypt is the current OAU chairman. Ambassador 
Hifni said that the ambassadors discussed aspects of the 
mechanism's work in light of the resolutions passed at the 
summit meeting of the central apparatus, chaired by President 
Mubarak in Cairo last December. 
  Ambassador Hifni told a MENA correspondent in Addis Ababa 
that discussions during the meeting also dealt with the 
mechanism's functions and the creation of an OAU peace fund. 
  The Egyptian ambassador said that the conferees agreed that 
a 
plan should be drawn up to finance the mechanism. Such a plan, 
they agreed, will be formulated by a working team from the OAU 
General Secretariat and African countries, with the aim of 
raising donations from companies, African institutes, and 
non-government organizations. 
  The budget plans, Hifni added, will be submitted to the 
ministerial meeting of the mechanism, which will meet in Addis 
Ababa in March under the chairmanship of Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa. 
  The ambassadors also discussed the formulation of a general 
legal framework governing the participation of OAU member 
countries in peacekeeping operations in the continent. The 
ambassadors discussed a report by the OAU secretary general's 
special envoy to Burundi and reviewed the conflicts in Somalia, 
Liberia, and Angola, Hifni noted.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 28 Feb (PANA) -- Somali faction leader, 
General Mohamed Farah Aidid, Monday [28 February] in Addis 
Ababa, held a 30-minute discussion with the OAU assistant 
secretary general in charge of political affairs, Tobias 
Muparanga, on the situation in war-torn Somalia. "He briefed me 
on the efforts he has been making with other Somali factions 
towards resolving the Somali crisis", Muparanga told PANA after 
the meeting in an Addis Ababa hotel. 
  Aidid arrived in the Ethiopian capital on Sunday from 
Eritrea 
where he briefed the Eritrean leader, Isayas Afewerki on efforts 
by his Somali National Alliance (SNA) to end the impasse in 
Somalia, which has not had a central government since the fall 
of President Mohamed Siad Barre in January, 1991. Since the 
failed Somali informal political consultations in Addis Ababa in 
December 1993, Aidid has been staying in Nairobi, Kenya, where 
he has met several Somali factions and briefed Kenyan President 
Daniel arap Moi on the outcome of the Addis Ababa consultations. 
He also travelled to Uganda to brief President Yoweri Museveni. 
According to the OAU official, Aidid will also visit Tanzania 
in efforts to brief the leaders of the sub-region on the future 
of Somalia when American troops withdraw and the destruction of 
the country's infrastructure. 
  Muparanga led an OAU fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in 
November 1993 where he met Somali faction leaders as well as 
civic leaders and discussed with them efforts by the continental 
body to end the Somali crisis. 
  Since the United Nations Security Council lifted the hunt 
for 
Aidid, for alleged killing of Pakistani peacekeepers serving 
with the UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) in June, blamed on his 
supporters, he has been on a diplomatic offensive to drum up 
support from the leaders of the region for a future government 
in Somalia in which he is to play a leading role. 
  Aidid's aide said he is expected to meet the Ethiopian 
president, Meles Zenawi, Tuesday before returning to Nairobi to 
continue with further consultations with the Somali factions. 
  President Meles was mandated by the 1993 June summit of the 
OAU in Cairo to resolve the Somali crisis on behalf of the 
African leaders. American troops and those from other Western 
nations are due to withdraw from the war-torn east African 
country by the end of March.

  [Text] Yaounde, 28 Feb (CAMNEWS/PANA) -- A French military 
contingent landed on Sunday [27 February] at an air base in 
Yaounde on a mission connected with the current border dispute 
between Nigeria and Cameroon over the 1000 square kilometre 
Bakassi Peninsula, believed to be rich in oil. 
  The CAMEROON NEWS AGENCY (CAMNEWS) reported in a dispatch to 
PANA Monday that the arrival of the French soldiers and 
diplomats was prompted by what it termed as "the illegal 
occupation" of parts of the Bakassi Peninsula in southwestern 
Cameroon. CAMNEWS did not give the number of French soldiers 
who arrived. The agency said that the French mission is in 
Cameroon "to evaluate the situation created by the invasion of 
Bakassi by troops of the Nigerian Army and the agression of 
Cameroonian soldiers on their territory". 
  CAMNEWS said that there were clashes between Cameroonian and 
Nigerian troops on 18 and 19 February around the fishing zone 
around Kumbo and Janea. The agency claimed that Nigeria's green 
and white flag has been flying in Jabana and Diamond areas since 
3 January 1994. The Cameroonian agency quoted Radio Kano of 
Nigeria which reportedly said that in three assaults, Nigeria 
lost 30 soldiers while one Cameronian soldier was killed and two 
others injured. 
  A journalist from the national Cameroonian daily, CAMEROON 
TRIBUNE, who accompanied the country's minister of state in the 
president's office, Edouard Akame Mfoumou, on a visit to the 
area wrote that: "Troops from the two armies have occupied the 
fishing zones which have been transformed into combat areas and 
are only 100 metres away from each other in the Diamond and 
Ibabato area". 
  CAMNEWS wrote that the French troops arrived around the same 
time as a French delegation of French diplomats from the French 
president's office and Foreign Ministry. Among those in the 
French diplomatic team is the special chief of staff of 
President Francois Mitterrand. The diplomats are also expected 
to visit Abuja, Nigeria's federal capital, on "reconciliation" 
the agency added. 
  France and Cameroon have a defence pact dating back from 
when 
the central African state became independent from France on 20 
May 1960.

  [Text] Yaounde, 28 Feb (AFP) -- Cameroonian President Paul 
Biya late this morning received a high-ranking French delegation 
led by General Christian Quesnot, special chief of staff of 
French President Francois Mitterrand, official sources in 
Yaounde said. The arrival of this delegation comes in the wake 
of tension between Cameroon and Nigeria in the border region of 
the Bakassi peninsula. According to the national radio, no 
statement was made after this meeting, and contents of 
discussions was not made public. 
  The French delegation was composed of Bruno Delaye, 
diplomatic adviser of President Mitterrand; Jean-Marc Rochereau 
de la Sabliere, director of African and Malagasy Affairs at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The delegation was accompanied by 
the French ambassador in Yaounde, Mr. Gilles Vidal, and another 
French military officer, Colonel Rentegeat, the radio added 
without specifying the function of this officer. 
  Well-informed Cameroonian official sources were pointing out 
this morning that the delegation hoped to go to Abuja, the 
Nigerian federal capital, immediately after the audience with 
President Biya to meet the Nigerian head of state, General Sani 
Abacha. A French military detachment of about 30 soldiers also 
arrived in Yaounde yesterday from their base at Bouar in Central 
African Republic. The detachment is charged with an 
"exploratory mission on the conflict situation at the borders," 
in accordance with the defense accord signed between France and 
Cameroon. 
  The French Foreign Ministry today pointed out that while 
sending a delegation to the two countries, France is also 
"undertaking an intensive diplomatic activity" at the OAU and 
the UN Security Council.

<F P=106> [Government communique on 25 February Council of Ministers </F>
meeting issued on 26 February in Bangui; read by Gerard Gaba, 
minister in charge of the general secretariat of the government 
and relations with parliament--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Begin Gaba recording] The Council of Ministers 
held a meeting on 25 February from 1000 to 1530 under the 
chairmanship of President Patasse. During the session, a few 
reports were heard and five draft decrees presented by the 
minister of interior and national security. [passage omitted] 
The government postponed the examination of the drafts until the 
next meeting when additional information will be provided. 
  Before rounding up the session, the government made the 
following clarification: For some time now, groups of 
demonstrators have decided to systematically sequester cabinet 
members and senior state officials and have been making 
(?threatening) statements. The government is aware of the 
miserable conditions in which the Central African people are 
living. It is a well-known fact that this situation was 
inherited from the defunct regime. 
  As everyone knows, the new government is consistently trying 
to gradually put an end to the pains inflicted by that regime 
and then to put the country back onto the path to development 
and social welfare. For this reason, the government maintains 
that it will not yield to any blackmail or any kind of threat. 
There are legal procedures that each citizen must follow to 
exercise his right to make demands, instead of resorting to 
anarchy. 
  The government once again pledges its openness to dialogue. 
It however reminds those who prefer violence and blackmail that 
Ordinance No. 81/027 of 22 May 1981, which punishes acts of 
violence and vandalism perpetrated by groups, is still in force.

  [Text] [Announcer] The guest on Afrique Midi today is the 
Chadian civil service minister. Following the ruling of the 
International Court of Justice in favour of Chad in the border 
dispute concerning the Aouzou Strip, Abdelkader Kamougue has 
just been to Tripoli to hand over a message from the Chadian 
president to Colonel al-Qadhdhafi. Libya has not said yet if it 
will abide by the ruling of the International Court. Ghislaine 
Dupont first asked Abdelkader Kamougue if the Libyan leader 
confirmed that his country would withdraw from the Aouzou Strip. 
  [Begin recording] [Kamougue] From what I could gather, 
Colonel al-Qadhdhafi seems to accept the ruling, insofar as he 
said that as far as this border dispute is concerned, the matter 
is now closed. What does he mean by a closed matter? He said 
that a page has now been turned and that the future should be 
considered in a different light. However, we have not noticed 
any offical sign through the radio or the press since he said 
that. Nevertheless we are not losing hope since, following our 
proposal, a meeting of foreign ministers will shortly take 
place, which will enable us to go into the matter more deeply. 
  [Dupont] Do you believe that this lack of official statement 
is, in a way, a bad omen? 
  [Kamougue] We could be tempted to say that. However, since 
dialogue between the two countries is continuing, since we 
maintain our links, since we have an embassy there, and since we 
believe that the Libyan foreign minister will come to N'djamena, 
we believe that there is room for hope. 
  [Dupont] Has Chad received any assurances yet that Libya 
will 
pull out from the Aouzou Strip? 
  [Kamougue] The ruling was given, and I believe that it is 
necessary for the two countries to get closer to consider the 
conditions under which Libya could return the strip and evacuate 
it. So the issue will start being addressed at the next meeting 
of foreign ministers. 
  [Dupont] Several Chadian officials, particularly diplomats 
in 
post in Tripoli, say that the Libyans have reinforced their 
military presence in the Aouzou Strip. 
  [Kamougue] During our meeting Colonel al-Qadhdhafi denied 
this reinforcement and gave us assurances that in fact their 
presence in the zone has been reduced. Like Saint Thomas, we 
can say that we must see before we believe, so we remain somehow 
confused by all this for the time being. 
  [Dupont] Will the Chadian Government set a deadline for the 
Libyan pullout from Aouzou? 
  [Kamougue] We believe that the enforcement of this ruling 
should take place in the shortest possible time. Regarding the 
setting of a deadline, I believe that it will be possible for 
both delegations to make proposals and to find a compromise 
concerning the agenda of this pullout. 
  [Dupont] If the Libyans were to procrastinate, what could 
the 
Chadian authorities do? 
  [Kamougue] For our part, we have been choosing peace and 
justice since the 1989 Algiers agreement, and we will continue 
in that direction. We do not intend to embark on any violent 
action against Libya, we believe that the UN system should help 
us obtain the evacuation of this territory which has become 
Chadian. 
  [Dupont] Mr. Kamougue, Chadian nationals living and working 
in Libya have been rounded up in the past weeks, have you 
discussed this issue with Colonel al-Qadhdhafi? 
  [Kamougue] It goes without saying that we discussed this 
issue during our meeting, and Colonel al-Qadhdhafi allowed us to 
visit our fellow countrymen who were detained in the (Zanzur) 
camp. These Chadians were rounded up over a question of 
residence documents which they allegedly did not possess. A 
total of 365 Chadians have been rounded up, 165 of them in 
Tripoli itself, and the others shared between Sabha and Benghazi. 
  [Dupont] A communique from the Chad president's office 
implies that the aim of these Chadians was to reactivate groups 
hostile to the authorities in Chad. 
  [Kamougue] All theories are possible. That is one. But we 
hope that as far as the national question is concerned, the 
Chadians opposed to the transitional government will not take up 
arms to contest the verdict of the International Court of 
Justice. I don't think these Chadians will fall into that trap.

  [Text] Libreville, 26 Feb (AFP) -- The Gabonese Democratic 
Party (PDG) asked the government to take court action today 
against those responsible for acts of violence which marked the 
start of a general strike action this week. 
  "The PDG calls on the government to restore order, guarantee 
the security of persons and property, and throw full light on 
the recent riots so that all the authors are made to answer 
before the law for their acts," stated the party's deputy 
secretary general and spokesman, Rene N'demezo Obiang at a news 
conference. According to him, "apart from soldiers and 
strangers, victims of the recent violence were essentially PDG 
activists and supporters." 
  The official casualty report on the four days' clashes 
between groups of demonstrators and security forces in several 
residential districts in Libreville and Oyem, the opposition 
stronghold in the north of the country, lists nine dead, 
including two soldiers; six seriously wounded; five persons 
kidnapped and later released; about 50 burned vehicles, and over 
a hundred shops and street stalls ransacked. 
  One of the victims is Jean Kamga-Komo, a local PDG official 
in Libreville. "The PDG wants the authors of the cowardly 
murder of our comrade to be identified and punished in 
accordance with the law," Mr. N'Demezo stressed. 
  The government has accused opposition parties, especially 
Father Paul Mba Abessole's National Lumberjacks Rally of 
"politically recuperating" and capitalizing on the general 
strike launched by the Gabonese Free Trade Unions Confederation 
to call for salary increases following the devaluation. 
  Defense Minister Martin-Fedele Magnaga said "certain 
opposition party leaders recruit, train, and arm militias" and 
have "overrun the capital with people that loot and go on the 
rampage." 
  Questioned on possible self-defense measures by supporters 
in 
the event of renewed disturbances, the PDG spokesman stressed 
that his party did not want "a kind of Lebanization of the 
country with "independent armed troops who take the law into 
their own hands." 
  The party's main position is to ask government to enforce 
law 
and order, he further stated, "but we cannot continue to leave 
our supporters to be sacrificed as victims...and if government 
does not do anything about the situation, we will have no other 
choice but to create private militias as in Lebanon. But we do 
not want it to come to that," the spokesman said.

  [Text] It is better late than never. After several hours 
of negotiations, political leaders of the five parties that form 
the current government have finally managed to make a 
breakthrough towards the establishment of the remaining 
transitional institutions. A marathon meeting interrupted by a 
brief pause at 1830 discussed the problem of the functioning of 
the government led by Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and the 
obstacles to the establishment of the national assembly and the 
transitional government extended to include the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF]. 
  Two meetings -- since there had to be two -- on 25 February 
and 27 February were led by President Juvenal Habyarimana in the 
presence of the two prime ministers, Agathe Uwilingiyimana and 
Faustin Twagiramungu. The meeting concluded with a communique 
whose contents are read to us by the principal secretary at the 
presidency of the Republic, Enoch Ruhigira. 
  [Begin recording] President Juvenal Habyarimana chaired 
meetings on 25 and 27 February, which brought together the 
political parties which form the current transitional 
government, namely the Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development, the Republican Democratic Movement 
[MDR], the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic 
Party, and the Liberal Party [PL]. 
  Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Prime 
Minister-Designate Faustin Twagiramungu participated in the two 
meetings, which studied the problem of the functioning of the 
current government led by Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana as well 
as the obstacles hampering the establishment of the transitional 
institutions. 
  Concerning the functioning of the current government, it was 
stated that so long as the transitional broad-based government 
has not been put in place, the current government must continue 
functioning through ministerial council meetings in order to 
tackle the challenges facing our country, particularly the 
problems relating to security and the problem of establishing 
transitional institutions. 
  In regard to obstacles to the establishment of the 
transitional institutions, the 27 February meeting reached the 
following conclusions in order to help come up with a solution 
enabling the MDR and PL parties to participate in the 
institutions: 
  Concerning the MDR, the list of deputies is that established 
on 5 January, with reservations concerning cases pending in 
court and the settlement that will ensue. 
  Concerning the ministers, [words indistinct] on the MDR 
side, 
will be entitled to two ministers chosen from a list to be 
presented to the prime minister-designate, while Prime 
Minister-Designate Faustin Twagiramungu will be entitled to one 
ministerial portfolio. 
  Concerning the PL party, the Mugenzi faction will nominate 
five deputies from its ranks, while the Ndasingwa faction will 
choose six. Concerning ministers, the Mugenzi faction will have 
two while the Ndasingwa faction will have one and will provide 
candidates for the post of transitional national assembly 
speaker. Landwald Ndasingwa expressed reservations about the 
(?proposal), notably on the distribution of ministries. 
  Any faction not satisfied by the above compromise will draw 
lessons from the conclusions reached and will assume liability. 
[sentence as heard] 
  The two PL factions will send the final lists of deputies to 
the president of the Republic and the prime minister by 1900 on 
28 February at the latest. 
  The prime minister-designate will present the list of 
ministerial candidates to the president of the Republic by 1200 
on 1 March. 
  The establishment of the transitional institutions will take 
place at a date to be jointly agreed upon with the RPF. 
  Signed in Kigali on 27 February 1994. Thank you. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Kinshasa, 25 Feb (PANA) -- Zairean President, Mobutu 
Sese Seko and his staunch opponent, Etienne Tshisekedi, whom he 
sacked as prime minister in late 1992, reportedly met Wednesday 
[23 February] night in Gbadolite, the birthplace of the former, 
Zairean papers revealed Friday. The alleged meeting took place 
a few days before the resuming of the plenary session of the 
transition parliament, due to open Saturday in Kinshasa to elect 
the prime minister. 
  The papers said the meeting between the two was the crowning 
of a series of secret deals which have been undertaken by a 
number of prominent Zaireans. Among those who involved in the 
secret conciliation efforts was the chairman of the Zairean 
National Union of Employers, Bemba Saolona, who is a close 
associate of President Mobutu. 
  Tshisekedi and his radical Union for Democracy and Social 
Progress (UPDS) have insisted that his sacking from the 
premiership was illegal because he was democratically elected by 
the 1991 national conference and not by the president.

  [Excerpt] A cabinet meeting was held on 25 February to

presided over by Mr. Faustin Birindwa, prime minister and head 
of government. The meeting began with a wide overview of the 
general national situation, and observed that general calm 
prevailed over the entire, vast national territory. 
Nevertheless, according to information received from the chief 
of general staff of the Zairian Armed Forces, there have been 
rebel infiltrations from a neighboring country into the 
Ruwenzori and Wataninga areas in North Kivu. After combat 
troops were dispatched to the affected areas, the Zairian Armed 
Forces rapidly repelled the invaders, kicking them out of our 
country. [passage omitted]

  [Text] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today told 
wananchi [citizens] in Lugari constituency in Kakamega District 
[western Kenya] to ignore threats by opposition parties and turn 
out in large numbers on Thursday, 3 March to vote for Kenya 
African National Union [KANU] in the by-elections. 
  The president said in a democratic society people should be 
free to decide their own destiny and wondered why opposition 
politicians were intimidating voters in the run-up to the 
elections. He, however, assured wananchi that the government 
had enough security machinery to contain any situation that may 
arise from those threats. President Moi said KANU stood for 
peace, love, and unity and the government shall not condone any 
acts of violence in the country. President Moi was speaking at 
various centers on his way to Nzoia chief's camp in Lugari to 
address a campaign rally on behalf of the KANU candidate in the 
constituency by-elections, Mr. Apili Wawire. 
  Among the centers he stopped at were Uasin Gishu Kakamega 
border, Nangili, Kongoni, Matunda, and Kona Mbaya. Thousands of 
jubilant wananchi, waving the popular one-finger KANU salute, 
assured the president that they will vote in the KANU candidate, 
Mr. Apili Wawire. President Moi told those wananchi that by 
voting for Mr. Wawire they will have voted for KANU, which 
stands for progress and stability. President Moi dismissed as 
cheap politics by a Forum for the Restoration of Democracy 
[FORD]-Kenya candidate, Burudi Nabwera, that part of Lugari 
constituency would be made part of Rift Valley Province. He 
said it was a pity that such an old man would stoop so low as to 
tell such lies only for the sake of wooing votes. 
  President Moi, who is also the president of the ruling 
party, 
KANU, wondered why the opposition was against harambee [communal 
fund raising] and yet that spirit had contributed a lot to the 
development of this nation. The president said that KANU will 
always concern itself with development matters and the general 
welfare of all Kenyans without discriminating. The president 
reiterated that it was the opposition parties which started off 
the tribal clashes in parts of Rift Valley and Western province 
and they should not use the same against KANU. President Moi 
recalled how he had appointed Mr. Nabwera to head several 
parastatals, including appointing him a minister of state in his 
office and [word indistinct] why he was not grateful to the KANU 
government.

  [Text] Nairobi, 28 Feb (KNA) -- The chairman of the 
Electoral Commission Mr. Zacheus Chesoni has warned outsiders 
out to unleash violence in Lugari constituency to keep off and 
give the constituents a chance to elect their own representative. 
  Mr. Chesoni said that the constituency had no past history 
of 
violence and blamed outsiders, some of whom he said are members 
of Parliament, for introducing insecurity in the area. He at 
the same time reminded voters in the constituency to exercise 
their democratic rights of choosing their member of parliament 
without fear or intimidation. 
  Mr. Chesoni, who was addressing a press conference in his 
office today, appealed to all the political parties and their 
supporters to restrain themselves from any acts of violence for 
the remaining electioneering period. He said that voting takes 
place as scheduled, on 3 March 1994 from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM and 
said that time will only be extended in polling stations which 
opened late. He told all the election officials taking part in 
the by-election to be fair and impartial and warned that anybody 
found interfering with the election process will be prosecuted. 
He assured the voters that the commission will liaise with the 
police commissioner to ensure that adequate security is provided 
during and after the by-election. To avoid cheating, Mr. Chesoni 
said that only original national identity cards will be used and 
told those who might have lost their identity cards to keep off 
the polling stations. 
  Asked whether there will be any foreign observers during the 
by election, Mr. Chesoni said that the British and American 
embassies have indicated their willingness to send their 
political counselors as observers on the voting day. He took 
issue with a local daily for criticizing the commission's 
decision to increase polling stations in the constituency and 
explained that the decision was only made to encourage more 
voters to turn up. He was accompanied by commissioners Samuel 
Kivutu and the deputy chairman, Mr. Mwathani Mbaka. 
  [Nairobi DAILY NATION in English on 28 February on page 1 
adds the following: "Heavily armed police clashed with Forum 
for the Restoration of Democracy [FORD]-Kenya supporters 
yesterday at Malava, Kakamega District, when a district officer 
tried to stop acting FORD-Kenya Chairman Kijana Wamalwa from 
opening a local party office. The paper said no-one was injured 
in the `pushing and brawling', during which it said the crowd 
shouted anti-government slogans."]

  [Excerpt] Sheikh Khalid Balala [former Islamic Party oF 
Kenya, IPK, activist who resigned from IPK in October 1993] 
yesterday threatened to call a nationwide strike of schools and 
colleges if Secretary-General Abdulraham Wandati of the Islamic 
Party of Kenya and the chairman of the Universities Academic 
Staff Union, Dr Korwa Adar, are not released unconditionally. 
Sheikh Balala told the government that by arresting innocent 
people it was inviting anarchy. He said he would organize the 
preparation and distribution of one million leaflets instigating 
a national strike of all institutions of learning if the two men 
were not released within a week. The leaflets, he said, will 
start circulating in Nairobi, and then spread to all parts of 
the country. The strike itself will start next Monday. 
  Mr. Wandati was arrested last week in Lugari [western Kenya] 
at a FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy] Kenya 
campaign rally allegedly over statements he had made earlier. 
  Dr Adar was picked up by police from his Spring Valley 
residence on Friday night. [passage omitted]

at the SNA headquarters in Mogadishu, was attended by local and 
foreign journalists. 
  Speaking at the press conference, the USF chairman said that 
his organization started the struggle with the SSNM and the 
principal objective was to uphold the Somali people's unity and 
that it wanted existing disagreements to be resolved through 
dialogue. Mr. Hufane said that after it became clear that the 
SNA's objective was based on peace and the unification of the 
Somali people, which conformed with the USF's objective based on 
the restoration of peace among the Somali people, the USF had 
decided to join the SNA, as had other organizations. 
  He said that he had held meetings with leaders of Somali 
organizations and discussed ways of finding a just solution to 
Somali problems. Mr Hufane said that recently he and his 
delegation had held talks with leaders of the Horn of Africa 
countries, including the Kenyan and Sudanese presidents [as 
heard]. Answering many questions from local and international 
journalists, Mr. Hufane said there was no internal conflict in 
the USF Central Committee, of which he was chairman. He said 
his organization would never accept disunity among the Somali 
people. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A joint Franco-Ivorian military exercise 
codenamed "N'Zi 94" will take place from 28 February to 4 March 
in the Gagnoa, Sinfra, Bocanda, and Bongouanou quadrilateral 
area. "N'Zi 94" will therefore be the first major military 
maneuver undertaken by the Ivorian Army in 10 years. 
  Franco-Ivorian maneuvers were suspended for essentially 
economic reasons. This year, the Ministry of Defense and the 
military general staff have decided to organize, in conjunction 
with the French, a joint exercise which will mobilize over 1,200 
men, 250 light vehicles and tanks, 10 combat planes, and three 
naval ships. Because of the economic crisis, France will make a 
substantial contribution to the success of the operation. It 
will bear the cost of fuel, ammunition, and food rations.

  [Text] Monrovia, Feb 28 (AFP) -- Rebel Liberian leader 
Charles Taylor named Monday [28 February] five supporters to 
ministerial posts in a transitional government after striking a 
power-sharing deal with a rival armed movement, pro-Taylor radio 
said. 
  Taylor said his National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) 
and the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO) had agreed since last 
September to split four key "power" ministries between them, 
foreign affairs, justice, finance and defence, said NPFL radio 
monitored here. 
  The rebel leader nominated Momolu Sirlead as foreign 
minister, Laveli Supuwood to the justice portfolio, Joe Mulbah 
to information, Roland Massaquoi to agriculture and Tom Woewiyu 
to employment. 
  The NPFL and ULIMO had agreed to split "the majority" of the 
major ministries between themselves as long ago as last 
September, the radio said, adding there was no need to discuss 
the issue further. 
  There was no immediate confirmation of the agreement from 
ULIMO, one of Taylor's rival in this war-ravaged West African 
state before a peace pact was signed last year. 
  A February 16 meeting to decide the ministry carve-up ended 
without agreement and talks were due to be continued at an 
unspecified later date. 
  Nominations to the agriculture, information and employment 
portfolios had been agreed at a Liberian peace conference 
attended by the NPFL, ULIMO and the interim government currently 
exercising authority over part of the country, notably the 
capital Monrovia. But differences had remained over the key 
posts. The transitional government is due to take office after 
the completion of a disarmament programme -- scheduled for March 
7. 
  However, the rebel radio warned the NPFL would only hand 
over 
its weapons to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] peacekeepers from outside the 
region. Taylor's force has long been hostile to the Nigerian-led 
force, which it accuses of siding with his rivals in the bitter 
civil war. Currently six nations make up the force, Nigeria, 
Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Mali, Tanzania and 
Uganda. 
  Meanwhile officials announced David Kpormakor had been 
elected Monday president of the State Council, an interim 
collegial presidency which is due to assume power under the 
final peace accord. Kpormakor, an interim government 
representative on the five-member council, replaces another 
interim government member Philip Banks. 
  The election to the post of president -- the subject of 
intense political manouevrings -- took place under the 
supervision of UN special envoy on Liberia Trevor Gordon-Somers. 
  The council elected Thomas Ziah (ULIMO) as first vice 
president, Isaac Musa (NFPL) as second vice president, with 
Banks and Mohamed Sheriff (ULIMO) filing the remaining posts.

  [Text] The Constitution was violated at the Higher Council 
of Communication, CSC, this morning. Elements from the police 
and Republican Guard intervened to prevent the CSC chairman and 
other members of the council's standing committee from entering 
their offices. This operation was ordered by the Supreme Court, 
whose members went to occupy the place. Is this act legal in a 
law- abiding state? What will be the reactions of the various 
political and administrative authorities to end this situation 
which does not honor our country. In this showdown, what can 
the CSC, which is also a constitutional body, do? So many 
questions which deserve answers. At the CSC, people are very 
surprised that in a law-abiding state passion has prevailed over 
reason. Here is CSC Chairman Maazou Mahamane: 
  [Begin recording] I wonder if such an act is possible in a 
law- abiding and democratic state. I also wonder in the present 
situation how this problem will be resolved. For the moment, I 
will say that it [words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] Abuja, 28 Feb (AFP) -- France should be held 
responsible if the current border disputes between Nigeria and 
Cemeroon degenerates, Nigerian External Relations Minister 
Alhaji Baba Gana Kingibe pointed out today. Mr. Kingibe who was 
addressing reporters in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, felt that 
problems between Nigeria and Cameroon, which, according to him, 
are only "bilateral", should remain as such. 
  The same day Nigerian Information Minister Jerry Gana had 
already told AFP in Lagos "to be aware of the implications of 
French participation." He had expressed "reservations" about a 
French intervention in the border conflict, but expressed the 
hope that French military intervention "was going to bring peace 
and not escalate the crisis."

  [Text] As Nigeria tries to resolve its dispute with 
Cameroon over the Bakassi peninsula through peaceful means, 
there are reports that France has sent about 40 paratroopers and 
two Puma combat helicopters to Cameroon. The French troops are 
said to have arrived at Yaounde airport base carrying light 
machine guns. The troops were deployed from the Central African 
Republic where they are stationed. Apart from this, a 
high-level French delegation of senior diplomats and military 
officials are also in Yaounde to hold discussions with Cameroon 
President Paul Biya and Cameroonian authorities. The delegation 
includes the head of African affairs in the French Foreign 
Ministry and President Francois Mitterand's personal military 
chief of staff, General Christian Quesnot. France has a defense 
pact with Cameroon. 
  Foreign news correspondent Stephen Eshep was at the defense 
headquarters in Lagos for the reaction to the latest 
development. The Director of Defense Information Brigadier 
General Fred Chijuka said there was no cause for alarm and that 
the same French delegation now in Yaounde is expected in Nigeria 
within the week. 
  [Begin Chijuka recording] I cannot say what is going to be 
the government reaction to what they are going to discuss, but I 
feel that everything is tending toward finding a peaceful 
solution to what the other side considers as our incursion into 
their territory whereas we are convinced that...[pauses] we are 
also considering it as our territory. 
  Every day we have reports from that zone telling the defense 
headquarters what is happening and so on. What they have got 
this morning is that everywhere is calm so we will be there on 
the spot. And this is what they have told us. We have no reason 
to doubt it. So the general situation after that report is that 
the situation is very calm. [end recording] 
  French officials are reported to have said that the 
paratroopers would not be deployed in Bakassi. But the 
(?interesting) aspect is that there is a French military 
presence in Cameroon. There are speculations that the military 
presence has to do with the protection of French interests and 
the oil-rich peninsula. Tension has been increasing in the 
peninsula since last December, when Cameroonian gendarmes 
attacked villagers in the Bakassi peninsula in an attempt to 
take over territory which historically belongs to Nigeria.

  [Text] Lagos, 28 Feb (PANA) -- Nigeria said on Monday [28 
February] that the arrival of French troops in Cameroon does not 
change its commitment to peace on the border dispute between the 
two countries. "We (Nigeria's military) will continue to do 
our normal duties of maintaining peace in the border area until 
the federal government gives us other responsibility," Nigeria's 
defence spokesman Fred Chijuka told PANA. He said that Nigeria 
received advance notice from France about the mission to 
Cameroon. Chijuka said the French, by sending troops to 
Cameroon in fulfilment of a defence pact, were also for peace. 
Diplomatic sources said that a French delegation is also due to 
visit Nigeria over the border dispute, but a date is yet to be 
fixed. 
  The long-running dispute over the ownership of Bakassi 
peninsula in the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, took a new dimension 
with a reported clash by their troops on 18 and 19 February. 
Cameroon said that its troops were attacked, but Nigeria 
denied it saying that its own soldiers on a routine patrol duty 
were fired on. Nigeria said that its troops, acting on strict 
orders, never returned fire. 
  Nigeria has said that 30 of its villages in the disputed 
border area were set alight by Cameroonian gendarmes in the last 
two months. The arrival of French troops in Cameroon, comes in 
the wake of last week's visit to Nigeria by a Cameroonian 
delegation, which gave an assurance that President Paul Biya has 
accepted an invitation to visit Nigeria to resolve the border 
dispute. 
  Cameroon bases its claim to Bakassi on a 1913 pact between 
Germany and Britain, two former colonial powers. Cameroon 
claims that the pact was reinforced by another agreement between 
former Nigerian head of state, Yakubu Gowon and then President 
Ahmadu Ahidjo of Cameroon. But Nigeria argues that the 
agreement was never ratified by the country's then ruling 
supreme militaty council. Gowon has also denied ceding the 
peninsula to Cameroon.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mohamed Okorejo] </F>
  [Text] General Sani Abacha, the Nigerian head of state, put 
it most appropriately when he told a visiting Cameroonian envoy 
a few days ago that no problem should be too big for the two 
brotherly nations to solve at the conference table. Responding 
to a message from President Paul Biya (?suing) for peace along 
the Nigeria-Cameroon border, Gen. Abacha said he would gladly 
host President Biya for talks on the protracted border 
skirmishes. 
  The Cameroonian delegation came at the heels of an open 
confrontation along the border following irritating incursions 
into Nigeria's Bakassi Peninsula by Cameroonian gendarmes. For 
a very long time now, the gendarmes have harassed Nigerians 
living on their own side of the border often on the excuse of 
going after fleeing tax defaulters. Thousands of Nigerians have 
been displaced and abused in the process. Lagos had often 
treated such complaints at the diplomatic level so as not to 
spark off a war. Perhaps this gave the false impression that 
Nigeria could be a pushover in such matters. But the truth is 
that Nigeria, though a war-tested nation that can hold its own 
against any onslaught whatsoever, regarded the antics of 
Cameroon as undeserving of serious attention. It should be 
known that Nigeria did not want to react to the siege of its 
[word indistinct] because Cameroon cannot be a match for Nigeria 
when it comes to war. 
  Besides, it is apparent that Cameroon is being a pawn in the 
hands of those who do not wish Africa well. Nigeria knows this 
and does not want to oblige those who seek the dismemberment of 
the continent. However, certain internal feuds among 
communities in the eastern extremities of Nigeria called for the 
deployment of troops there to restore order. The trigger-happy 
gendarmes, not quite versed in military strategic movements, 
panicked and struck blindly. If there were any doubts about the 
maturity and forbearance of the Nigerian authorities over this 
matter, such doubts have been dispelled by a highly placed 
Cameroonian, Mr. John Fru Ndi, leader of the Cameroon Social 
Democratic Front, SDF. He owned up to a foreign radio station 
that the conflict was sparked off by Cameroonians. According to 
him, the Cameroonians in question were seeking an outlet for 
their internal frustrations. But, this is rather infantile 
because Nigeria does not want a spillover of the politics of its 
neighbors nor is Abuja known for territorial ambition. 
  However, this short confrontation must have shown the 
Cameroonian authorities the futility of their aggressiveness and 
the need to resolve the matter through genuine dialogue. But, 
first, Yaounde should accept that it put the cart before the 
horse when President Biya sought to internationalize the 
dispute. President Biya ought to know better than fall in for 
international do-gooders whose only aim is to emasculate Africa 
of its potential as a world power. President Biya and his team 
are welcome any day and can expect openness from Nigeria, but 
they should realize that Nigeria will no longer fall for delay 
tactics or double talk. This is because Nigeria can no longer 
allow her nationals to be abused and maimed by any country. The 
sacrifice for African unity should not be a one-sided affair 
just as the quest for transborder peace should be a collective 
responsibility. 
  Ironically, there are over 2 million Nigerians currently 
engaged in active trade with their Cameroonian counterparts 
while nearly a million Cameroonians are either studying or doing 
business in Nigeria. This has been so for centuries. This 
Saturday's [26 February] action goes beyond ordinary 
neighborliness and when it is known that there are uncountable 
marriages across the borders one wonders what really is amiss. 
For decades, the Nigerian-Cameroon Commission has worked hard 
to eliminate disputes along the common border but it seems that 
try as it can, there is a (?mistake) somewhere down along the 
line. This is what the Abacha-Biya talks should identify and 
find a solution to in the interest of the sociological 
well-being of their two countries.

the defunct Social Democratic Party, retired Major General Shehu 
Yar'adua, has withdrawn his case against the attorney general of 
the federation and three others. When hearings resumed today 
before the Kaduna High Court, counsel to Gen. Yar'adua, Mr. 
Ademola Ajala, told the court that his client had decided to 
withdraw the case in the interest of national peace and unity. 
Mr. Ajala stated that the parties had resolved the matter out 
of court. Following this submission, the presiding chief judge 
of Kaduna State, Justice (Akayeni Biyeye) struck out the case. 
It would be recalled that Gen. Shehu Yar'adua had filed a 
100-million-naira suit against the Federal Government for 
illegal detention and breach of his fundamental rights.

  [Text] A delegation from Israel arrived in Nigeria 
yesterday to seek ways of strengthening bilateral relations 
between the two countries. Professor Naomi Chazan, a member of 
the delegation, told Emeka Onwachukwu that one of the reasons 
for their visit was to (?intimate) the Nigerian Government on 
the peace process in the Middle East. 
  [Begin recording] [Chazan] I and my delegation were sent by 
the foreign minister of Israel, Mr. Shim'on Peres, to the 
government of Nigeria to do two things: Number one, to explain 
the progress on the peace process, autonomy for the 
Palestinians, and also on the subject of negotiations with 
Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon; and number two, to bring together 
Israel and Nigeria more closely to examine possibilities for 
cooperation and for mutual enrichment. 
  [Onwachukwu] Now, you have just alluded to the fact that 
your trip here is to acquaint Nigerians of what has been going 
on in respect of the peace process between the PLO and the 
Israeli Government. Now, what is the present situation about 
the negotiations? 
  [Chazan] There has been a fair amount of progress in the 
last few weeks. About two weeks ago, Israel and the PLO 
initialed the Cairo Agreement, which deals with most of the 
security issues that had been outstanding, and in the past two 
weeks, there has been substantial progress on almost all other 
things in our negotiations with the Palestinians. We anticipate 
if the progress continues, as it has in recent weeks, then 
within one month to six weeks' time, we will begin 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal. [end recording]

  [Text] Lome, 28 Feb (AFP) -- The president of the Supreme 
Court of Togo, Mr. Emmanuel Apedoh, told AFP today that the full 
results of the legislative elections organized on 6 and 20 
February in Togo have not yet been sent by the National 
Electoral Commission (CEN). He specified that he is still 
without "the reports on the counting of votes" in the five 
constituencies where incidents disrupted the polls and which the 
CEN declined to publish the results during the second round of 
the elections. 
  This statement calls into question the earlier one made by 
the CEN and the Togolese Government that the full results have 
been sent to the Supreme Court on 23 February. Questioned this 
morning, an official of the CEN admitted that certain documents 
on the results in the five constituencies have not as yet been 
sent to the Supreme Court but it will be done "in the course of 
the day." 
  The two parties opposed to President Gnassingbe Eyadema 
claimed to have won 43 out of the 81 seats at stake, and 
therefore the absolute majority in parliament which, according 
to the constitution, gives them the prerogative to form the new 
government. Supporters of the head of state have announced their 
intention to call for the annulment of the polls in the five 
constituencies (all claimed by the opposition) whose results the 
CEN did not publish. 
  This confusion has already caused a discrepancy in the 
scheduled political timetable. Thus it is out of the question 
that the new National Assembly can be officially inaugurated on 
1 March as expected since it can only sit "without further 
considerations" on the second Tuesday following the official 
proclamation of the election results. And yet the Supreme Court 
has a maximum of 15 days "after receiving the full results" to 
declare them official and final.

leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi arrived at a Durban hotel at about 
9.45am Tuesday [1 March] for a meeting with African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela, indicating that much of 
their talks would centre on violence. Mr Buthelezi told the 
media as he arrived: "The matter concerns us very deeply ... we 
haven't come here solely to discuss the elections." 
  The IFP president refused to answer questions about his 
party's threat to boycott the elections, saying his standpoint 
on the issue was well known. 
  In anticipation of talks with the ANC president, Mr 
Buthelezi 
said: "I don't expect concessions from Mr Mandela and he 
shouldn't expect concessions from me." 
  Later he said the meeting was important "by virtue of the 
fact of our constituencies". "Both of us love our country and 
both of us have struggled for it in different ways." 
  Mr Buthelezi said their supporters should benefit by the 
culmination of their struggle.

<F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban Feb 28 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
Central Committee member Farouk Cassim says a proposal to 
postpone elections in Natal/kwaZulu is aimed at preventing 
spiralling political conflict and avoiding a total 
constitutional deadlock. 
  Mr Cassim confirmed on Monday [28 February] that he had 
tabled surprise proposals to a parliamentary committee last 
week, but added they had not yet been officially adopted by the 
IFP, but "this can become the IFP's line". 
  The African National Congress [ANC] in Natal immediately 
rejected the postponement of elections -- "April 27 is 
non-negotiable," said provincial spokesman Dumisani Makhaye. 
"If you tamper with that date you'll be unleashing forces that 
will destroy everything in this country," he said. 
  Mr Cassim said the proposals would be discussed at an IFP 
Central Committee meeting in Ulundi on Monday night. 
  In terms of the suggestions, the April elections should be 
postponed in Natal/kwaZulu while they go ahead in the rest of 
the country. 
  An interim administration, of which kwaZulu would be one 
component, should be put in place in Natal. The other 
components could be nominated by the state president or whoever 
is in authority, said Mr Cassim. "The people of Natal should 
then be allowed to develop a provincial constitution and then 
put this to a referendum." 
  The IFP would, however, draw up this constitution which 
would 
have to be accepted by a 60 percent majority, he explained. 
"Then within 90 days, an election would take place and we would 
then join the rest of the country on the basis of a constitution 
that has the support of the people of this, the second most 
populous region in the country." 
  The IFP believed it would win a "clear majority" in a 
referendum of this sort, he added. Mr Cassim said the proposals 
were important as time was running out. "If you can't stop 
time, the best thing is to take part of the process out of time 
constraints. The ANC says it will bend over backwards and the 
fact is that we must find a negotiated settlement. It would be 
wrong for us to stop the rest of the country if they're ready. 
Equally, it would be wrong to force an equally important 
province to hurry along to something it has been opposed to all 
along. Rather than adding towards conflict, it might be 
necessary to have an alternative approach... and prevent a 
total deadlock and impasse." 
  Mr Makhaye, meanwhile, charged that the IFP was trying to 
buy 
time after having isolated itself from the country's negotiation 
process. "The patience of our people is not endless. But what 
has held them back from venting their anger is precisely because 
people are focusing on the April 27 democratic elections. I 
personally think the time has now come to move forward to 
democracy with or without the IFP or those wanting a volkstaat 
[Afrikaner homeland]. We can't bend over until we break our 
spines."

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Whitfield, political correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] has launched a bid 
to have the election postponed in kwaZulu/Natal and for a 
referendum to be held on a provincial constitution it would 
compile. 
  In terms of the IFP's surprise proposals put to a 
parliamentary committee, an election in the province could be 
delayed by more than a year. The move--the latest in a long 
series of initiatives from Ulundi designed to shift the 
direction of the transition--comes with ANC [African National 
Congress] president Nelson Mandela and IFP leader Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi scheduled to hold a highly important 
meeting tomorrow. The fact that Mandela initiated the meeting 
and was prepared to travel to Durban is being seen in some IFP 
circles as an indication that the ANC might be prepared to make 
further concessions to the IFP and its Freedom Alliance (FA) 
partners. 
  However, one senior Government negotiator was highly 
sceptical last night, saying. "I think we are just going to 
have to resign ourselves to an election without the IFP or the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front]." There is increasing 
speculation that Bophuthatswana--its administration reportedly 
crumbling under civil service strikes--might come into a 
settlement. Today Parliament begins a three-day session in 
which amendments to the Interim Constitution agreed by the 
Negotiating Council will be passed. The amendments were 
designed to lure the FA--including the IFP--into a political 
settlement but have been bluntly rejected by the dissenting 
parties. 
  Chief Whip of Parliament Alex von Breda said last night it 
was technically possible for additional amendments to be made to 
the Interim Constitution and approved by Parliament if they were 
agreed to today or tomorrow. 
  IFP members of the parliamentary standing committee on 
constitutional matters said they had "given notice of intent" by 
tabling a document on Friday spelling out proposals in terms of 
which kwaZulu/Natal would be handled as a special case. The IFP 
hoped these proposals would be included as amendments to the 
Interim Constitution. 
  The IFP proposals include: 

  -  The Interim Constitution would have no force in 
kwaZulu/Natal until the province had adopted its own 
constitution. 
  -  The kwaZulu/Natal Joint Executive Authority (JEA) would 
maintain legislative and executive control of the province until 
it had adopted a new constitution for the province. 
  -  An administrator-general for the province be appointed by the 
State President. 
  -  Existing civil servants in kwaZulu/Natal within 12 months, 
providing it had been approved by 60 percent of voters in the 
province. 
  -  The election in kwaZulu/Natal would take place no less than 
90 
days after the adoption of the constitution.

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 28 SAPA -- The talks between the 
government and members of the Freedom Alliance had reached "a 
bit of a standstill", President F W de Klerk said on Monday. On 
his way to addressing a special three-day parliamentary session, 
he told pressmen that the South African Government still had 
more to give in the negotiations and wanted to give more. "Time 
will tell". 
  South Africa had reached the end of one chapter of 
negotiations, after which "fundamental negotiations will still 
take place", which was neither good nor bad news. 
  He felt the constitutional and electoral amendments to be 
considered by Parliament in the special session addressed the 
core of the matters about which negotiations had been conducted. 
But "you can bring a horse to water but you can't make it drink". 
  On Tuesday's scheduled talks between ANC [African National 
Congress] President Mr Nelson Mandela and IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] head Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, he said: "I hope it goes 
well". The two leaders should have met more often before now.

  [Text] Parliament Feb 28 SAPA -- The status and position of 
the Zulu king had to be elevated above party politics, and the 
monarchy secured through effective constitutional safeguards, 
the state president, Mr F W de Klerk, said on Monday [28 
February]. 
  Addressing a special session of Parliament, he said he 
understood the concerns of King Goodwill Zwelithini and his 
people on the future of the Zulu monarchy. The government and 
the National Party supported the view that the Zulu kingdom 
should be given constitutional recognition. "The Zulu kingdom 
is recognised by us as a unique reality. It has a proud history 
and plays an important role in the life of the Zulu nation." 
  Mr de Klerk said the monarchy could be secured either in a 
constitution for kwaZulu/Natal or in the national constitution, 
or both. The government had been involved in serious and 
in-depth discussions on the issue of the Zulu monarchy but no 
specific agreement had yet been reached. However, negotiation 
would continue until agreement was reached.

  [Text] The state president, Mr. F. W. de Klerk, says the 
government is determined to go ahead with the April election, 
irrespective of whether the Freedom Alliance participates. Mr. 
de Klerk was speaking during a joint session of the special 
parliamentary sitting that opened today. He said any attempts 
to disrupt the election would be strongly opposed. This week's 
special parliamentary sitting is aimed at removing the Freedom 
Alliance's objections to the constitution. 
  Mr. de Klerk said the latest amendments removed any 
reasonable excuse for nonparticipation in the election. He said 
the government would use every possible means, including the 
security forces, against any party wanting to achieve its goals 
by unconstitutional methods. Mr. de Klerk said parties aiming 
at secession or the illegal takeover of state or municipal 
authority should not have any illusions about the consequences 
of their actions and the role of the security forces.

  [Text] Pretoria March 1 SAPA -- Conflict would probably 
persist in South Africa for a number of years and the South 
African Defence Force [SADF] had a role to play in this regard, 
African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela told 
the Defence Command Council. An SADF statement quoted Mr 
Mandela as telling the council on February 23 that the country's 
socio-economic backlog and the inability of any government to 
fulfil expectations meant it was probable that a measure of 
instability would persist for a number of years. 
  Mr Mandela expressed his appreciation of the valuable work 
performed by the SADF in the interests of peace, the statement 
said. He pronounced his satisfaction with the growing 
credibility and acceptability of the SADF in black townships, it 
added. 
  The statement quoted Mr Mandela as saying the ANC shared the 
vision of an apolitical, professional and effective defence 
force acceptable to and representative of the people of South 
Africa. The national defence force should not be loyal to any 
political party, including the ANC, but to the state and the 
people of South Africa. 
  Mr Mandela said the ANC was sensitive to the position of the 
commandos and would not like anything done that might alienate 
them, according to the SADF statement.

  [Text] Bloemfontein Feb 28 SAPA -- Fewer than half the 
planned 10,000 members of the National Peacekeeping Force are 
being trained, Liaison Officer Col Coenie van Rensburg told SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news on Monday. 
He said there was not enough time to train the rest. Only 
4,326 men are being trained, about 3,260 at De Brug in 
Bloemfontein and the remainder at Koeberg near Cape Town. The 
force was established to maintain law and order at polling 
booths during the April elections.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 1 SAPA -- The National 
Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) being trained for the April elections 
will cost R[Rand]130m [million], according to the NPKF's budget 
proposal. The NPKF budget was due to be tabled on Tuesday at the 
Cape Town sitting of the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) 
whose subcouncil on defence devised the spending estimates. 
  The budget makes provision for R50m to be spent on personnel 
costs until the end of march and another R80m to be spent on 
equipment and logistics. The budget is based on a force of 
10,713. 
  The De Brug contingent comprises 1,062 personnel drawn from 
the South African Defence Force, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation, MK; ANC military wing], the Transkei Defence Force with 
a smaller number drawn from the South African Police, Venda 
Defence Force and Ciskei Defence Force with 190 each. Another 
intake to Koeberg comprises 1,182 people. 
  The budget includes catering at R11.51 per peacekeeper, 
camping equipment, 442 vehicles of which 125 are replacements 
issued by the South African Army, telecommunications equipment 
valued at about R4.5m, uniforms costing about R6m and various 
types of riot equipment.

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 28 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela's "eventual" decision that ANC 
members should behave themselves at rallies was welcome, Law and 
Order Minister Hernus Kriel said at a press conference on Monday 
[28 February]. "The National Party is not the only party 
suffering because the ANC cannot control its supporters. It 
will also be interesting to see if Mr Mandela takes action 
against his supporters who don't heed his words. A large number 
of ANC supporters have been found guilty of various crimes, like 
smuggling weapons and murder, and no steps have yet been taken 
against them." 
  He hoped to make known details of a pact with neighbouring 
"Frontline" states soon about arms smuggling into South Africa. 
"We are negotiating with Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho, and 
although these things take time we are making progress."

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 28 SAPA -- A tough programme to ensure 
law and order would be implemented by the National Party [NP] 
after the election, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said on 
Monday [28 February]. 
  Speaking at a press conference, he said when the NP could no 
longer be accused of a lack of legitimacy, more severe 
punishments would be put on the statute books and more prisons 
built to jail criminals. "We will improve South African Police 
[SAP]-community relations because we believe therein lies the 
answer to bring down the crime rate. We will also recruit more 
force members and improve their training as well as provide even 
better technical equipment." 
  An unfortunate culture of violence had been created in South 
Africa through intolerance, intimidation and uncontrolled 
supporters. In this, he said, the ANC [African National 
Congress] had to be singled out as the main threat to the 
democratic process. But the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and far 
right-wing also seemed to be vying for this unenviable position. 
"Together, their political intolerance and violence threatens 
to destabilise the transition to democracy and can, if allowed 
to continue unchecked, create a bloodstained election." 
  The ten major threats to democracy -- in which Mr Kriel said 
the ANC, IFP and far right played leading or prominent roles -- 
were political intolerance, uncontrollable supporters, 
intimidation, no-go areas, illegal weapons, war talk, 
demonisation of the SAP, murder of policemen, extremism and mass 
action. "If these organisations use violence to either win an 
election or reach political objectives, how will they act after 
gaining victory against their political opponents and when in 
control of the state's security organisations?"

  [Text] Cape Town March 1 SAPA -- Between 500 and 1,000 
people were being trained and armed in Northern Natal every 
fortnight, ANC [African National Congress] Secretary General 
Cyril Ramaphosa, told the Transitional Executive Committee on 
Tuesday. He said people in the Umfolozi area were being armed by 
white conservative farmers who were assisting in training them. 
  The only objective could be to serve the stated goal by 
certain parties that there would be no election allowed in the 
territory. "The activities clearly show something is afoot in 
preparing a number of people who are fully armed, probably to 
launch an attack on people going to vote." 
  Mr Ramaphosa quoted from a letter received from a local 
chief 
in December. "It demonstrates the problems we will face in 
Natal," he said. Guns were being deployed throughout the 
territory.

  [Text] Rayton Feb 28 SAPA -- Armed Boerecommando [Boer 
Commando] members fortified Rayton's municipal offices with 
sandbags and razor wire on Monday [28 February] -- but a special 
town council meeting resolved hours later that the barricades 
should be removed by the commando members. Pretoria 
Boerekommando Commandant Willem Ratte said the fortification of 
the town's municipal offices would hopefully be one of the first 
steps towards a volkstaat [homeland]. 
  The offices had been barricaded at the request of the local 
community, he said. But Town Clerk Nick Ebersohn said he first 
heard about the erection of the barricades at 3.15am on Monday. 
"At that time, it did not seem opportune to tell the people not 
to do it," said Mr Ebersohn. 
  Rayton's seven councillors were all independents, he said. 
He 
would not be drawn on whather Rayton supported the volkstaat 
movement. Rayton is situated about 30km east of Pretoria in an 
area marked by rightwing activity. Radio Pretoria's Donkerhoek 
site is about 10km from the town. 
  Speaking on Radio Pretoria on Monday, Cmdt Ratte said the 
volkstaat would stand or fall at local government level."I am 
convinced that if we can't even restore democracy at local 
government level, we won't be able to do so at national level. 
  "If communities like Rayton and Akasia and others clearly 
adopt standpoints against the government's threat of forcing 
undemocratic bodies on them, it can be the start of the 
volkstaat, and I am convinced it will be the start of the 
volkstaat." 
  Cmdt Ratte said the government had issued a threat that all 
town councils would be forced to disband and become part of 
non-democratic forums. "The people of Rayton said that, just 
like akasia, they were not prepared to submit to these threats, 
and they refused to disband their democratically elected 
council." 
  Just because Rayton was small did not mean it was 
unimportant. "It is especially at local government level that 
the volkstaat will stand or fall." 
  Pretoria Boercommando members barricaded Akasia's council 
offices on February 14 to "protect the complex until Akasia's 
incorporation into a future volkstaat", Akasia Management 
Committee Chairman Louis Meynardt said at the time. 
  Akasia is 15km north of Pretoria.

  [Text] A security firm run by Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of 
the Nation, MK, armed wing of the African National Congress] 
commanders and manned by MK soldiers is operating in a township 
on the edge of Johannesburg. Five MK commanders have 
capitalised on their training in Angola and the former Soviet 
Union to go into business. The MK officers -- together with 
legal, commercial and human resource specialists -- founded 
Alexandra Business Holdings several months ago with the aim of 
employing MK returnees. They went into partnership with the 
established Security Operations Group and obtained the backing 
of ANC [African National Congress] deputy secretary general 
Jacob Zuma. 
  This week, the group launched its first security firm and 
negotiations for the formation of another four companies are 
under way. The guards, armed with revolvers and shotguns, will 
soon start protecting trucks in Alexandra and industries on the 
outskirts of the township. The firm has already signed to 
protect trucks belonging to soft drink giant Amalgamated 
Beverages Industries. 
  Alexandra Business Holdings chairman Sam Buthelezi said the 
company planned to use an "empowerment strategy" to contribute 
towards more stable and harmonious communities. 
  Director Mandla Maseko is still MK chief of staff in 
Alexandra and was trained in Angola and the Ukraine before doing 
time on Robben Island. "Guerrilla training is an advantage in 
this type of work, but extra security training is necessary," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Ferial Haffajee] </F>
  [Text] Three refuse bags filled with torn-up ID application 
forms have been found at a Department of Home Affairs office -- 
prompting an Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] probe into 
possible official sabotage of the election process. 
  The remains of the completed forms, with photographs and 
fingerprints, were found in the yard of a Home Affairs office in 
Lenasia, near Johannesburg. They have been seen and 
photographed by the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN. The ID applications are 
largely those of African domestic workers and the residents of 
three squatter camps in the Lenasia area. The ANC [African 
National Congress] says they are likely to be ANC supporters. 
"This has very serious implications. It can suppress our 
capacity to muster votes," said Issu Chiba, chairman of the 
local ANC branch. 
  The IEC confirmed that the documents were authentic and not 
"innocent refuse". The IEC is now investigating whether Home 
Affairs officials are sabotaging the process or guilty of 
"inefficiency and negligence". A Home Affairs representative 
said if the allegations were proven to be true, the department 
would take "the strongest possible steps" against the staff 
responsible. The find follows a SUNDAY NATION expose last 
August of Home Affairs officials in Barberton, Eastern 
Transvaal, who had burnt a pile of ID books. ANC 
secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa called this "gross sabotage of 
the elections process". 
  This week the ANC called for independent monitoring of the 
issuing of IDs and temporary voter cards in the run-up to the 
elections. The latest find took place when Lenasia ANC branch 
member Batista Mokwena investigated complaints from applicants 
who had waited months for their IDs and found the application 
forms and other documents in a bin at the Home Affairs offices. 
  The torn-up application forms had been filled out, 
fingerprinted, stamped and signed by clerks before being thrown 
away. Other documents of applicants, including original birth 
certificates and photographs, were also discarded. Mokwena had 
been posted outside the Home Affairs office to assist droves of 
people plying ANC branch offices with requests for help in 
applying for IDs. He discovered the discarded forms after 
investigating the large number of applicants who had been told 
there was no record of their applications. 
  Most of the destroyed applications were made in January and 
February this year and appear to belong primarily to domestic 
workers and squatter residents from three squatter camps in the 
area. Both the Department of Home Affairs and the IEC have sent 
investigating teams to Lenasia and much of the evidence has 
already been handed over to the commission. Complaints about 
the Home Affairs staffers in Lenasia surfaced early this year. 
Shan Balton, of the local ANC branch, met Home Affairs 
officials in January to complain that most of the Lenasia clerks 
did not speak a vernacular language and that free photographs 
were not being provided. 
  "The problems did not stop and we decided to put a volunteer 
in the Home Affairs office to assist with forms," said Balton. 
"If this is happening in Lenasia, what's happening in small 
rural towns?" He added: "There is a problem with the absolute 
control that Home Affairs has over the issuing of IDs and 
temporary voter cards. They need independent people in the 
offices."

column] 
  [Text] Open up the newspaper you're busy reading and 
measure it from top to bottom. That, plus another two 
centimentres, is what a ballot paper for the National Assembly 
election will measure. With 60 cm ballot papers, 10 different 
kinds of ballot papers and marking fluid all over our knuckles, 
the April election is going to be like no other. 
  Our 80 million ballot papers will fill 10 jumbo jets when 
they wing their way to South Africa from London where they are 
being printed. According to the Independent Electoral 
Commission, no South African firm could handle the printing 
order and the London firm De La Rue, of Basingstoke, has 
expertise in printing bank-notes, ballot papers and official 
documents. 
  Printing will be completed by April 17. The ballot papers 
will be flown to South Africa under stringent security and be 
transported to warehouses under surveillance and in the presence 
of political party officials. Three days before the election 
they will be transported to secure locations near the voting 
stations. 
  Ten different types of ballot paper will be used -- one for 
the National Assembly (the 60 cm one giving details of each 
political party) and nine for each of the provinces for the 
provincial legislature elections indicating only the parties 
contesting the election in each province. 
  On election day, voters will have both hands dipped into 
marking fluid which is invisible but shows up under UV lights. 
That means no one who has been "dipped" can vote again. The 
dye washes off after about seven days.

<F P=106> [Report by Louise Flennegan] </F>
  [Text] Homeland administrations are crumbling on the eve of 
the elections with the public service in Venda almost 
non-existent and that in Bophuthatswana coming under tremendous 
strain. 
  With increasing restlessness among Bophuthatswana civil 
servants -- evident in the homeland this week -- there is every 
possibility that the public sector could soon be hit by a total 
strike, similar to that which crippled the Venda government. 
Late this week workers in the education, finance and audit 
departments threatened to join the industrial action as postal 
workers indicated that their strike would continue at least 
until mid-March. 
  And as the collapse of the Bophuthatswana administration 
loomed dangerously close, it emerged that yet another meeting 
between ANC [African National Congress] president Nelson Mandela 
and homeland leader Lucas Mangope was in the offing. It is 
expected that reincorporation of the homeland and free political 
activity will be high up on the agenda of the meeting, which is 
scheduled for sometime this week. 
  Although civil servants in Bophuthatswana have demanded the 
refund of their pensions, the restlessness seemed to be more a 
symptom of growing impatience among homeland residents with 
Mangope's resistance to reincorporation and participation in the 
Transitional Executive Council. Meanwhile, mediators in the 
Venda civil servants dispute over the multi-million pension fund 
scam were this week unable to find state officials to negotiate 
with as government offices remained deserted. Key government 
officials were said to have taken refuge in Johannesburg, 
hundreds of miles away from workers who want the millions of 
rands, handed out in pensions to senior government staff, to be 
repaid. 
  The collapse of key sections of government administration in 
Venda was precipitated by last week's mass march after which 
civil servants occupied control centres of sections of the 
homeland's security forces. Communication links were disrupted 
and police refused to intervene to restore order. 
  The civil service in both Ciskei and Transkei also seem to 
be 
gripped by uncertainty. "Everyone is panicking," said one 
Ciskei civil servant. In some offices everything from pens to 
computers are being stolen by civil servants desperate to make 
the most of the last few weeks. Officials seconded by South 
Africa to the homelands are worried about their positions -- 
there are about 360 in Ciskei alone. 
  In Transkei, seconded officials were told this week that the 
South African government did not know what would happen to them. 
  In Ciskei, new cars are allegedly still being handed out to 
bureaucrats who may no longer have top jobs in May. The Ciskei 
government recently confirmed the receipt of a fleet of 35 
brand-new Ford Meteors and Lasers for government officials. At

<F P=106> [Report by Norman Chandler] </F>
  [Text] The first observers from China, part of the UN team 
monitoring the election, have arrived in South Africa [SA]. It 
marks the first occasion on which representatives of the 
People's Republic of China have taken part officially in South 
African affairs. 
  The first two observers arrived last week with Tian Zengpei, 
Beijing's Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs. China made a 
specific request to the UN that, as one of the permanent members 
of the UN Security Council, it had a right to take part in the 
democratic election process in South Africa. 
  Pretoria and Beijing do not have formal diplomatic 
relations, 
but it has been reliably learnt that this is likely to change 
after the election. At present, the Republic of China (Taiwan) 
is recognised by Pretoria. Both countries, however, maintain 
"study centres" in South Africa. The centres are headed by 
senior career diplomats -- the former ambassador to Tanzania, 
Sun Guotong, heads the Chinese mission in Pretoria -- and deal 
with cultural matters and visa requirements. 
  China has purchased property for an embassy in Arcadia, 
Pretoria, as well as a house in the exclusive Waterkloof suburb 
as its official residence. China is currently mounting a major 
diplomatic offensive in southern Africa and has in recent months 
forged trade and cultural links with South Africa. 
  Various trade fairs have been held in SA and China -- the 
next is to take place in Pretoria in June -- while top 
government officials and trade missions have exchanged visits. 
Last year, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Renier Schoeman went 
to Beijing to formally open a South African "study centre."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Mandela's Call for Peace Prelude to `Tough Action' -- A 
page-16 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 1 March 
comments on two "major initiatives" to persuade the Freedom 
Alliance (FA) to participate in the April election. The first 
African National Congress (ANC)-National Party (NP) initiative, 
"which includes a move to extend the election registration 
deadline -- offers the FA an opportunity to reappraise its 
foolish and dangerous boycott tactic." The second initiative 
comes from Nelson Mandela, who has said: "`I will go down on my 
knees to beg those who want to drag our country into 
bloodshed...not to do so'." THE STAR believes Mandela's 
willingness to "adopt the position of supplicant begging for 
peace should not deceive his political opponents. It is not a 
sign of weakness, but a move by a strong man to prepare for 
tough action by showing that he has done his best to reach a 
compromise and avoid violence. Like the threat to restore the 
pre-colonial Zulu monarchy, Buthelezi's latest ploy -- of 
seeking a postponement of the April election in Natal and 
preserving the status quo there for the immediate future -- has 
no chance of success. By introducing yet another demand, he 
risks demonstrating beyond doubt that he will do anything to 
avid the verdict of the people at the polls. Unless he changes 
tack, his political epitaph will be that of a spoiler." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Need for Buthelezi `Conciliatory' Approach -- "It took a 
great deal of humility for Mandela, hardly a humble man, to say 
at an election rally on Sunday that he would be willing to `go 
down on my knees' before Buthelezi to plead with him to join the 
process," notes Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 1 March 
in a page-8 editorial. This permits Buthelezi "the opportunity 
to re-enter the political mainstream with dignity, perhaps even 
with the aura of a statesman." "What is required of Buthelezi 
at this stage, however, if he desires a reasonable deal, is that 
he adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the process even 
if he remains dissatisfied with the offer on the table." 
However, the chances of Buthelezi adopting that approach "seem 
doubtful," given "the new obstacles he has identified. First he 
said Inkatha would be unprepared for an April election even if 
all its constitutional demands were met. He then noted that the 
king's demands for an autonomous realm were paramount. The 
portents are not good." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  `Good Riddance' to Homelands -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 1 March in a page-8 editorial believes the collapse 
of the political infrastructure in Venda and Bophuthatswana "was 
to be expected considering the manner in which these homelands 
were created. It is a well known fact that the National Party 
created these tin pots states dictated by the political fraud 
that they were giving black political status in their `own 
homes'. The so-called independent black states also deprived 
millions of people of their South African citizenship." It is 
well to bid the homelands "good riddance" since the lives of 
many have been "wrecked and millions of rand have been wasted on 
the homelands." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  `Colonels' Conspiracy' Threatens Country -- Gerald Shaw 
writes in his "Political Survey" column on page 6 of Cape Town 
CAPE TIMES in English 25 February: "A military coup is not on 
the cards; neither is a civil war, we may hope, but there are 
elements in the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] and the 
Inkatha Freedom Party whose efforts to upset the apple cart 
should be taken seriously." Shaw writes that according to the 
weekend newspaper RAPPORT, "the new conspiracy -- let us call it 
the Colonels' conspiracy -- is taking shape in extreme secrecy, 
with generals Viljoen and Groenewald and other Volksfront 
leaders apparently not in the picture." Now the "claim for the 
restoration of the Zulu kingdom's 1834 boundaries, however it 
originated, is ripe for exploitation by the dark forces on the 
Right, and so is the drive to rally traditionalist Zulus behind 
King Goodwill Zwelithini and declare a Natal/kwaZulu UDI 
[unilateral declaration of independence]. This conscious 
exploitation of Zulu national pride has added an explosive 
element to a readily combustible mixture." 
<H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>
  Stop Promises of Afrikaner Homeland -- "While we support the 
efforts being made to bring Inkatha and the rightwingers on 
board the election train, we must question the wisdom of 
promising some Afrikaners a volkstaat [homeland]," declares a 
page-14 editorial in Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 27 
February. "Whatever the motives of the ANC are in this regard, 
we believe they are playing dangerous games by making the 
rightwingers even remotely believe they can have their own 
homeland." "Afrikaners, like it or not, are now part of a 
heterogeneous but unitary South Africa."

  [Text] The search for peace continues in the Zambian 
capital. The peace talks are to continue today with a second 
reading of the general document on national reconciliation that 
has been presented by the mediators. The National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and government teams held a 
plenary meeting yesterday, but no one knows what kind of 
progress may have been made. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Alicerces 
Valentim yesterday accused the Luanda Government of lacking 
seriousness in its approach to the national reconciliation 
dossier. Speaking to a Portuguese radio station, that UNITA 
official said that the central and provincial government posts 
Luanda intends to give UNITA amount to nothing more than a joke. 
UNITA has been asking for greater participation in the 
country's administrative organs as a [word indistinct] of its 
commitment to the Lusaka peace talks [words indistinct].

  [Text] Early this morning the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] carried out a violent attack on 
government forces in Ebo District. Bloody clashes are 
continuing. This was revealed by Antonio Augusto Torcato, deputy 
governor of Cuanza Sul for military issues. Speaking at a 
ceremony marking the 18th founding anniversary of the national 
police today, he said government forces stationed in the 
province are ready to neutralize any UNITA attempt. It will be 
recalled that over the weekend Cuanza Sul Provincial Governor 
Francisco Jose Ramos da Cruz condemned the infiltration of UNITA 
armed men in (Ambuiva), Seles District, as well as in the 
capitals of Porto Amboim and Sumbe districts, with the aim of 
raiding Sumbe and preventing free movement along the Porto 
Amboim-Luanda national road.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
president, presided over the opening of a four-day UNITA General 
Secretariat methodological seminar. This four-day seminar was 
the first of a series of three to be held this year. It closed 
on 26 February and was attended by 73 UNITA officials from 
Benguela, Bie, Cuanza Sul, Cunene, Moxico, and Huambo Provinces. 
The meeting discussed a number of issues connected with party 
operations. Lourenco Bento, the Voice of Resistance of the 
Black Cockerel correspondent in Huambo, has sent us this report: 
  [Begin Bento recording] [words indistinct] in addition to 
the 
government [as heard] delegates and guests, Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] General Staff officials, and party 
leadership officials. The (?opening ceremony) at the municipal 
administration conference hall was chaired by UNITA President 
Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, who invited those present to pay a 
deserved homage to the late Ivorian President Felix 
Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's greatest man and a close friend of 
UNITA. [passage omitted] 
  Our beloved President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi then 
introduced Engineer (Plaques), mayor of the city of Huambo, to 
those present at the meeting. [passage omitted] 
  Addressing this methodological seminar of the UNITA General 
Secretariat, President Dr. Jonas Savimbi began by describing 
Angola as a [word indistinct] country facing complex problems 
[words indistinct] Dr. Savimbi also mentioned the irreparable 
losses of UNITA Vice President Engineer Jeremias Chitunda, 
General Mango Alicerces, and Engineer Elias Salupeto Pena, who 
were massacred by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] in Luanda in 1992. [passage 
omitted] 
  Our beloved president also talked about our country's 
economic situation. In an allusion to injustices and the 
depletion of the country's economic resources by the regime 
currently in power, he described Angola as a (?country that is 
richer than its own people). He accused the MPLA-PT and its 
officials of continuing to be unwavering and intolerant 
communists. He promised that UNITA will continue to abide by 
principles of openness and tolerance. 
  The UNITA president noted once again that Huambo must not be 
the (?headquarters) of Angola's division. Huambo is just a 
rearguard base so they do not kill all of us, Dr. Jonas Savimbi 
said. He called on the cadres (?to be organized) and to look 
after human and material resources. This four-day seminar ended 
26 February. 
  During the seminar, the cadres discussed with honesty and in 
depth the problems faced by areas under their responsibility.

  [Text] Hundreds of people who claim that they suffered 
abuse during President Kamuzu Banda's three decades in office 
have banded together to demand compensation and an investigation 
into their complaints. The alleged victims are mainly political 
exiles, prisoners, and members of the Jehovah's Witness 
religious sect forced into exile into neighboring countries when 
their church was banned by the Government of Malawi in the 
1970s. Property running into millions of dollars was seized 
from members of the sect and taken over by the governing Malawi 
Congress Party or its now disbanded militia, the Malawi Young 
Pioneers. A former exile and now member of the opposition 
United Front for Multiparty Democracy, Mr. Frank Jiya, said that 
compensation would be seen as a symbol of apology and 
reconciliation to those who had suffered.

  [Text] A source close to the FAM/FPLM [Mozambique Armed 
Forces/Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique] 
representation in the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] confided to 
DOMINGO that "it does not make sense to try to dissociate the 
preelectoral campaign in South Africa from the ongoing events in 
Mozambique. Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] has been 
instructed to dismantle its units in the neighboring country. 
It is not too difficult to conclude that units of the political 
and military organization in South Africa and Kenya could be 
transferred from their training camps to Mozambique." 
  Last week, DOMINGO interviewed a senior government army 
officer in an attempt to confirm reports that some 5,000 Renamo 
men were being trained at a military base in Kenya. DOMINGO 
also asked the FAM/FPLM member to comment on the Renamo 
leadership's refusal to allow its withdrawal from the Salamanga 
state farm to be monitored. 
  [Unidentified FAM/FPLM officer] I have substantial and 
reliable information that confirms this: Renamo is training 
people in Kenya. Yet, I would like to stress that even in South 
Africa Renamo members in Phalaborwa and Sukuza could be crossing 
the Mozambican border. You should note, for instance, that from 
Salamanga to the border is about two hours on foot. That means 
Renamo units in South Africa can be moved in the dead of the 
night. 
  [DOMINGO] Do you confirm that? 
  [Officer] Like any other army, our intelligence services 
have 
confirmed it. Whoever wants to get the facts can do so. What 
we do not wish to accept is that Renamo should transfer its 
elements to Mozambique, regardless of their origin. After all, 
that is a violation of the General Peace Accord. 
  [DOMINGO] Pardon me, but the government has the details. Why 
has it not submitted them to the CCF, the body responsible for 
ensuring the end of hostilities? 
  [Officer] Look, very recently, General Ngonhamo burned 
himself with the story about Nampula, "Rex," and Nihia. It 
seems to me that there is a power struggle within Renamo. I am 
not concerned about that, but it could somehow influence the 
course of negotiations. You should note that Ngonhamo's 
appointment to the Joint Commission for the Formation of the 
Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [CCFADM] was a violation. It 
seems that the CCFADM is nonpartisan. So, I cannot see how Gen. 
Ngonhamo could have been appointed to the Supreme Command of a 
Mozambicann professional army. Moreover, this overlapping of 
tasks has been deferred by the Supervision and Control 
Commission! 
  [DOMINGO] What has that to do with Salamanga? 
  [Officer] It is very simple! But the answer is somewhat 
delicate! You should be aware that Ngonhamo belongs to the 
young generation of soldiers who fought FPLM. You should also 
note that I do not resent Renamo in any way. Yet, I would like 
to say that Renamo lacks cadres at all levels. Imagine what 
would have happened if Renamo had taken over Salamanga: What 
administrative apparatus would it have been able to put in place? 
  [DOMINGO] My question had to do with Salamanga alone, but 
what area in dispute?... 
  [Officer] Well, I have tried to explain all this philosophy 
-- the strategic and tactical aims behind the idea that 
Salamanga is an area of chronic and cyclical dispute. From what 
I have heard, Salamanga has nothing special in geophysical 
terms. What it has is military and strategic importance. Ask 
Renamo itself why it is so bent on staying in Salamanga. That 
means that only Renamo can explain its behavior. 
  [DOMINGO] But, as an FAM officer, what objectives do you 
think Renamo has in mind for Salamanga? 
  [Officer] I am no bureaucrat. I am a soldier and I deal with 
military operations. I see life in professional terms or, in 
other words, in terms of military strategy and tactics. I know 
that Renamo must withdraw from Salamanga. What I do not know is 
whether they will really settle in Chinhanguanine, an assembly 
area that was approved last year. In view of that, and not 
taking into account what I said earlier, I fail to see why they 
cannot move from Salamanga to Chinhanguanine. It is worth 
noting that those two areas are not even that far apart, so one 
cannot even mention transportation problems by way of excuse! 
  [DOMINGO] Does that mean that there are confidential 
reasons? 
  [Officer] I am not saying anything! I see things as they 
are. Renamo is afraid of what will happen in South Africa in 
the wake of the April elections, so it is trying to deactivate 
its forces in that neighboring country. It is a normal 
reaction. It does not know yet who is going to win, but a 
post-apartheid leader, from the African National Congress/South 
African Communist Party, for instance, will likely contest the 
presence of Renamo guerrillas in South Africa. 
  [DOMINGO] How? 
  [Officer] Just like this: Renamo needs Salamanga to house 
its 
forces currently in Sukuza and Phalaborwa. It is said that 
those training camps are now being used by Buthelezi's men in 
the Inkatha Freedom Party's armed wing. It is also said that 
the strongmen in Inkatha are Renamo people, or people who were 
trained by Renamo at the same time and in the same camps. The 
men involved in protection work, even in the Zulu "hostels" 
[preceding word in English] are Mozambicans connected with the 
Inkatha Freedom Party. 
  [DOMINGO] Are you not going a bit too far? 
  [Officer] I might have been, if we were not sure that 
Salamanga is just a farm owned by the state. Just imagine that 
the peace process grinds down to a halt here. What major 
offensive capabilities can you expect from Renamo assembly areas 
near the capital? What is more, Renamo rejected Salamanga as an 
area where the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] teams might be able 
to do dignified work. I can just imagine the headaches of 
Colonel Segala, of the CCF! [sentence as published] 
  [DOMINGO] And what about the government's headaches? 
  [Officer] It is true that the government has its own 
headaches, too. What I am going to say is an aside: We had to 
salute the Renamo guys in the military leadership course! From 
one day to the next, there was wholesale promotion of people to 
army officers! To give the course, they even needed an 
interpreter to translate the national languages into Portuguese! 
It is really too much! Yet, because of military discipline, we 
are forced to salute them left, right, and center! 
  [DOMINGO] So it should be on merit. 
  [Officer] That is how we would have liked it done. Look, now 
there are some diplomats who say that Lieutenant General Lagos 
does not have a conciliatory approach. Why? Is that not 
interference? For a start, it was Lagos who prevented Renamo 
dividing the country in the mid-1980's. Renamo's General 
Ngonhamo was Southern Region commander for several years. He 
worked with the late General Gomes. Naturally, you must know 
about the story of Nalazi and Changanine. Today, what matters 
is not what a certain officer did or was during the war. 
Rather, what matters is what that officer can mean to the 
national reconciliation effort. 
  [DOMINGO] Let us go back to the Salamanga issue: Why did we 
not come across a representative of the government, or of the 
government army? 
  [Officer] For a start, the Joint Administration Commission 
is 
in operation. There is only a short time to go before 
elections, and I fail to see the need for a new dispute. By 
that I mean that we -- on the government's side, obviously -- 
will be resettling there sooner or later. 
  [DOMINGO] What does Salamanga mean to you? 
  [Officer] It means nothing. It is a position, like any other 
position. Like Dunda, in Manica Province, or Savane, in Sofala 
Province, for example. It means absolutely nothing!

  [Text] Captain Joao Nhancumba, head of the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] team to the Cease-Fire Commission 
[CCF], has categorically denied reports that his movement is 
training men in South Africa. Such men had allegedly come from 
the former base at the state-owned farm in the Salamanga area. 
  Confronted with the statements made by Mozambique Liberation 
Front, Frelimo, Party first secretary to our newspaper last 
week, that Renamo soldiers were constantly involved in movements 
to South Africa, Capt. Nhancumba said: "That is false! It is 
true that our soldiers left the base and moved from one place to 
another, but they never crossed the border. It is likely that 
people have seen our men moving around and they may have thought 
they were crossing the border into South Africa." 
  Asked about a helicopter that the DOMINGO reporters had seen 
overfly at a low altitude the Renamo base at the state-owned 
farm in Salamanga, our interviewee said that "Renamo controls no 
air space whatsoever. What is more, I think everyone knows that 
we do not have any helicopters!" 
  Capt. Nhancumba also confirmed the complete withdrawal of 
his 
900 men from Salamanga and added they had moved to the 
Chinhaguanine assembly area. He explained that not all men are 
carrying weapons because Renamo did not have weapons for all its 
soldiers, adding that "during the war, we used to rotate our 
weapons among the men." 
  The Renamo team leader to the CCF also said that his 
movement 
is not removing weapons from assembly areas and taking them to 
the UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, regional depots because 
there are still many weapons in the hands of militia and 
paramilitary forces. 
  He said, by way of conclusion: "There has to be some sort of 
equilibrium between the government and Renamo concerning the 
arms collection process."

  [Text] NOTICIAS newspaper has learned from the UN 
Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] that the demobilization of 
government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] forces 
will no longer begin throughout Mozambican territory today. 
That is because Renamo has not yet delivered to Unomoz its 
lists with the names of men to be demobilized and to join the 
future national army. 
  The government has already turned over to Unomoz a number of 
lists containing the names of more than 10,000 soldiers.

from the government and Renamo left assembly areas to join the 
future Mozambique defense forces. A total of 341 of these 
troops belong to Renamo. The training of the first 5,000 
infantry troops will begin on 21 March.

<F P=106> [Report by D Isaacson] </F>
  [Text] Ulundi Feb 28 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela will be wasting his time if tries 
to persuade Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi to enter the April elections when they meet in Durban 
on Tuesday [1 March], the IFP president said on the eve of the 
summit. 
  Mr Buthelezi said he wanted to talk only peace with Mr 
Mandela. "There is no question of me being persuaded by him or 
anyone to ensure the IFP's participation in the elections," Mr 
Buthelezi said in a memorandum prepared for delivery to National 
Peace Secretariat Chairman Dr Antonie Gildenhuys in Ulundi on 
Monday. "I have nothing further to talk about on this issue, 
particularly with Mr Mandela...I hope he does not waste his time 
by trying to persuade me to accept this." 
  Mr Buthelezi said Tuesday's meeting was a follow-up to their 
peace summit in June last year when they agreed, among other 
things, to address rallies together. But this had not happened, 
he said, in spite of meeting ANC Chairman and Deputy 
Secretary-General Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma in September, 1993 
when they discussed possible dates for the joint public 
addresses. "I gave them October 16 and 17 as being possible 
dates...I have heard nothing further from them until last week 
when Mr Zuma contacted me about tomorrow's (Tuesday's) meeting." 
  Mr Buthelezi criticised Mr Mandela for what he described as 
an offensive statement that he, Mr Mandela, was prepared to go 
on his knees to the IFP president to prevent bloodshed. "The 
insinuation...that I am responsible for the bloodshed, I throw 
at him with the contempt that it deserves." 
  Mr Mandela was also reported as saying he wanted to persuade 
Mr Buthelezi to participate in the April poll. "I am prepared 
to co-operate with Mr Mandela in any efforts that we agree can 
end or reduce the levels of violence," Mr Buthelezi said. 
  On the election, the IFP leader said his party would not 
participate because of the interim constitution which did not 
allow regions to have exclusive powers. He said Mr Mandela had 
also told him during their June meeting the ANC was opposed to a 
federal system. "We do not accept the constitution. We do not 
intend entering the elections. And indeed we oppose the 
constitution and the election with every democratic means at our 
disposal." 
  But, Mr Buthelezi said, he alone could not make a decision 
to 
participate in the elections. "It is an IFP matter as much as 
it is a Freedom Alliance issue. I want there to be no illusions 
about this, and understanding this before our meeting tomorrow 
will contribute a lot to making our meeting fruitful and 
meaningful."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good evening! Some progress has been reached in the 
discussions of specific principles and modalities on national 
reconciliation. Some sources said today that agreement had been 
reached in more than half of the issues on specific principles 
and modalities. The sources said agreements had been reached on 
issues, such as administrative centralization and the 
participation of the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] in the country's administration. What now 
remains is the definition of the percentage of UNITA's 
participation in the central and provincial governments and the 
news media. Other issues still to be discussed are connected 
with the Constitution of the Republic, the granting of a special 
status to Jonas Savimbi, and the recovery of UNITA's property. 
  Meanwhile, another reliable source in the peace talks 
neither 
confirmed nor denied this information. He said, however, that 
an agreement on specific principles and modalities could be 
reached this week. If this agreement is reached, the parties 
will once and for all resolve the national reconciliation issue. 
Once this is done, the peace talks will have practically been 
concluded, since the next issue will be the mandate of the UN 
Angola Verification Mission, which is already at an advanced 
stage. A special envoy of Bill Clinton arrives in Lusaka 
tomorrow to work for some days with Alioune Blondin Beye, 
special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, to 
prepare U.S. participation in economic and humanitarian 
assistance to Angola after the coming into force of the 
cease-fire. Bill Clinton's special envoy is expected to meet 
with [words indistinct]. 
  Here in Lusaka, reports say the government has already 
reached an agreement with the mediators and observers on all 
issues [words indistinct] by the mediators on specific 
principles and modalities on national reconciliation, but UNITA 
has not yet [words indistinct]. It worked alone during the 
second half of this afternoon to once again examine the document 
from the mediators and observers.

  [Excerpts] Libreville, 1 March (AFP) -- The UN Economic 
Commission for Africa (CEA) said Tuesday [1 March] that the CFA 
franc, used in 14 African countries, might be devalued again if 
the 50 percent devaluation on January 11 did not boost growth. 
The African franc zone "will not be safe from a new 
devaluation" over the next few years if it is the "most 
realistic" option for promoting long-term macro-economic growth, 
a study published by the CEA Tuesday said. [passage omitted] 
  In a study on the macro-economic effects of the CFA franc's 
devaluation, published during the fifth meeting of African 
finance ministers which opened in Libreville on Tuesday, the CEA 
cautioned, however, that despite the "numerous studies on the 
subject, one cannot say with certainty if devaluation is an 
efficient measure or not." 
  The study predicted three possible scenarios for the 
development of the 14 affected economies over the next six 
years. The "most realistic of the three" calculated a 50 
percent increase in domestic prices in the first year, a 
permanent five percent increase in annual public spending, a 
thirty percent increase in foreign capital flows in the first 
year and a stabilisation at 18 percent in the following years. 
  The devaluation would provoke a short-term increase in 
production with a growth in gross domestic product at 7.8 
percent in the first year, thanks to a 39.7 percent boost to 
exports, the CEA said, confirmed by a rise in exports from Cote 
d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso since January French officials at the 
meeting said. 
  However, after the first year, the outlook will deteriorate, 
the CEA said, and in the long term there would be a "net slowing 
of growth," due mainly to inflation slowing down exports, 
increasing trade deficits and cutting funds available for 
investment and production. "In fact, the long term model gives 
production figures which are almost unchanged from those that 
would have been seen if no devaluation had taken place," the CEA 
said 
  The effect of the devaluation on the region's trade balance 
was also doubtful, because of the rise in prices, the CEA said. 
At the end of six years, "national output will become less and 
less competitive and imports less and less expensive," the CEA 
said, ending up in "a continuing degradation in the trade 
balance". 
  In total, "the direct expansionist effect of the devaluation 
on the whole of the economies of the franc zone will be wiped 
out in the long term," the study said, predicting another 
devaluation to follow. 
  CEA Executive Secretary, the Algerian Layashi Yaker opened 
the African finance ministers' meeting warning that "poverty was 
developing" on the continent which was facing a "spiralling rise 
in unemployment". After the "lost" decade of the 1980s, Africa 
had not started out any better in the 1990s, he said, with an 
average growth in output of 1.5 percent since 1990, less than 
half the rate of growth of the population. Debt problems have 
continued to grow, Yaker said. "Why have ten years of 
structural adjustment not succeeded in bringing Africa out of 
the crisis?" Yaker asked, saying it was the "central" question 
for the continent. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The first round of the fifth session of the 
conference of African finance ministers has opened in 
Libreville. There are many items on the agenda. They include 
the project to create an African Monetary Fund, the mobilization 
of resources, the basing of African currencies on European 
currencies which, in fact, calls for the adoption of a unique 
currency. Despite the diversity of the topics and the problems 
involved, we are forced to admit that the main problem remains 
getting Africa out of this quagmire. This bleak situation made 
an authority on African affairs, Professor Rene Dumont, to say 
in the 1960's that black Africa is on the wrong path. All the 
same, structural adjustment programs were not lacking. Here, 
Layashi Yaker, executive secretary of the United Nations 
Economic Commission for Africa speaks out: 
  [Begin recording] The orthodox structural adjustment program 
can succeed in Africa only with the redefinition and the 
strengthening of the role which governments must play in the 
area of adjustment to favor greater public investment in the 
provision of infrastructure, the generation of capital, and the 
development of basic agricultural technology. This must lead to 
abundance and the adoption of a credible economic policy that 
will favor private sector participation and ensure better 
implementation of the program, better management, and political 
stability. [end recording]

  [Text] Good evening! The discussions of specific 
principles and modalities of national reconciliation are still 
at an edge. The parties have not yet reached an agreement 
because of two issues, which we do not know because of news 
blackout. What we know is that the document under discussion 
has 16 points and an agreement has already been reached on 14 
points. According to a source, the parties have yet to reach 
agreement on fundamental issues for national reconciliation. 
Other reports say agreements have already been reached on 
issues, such as administrative decentralization and the 
participation of the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] in the country's administration.

  [Text] According to the UN, 25,000 people were killed in 
Cuito, in the center of the country, in 1993, in clashes between 
the regular army and rebels. UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi said in an 
interview with AFP today that he ruled out the military victory 
of one side or the other. He called for a global cease-fire. 
[passage omitted] 
  Still about Angola, let us go back to the situation there in 
the light of the visit the Angolan head of state, Mr. dos 
Santos, made to Paris. We heard today that President dos Santos 
received N'zita Henrique Tiago, the leader of the FLEC-FAC 
[Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave--Armed Forces 
of Cabinda] a few days ago, on the occasion of his official 
visit in France. The FLEC-FAC is one of the branches fighting 
for the independence of Cabinda. It is the first time that the 
Angolan president has met the leader of the FLEC-FAC, one of the 
two movements on Cabinda territory. Farida Ayari reports: 
  [Ayari] During a 45-minute meeting with N'zita Henrique 
Tiago, President dos Santos suggested a cease-fire to the 
FLEC-FAC leader, so that negotiations on the future of Cabinda 
could be started. N'zita Tiago welcomed this proposal. He asked 
the Angolan head of state to send him an official letter to 
confirm his position. 
  The FLEC-FAC leader reiterated the demands of his movement, 
that is, the evacuation of Cabinda territory by the Angolan 
political and military forces, the organization of a referendum 
on self- determination, and the establishment of Cabindan 
institutions. 
  Jose Eduardo dos Santos pointed out that there were other 
FLEC branches and said that it was necessary to take everyone's 
opinion into account. 
  In this respect, N'zita Tiago asked the Angolan president to 
withdraw his troops from the north and the center of Cabinda, so 
that a conference with all Cabindan political movements could be 
organized in the enclave. The aim of the conference would be to 
reach a common position, which would then be presented to the 
Angolan government. 
  This meeting at the top is vital because the FLEC-FAC -- 
and, 
to a lesser extent, Jose Tiburcio Luemba's renovated FLEC -- is 
the most significant Cabindan movement fighting for 
independence. It is also the only one controlling territories 
in the Cabinda enclave, which produces 60 percent of Angolan oil.

  [Text] Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings left Luanda for 
his country a few moments ago. Jerry Rawlings made a one-hour 
technical stopover in our country after attending the official 
handing over of Walvis Bay to Namibia. Presidents Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos and Jerry Rawlings took the opportunity to review the 
situation in Angola and Ghana. Shortly before his departure, 
Jerry Rawlings told the press that the Angolan Government has 
been taking a generous stand in the Angolan conflict. 
  [Begin Rawlings recording, in English fading into Portuguese 
translation] After listening to President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos, I think the Angolan Government has taken a very generous 
stand in the Angolan conflict, which has already killed 
thousands of people. Because of the unjust war carried out by 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], 
the Angolan people continue to suffer. It is imperative that 
UNITA negotiates seriously to find a solution that would bring 
lasting peace to Angola. [end recording]

  [Text] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo from the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] told Radio Mozambique 
this afternoon that his movement handed the list of men to be 
demobilized to the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] on 27 
February. Ngonhamo said the list was handed in at the Unomoz 
headquarters' reception in Maputo, but the people who received 
it there did not pass it in time to the Unomoz Technical 
Demobilization Unit. 
  The Renamo senior official early this afternoon left for 
Maringue where he will select a group of 25 officers from his 
movement to take part in the second leadership course for the 
future Mozambique armed forces. He also revealed that Renamo 
troops have already begun to be transferred to the Dondo and 
Manhica training centers to join the new unified army. 
  Ngonhamo pointed out that preparations for the beginning of 
a 
military logistics course in Maputo and the training of marines 
at Catembe are already at an advanced stage. Ngonhamo also said 
that his movement now possesses a complete list of men for a 
special forces course in Nacala.

  [Text] Harare March 2 SAPA -- Signs of tension between 
Zimbabwe and Ethiopia are beginning to show over the Ethiopian 
Government's request for the extradition of former dictator and 
alleged mass murderer Mengistu Haile Mariam. 
  Last week Ethiopian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Fantahun Michael 
announced that he had formally lodged documents for the 
repatriation of Mengistu, who has been granted political asylum 
by President Robert Mugabe, once a close friend of the former 
Marxist despot. 
  Mr Michael said Mengistu was wanted in Addis Ababa to answer 
charges that he was responsible for the deaths of up to 100,000 
people and "general crimes against humanity" during his 12-year 
regime. 
  But Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira has 
expressed annoyance at the affair, telling THE HERALD, the 
country's main daily newspaper: "I don't like what the 
ambassador is doing, negotiating through the press". 
  Mengistu has also strained his relations with his hosts, who 
allowed him to live in Zimbabawe on condition that he kept out 
of politics. Three weeks ago Mr Shamuyarira had to rebuke 
Mengistu, telling him to "shut up or get out" after the "butcher 
of Addis" issued a long letter to the local press in which he 
said he was ready to go to the "rescue" of his country. 
  Despite the rebuke, Mengistu last weekend issued another 
statement in which he appeared to snub the Zimbabwe Government, 
saying it was "totally unacceptable, intolerable and unbearable" 
for him to "stand by and see the country bleed". 
  Mr Mengistu flew to Zimbabwe under cover of darkness in May 
1991 as rebel forces were about to seize Addis Ababa.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Nicephore Soglo by Gerard Nicaud; </F>
place and date not given: "Not All Reforms Are Possible"] 
  [Text] [Nicaud] Mr. President, is it possible to make an 
initial assessment of the devaluation of the CFA franc, almost 
two months on? 
  [Soglo] The effects started well before that. When the new 
majority came to power in France and when Mr. Balladur's letter 
arrived (in mid-September last year), there was great 
speculation. So much so that the devaluation was called the 
"tom-tom devaluation." No devaluation has ever been discussed 
for so many years. But there had been no preparations for it. 
Things speeded up over recent months, to such an extent that 
the exodus of capital finally reached 1 billion CFA francs per 
day. That is unreasonable and was very costly. 
  [Nicaud] At what point did devaluation seem inevitable? 
  [Soglo] Back in April 1992, the French prime minister 
visited Cameroon. Then four African heads of state came to 
France and met with President Mitterrand (31 July 1992). It was 
then that we really began to be aware of the scale of the 
problem. We did the accounts and noticed that many African 
countries had huge arrears in the payment of their debt. So, 
what happened? France settled the arrears with the IMF or the 
World Bank. In other words, this money did not profit the 
French enterprises or African countries. That was when we 
really realized that there was no other way out. 
<H5>  Feeling of Abandonment </H5>
  [Nicaud] Before you became president of Benin, you were vice 
president of the World Bank. Does this mean that you were in 
favor of devaluing the CFA franc from the start? 
  [Soglo] When we began to talk of devaluation, Benin was the 
only country in the area to have an adjustment plan. We were 
therefore relatively at ease. In fact, our situation would have 
enabled us only to devalue by between 20 and 30 percent. But 
the economy of some countries, like Cameroon, the Congo, Niger, 
and the Cote d'Ivoire were in such a state that we had to go to 
50 percent. We therefore agreed out of solidarity. There would 
be no point in leaving the group midstream. 
  The fact remains that the Dakar meeting in January was one 
of 
the most difficult that I have had to attend. France then told 
its African partners: "If you do not want to devalue, that is 
your right, but you will have to reach agreement with the IMF 
and World Bank" (to negotiate structural readjustment agreements 
and aid). That said it all. 
  [Nicaud] Did you feel betrayed? 
  [Soglo] In this kind of meeting, the dimension is not just 
economic and monetary, it is also emotional. Some African heads 
of state had the impression that France was abandoning them. 
That was also very difficult to explain to the population, even 
if this devaluation enables us to win back our internal markets, 
especially in the agricultural sphere. In addition, this was 
not the first devaluation of the CFA franc. In the past, it was 
devalued several times following devaluations of the French 
franc. This time, what people dislike is the divorce between 
the CFA franc and the French franc. Once we realized that it 
was inevitable, we began to negotiate accompanying measures. 
And that took a long time.... 
<H5>  Democratization and Economic Reforms </H5>
  [Nicaud] Judging by the demonstrations and riots that have 
taken place in several countries in the Franc Zone -- Togo, 
Senegal, and Gabon -- in the past few weeks, these measures seem 
inadequate... 
  [Soglo] We must look at things from three angles: the past, 
the present, and the future. The past is the debt. From the 
viewpoint of bilateral aid, France has canceled this debt in 
full for the least developed countries and by 50 percent for the 
countries with moderate revenues. That leaves the multilateral 
debt. I have just returned from Japan, where I tackled this 
problem, and I also know that the Americans are ready to make an 
effort within the Paris Club (which brings together the main 
creditor countries). 
  The present is inflation, in other words the housewife's 
shopping basket. To absorb the inflationary effects of 
devaluation, the state must play its role. It must ensure that 
the essential products imported (oil, sugar, milk, cement, 
pharmaceutical products...) do not increase too much. To do 
this we have asked the World Bank for permission to subsidize 
them for a short time because the increase would be too high. 
But the state cannot stand alone. Everybody must play his part: 
For instance, we have asked the enterprises to reduce their 
profit margins (many of them had built up stocks before the 
devaluation), and the employees not to ask for wage increases 
which are too high (the negotiations are not yet over). 
  The future is investment. A rate of 10 percent (compared 
with GDP) only just makes it possible to maintain the existing 
equipment. It must reach 20 percent. In Benin we have gone from 
13 percent to 18 percent and more. The problem is that in 
Africa we must simultaneously do two things which are generally 
regarded as incompatible: democratization and economic reforms. 
In many cases, the latter is done first and once that stage has 
been completed, there is democratization. We have seen that 
with several countries, Chile, Turkey, and now China. 
  When I left the World Bank to become president of Benin, I 
found myself in the field, so to speak. And I can now say to my 
former colleagues, paraphrasing Catherine of Russia: "Take care: 
You are working on a sheet of paper which has no feeling, and I 
am working on human skin which is very sensitive." In other 
words, the people in those institutions must wake up to what is 
feasible and what is not immediately feasible.

  [Text] Monrovia, 1 Mar (AFP) -- The deployment of Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group 
[ECOMOG] troops began today throughout the country in order to 
carry out the 7 March disarmament of all the factions fighting 
since December 1989, according to ECOMOG Commander General John 
Inienger in Monrovia. The troops are accompanied by UN military 
observers. 
  In a communique, Gen. Inienger stated that the various 
factions expressed the will to withdraw from the frontlines as 
of today. "I approved this decision and ordered the ECOMOG 
troops to be deployed immediately in those regions," he 
explained. This initiative constitutes "a great stride toward 
peace," the ECOMOG commander commented. He specified that 1,700 
Ugandan and Tanzanian soldiers would be positioned in the 
country's northeastern regions under the control of the National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], the main armed faction. 
  Concerning the deployment of the other contingents, sources 
close to the ECOMOG indicate that the Nigerians would be 
dispatched to the country's southeastern areas where an armed 
militia, the Liberian Peace Council, has been trying since 
September 1993 to be established much to the detriment of the 
NPFL. The Ghanaians will be dispatched to western and 
northwestern regions which are dominated by the United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia, the NPFL's rival 
faction. Finally, Monrovia and its region, administered by the 
Interim Government of National Union and the Armed Forces of 
Liberia, will be placed under the responsibility of the Guinean 
contingent of ECOMOG. The role to be played by the Sierra 
Leonean, Gambian, and Malian elements of the force was not 
specified. 
  According to the estimations of the National Readjustment 
Commission, some 60,000 fighters from all sides are expected to 
be disarmed and demobilized as of 7 March. Simultaneously, 
transitional institutions will officially assume office, and 
their mission will be to lead the country to free elections in 
September. According to UN estimates, the Liberian civil war has 
claimed 150,000 lives since it began in December 1989.

  [Text] Lagos, March 1 (AFP) -- The Nigerian government and 
media have expressed suspicion at the arrival in Cameroon of 
French troops and a high-ranking French diplomatic team to 
discuss a bloody border dispute between the West African 
neighbours. 
  "We are a bit suspicious of what really the French 
intentions 
are," a senior Nigerian official who asked not to be named told 
AFP on Tuesday [1 March], a day after the French delegation held 
talks with Cameroon's President Paul Biya in Yaounde. "Because 
whatever the French interest in Nigeria may be, and of course, 
there is a lot of interest here, the one in Cameroon and 
certainly in the French-speaking West Africa for them is more 
fundamental and critical," he said. "Certainly their 
involvement could not be good news for Nigeria at all," he 
added. I think we certainly have to play diplomacy. But at the 
same time, we have to look at the security and military 
implications of French intervention so as not to be caught 
unawares." 
  France on Sunday despatched a contingent of 30 paratroops 
and 
two Puma helicopters to Cameroon, which disputes control of the 
Bakassi peninsula on the border, believed to be rich in oil and 
fish, with Nigeria. Each side blames the other for fighting 
there last month. Cameroon alleges that Nigerian soldiers have 
invaded the area and attacked Cameroonian gendarmes, but Lagos 
charges that the Cameroonian paramilitary police have been 
attacking and harassing ethnic Nigerian fishermen, forcing 
several thousand to flee. 
  "French troops sent to repel Nigeria," the independent 
VANGUARD newspaper reported Tuesday in a headline typical of the 
general tone of the press, which expressed misgivings at the 
move. 
  Cameroonian television said the French troops were 
"essentially on an exploratory mission" and a French foreign 
ministry spokeswoman promised an even-handed approach from the 
team from Paris, led by General Christian Quesnot of the general 
staff and Bruno Delaye, President Francois Mitterrand's African 
affairs advisor. 
  Nigerian Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe planned 
Wednesday 
to hold a "very comprehensive" press briefing on the issue, a 
foreign ministry spokesman told AFP here on Tuesday. Kingibe 
warned Monday in the Nigerian capital Abuja that France "will 
take full responsibility for internationalising" the conflict 
and also shoulder the blame for the "attendant consequences" of 
an escalation of the dispute. 
  The French foreign ministry spokeswoman said that the team 
from Paris was expected to fly on from Yaounde to Abuja for 
talks with Nigeria's military ruler, General Sani Abacha, after 
its consultations with Biya, in a bid "to keep the peace" and 
find ways "to resolve the dispute as soon as possible in 
accordance with international law." But there was no indication 
Tuesday as to when the French delegation might meet the Nigerian 
leader. 
  In an editorial Tuesday, the DAILY TIMES said: "We stated in 
the past that Nigeria is not an imperialist country and that we 
seek the wellbeing of ourselves and fellow Africans. We still 
stand by that declaration except that there comes a time when a 
nation must stand up for its legitimate right. "That time is 
here." 
  In another development, the European Union (EU) called 
Tuesday for international arbitration into the dispute and 
expressed "grave concern" at the "skirmishes" talking place in 
the border region. "The EU urges the governments of Nigeria and 
Cameroun to seek a solution to the dispute, through arbitration 
or mediation of any regional or international organisation," a 
statement issued by the Greek embassy here said. Greece 
currently holds the presidency of the Union. 
  The Union also called for the immediate withdrawal of troops 
concentrated on one side of the frontier line, the statement 
added, without indicating which side.

  [Text] Lagos, 1 Mar (PANA) -- Nigeria on Tuesday [1 March] 
reasserted its claim to the Bakassi Peninsula, a major bone of 
contention with neigbouring Cameroon. Nigeria's military 
leader, General Sani Abacha told a French delegation that his 
country had always maintained a police post in the disputed area 
and conducted population census there. An official statement 
after a closed-door meeting in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, quoted 
Abacha as saying his government's concern is the security of 
Nigerians who form 96 percent of the residents of the area. 
  The four-man French Government delegation was led by Bruno 
Delaye, special adviser to President Francois Mitterrand. The 
team met with Cameroonian President Paul Biya in Yaounde Monday. 
  France has also sent 30 paratroopers to Cameroon under a 
defence pact following reported clashes between Nigerian and 
Cameroonian troops on 18 and 19 February. Abacha said that the 
presence of Nigerian soldiers in the area was to forestall 
communal clashes between Nigeria's communities in the 
south-eastern states of Akwa Ibom and Cross River. He said 
Nigeria has no territorial ambitions. 
  He restated that the dispute could be resolved amicably 
without external assistance. "The two peoples are brothers from 
time immemorial and were only separated by colonial boundaries a 
few years ago," the statement quoted Abacha as saying. 
  Abacha said a machinery had been put in place to implement a 
suggestion by the French delegation that Nigeria and Cameroon 
should discuss the problem during a scheduled meeting between 
their two leaders. The statement quoted Delaye as telling 
Abacha that French paratroopers were in Cameroon only to honour 
the defence pact between the two countries. 
  He said that France wanted the two neighbours, both of whom 
have cordial relations with France, to resolve their differences 
amicably. Speaking to State House correspondents after a 
closed- door meeting, the French envoy said "we are here to help 
and not to create problems." 
  Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Baba Gana Kingibe, told 
reporters there was determination and commitment on both sides 
towards resolving the issue through dialogue. "We are looking 
forward to the proposed summit of the two heads of states. The 
sooner it takes place the sooner we find our way forward towards 
finding a solution", he said. He said the presence of French 
delegation here in Abuja is in no way an indication of their 
involvement in our on-going negotiation with Cameroon. 
  Kingibe warned on Monday that French military intervention 
could escalate the conflict.

  [Text] A four-man French delegation, led by Monsieur Bruno 
Delaye, an adviser to the French president, Francois Mitterrand, 
was in Aso Rock, Abuja, today to deliver a special message from 
the French president. The message was in connection with 
developments in the Bakassi peninsula. State House 
Correspondent Chris Ngu reports: 
  [Ngu] General Abacha told a four-man French delegation, led 
by Mr. Bruno Delaye, President Mitterrand's adviser on African 
affairs and ecology, that Nigeria's concern in the disputed 
Bakassi peninsula is the security of Nigerians who form 96 
percent of residents of the area. The head of state explained 
that the presence of Nigerian soldiers there is to prevent 
clashes between communities in Akwa Ibom and Cross River states, 
both in Nigeria. He restated Nigeria's commitment to peaceful 
coexistence worldwide. 
  On claims and counter claims of authority over the 
peninsula, 
Gen. Abacha told the delegation that evidence of history showed 
that the disputed area for long had Nigerian presence in the 
form of a police post. Not only that, several census exercises 
have been conducted in the area by Nigerian authorities. The 
head of state reaffirmed his belief that the dispute could be 
resolved amicably without foreign assistance. 
  Mr. Delaye had explained that French paratroopers were in 
the 
Cameroon only to honor the defense pact between France and the 
Cameroon. Mr. Delaye and Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, 
Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, later walked into a waiting party 
of State House correspondent. Mr. Delaye was not forthcoming 
with answers to questions. That way he left Nigeria's foreign 
minister to do the talking. 
  [Begin recording] [Delaye] I am not prepared to make 
comments 
now, [words indistint] I am not the minister. 
  [Kingibe] Mr. Delaye, who is the special adviser to the 
president of France, accompanied by his delegation, has come to 
see the head of state with a message from the president of 
France conveying to the Nigerian authorities the observations of 
the French authorities on the ongoing situation in the Bakassi 
and on the general relationship between Nigeria and France. I 
think that is .... [pauses] Mr. Delaye said he had very useful 
discussions during his visit to Abuja and I think that they will 
now go towards a resolution of the problem in the way that will 
be satisfactory to all concerned. Well, at least there is a 
determination in that commitment on both sides, it seems, but 
definitely on our side, for a peaceful resolution of the problem 
through dialogue. And there is this proposed summit of the two 
heads of state to which we were looking forward and for which we 
were prepared and the sooner this summit takes place, the sooner 
we will find our way forward towards finding a solution. [end 
recording]

  [Text] A major raid has been carried out in Senegal. 
Police forces and the gendarmerie arrested more than 1,000 
people in Dakar yesterday. Nicolas Balique reports: 
  [Balique] A total of 1,262 people were arrested for 
questioning during the operation, a major roundup which required 
almost 1,000 men during the Sunday [27 February] night. Given 
the number of arrests -- some for mere identity checks, others 
for drug trafficking, prostitution or possession of knives -- 
this cannot be called a routine operation. It is rather an 
operation carried out within the framework of an all-out policy 
of firmness after the trauma of the bloody events of 16 
February. Forty-eight hours after the raid, it must be pointed 
out that a similar raid, which was carried out in the caves of 
Dakar seafront, led to the arrest of more than 150 dropouts, 
including armed bandits from the subregion, Guinea, Gambia, or 
Liberia. Meanwhile, the inquiry into the violence of Black 
Wednesday [16 February] is continuing, the religious movement 
Moustarchidine has been banned, and the two main opposition 
leaders have been placed under committal order. Some are 
wondering whether this latest raid will not be a mere flash in 
the pan. In any case, the authorities do not think so. This is 
Nicolas Balique in Dakar for RFI.

  [Text] Lome, 28 Feb (AFP) -- Togo's electoral authority has 
given the Supreme Court complete results from the second round 
of a general election held on February 20, court President 
Emmanuel Apedoh said Tuesday [1 March]. The opposition to 
President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who has ruled the small West 
African country for 27 years, claims to have won the poll, 
taking 43 of the 81 national assembly seats, which would entitle 
it to form a government. But Eyadema's supporters have alleged 
irregularities and stated that they want the results annulled in 
five of the constituencies the opposition declared it has won. 
  The Supreme Court, which received the results from the 
National Electoral Commission on Monday, now has two weeks 
officially to release them and rule on any eventual annulments. 
The poll came after years of unrest, which claimed scores of 
lives and saw thousands of people flee the country, following a 
national conference in 1991 to pave the way for multi-party 
politics.

  [Text] The Burundi Government has reiterated its 
determination to restore peace and put an end to the massacres 
in the country. This determination was expressed today by the 
minister of state for external relations, Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, 
before the UN Commission for Human Rights. The ending of the 
massacres and the restoration of peace in Burundi [words 
indistinct] all the state institutions starting up again. 
Minister Ngendahayo stressed the pluralist character of the new 
government and said it intended to rely on an awareness campaign 
for the people to inspire respect for human rights and tolerance 
to restore peace in Burundi. 
  However, it is worth noting that the mood now prevailing in 
Bujumbura, the capital, is far from relaxed, as gunshots were 
heard last night resulting in two policemen wounded. These 
incidents prevented the reopening of schools in the Burundian 
capital.

  [Text] Cameroon has officially requested an emergency UN 
Security Council meeting following, I quote, the brutal attacks 
launched recently by the Nigerian Armed Forces in the border 
Bakassi Peninsula. In a letter addressed to the Security 
Council, which was made public in New York yesterday, 
Cameroonian Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono said that on 18 
February, the Nigerian Armed Forces launched brutal attacks 
against Cameroonian troops stationed at Bakassi Peninsula in 
violation of the territorial integrity of Cameroon. My 
government reiterates its determination to resolve this dispute 
through peaceful means in full compliance with the objectives 
and principles of the UN Charter, Oyono stated adding that 
Cameroon will continue to seek the appropriate international 
channels for resolving this issue. 
  Meanwhile, French diplomacy has been activated. After 
Yaounde, a French diplomatic and military delegation went to 
Abuja, Nigeria, where it met with President Sani Abacha. 
Nothing filtered from that meeting but it is known that the 
Nigerian Government stated yesterday that this conflict could be 
resolved bilaterally. The same feelings are shared by the 
radical Cameroonian opposition. Social Democratic Front Chairman 
John Fru Ndi still believes in dialogue in order to prevent the 
worst. We have on the line, Mr. Fru Ndi whose statement is 
translated by Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou. 
  [Begin Fru Ndi recording, in English with superimposed 
translation into French] I do not think that Cameroon's border 
problems with our neighbors Nigeria, Chad, or others should lead 
to a civil war. I think we should hold dialogue with those 
countries in the African way and we should try to resolve the 
problems of our border peoples, but if we have to resort to war 
it will only result in dividing our continent. I am convinced 
that the problem could be resolved at the OAU. In Cameroon, we 
have about 2 million Nigerians and in Nigeria we have some 
800,000 Cameroonians studying or doing business. Having said 
this, I believe good neighborliness must be encouraged instead 
of seeking to provoke a civil war that will divide our people.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 1 Mar (AFP) -- The Congolese opposition 
coalition today accused the presidential group of violating the 
cease-fire agreement concluded on 30 January by deputies of the 
four regions of the southern part of the country for the 
restoration of peace in the Congolese capital. In a communique, 
the opposition claims that supporters of the presidential group 
continue to fire gunshots in the M'filou District in the 
southern part of the city, and continue to "kidnap and murder 
people suspected to be close to the opposition." 
  The opposition further asserts that in February more than 20 
of its supporters were "kidnapped or killed" by members of the 
ministerial reserve, a unit that is directly under the head of 
state. This reserve is "responsible for the insecurity in the 
northern district of the city" and on the Tsieme road leading to 
the northern part of the country, the communique adds. The 
opposition also adds that it has respected the cease-fire 
agreement by helping to restore traffic and the "gradual return" 
of displaced persons in the Bacongo and Makele-Kele districts 
which it controls. 
  On the other hand, the CONGOLESE NEWS AGENCY claimed 
yesterday that some 20 young men were enrolled in the opposition 
militia controlled by the former head of state, General Denis 
Sassou Nguesso, at Gamboma, in the center of the country, while 
five cases of ammunition were stolen from the Gamboma 
Non-Commissioned Officers School and sent by two soldiers to the 
northern part of the city, an area under the control of the 
opposition militia. 
  An official of the opposition has denied these reports.

  [Excerpts] After a meeting between representatives of the 
Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, the 
Republican Democratic Movement, the Social Democratic Party, the 
Liberal Party, and the Christian Democratic Party and the 
Rwandan head of state on Sunday, 27 February, the office of the 
president issued a communique in which the principal private 
secretary, Mr. Enoch Ruhigira, announced that the various 
political groups represented in the government now in place in 
Kigali had settled certain differences which had blocked the 
establishment of institutions in which the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] is to take part. According to the same communique, 
practically the only thing left is to fix the date to establish 
the new institutions, which will be done, according to the 
communique, after consultations are held with the RPF. 
  On Monday, 28 February, the RPF made known in a press 
release 
its reaction to Mr. Enoch Ruhigira's communique. It is a 
categorical refusal to take part in institutions which would 
only be an extension of the dictatorial rule of Major General 
Juvenal Habyarimana, and thus the very negation of the spirit of 
the agreements signed in Arusha seven months ago. The RPF 
communique reads as follows: 
  [Passage omitted] It was in a climate of fear that the 
leaders of these parties agreed on 27 February to decisions 
which they had rejected on 23 February. As it is clear that 
President Habyarimana resorted to terrorism and intimidation -- 
with the murder of one opposition leader and the massacres 
perpetrated throughout last week -- to weaken the leaders of 
these political parties, the RPF challenges the conclusions of 
the so-called compromises won by President Habyarimana under 
these conditions. 
  These compromises are all the more unacceptable as their 
spirit contradicts that of the Arusha peace accord, which was 
aimed at initiating radical reforms in the structures and 
functioning of the Rwandan state in order to eradicate the 
dictatorial practices President Habyarimana wants to safeguard 
by manipulating political parties, imposing on them elements 
loyal to him as representatives within these institutions. 
  The RPF once again condemns the barbarous acts perpetrated 
by 
militias in the pay of President Habyarimana and announces that 
it will not take part in a government put in place on the basis 
of compromises reached by means of terror. Concerning the 
deputies at the transitional national assembly, the RPF will not 
accept any list other than the one approved by the 
constitutional court on 4 January. Similarly, the RPF requests 
that the right of the prime minister-designate of the 
broad-based transitional government to choose the ministers for 
his government team -- as was planned for 5 February -- be 
restored before President Habyarimana launches a policy of 
escalating intimidation. [passage omitted] 
  Issued in Mulindi on 28 February 1994 
  Signed by Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, RPF chairman

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Kamal Hamdi: "Djibouti Opposition Leader </F>
Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Government Refusing To Conduct Peaceful 
Dialogue, Insisting on One-Party System] 
  [Text] Bonn--Ahmed Dini Ahmed, former Djibouti prime 
minister and leader of the the opposition "Union and Democracy 
Front" in Djibouti, is on a visit to Germany. During his visit 
he met with a number of German Foreign Ministry officials in 
Bonn. He also visited a number of Arab and Islamic embassies 
and diplomatic missions there to explain political, 
constitutional, economic, and social conditions in Djibouti as 
well as the present situation in the Horn of Africa, especially 
after the international forces' withdrawal from Somalia, and the 
future of east African states. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Ahmed Dini spoke about 
the ongoing civil war between the government and the opposition 
in Djibouti, pointing out that the opposition in his country 
started out peaceful, constitutional, and away from any aspects 
of violence. But it was forced to resort to the use of arms 
because it is impossible to reach an understanding with the 
government, which insists on establishing a one-party system, 
violating human rights, and implementing illegal random death 
sentences. 
  He added: 227 civilians have been executed in Djibouti so 
far. 
  Ahmed Dini Ahmed added: The opposition in Djibouti tried to 
open a dialogue with the government of President Hassan Gouled 
through the mediation of some Arab and other states, but the 
government rejected any peaceful dialogue and escalated military 
repressive measures. As a result, the opposition was forced to 
resort to fighting. Nevertheless, it is still looking for 
reasonable means to reopen a dialogue and initiate negotiation. 
  The Djibouti opposition leader, who headed the first 
independent government after independence in 1977, said that the 
opposition's aims are to establish a pluralistic, democratic 
system, to hold free and honest elections, to guarantee 
constitutional freedoms, to establish freedom of expression and 
the press, and to respect human rights. 
  Ahmed Dini Ahmed told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that he sensed from 
his contacts with officials in Bonn that Germany does not 
support the present regime in Djibouti because of its human 
right violations. And that the Federal Government has suspended 
its development aid to Djibouti since 1992, namely after the 
implication of the authorities and security men in the murder of 
54 oppositionists. 
  He said that Germany once offered the Djibouti Government a 
ferry for civilian use in Djibouti Port. But the government 
turned it into a military ship equipped with weapons and machine 
guns. When Djibouti refused to remove these weapons, Bonn 
announced the suspension of its financial, material, and 
security aid, keeping some development aid, especially in the 
area of water prospecting and irrigation and some agricultural 
development projects.

  [Text] Mogadishu, March 1 (AFP) -- Somali gunmen shot at 
American and Italian troops in seperate incidents on Tuesday [1 
March] as the last soldiers from a key US army unit left 
Mogadishu. 
  The withdrawal of the Falcon Brigade, left some 2,700 US 
troops in Somalia and some 4,000 others off-shore. The United 
States was due to complete its troop withdrawal from the 
war-ravaged country by the end of this month, amid fears that 
renewed clan-warfare could escalate. 
  A convoy of US troops came under fire near the Mogadishu 
port 
on Tuesday, while a group of Italian soldiers erecting tents for 
cholera victims in north Mogadishu were also shot at. UN 
officials said the Italians returned fire and wounded one 
Somali. None of the Americans was injured. 
  Also on Tuesday, occupants of a white Toyota Land Cruiser 
fired at a US sentry position at the new port area. 
  Last Sunday, about six Somalis jumped from a van and fired 
several shots into the American military compound. The 
Americans returned fire and seriously wounded two Somalis. 
  Meanwhile, a group of Somalis erected a roadblock near the 
green line in north Mogadishu.

  [Text] Durban March 1 SAPA -- IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi has again rejected participation 
in South Africa's first all-race election in April under the 
present constitution and says the election period should be 
"extended" while constitutional negotiation takes place. In a 
statement delivered to ANC [African National Congress] President 
Nelson Mandela at their meeting in Durban on Tuesday [1 March], 
the IFP president repeated the interim constitution was a 
"prescription for disaster". Mr Buthelezi said however he 
remained totally committed to a negotiated settlement. 
"Together we could relieve the prohibitive pressure of time 
and create a space to salvage failed negotiations. This would 
mean extending the election period and providing for mediation 
regarding the problems that are separating us." 
  Mr Buthelezi's memorandum, presented to Mr Mandela at the 
beginning of their Durban summit, was leaked to the media. Mr 
Buthelezi said that the failure to reach a comprehensive 
constitutional settlement "will have disastrous consequences, 
and no amount of talks in advance of tanks rolling down on 
Ulundi, or of white rightwing resistance being crushed, will 
justify the retention of the 1993 constitution as a [word 
indistinct] of the promise to come". 
  The IFP president said it was glib of some leaders to say 
that only elections would curb violence, adding: "There will not 
be stability, and democracy will not flow from what the ANC has 
done in an unholy alliance with the National Party and the 
government." 
  "The 1993 constitution...is fatally flawed. No amount of 
political dressage and no amount of constitutional rephrasing of 
the text around the fatal flaws can hide them." 
  In addition, there was the question of the transition 
process, said the IFP leader. "We reject the TEC (transitional 
executive council) and we reject the decisions it makes, and we 
will not be willing accomplices in implementing them." 
  He said there was a "very substantial" number of South 
Africans who rejected the constitution and the TEC. "How, Mr 
Mandela, do you think there can be fair and free elections when 
millions of South Africans reject the constitution under which 
it will be held? We are democrats, Mr Mandela, and we will 
exercise our democratic right to oppose a constitution we reject 
and to oppose the election under it." 
  On the issue of the Zulu monarchy, Mr Buthelezi said King 
Goodwill Zwelithini had noted the failure of negotiations to 
deliver a federal dispensation. "Zulus want their land back, 
and they now lay claim to it and they will not listen to any ANC 
talk about anything to the contrary." 
  Mr Buthelezi said the king's demand for a sovereign kingdom 
had made recent constitutional concessions "irrelevant". "They 
can only be seen to be treating the symptoms of the 
constitutional malady even within the drive for federalism. 
They do not address the concerns of his majesty." The Zulu 
people would not put themselves and their kingdom and ultimately 
their destiny in the hands of central government rule, said Mr 
Buthelezi. 
  He added that he would stand with his ANC counterpart in an 
attempt to end violence, adding that social reconstruction was 
an absolute prerequisite for addressing township and rural 
fighting.

  [Text] Durban March 1 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] is to consider provisionally registering for South 
Africa's April elections while both the IFP and African National 
Congress [ANC] are to explore possible international mediation 
to resolve outstanding constitutional deadlocks. This emerged 
after several hours of talks between ANC President Nelson 
Mandela and his IFP counterpart, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in Durban 
on Tuesday [1 March]. 
  "We've laid a solid foundation for possible breakthroughs," 
said Mr Mandela at a press conference after the meeting. "We 
have laid the ground plan for future progress." 
  On his party's stance on elections, Mr Buthelezi said: 
"Provisional (registration) means it leaves our options open. 
If a solution is found, it makes it possible for us to 
participate." He said the IFP was determined to contest 
elections, but he added that his party's demands, as contained 
in the Freedom Alliance's proposals late last year, had to be 
met. The Zulu king's demands also affected the IFP's 
participation in elections: "If we had a federal solution, the 
issue of the king would not have come up. We can in no way 
ignore it." 
  The question of provisional registration had to be taken to 
the IFP's Central Committee for ratification, he said. 
  Questioned on whether the IFP was closer to contesting 
elections, he responded: "Not at all." 
  On his party's proposals to have the elections postponed, Mr 
Buthelezi noted Mr Mandela and State President F W de Klerk had 
made it clear this would not happen. But, he said, "we have not 
even started campaigning...It's only fair to give us a little 
space to campaign". 
  Asked about the Freedom Alliance, Mr Buthelezi said he 
would have to consult his negotiation partners on IFP 
participation in elections, but stressed the decision to 
provisionally register for the poll was purely for the IFP. The 
deadline for registration is Friday. 
  On international mediation, Mr Mandela said this was still 
under consideration and had to be taken the party's principals. 
[sentence as received]. Mr Mandela said later it was a 
"mistake" to think the problems faced by the parties could have 
been resolved overnight and he remained optimistic about future 
meetings with the IFP president. 
  Both leaders said it was an "absolute certainty" they would 
meet again soon to try to resolve their constitutional 
differences. "In discussions of this nature there can be no 
deadline. Not even April 27 is a deadline," said Mr Mandela. 
"We'll continue searching for solutions even after April 27 if 
we don't reach a solution now." 
  The leaders resolved to redouble their efforts to encourage 
their constituencies to participate in and support National 
Peace Accord structures and all peace initiatives. Both parties 
also agreed to establish a task group to strengthen peace 
committees and to allow communication between themselves. But 
the primary responsibility for law and order remained with the 
government, Mr Mandela and Mr Buthelezi noted in a joint 
statement. 
  The leaders said they would work together to try to ensure 
canvassing for their respective views could take place. 
  Commenting on the relationship between the ANC and IFP 
leaders, Mr Mandela said in spite of their political differences 
they were "very close friends...I came here in high spirits and 
I'm leaving the meeting in higher spirits". 
  "It's sufficient for us to say we're satisfied with the 
progress we've made," he added.

<F P=106> [Joint statement by ANC President Nelson Mandela and IFP </F>
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the Royal Hotel in Durban on 1 
March; on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] Both parties approached this meeting with a 
determination to promote conditions in which the people of South 
Africa as a whole can exercise their democratic right to make 
political choices in accordance with their beliefs and 
conscience. 
  Notwithstanding differences on constitutional matters, the 
parties recognised the right of people to participate or not to 
participate in the forthcoming general elections. 
  After a constructive exchange of views, the parties agreed 
to 
work together to ensure that canvassing for respective views 
should be able to take place without let or hindrance. 
  In an effort to resolve outstanding constitutional 
deadlocks, 
the parties agreed to explore with their principals the 
possibility of international mediation and in this regard the 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] would consider provisional 
registration in terms of the electoral act. 
  Both parties agreed that the present levels of violence in 
our society were totally unacceptable and were jeopardising 
conditions for socio-economic reconstruction and development. 
  They therefore resolved to redouble their efforts to 
encourage their respective constituencies to participate in and 
support National Peace Accord structures and all peace 
initiatives. 
  While recognising the fact that members of the ANC [African 
National Congress] and IFP are involved in political violence, 
the parties are of the view that the primary responsibility for 
the maintenance of law and order remains with the government of 
the day. 
  The parties also explored the possibility of making greater 
use of international expertise in areas such as conflict 
resolution and the investigation of political violence. 
  It was agreed that a task group would be established in 
order 
to faciliate the strengthening of peace committees and to attend 
to communication between the parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte in the </F>
Cape Town studio by SABC announcer John Bishop in the 
Johannesburg studio on the "Agenda" program--live] 
  [Text] [Bishop] We are going across to talk to Mr. Danie 
Schutte about the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] agreeing to 
register provisionally. Good evening, Mr. Schutte. Thanks for 
coming on. It's been quite a business this evening, in this 
program. 
  [Schutte] Good evening, Mr. Bishop. 
  [Bishop] First of all, what can you tell us -- what can you 
add, indeed, to what our political correspondent has said and 
what's been carried in the news? 
  [Schutte] Well, I think the first thing that I would like to 
say is that I am cautious. There are a number of conditions 
that have been set. Of course if something happens, if it 
really is true, then it is very good news because the fact will 
be that then we will be able to say that the leaders 
representing 90 percent of our population will in fact have 
indicated participation in this election and then one can say 
that this is an inclusive election -- that what we've aspired to 
in the last few years, that would be very good news but I think 
-- of course, I think the other thing that one must say is that 
it is a good indication that the IFP is at least considering 
participation. 
  [Bishop] Would you say though that two leading figures like 
Mr. Mandela and Dr. Buthelezi would come together, look so much 
at ease and yet it not really being on -- that there's still a 
chance everything might be off? 
  [Schutte] Well the news is very fresh to me, and I can only 
look at the spoken word. And if one looks at the spoken word, 
there is still a lot of conditions put to it, but what I can say 
is that there has been a lot of work put into trying and finding 
an accommodation in the last few days and hours and there is an 
indication that that will not be in vain. 
  [Bishop] What price the Freedom Alliance? How are you 
reading that? 
  [Schutte] Well that is not indicated. Also, the other aspect 
of the international mediation. The fact is that the election 
must go forward. The election must go forward on 27 April and 
to make that possible there are a number of restrictive dates, 
the one is 4 March. Parties who want to participate will have 
to register by 4 March and to enable them to finally be part of 
the election process they will have to submit their candidates' 
list by 9 March. That is the final date. 
  [Bishop] Mediation -- what's the relevance there? Mention of 
an overseas mediator, indeed. 
  [Schutte] Well, that is not clear to me at this stage 
because 
if that is to be...if that is to happen before any of the 
parties -- well before the IFP decides to really get involved, 
that will have to occur very, very soon. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Schutte how close were the Nationalist Party to 
the ANC [African National Congress] on this approach to Dr. 
Buthelezi? 
  [Schutte] We took it on ourselves to make a number of 
approaches, to make a number of proposals to him with a view to 
getting his participation. The moment that we could get that I 
am sure that we could have also persuaded the ANC to accept many 
of the proposals. That was our game plan. 
  [Bishop] Can you tell us if certain offers were made to 
persuade Dr. Buthelezi and the IFP to agree to provisionally 
come on board? 
  [Schutte] Well, of course we indicated also that a great 
many 
of their preconditions have been met, and are now being met in 
parliament, so I believe that that was also...that also played a 
major role. 
  [Bishop] Nothing further and more tempting perhaps? 
  [Schutte] I don't want to take the matter any further at 
this 
stage. I think it's far too late. The fact is that tomorrow is 
the last day of parliament and we would have to have some 
more...some clear indication at this stage to take the matter 
any further. I just cannot see at this stage, at this very late 
stage, that amendments can be made. 
  [Bishop] Well, thank you so much for coming on and helping 
us 
with this, the big breaking news story of the evening. 
  [Schutte] Thank you.

  [Text] Parliament Mar 2 SAPA -- The government remained 
primed to deal with significant progress in constitutional 
negotiations now or in the near future, State President Mr F. W. 
de Klerk said on Wednesday [2 March]. He also revealed that he 
had had discussions on Tuesday night with Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] leader General Constand Viljoen. 
  Answering a question during state president's question time 
from Mr Dave Dalling (ANC [African National Congress]-Sandton), 
he said the government called on other parties to negotiate in 
good faith and with a will to reach solutions. Although he was 
very pleased that Tuesday's talks between ANC president Mr 
Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Dr Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi had taken place, it should be remembered they would 
not have been possible without hours of discussions between he 
and other senior government members like Home Affairs Minister 
Mr Danie Schutte, and Dr Buthelezi. 
  It had therefore been possible to put specific proposals 
before Tuesday's meeting. On his talks on Tuesday night with 
Gen Viljoen, Mr de Klerk said: "We don't make a public display 
like the ANC (of such talks). With us results count." 
  President de Klerk said April 27 remained the election date 
-- "I am a leader of a party which keeps its word." 
  On proposed international mediation to address the 
constitutional impasse with the Freedom Alliance [FA], he said 
time was of the essence, and this could provide problems 
regarding such mediation. 
  He would, however, examine any proposal. "My government's 
attitude is that negotiation doesn't end today." 
  Multi-party accords could be reached in the next 10 days, 
two 
weeks, or whatever, on outstanding issues. Mr de Klerk said he 
found the concept of provisional registration of parties 
"interesting". Other FA parties should also look at it.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Housing Issue Becomes Political Football -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 2 March in a page-14 editorial notes that the 
African National Congress (ANC) is "irritated that the Minister 
of National Housing, Louis Shill, should try to gain the 
political initiative by announcing a 10-year housing plan just 
weeks before the election." The Transitional Executive Council 
has resolved that the plan "should be suspended until the 
controversy is settled." Shill disclaims "ulterior motives" in 
unveiling the plan. "Whatever the rights and wrongs, those with 
the interests of the homeless at heart will want a start made. 
Housing has been a political football far too long." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Warning Against Jeopardizing Housing Plan -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 2 March in a page-8 editorial also 
refers to Housing Minister Shill's announcement of the 10-year 
housing plan, saying "such an important project should not be 
jeopardised by politicking or an individual's ego." In calling 
for Shill's resignation ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa 
"accused Shill of trying to hijack the project for the benefit 
of the National Party, in spite of an appeal by the National 
Housing Forum that he should wait until a few sticking points 
had been cleared up." The plan "clearly has the general 
approval of the forum, and putting it into operation will be the 
task of the new government." The forum will have to "smooth out 
remaining problems at its plenary session on March 14, and then 
get on with the job of building houses. It should not be 
distracted by the pleasure of taking parting shots at Shill." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Call for Government To Address Election `Anxiety' -- "Too 
many things seem to be falling apart as we near the magical date 
for the first one man, one vote elections," declares a page-10 
editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 2 March. "There 
are political disruptions and violence at the macro level while 
things are not exactly rosy at the local level." The editorial 
refers to the strikes at various hospitals, and the strikes by 
railway employees, as well as the "uncertainties" in the taxi 
industry. "There is too much uncertainty and anxiety. If the 
Government is serious about having proper elections, they must 
put their house in order. They must give those they hope will 
vote for them the confidence that the situation will improve 
after the elections."

<F P=106> [By Randy Zormelo] </F>
  [Text] Cotonou, 1 Mar (PANA) -- Beninois President 
Nicephore Soglo said Tuesday [1 March] in Cotonou that African 
countries must unite to collectively meet the challenge of 
development or perish. He was opening the committee meetings of 
the Global Coalition for Africa (GCA) in the Beninois economic 
capital. 
  The committees are governance and democracy chaired by Soglo 
and economic reform polices chaired by Ghana's finance and 
economic planning minister, Kwesi Botchwey. 
  Soglo said African countries are currently facing economic 
and financial crises of an unprecedented dimension. He said all 
the political and economic reform efforts and sacrifices so far 
made by them have been reduced to nought. "Our countries are 
facing an imminent social upheaval and we are left with no 
choice but to unite or perish," Soglo told delegates attending 
the four-day GCA meeting. 
  Launched in Kampala, Uganda, in 1990, the GCA seeks to 
improve the working partnership existing between African and 
developing countries in economic and development-related fields. 
  Soglo said the recent devaluation of the CFA franc which was 
not originally on the meeting's agenda was placed at the last 
minute because of its obvious implications for economic reform 
in the countries concerned. Pegged to the French franc since 
1948, the CFA franc which the common currency for 14 francophone 
countries in West and Central Africa and the Comoros, was 
devalued in January by 50 percent, seriously hurting the already 
fragile economies of these countries. 
  The Beninois president said despite follow-up measures taken 
including debt reduction, increased investment and reasonable 
control of price increases, the situation remains "extremely 
serious." Soglo said a devaluation of this magnitude is 
difficult to manage and is bound to cause social tension. "We 
should exchange ideas and experiences to make the devaluation of 
the CFA a positive change and a new opportunity for economic 
development instead of considering it as catastrophe." 
  Soglo said his committee will present a comprehensive study 
on self-evaluation of governance and democracy. The document, 
which will be presented to African governments, contains 
concrete measures to meet the challenge of effective governance 
and transition to democratic rule. 
  The committee on economic reform policies is excepted to 
discuss structural adjustment and economic reforms and a 
strategy for agricultural development in Africa. 
  More than 100 delegates are attending the committee 
meetings. 
Also in attendance are three former heads of state -- Amadou 
Toure of Mali, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi, and Aristides Pereira 
of Cape Verde.

  [Excerpts] The European Union is asking Nigeria and 
Cameroon to go to international arbitration or mediation to 
settle their border dispute. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday Nigerian President Sani Abacha received a 
high-level French delegation; Paris is trying to calm things 
down, though it has sent a few paratroopers to Cameroon, which 
the Nigerians do not seem to like. They said yesterday after 
the meeting that they favored a friendly settlement to the 
border dispute, but without outside assistance. This attitude 
is more or less shared by John Fru Ndi, one of the main 
opposition leaders in Cameroon. John Fru Ndi was interviewed by 
our colleagues in RFI's English section: 
  [Begin Fru Ndi recording, in English with superimposed 
French 
translation] I think that French intervention is not desirable 
at the moment. We think that Cameroon and Nigeria, as African 
countries, can try to settle the dispute between them with the 
help of the OAU, rather than by asking for the help of a third 
country, especially France. If France has to come in, where is 
the sovereignty of Cameroon? [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Upon his return from Libreville, Gabon, where he 
attended the summit of Central African heads of state on the 
consequences of the devaluation of the CFA franc, President Ange 
Felix Patasse announced the creation in the days ahead of the 
Economic and Monetary Commission of Central Africa [CEMAC]. He 
also spoke of the devaluation of the CFA franc, the backup 
measures being implemented, and the effects of the monetary 
adjustment on the balance sheet of the Bank of Central African 
States [BEAC]. He also mentioned the steps to take in response 
to the presentation of the experts' report on economic and 
monetary integration. Taking stock of the summit, the president 
stated that the Libreville meeting helped adopt practical steps 
to implement the backup measures. [passage omitted] 
  Analyzing the incidence of the monetary adjustment on the 
balance sheet of the BEAC, the heads of state noted the negative 
effects that the new exchange rate has had on their transaction 
accounts, all of which are now in debt. Central Africa, 
President Patasse said, is lagging behind its West African 
counterparts and its issuing bank is not doing well, mainly 
because of the selfishness of some states. This attitude has 
worsened to such extent that the BEAC's balance relies on the 
fragile economies of two states in the subregion. 
  [Begin Patasse recording] It is very easy to note that 
Central Africa is ill as a result of the selfishness shown by 
each of the subregional states. As a result of exaggerated 
nationalism in the subregion, Central Africa is now lagging far 
behind West Africa. I stress that if Central Africa does not 
realize the danger we will get lost, and that is the main lesson 
to draw from our Libreville meeting. When you analyze the 
report presented by the BEAC governor, you will note that the 
Central Bank hinges on the CAR in the first place and then on 
Chad. When we take into account the transaction accounts, we 
can say that as far as the Central African Region is concerned 
there is a deficit. It is thanks to our country that the 
Central Bank survives. But we must avoid boasting because the 
essential element needed first of all is solidarity. [end 
recording] 
  The main decisions made by the heads of state in Libreville 
include: checking increasing inflation, reducing increases in 
the prices of essential commodities, and negotiating with the 
IMF the possibilities of ensuring an influx of funds to Central 
Africa necessary to reestablish financial balance in the 
subregion. But the main announcement that the head of state 
made was the creation in the days ahead of the CEMAC. The heads 
of state agreed on the examination of two draft texts to be 
submitted to them for signature in order to rapidly put in place 
the institutions of the new community. All this is expected to 
be ready for the next summit slated for Ndjamena. Let us listen 
to the president again: 
  [Begin Patasse recording] We will find solutions to our 
problems. We will meet in Ndjamena in one or two week's time, 
and we will find solutions. We have transcended the chauvinist 
stage to tackle major problems confronting all of us, that is 
how we will create the CEMAC. That is the main point of our 
meeting in Libreville. We also examined security problems in 
the subregion. Concerning this point, there are the examples of 
our Chadian brothers that we have accepted on our territory and 
the Cameroon- Nigeria conflict. These are the current problems, 
but we are convinced that if political will exists in such a way 
that we can pool our resources to rejuvenate Central Africa, I 
am convinced that we shall overcome micro-nationalism which 
constitutes an obstacle to Central Africa's development. [end

  [Excerpt] The UN secretary general's special representative 
to Rwanda, Dr. Jacques Roger Booh-Booh, has called on the 
parties that signed the Arusha peace agreement to redouble their 
efforts so as to find a solution to the current deadlock as soon 
as possible. Mr. Booh-Booh renewed his call yesterday 1 March 
at the end of a meeting in Mulindi with Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] senior political and military officials. During talks 
that lasted two hours, the UN secretary general's special 
representative reminded the RPF officials about the need to give 
greater importance to dialogue, to demonstrate the logic of 
peace and to prepare themselves for acceptable political 
compromises. 
  According to a communique issued on 28 February in Mulindi, 
the RPF declared itself prepared to take part in the 
transitional institutions provided that the deputies of the 
Liberal Party ratified on 4 January 1994 by the Constitutional 
Court was maintained. The RPF condemned the current high level 
of violence in the country and denounced the manipulations aimed 
at changing the balance of political forces as stipulated in the 
Arusha peace agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Luanda, 2 Mar (AFP) -- The Zairian radical 
opposition will launch "an armed resistance struggle" in the 
near future to "paralyze the country" considering "the failure 
of the inter-Zairian political negotiations," Jacques Matanda, 
chairman of the Convention of Nationalist Reformers, one of the 
components of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition, said 
today in Luanda. 
  These political negotiations were only "stage-managed by the 
Zairian political class" comprising "90 percent of Mobutu 
supporters," Matanda added at a news conference. He described 
Monsignor Monsengwo, under whose auspices the negotiations took 
place, as a "traitor". According to Matanda, the bishop 
"betrayed the civilian, military, and religious population's 
confidence," adding that the negotiations also served to get rid 
of Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi. 
  The Zairian opposition is capable of "overthrowing President 
Mobutu," and they do not need troops to do so. "They only have 
to paralyze the sensitive areas by blowing up fuel pipelines, 
the rail lines or the high tension pylons." Matanda said 
"Mobutu has an army which has been reduced to its simplest form, 
in a miserable state." He said "Mobutu can be overthrown, the 
most important thing is to start it." Jacques Matanda, however, 
admitted the existence "of divergent views within the 
opposition." 
  Matanda also spoke about the support given by the Angolan 
authorities to Zairian "nationalists" who had launched an armed 
attack on the province of Shaba (extreme south of Zaire) in 
March 1977. Nathaniel Mbumba's National Front for the 
Liberation of Shaba had the "blessing of the ruling Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola and particularly that of 
the defunct President Agostinho Neto," Matanda pointed out. 
Luanda had several times denied Kinshasa's accusations of the 
presence of Katangese maquisards in Angola. 
  Furthermore, Matanda said that soldiers from the Zairian 
president's special division unit fought on the side of the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] for 
the capture of the oil town of Soyo (northern Angola). "Most of 
the soldiers fighting in northern Angola" with UNITA come from 
Zaire, Matanda added.

  [Text] A Somali National Alliance [SNA] senior spokesman 
has said that some surrogates taking orders from elements of UN 
Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM] have attacked residents of some 
areas of Galguduud area in Dhuusa Mareeb town. The SNA senior 
spokesman said that in their attacks on districts in Galguduud 
region, the elements massacred innocent and defenseless people 
while destroying much property. The spokesman said the attack 
had been organized by UNOSOM in an effort to stir up 
confrontations between the communities in the various regions of 
Somalia. It was also a violation of the cease-fire agreed by 
the Somali people in the Addis Ababa Accord and the agreement of 
the central regions of Somalia by the supporters of SNA, Somali 
Salvation Democratic Front, and Somali National Democratic Union 
signed following the 28 May to 4 June 1993 peace conference in 
Mogadishu. In conclusion, the SNA senior spokesman called on 
the Somali people in Galguduud region to avoid becoming victims 
of UNOSOM's treacherous maneuvers aimed at creating renewed 
friction among the Somali people, who were in dire need of peace 
and justice.

  [Text] The leader of the Somali National Alliance, SNA, who 
is also the chairman of the United Somali Congress, USC, Mohamed 
Farah Aidid and his large delegation left Addis Ababa 
International Airport today for Nairobi, Kenya. 
  While in Addis Ababa, Mr. Aidid held talks with the French, 
Russian, Chinese, Italian, and Egyptian ambassadors to Ethiopia, 
based in Addis Ababa, whom he briefed on the situation in 
Somalia and his talks in Nairobi with the various groups of the 
Somali community. He also briefed them on the agreement he had 
reached with the leaders of Somali groups, an agreement based on 
understanding, collaboration and mutual respect, far removed 
from earlier mutually antagonistic attitudes. 
  Asked by the Egyptian ambassador to Ethiopia why he would 
not 
be attending the Cairo meeting, Chairman Aidid replied that the 
SNA was not attending the conference organized by the Egyptian 
Government in Cairo, because the meeting violated the OAU Cairo 
agreement, which provided for the issue of the Somali people to 
be left to the leaders of the Horn of Africa and the Somalis 
themselves. The chairman went on to say that the Cairo 
conference would have a disruptive influence on the ongoing 
talks of the Somali people in Nairobi, Kenya. Chairman Aidid 
said that the talks of the Somali leaders in Nairobi were being 
supported and participated in by the leaders of the countries of 
the Horn of Africa. 
  Aidid called on the Egyptian Government to stop interfering 
in the internal affairs of the Somali people. He said if Egypt 
really wanted to help the Somali people, the Egyptian Government 
should support and implement the December 1993 accord reached in 
Cairo, Egypt. The accord authorized the presidents of the 
countries of Horn of Africa to find a lasting solution to the 
crisis prevailing in Somalia and allow Somalis to decide their 
own destiny.

  [Text] The Catholic church in Uganda says a priest and 
three Ugandan nuns have been kidnapped in the north of the 
country. A church spokesman said the father and nuns were 
kidnapped in Lira District by members of a religious sect 
calling itself Lord's Resistance [two preceding words in 
English], who were followers of the religious sect of Alice 
Lakwena in the 1980s. 
  Rebels in Uganda have increased attacks against soldiers and 
civilians since peace talks with the government collapsed last 
month.

  [Text] Kampala, March 2 (AFP) -- Rebels have freed a 
kidnapped Spanish priest but seriously wounded an unspecified 
number of travellers in an attack in northern Uganda, a church 
source and press reports said here Wednesday [2 March]. 
  The rebels, led by Joseph Kony, on Monday ambushed a vehicle 
operating a daily passenger service between Lira and Kitgum, at 
Ludel and subsequently set it ablaze, witnesses said according 
to the NEW VISION newspaper. Some of the passengers, who were 
badly injured, said a group of about 50 rebels jumped on to the 
road ahead of the vehicle and opened fire, shooting sporadically 
both in the air and at the vehicle. 
  The vehicle's driver was hit in the arm by two bullets while 
the conductor got a hard kick on the knee from one of the rebels 
who had taken cover in the nearby bush. 
  Earlier in the day, the rebels abducted and held hostage two 
Roman Catholic missionaries, Spaniard Luigi Paolino Aguilera and 
another unnamed black priest, together with two nuns from Lira's 
Paranga mission, reports said. 
  The papal envoy here, reached by telephone by the Italian 
news agency ANSA, said Father Aguilera had returned safe and 
sound to the Kitgum mission, 380 kilometres (about 240 miles) 
north of Kampala. 
  Aguilera, a member of the Comboniani order based at Padua in 
northern Italy, was held by the rebels for just one day, but 
subjected to five hours of "indoctrination" in the bush before 
he was set free, ANSA reported. The Italian news agency said 
the two nuns were still in the hands of the rebels of the Lord's 
Resistance Army (LRA), but made no mention of the black priest 
also said to have been abducted. 
  Other reports here said that at least one of the priests had 
been released, but a Ugandan Catholic Secretariat spokesman 
could not be reached for further details. 
  NEW VISION said two priests and two nuns were held hostage 
by 
the rebels apparently for use as human shields in the event of 
an attack by government forces. 
  Security sources in Lira said on Wednesday that government 
troops based at Pajule, 15 kilometres (12 miles) from the scene 
of the incident, moved swiftly in pursuit, but arrived late and 
only managed to find the vehicle in which the priests had been 
travelling. 
  The attack on travellers is seen by the people in the area 
as 
an attempt by the rebels to make their presence in the region 
felt, a gesture that would form the basis for future 
negotiations with the government. 
  The LRA, a remnant of the voodoo priestess Alice Lakwena's 
Holy Spirit Army, has stepped up attacks on government forces 
since February 19, after negotiations with the government broke 
down. 
  On February 13, President Yoweri Museveni gave the rebels 
one 
week to surrender or else face the might of the Ugandan army.

  [Text] A contingent of the task force stationed in Tamale 
was yesterday called upon to observe an imminent attack by a 
group made up of predominantly Dagomba youths on Kokomba 
elements, who are reported to have gone to the Tamale branch of 
the Agricultural Development Bank to transact business. The 
contingent was also called upon to forestall a possible invasion 
of the bank by the group. 
  A statement issued in Accra today by the Ministry of 
Information said attempts to restrain the mob by peaceful means 
failed to bring the situation under control. The contingent was 
therefore compelled to fire warning shots in order to calm the 
situation and to disperse the crowd. Again, this failed and as 
an attack on the contingent itself became imminent, it was 
forced to fire in self-defense resulting in the death of eight 
persons in the crowd while 21 others were injured. 
  The statement said the government deeply regrets the 
incident 
and conveys to the families of the deceased its deepest 
condolences. The government also deplores the latest attack on a 
policeman by a mob in Tamale, as a result of which he is in 
coma. The statement reiterated the government's appeal for 
restraint on the part of all factions involved in the clashes in 
the conflict areas of the Northern region. 
  Meanwhile, a government delegation, led by the minister of 
defense and chairman of the Emergency Committee, Alhaji Mahama 
Iddrisu, is on its way to Tamale to assess the situation. The 
minister of interior, Colonel Osei-Wusu, is also on the 
delegation. 
  [In the same newscast, the radio also carries in its press 
review section, the following related item: "The DAILY GRAPHIC 
and the GHANAIAN TIMES carry reports of a heavy bomb blast last 
Monday at the Korle-Dudo Hawkers' Market within the premises of 
the Kokomba market in Accra. The blast, which observers believe 
is a spillover of the ethnic conflict in the Northern Region, 
seriously injured three persons, who were asleep. A victim of 
the blast alleged that earlier, three persons in military 
uniform came to the market at about 1030 that night and ordered 
children who were playing around the area to leave. According 
to the caretaker of the market, a small boy around the area was 
also found holding a live grenade with the pin intact showing it 
to his mother as a crab he had found."]

  [Text] Monrovia 2 Mar (AFP) -- An AFP journalist in 
Monrovia has observed that on 2 March, United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia, [ULIMO] soldiers stationed at 
Po River, 20 km east of Monrovia, opposed the deployment of 
Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group [ECOMOG] troops to their sector. ULIMO is an armed 
Liberian faction. 
  The deployment began on 1 March throughout the country to 
disarm all the factions. In principle, this should have begun 
under UN supervision on 7 March. 
  ULIMO guards at the Po River checkpoint told AFP: "We will 
not allow ECOMOG to be deployed to our sector because we have 
not received orders to that effect." They also reiterated their 
request for "financial compensation before handing over their 
arms." 
  Last week, ULIMO chairman, Alhaji Koromah, asked for $5 
million from the United Nations to fund the reintegration of his 
troops into civilian life. 
  On 1 March, General Ian Douglas, coordinator of the 
reinsertion program of the United Nations Observer Mission in 
Liberia, indicated that an "emergency fund" of $180,000 would be 
granted. 
  During a visit to the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL] camp in 
Schieffelin, 20 km east of Monrovia, Gen. Douglas stressed that 
"the aid would be effective only after disarmament, camping, and 
demobilization" of the forces of the three leading armed 
factions, the AFL, ULIMO, and the National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by four opposition political parties in </F>
Niamey on 2 March following a meeting on armed rebellion; read 
by Sanni Bako, information and propaganda secretary of the 
National Movement of Development Society-Nassara--recorded] 
  [Text] We, the Alliance for Democracy and Social 
Progress-Zoumounchi, the National Movement of Development 
Society-Nassara, the Union of Popular Forces for Democracy and 
Progress-Sawaba, the Union of Progressive Patriots and 
Democrats-Chamoua, after meeting today and thoroughly analyzing 
the document entitled Armed Resistance's Global Program, which 
was referred to us by the president of the Republic through his 
letter dated 22 February, make the following statement: 
  First, the national and international opinion notes that the 
demands of the armed rebellion in our country seriously 
jeopardizes national unity and territorial integrity. Those 
demands are the logical consequences of the ostrich policy and 
shady deals that this problem has engendered since the end of 
the sovereign national conference. Second, all the demands made 
by the armed rebellion should be examined in the strict respect 
for the provisions of the 26 December 1992 Constitution, whose 
guarantor is the president of the Republic. Third, in the face 
of the armed rebellion's determination to continue its repeated 
deadly attacks, we urgently call on the government to take all 
the appropriate measures to ensure the security of people and 
goods throughout the country. Fourth, and finally, we condemn 
and call for an end to all the maneuvers, manipulations, and 
other machinations from inside and outside aimed at partitioning 
Niger. In this regard, we urge the president of the Republic to

  [Text] The Federal Government has expressed indignation 
over the internationalization of the territorial dispute between 
Nigeria and Cameroon by the French Government. Briefing media 
executives in Lagos this evening on the latest developments 
around the Bakassi Peninsula, the foreign affairs minister, 
Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, said the federal government's 
position is that Nigeria and Cameroon can resolve the dispute 
peacefully, having been traditionally good neighbors. He said 
the French should hold themselves fully responsible for the 
consequences of any direct military confrontation between 
Nigeria and Cameroon. 
  [Begin Kingibe recording] We hold the French responsible for 
internationalizing it, for encouraging the Cameroonians to go 
from pillar to post; they are ones who provided the Cameroonians 
three French lawyers -- international law lawyers -- to go to 
the Hague to try and file the case at that tribunal. They are 
the ones who strategized for them to wait until they become the 
president of Security Council, which was in force yesterday, 
before they took the matter of Bakassi, and they are the ones 
who internationalized and introduced an element of war by 
bringing in their troops into the region where, in fact, the 
conditions for inviting their local defense staff did not exist. 
[end recording] 
  Discussing the situation on the ground, Ambassador Kingibe 
said the Cameroonian Army has already been placed on the alert 
and the French troops and military hardware are on the ground in 
that country. He also warned if nothing is done quickly to 
return to dialogue, the situation might explode. He said that 
while Nigeria is mobilizing all diplomatic machinery at its 
disposal to ensure a peaceful resolution of the dispute, it is 
prepared and has the full capacity to defend every inch of its 
territory and protect the lives and property of all Nigerians. 
  Foreign Ministry correspondent Godfried Agor reports that 
Nigeria cannot be bothered by an International Court ruling 
since the document disputed, dating far beyond the colonial era, 
confirms Nigeria's ownership of the disputed territory.

  [Text] Nigeria has opened a mission in Pretoria, South 
Africa. A Foreign Ministry's spokesman, Ambassador Boko York, 
said in Abuja today that Nigerian charge d'affaires, Mr. 
(Korpo), and a minister in the ministry have already left in 
company of five other officials to open Nigeria's first mission 
in that country. Ambassador York said that the departure of the 
team was delayed due to logistic and financial reasons. 
According to him, another team of officials will soon leave for 
South Africa to open a consular office in Johannesburg. 
Ambassador York added that Nigeria plans to establish full 
diplomatic relations with South Africa after next month's 
elections in that country.

  [Text] The UN secretary general's special representative, 
Aldo Ajello, has reiterated that elections will only be held in 
Mozambique once all troops have been demobilized. Ajello was 
reacting to an AFP report that the UN could agree to elections 
being held in October even if the two armies were in place. AFP 
based its report on statements by Behrooz Sadry, Ajello's 
deputy. Ajello told our correspondent that he questioned his 
deputy about the report but that Sadry had denied the remarks 
attributed to him by AFP.

  [Text] The Mozambican Government has reiterated that it 
intends and is willing to have general elections by not later 
than October 1994 in line with the General Peace Accord 
timetable. That is according to NOTICIAS which cites a 
statement issued by the government. NOTICIAS says that is the 
first government reaction to the recent UN Security Council 
resolution on the Mozambican peace process. The statement says 
the apparent delay in the confinement of government troops is 
not in any way caused by political or logistical reasons. The 
UN Security Council resolution vigorously urged the government 
and the Mozambique National Resistance to speed up the 
confinement of troops, and asked the sides to begin demobilizing 
their forces.

  [Text] The Mozambican Government is to begin demobilizing 
its forces from assembly areas at once without waiting for the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]. This was disclosed by 
Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana at the end of yet another 
meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC]. He 
said the government's decision is designed to speed up the peace 
process and enable soldiers to leave assembly areas. 
  The simultaneous demobilization of troops of both sides 
should have started on 22 February, but Renamo was late in 
submitting the list of its troops. Raul Domingos, head of 
Renamo's delegation to the CSC, said the government's decision 
to unilaterally begin confining [as heard] its troops was 
worrisome. Raul Domingos said the two sides should operate 
within the parameters of the General Peace Accord so as to 
prevent mistrust. He said the delay in demobilizing Renamo 
troops was due to technical problems.

discuss recent rioting at Renamo assembly areas. The agenda 
included the destruction of explosive devices collected from 
both sides, the transfer of war materiel from assembly areas to 
UN Operations in Mozambique regional depots, and the start of 
demobilization.

<F P=106> [Speech by King Mswati III at the opening of the Sixth </F>
Parliament in Lobamba on 18 February--live] 
  [Text] Your majesty the Ndlovukazi, your royal highnesses, 
right honorable prime minister, chiefs, excellencies, members of 
the diplomatic corps, honorable ministers, Mr. President and 
honorable members of the House of Senate, Mr. Speaker, and 
honorable members of the House of Assembly. Distinguished 
guests, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by welcoming you all 
to the state opening of the first session of the Sixth 
Parliament of the Kingdom of Swaziland. 
  My first duty today, on behalf of the whole Swazi nation, is 
to commend the work of the previous government. In often 
difficult circumstances, and over a period of great change in 
the Kingdom, the prime minister and his cabinet team, along with 
the members of both houses of Parliament, worked hard for the 
development of the Kingdom. The nation owes a vote of 
appreciation to all who served us over this period. 
  Two years ago, the nation was in the process of deciding the 
direction to be taken -- of political reform. I made it clear 
then, in this chamber, that the future of Swaziland depended on 
the full, active, and peaceful participation of all Swazis in 
that process to achieve a result which would truly reflect the 
wishes of the majority of the country. The elections were 
clearly a success. They were accepted as freely and fairly 
conducted by the international community, and more importantly 
they were what we, the Swazi people, wanted. 
  Beyond the fact of a new electoral system, the reforms have 
been important to Swaziland as a means by which the whole Swazi 
family has been involved in a debate of national interest and 
significance. I should like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate the nation for its wholehearted participation and 
support of the process, and for the peaceful manner in which the 
exercise was conducted. Of course, the very nature of reform 
implies an ongoing process, and the recommendations given by the 
nation include many issues which still require attention. This 
we will address in the same manner -- carefully and peacefully 
and with the full knowledge and approval of the Kingdom. 
  I should also like to highlight the achievement of those of 
you sitting here who are very much the end result of the first 
reform initiative. You members of the House of Assembly, who 
have been chosen by your fellow Swazis to be their 
representatives in the country's most important legislative 
chamber, you take your seats here at a vital time in the 
Kingdom's history, and you and all members of both houses hold 
in your hands the hopes of those you represent, to ensure that 
the direction of our development aim is correct, and that the 
effects of development strategies implemented by government 
reach those who most need them, for the time has now come for 
the nation to direct its attention to the issue of greatest 
importance for our future stability and prosperity -- how best 
to tackle the economic problems facing the country today, and 
what steps we must take to sustain the progress toward achieving 
our national development objectives. 
  Before considering this economic challenge at a national 
level, we should understand the importance to Swaziland's 
development of events occurring around the world. These days of 
increasing economic inter-dependence between nations, the 
effects of situations in one part of the world, or the decisions 
of other countries and organizations, can have implications for 
the rest of us. One example of this, and one that perhaps has 
the greatest significance for the world's economic future, is 
the signing last December of the General Agreement of Tariffs 
and Trade. This was the result of many years of negotiations 
between all the major trading blocks aimed at breaking down 
trade barriers between countries, and it is an important step 
towards creating a world of free trade. 
  While Swaziland, along with other developing countries, can 
welcome the outcome of the agreement in terms of expanding 
markets for our exports, there are several short term 
disadvantages and implications for our economies to be taken 
into account. Two examples of these are, first, the issue of 
our unique access to various markets for our sugar, beef, and 
other products. Under the terms of GATT, this trading advantage 
will certainly fall away in time, reducing the revenue from 
those export markets. And second, linked to the first, is the 
fact that the agreement will mean all our exports will 
potentially be in direct competition with every other country. 
Thus, the GATT signing represents both an advantage and a 
challenge to the Kingdom. The advantage is the opening up of 
whole new markets for our exports, and the challenge to Swazi 
industry of producing exports which stand up to competition from 
the rest of the world. These are areas for national discussion 
as we determine ways to lift our levels of quality and 
efficiency in production. 
  At government level, we have already begun to lobby the 
First 
World to consider the penalties to developing countries of the 
agreement. The price to them of our support for the signing is 
their understanding of the potential harm it will do to our 
economies. In the short term, we are looking for a continuation 
to our preferential access to markets, at least until we are in 
a position to compete with the developed world in the export 
market place. This will be a challenge for government and an 
issue for which we will be looking to our friends in the 
international community for help and advice. 
  Conflict situations around the world too have an impact on 
us, not simply for the adverse effect they have on the world 
economy, but also because they tend to divert attention away 
from the development needs of emerging countries like Swaziland. 
The situation in Bosnia, for example, while providing an 
illustration of the dangers of division within a country, 
continues to draw resources and concern away from the developing 
world in a justifiable effort to resolve the crisis there. 
  Swaziland continues to support the process of negotiation 
between the three rival factions, and we pray that the use of 
force is avoided. We encourage the moves by the United Nations 
and the European Union to assist in finding a settlement to the 
dispute, and an end to the suffering of so many. 
  Another focus for world attention outside Africa has been 
the developments toward a lasting settlement in the Middle East. 
The danger of that troubled area developing once more into a 
global situation with huge economic and social (?cause) can 
never be overlooked. And so we welcome any moves which reduce 
tension and bring the separate nations closer together. 
  Swaziland with its long association with the state of Israel 
gives particular credit to the decision by the Israeli people 
and government to take the road of negotiation and 
reconciliation. It is one that we have supported constantly for 
many years. Despite the delays and setbacks, we are encouraged 
by the efforts of both sides -- Palestinians and Israel -- to 
push forward with the agreement signed last September. Let us 
hope that this first step in the process to real peace in the 
region can continue, and we trust that other steps to include 
all the people of the Middle East will soon create an atmosphere 
in which countries there can develop peacefully without the 
constant threat of violence and disaster. 
  And here in Africa the tragedy of civil war and internal 
strife in so many countries continues to affect the economic 
development of the continent as a whole and serves as a lesson 
to us all on the importance of maintaining unity within nations. 
The UN operation in Somalia has been the most expensive in the 
organization's history. With the withdrawal of most of the UN 
force in two months' time, let us pray that the lives, 
resources, and effort which have been expanded over the past 
year will not be wasted by a return to the bloodshed of recent 
history. 
  In Sudan, the ongoing conflict between different ethnic 
groups has resulted not only in death and destruction, but has 
caused the enforced movement of many thousands of refugees who 
now tax the resources of countries which are obliged to act as 
their temporary hosts. The economic effect of refugees on a 
country is one that we here can well understand and sympathize 
with. 
  And perhaps most tragic of all is the continuation of the 
daily shedding of blood in Angola, a country whose people have 
known no peace for over 20 years and who are paying the 
appalling price of the use of force to resolve their 
differences. As fellow member of two organizations of economic 
cooperation, the resolution of the conflict in Angola has 
particular importance for us. We hope that the negotiations 
underway in Lusaka signal the start of lasting peace to that 
unfortunate country so that her huge natural and human resources 
can contribute effectively to the economic future of our 
subregion. 
  Clearly though the economic implications to Swaziland of the 
situations in our two neighbors, Mozambique and South Africa, 
deserve our closest attention. The process of peace in 
Mozambique appears to be on course, and we congratulate all who 
have contributed toward its success so far. The effect on our 
economy of a stable and prosperous Mozambique cannot be 
overemphasized, and we must be doing all we can now not just to 
support the process, but to understand how best we can prepare 
ourselves to take the fullest advantage of a return to peace in 
our neighbor. It is imperative that we keep the channels of 
communication at all levels between governments, NGO's 
[nongovernmental organizations], and the private sector as open 
and as active as possible. Our shared border holds many 
possibilities for mutual economic improvement including 
increased trade, joint tourism projects, and the greater use by 
us of Mozambique's access to the sea. The success of the 
refugee repatriation program is the first indication of the 
importance we must attach to increasing cooperation with 
Mozambique and government must accept this as a major priority. 
  The same is true of our other neighbor, South Africa. The 
change in policy and direction of a new nonracial government in 
South Africa is undoubtedly the single most important factor for 
Swaziland's economic future. We would do well to fully 
understand the implications to us of change in a neighbor on 
whom we rely so heavily. The initiative lies with us to open 
the lines of communication with those with whom we will be 
dealing in future. With new figures in power in South Africa, it 
will be up to us to inform and educate about the needs of the 
Kingdom and to discuss with them the possibilities for increased 
economic cooperation. Of particular relevance are our shared 
natural resources, our various financial links and our numerous 
trade agreements. We must not ignore the significance to 
Swaziland of change in South Africa, and government must take 
the lead in establishing links as early as possible. 
  It follows that it is in Swaziland's best interest for South 
Africa to enjoy as peaceful a transition as possible to a stable 
and prosperous future. We, therefore, look with concern at the 
potential for disruption to the process toward elections in 
April of the non-involvement of large sections of South African 
society. We have constantly urged all parties in South Africa 
to grasp this opportunity to be a part of their country's 
future, and we continue to do so. Instability across our border 
has the gravest implications for us and we must do all we can to 
encourage a smooth transition. 
  One important aspect of a new South Africa, and one that has 
been in focus recently, is the future of those Swazis who 
through the unjust laws of Swazi territory over the years find 
themselves unwillingly members of a country which is not their 
own. The world should be left in no doubt that we are doing all 
in our power through peaceful negotiation to restore to the 
Kingdom the land and the people we have lost through a process 
of historical injustice. The recent establishment of a border 
adjustment committee signals our intention to proceed with this 
issue at the highest levels. The nation will also be aware that 
I raised the subject on a number of occasions last year, 
including at the United Nations. In the event that we do not 
achieve our aims before a change in government in South Africa, 
we are of course prepared to talk to those who will have been 
given the mandate to act as a result of the elections in April. 
History and the facts are on our side, and I'm confident that 
justice will be done. 
  And so we come to the issue of the Kingdom's economy at 
national level. Clearly the world recession, recent drought, 
and the number of international factors have combined to ensure 
very difficult economic times ahead for Swaziland. Our 
challenge as a nation is to identify the areas of problem, and 
then to formulate strategies which will ensure the economic 
stability and prosperity of the Swazi people for many 
generations to come. 
  I mentioned last year that following on from the successes 
of 
the consultation of the nation on our political future, the same 
process would be used to decide the Kingdom's economic choices. 
I intend summoning the nation in the very near future to 
propose a four-stage process aimed first at educating us all to 
the economic realities of the Kingdom. Then gathering opinion 
on our national development priorities, seeking views on how 
best to frame our strategy, and finally deciding on how we 
implement them. The first two steps require the active 
involvement of all Swazis. 
  The first stage, one of education, is vitally important as 
it 
is central to the process that we will all understand the 
limitations and realities of composing a national development 
plan within an underdeveloped country such as ours. We must 
acknowledge that there are no easy overnight solutions to our 
economic difficulties, and that the most important ingredients 
for future success will be hard work, sacrifice, and dedication. 
  The second stage will also involve the support of all 
Swazis, 
young and old. This is when we will confirm the nation's 
priority objectives, the direction to be given to government for 
the Kingdom's development. Key objectives from the past which 
still hold good today include economic growth, sustainable 
development, self-reliance, equity and participation, and social 
justice and stability. We will need to confirm these, and if 
necessary, amend or add to them. I should like to highlight 
some of the more important aspects of each objective to give 
focus for discussion. 
  The key to our future is clearly to achieve growth in our 
economy. The creation of jobs and the increase in gross 
domestic product must be central to any development strategy. 
How to achieve this will be a major point for debate in the 
process of national consultation ahead. One aspect for 
discussion with regard to job creation is the problem of how to 
create the right environment for investment both by Swazis and 
by international investors. 
  For Swazis the provision of capital and knowledge, with 
which 
to start up businesses, is perhaps the most vital. For foreign 
investment the provision of a business environment which is 
attractive in terms of incentives, infrastructure, skilled work 
force, and good industrial relations is crucial to success. 
These issues are being addressed within government, but the 
nation will want to contribute to the debate with ideas and not 
by action on how to improve this vital area. 
  Hand in hand with economic growth is the need to ensure that 
our development is sustainable, that we can manage to control 
and improve our economy to ensure constant progress over the 
years ahead to get us through times of global recession. 
  While acknowledging the importance of close economic 
cooperation with other countries in the region, it is 
nonetheless that we do everything possible to stand on our own 
in terms of producing the basic everyday requirements such as 
foodstuffs and essential manufactured goods. We must grasp the 
message that to rely on imports is to be at the mercy of changes 
in the world crisis and to miss out on business opportunities. 
Emphasis must surely be placed on self-reliance. 
  Since the days when we first considered ourselves to be a 
distinct separate nation, a fundamental theme in protecting the 
unity and independence of the Swazi people has been the quality 
of all members of the Swazi family and the active participation 
of all in the decisions affecting the Kingdom. This principle 
was central to the process of political reform over the last two 
years and guides us in the economic debate ahead. 
  And finally, an element of our national objectives which has 
drawn the nation together and one that has ensured our 
independence, is the principle of social justice resulting in 
peace and stability for the Kingdom for so many generations. 
When we survey the state of perhaps the majority of countries 
on our continent, we would do well to reflect on the importance 
of these final two principles, and to realize how sensible we 
have been in the past to insist on the maintenance of peace and 
stability through a policy of social justice at all costs. 
  Of course the stability of our country depends on many 
factors. One is the physical security of the Kingdom and the 
efficiency of those entrusted with maintaining our system of 
justice. In these days of increasing crime, there has been a 
marked decrease in confidence in our ability as a nation to 
enforce the law. The police and the courts in particular are 
finding their resources and capabilities stretched to the limit 
and new answers to this crisis need to be found. 
  One encouraging move is the recent undertaking by the police 
force to establish close working groups with the civilian 
community, and this is clearly an initiative which deserves all 
our support. Crime prevention is the social responsibility of us 
all, and not an issue to be shrugged off as a problem for the 
police alone. And for the courts, plans are already in hand to 
expand existing facilities and courts so that the backlog in 
cases can be based [as heard] and the administration of justice 
to be made more efficient. 
  Equally important though is the relationship between the 
police and the courts. There must be a mutual understanding and 
sympathy between these two critical elements of our justice 
system. The two must work in harmony and with closer 
cooperation toward achieving an overall raising of confidence in 
the processes of the law. We will be calling for views on how 
to improve in this vital area in the months ahead. 
  These then are some of the more important aspects of our 
national objectives, which the nation will be asked to consider 
during the process of consultation, and I would appeal to all in 
the Kingdom to give serious thought to the various questions 
raised. 
  Closely linked to our national development objectives is the 
confirmation of government priorities on spending. This is an 
issue that will occupy members of both houses following 
presentation of the budget by the minister for finance. Since 
independence, our three highest priorities for government 
spending have been health, education, and agriculture. These 
are recognized as being fundamental to the objectives of any 
developing country. But the nation will be asked to confirm 
whether in each case the specific targets for spending in each 
area is correct, and indeed whether other areas deserve more 
attention. 
  The provision of adequate health care to all members of the 
Swazi nation continues to demand our concern. New challenges in 
this field confront as we strive to increase health facilities. 
To make existing ones more efficient [word indistinct] of most 
agents to educate our people about the importance of health care 
and the prevention of diseases. 
  We have all been shocked to learn of the extent of the 
spread 
in the Kingdom of the killer disease, AIDS. Swaziland, along 
with many other countries, stands to lose whole generations to 
this menace. Unless we act with haste to contain the danger, the 
real enemy to finding a solution to this potential devastating 
problem, ignorance -- ignorance of what this disease is, 
ignorance of what we can do to prevent it, and ignorance of the 
effect on our future if we fail to contain it. 
  This is a challenge for us all to confront. We all have a 
role to play in educating others to the dangers. There must be 
a wholesale change in attitude to our social behavior. The only 
alternative is to witness a tragedy occur which will undermine 
all our development efforts and result in a future of misery for 
our children. We require a national policy on this issue, and 
we look to you seated here to give the nation its direction. 
  A central principle since independence has been our belief 
that a nation's future is dependent on the products of its 
schools. Access to education is right for all Swazis, and this 
remains a guiding objective for government today. There has 
been a long debate on the issue of what some call free 
education. This is an issue the nation shall be addressing in 
our forthcoming debate on the national strategies. It must be 
acknowledged though before discussion begins that there is no 
such thing as free education. In the end the nation will pay, 
whether perhaps through higher taxes or a change in government 
spending. There is clearly no magic source of funds to pay for 
free education. Swaziland must pay for Swazis to be educated. 
Nor is this something that can be changed in the short term. 
Whatever the outcome of national debate on this issue, there 
will be no overnight miracle to cancel the bill to Swazis for 
our education. 
  Perhaps of more immediate concern and an issue that can be 
addressed in the short term is that of the direction of our 
education. The question is: Are we preparing Swazis with the 
right training, knowledge, and skills to enter the market place 
as workers? This is something for the nation to consider in the 
months ahead and for government now to reflect on. 
  The third pillar of our current priorities is the 
development 
of our agricultural policies and the support given by government 
to our farmers. Agriculture remains the stable employment for 
the majority of Swazis and the foundation of our economy. It 
deserves its place at the top of the nation's priorities. 
However, the development and direction of our agricultural 
policies and the degree and extent on government support to our 
farmers is another subject for debate. We look for the 
individual input of ideas from the farming community toward the 
development of a national agricultural strategy. Our economic 
future depends to a large degree on the performance of the 
agricultural sector, and this will be central to our national 
development plan. 
  An aspect of agriculture which has been ignored too much and 
which requires the urgent attention of the members of both 
houses here is the continuing decline in the state of our 
environment and the abuse of our natural resources. It is a 
poor worker who does not look after the tools of his trade. For 
a country whose main employment is centered on the fruits of the 
soil, we must recognize that our most important asset is the 
land we have inherited from our forefathers. We must do all we 
can to protect our natural resources for without them we are 
nothing. 
  To protect does not mean to avoid using. Indeed in some 
respects we under use our natural resources. Certainly as an 
example, recent experience has taught us that we cannot expect 
by right to receive sufficient rainfall every year to sustain 
us, and that we must prepare ourselves in future to make more 
use of the precious water resources in the Kingdom. This 
includes more emphasis on the construction of dams and the 
identifying of other sources of water for our irrigation needs. 
But equally we ignore at pour peril the dangers of overuse of 
other natural resources. We must conserve our priceless assets 
so that they will provide for future generations as they have 
for the past. Our soil, our trees, our rivers, our livestock, 
and our wildlife. These are part of the rich fabric of 
Swaziland and must be preserved at all cost. They are the tools 
of our most important trade. We must look after them. 
  Earlier when discussing the impact on our economy of global 
free trade, I referred to the requirement for us to become more 
competitive as producers and suggested that efficiency was the 
key. This requirement for efficiency extends beyond the private 
sector and could perhaps become the watchword for all national 
business. Leading the way in this regard should be government 
and those organizations supported by government, the parastatals. 
  With a new start for government, this is the ideal time to 
introduce the notion of efficient practice in all public sector 
dealings. Improved efficiency equals increased productivity 
and, in the case of parastatals, this is something the nation 
expects to see. Too much of government's precious resources are 
spent on supporting the inefficiency of companies who should be 
self-sufficient and independent of public subventions. 
  Let us see the introduction of controlled measures on the 
performance of government and the parastatals and let improved 
efficiency in the public sector be an example to private 
business. 
  Before I include, I should like to address a few remarks to 
our friend in the international community. First, allow me on 
behalf of Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the government, and the 
whole Swazi nation to express my deep gratitude to you all for 
your continuing support and share the experience toward the 
development of the nation. That support has been generous and 
well directed in the past, and it is my hope that you will be 
able to continue to assist us as we decide on the way ahead. My 
theme today has been to focus the attention of the members of 
both houses of the nation's parliament and of the Kingdom's as a 
whole on to the economic challenge for Swaziland in the years to 
come. 
  During the process of consultation with all Swazis which 
will 
begin very shortly, we will be approaching the international 
community for advice based on experience gained in your own 
countries and elsewhere. This is an opportunity for your 
countries to be part of this important stage in our development 
and we will result in a detailed analysis of the targets for 
future development assistance. We urge to help us find the 
right way forward. [preceding two sentences as heard] 
  I have spoken at length about the challenge facing the 
nation 
in the years ahead. These are exciting times and you members of 
Parliament, Assembly and Senate are at the very center of the 
decision-making process. We ask for God's guidance in your 
deliberations in these chambers, and we urge you to reflect on 
the huge responsibility you share for the future of our Kingdom. 
You have our confidence and trust. We ask that you perform 
your duties to the nation with honor, loyalty, and dignity. 
  Thank you. God bless these proceedings.

<F P=106> [Interview with IFP Chairman Frank Mdlalose an ANC Deputy </F>
Secretary General Jacob Zuma by SABC announcer Leslie Mashokwe 
in the Durban studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] Tonight we welcome you from our studios 
in Durban, where we've had a historic meeting between the leader 
of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, 
and the president of the ANC [African National Congress], Dr. 
Nelson Mandela. All sorts of agreements have been reached, 
which are said to be provisional, still going to be checked with 
their principals. [passage omitted] It was said throughout the 
day that the two leaders were smiling and holding each other's 
hand as if promising South Africa something that they could be 
proud of -- smiling about. I'm being joined now in the studio by 
Mr. Jacob Zuma, Deputy Secretary General of the ANC, and the 
national chairman of the IFP, Dr. Mdlalose. Gentlemen, good 
evening and welcome. The progress -- what sort progress are we 
talking about here if you look at this statement, Dr. Mdlalose? 
  [Mdlalose] Well, I think there's progress. First, I think 
the spirit in which the leaders discussed, the spirit in which 
the delegations intermingled and discussed was very, very 
promising; it was really good. And when we came to the actual 
substance of things that we went into, there was no skirting of 
issues. Issues were dealt with straight on, and people spoke 
honestly, and they spoke from their hearts but through their 
brains. They were not emotional; they were being realistic. 
And I think a lot of progress came out. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, how would you describe the kind of 
progress we are talking about here, constructive or satisfactory? 
  [Zuma] I think it was both, more constructive in a sense 
because both delegations approached the matters in a very 
serious manner with all the determination to find a solution. 
And I think that issues were discussed very frankly, and I 
think both delegations realized the responsibility that the two 
organizations have in connection with trying to solve the 
problems of the country, trying to deal with matters of 
violence, and I think what has been reflected in the statement 
as the kind of understanding in a joint statement actually 
reflects I think in a very exceptional manner a kind 
of....[pauses] The two delegations sat down and said we need to 
find a solution. A kind of a delegation that said we are not 
sitting here now to find a solution now, we said we are making a 
solid foundation so that this meeting is not going to be a 
one-off meeting, is actually the beginning of a process that is 
going to move now and, if needed, to go beyond the 27th of 
April. I thought that was quite a realistic approach that both 
delegations realized and indeed were determined to continue as 
much as possible -- in search for the solution. 
  [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, let us now leave out the diplomatic 
issues and tell South Africans the real story. When you say you 
are out to promote conditions in which people of South Africa as 
a whole could exercise their democratic right and to make 
political choices in accordance with their beliefs and 
consciousness, what exactly do you mean? You're saying the ANC 
can put up boards and advertise in Ulundi, open an office there. 
Can the ANC also reciprocate in the same way? What exactly do 
you mean? 
  [Mdlalose] But that's exactly what we mean, Lesley. We mean 
that people should be free to give their own philosophies to the 
public. People should be free to advocate for participation in 
elections if they want to and to promote their own philosophies. 
But equally, we think people must be free to be able to say why 
they may not be wanting to participate if they do not want to 
participate. That freedom should be there for everybody and 
they should be able to say it whether at Ulundi, or around Shell 
House, or wherever, without any fear. 
  [Mashokwe] Are you saying to your followers out there that 
they must from tomorrow allow the ANC in your areas and in the 
same vein the ANC remove their no-go areas wherever they may be? 
  [Mdlalose] Our party has been saying that all the time, and 
we want to redouble our efforts to let the people know that is 
what we stand for. 
  [Mashokwe] No-go areas, Mr. Zuma, within the ANC? 
  [Zuma] What we've been saying Lesley, is that in the period 
running up to where we are, we've had a situation where 
perceptions have been created that if political players are 
saying we are not participating in the elections, it means that 
those who are participating must be stopped from doing so, and 
those who are not participating must also not be given a chance 
to canvas their own views among the people on the reasons why 
they are not participating. What this meeting has said -- 
which I think is important -- it has underlined an important 
principle of democracy that people have a right to choose 
whether to participate or not to participate. But those who are 
participating don't have a right to prevent others to choose not 
to participate. And we are saying the question of no-go areas 
therefore must go. People must be able to reach any part of 
this country, in this province, and promote any of these two 
views, that we see as opposing views. And this is what we've 
said. We've said it doesn't necessarily mean that people must 
slaughter one another simply because they've got two political 
different views. And I think it is an important kind of an 
achievement that we made in this meeting. 
  [Mashokwe] But what the leaders say and what happens at the 
ground are two different things. You've been professing freedom 
of political expression on both sides, yet on the ground IFP 
supporters will not allow ANC supporters to politic in their 
areas and vice versa. How do you get the message down to the 
ground. 
  [Mdlalose] Well, as we've said earlier, we are going to 
redouble our efforts to get to the ground. We are preaching 
even as I'm talking to you now, preaching through the TV that 
people are watching. They have to be tolerant one to the other. 
Whether you belong to ANC, IFP, Azapo [Azanian People's 
Organization], PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], whatever, you must 
be able to listen to the other man and say he's entitled to 
explain his views to everybody around here. That is the message 
we're carrying on to the people wherever we are going to be. 
  [Mashokwe] It is evident that there are still differences on 
constitutional matters between the two parties here. There was 
talk about possible intervention by the international 
constitutional experts. What exactly gives? How are you going 
to unbundle this mess? 
  [Mdlalose] Thank you for asking that. First of all, we have 
discussed this and we've thought of an option that is before us 
-- to consult with international organizations and get them 
perhaps to help us to see through this impasse which we've 
reached. We have not reached unanimity on that point. The ANC 
people are going to discuss it among themselves. We'll also 
discuss it more fully among ourselves and be able next time we 
meet to come up with definite ideas about how we must approach 
this subject. 
  [Mashokwe] On that question of calling in international 
experts, Mr. Zuma? 
  [Zuma] We've certainly agreed that we need to take these two 
points to our principals: one, the issue that is being raised of 
the involvement of the international community at two levels. 
One level is at the level of violence -- in other words, to 
seek to reach the international community, an organization with 
the expertise of conflict resolution as well as the aspect of 
the deadlock on constitutional matters. And we've said we will 
take these matters to our principals to be considered and come 
back after that consideration to say how our principals look at 
those matters, and equally the IFP has felt, as a result of that 
kind of a discussion, there could be a provisional registration 
of the IFP in terms of the Electoral Act so that if agreement is 
reached, they are in a position to find it to participate. I 
think all of that indicates or gives you the chemistry of the 
discussions today that we were able to reach that point and have 
this kind of particular aspect to be referred to our principals. 
  [Mashokwe] I want to come back to this issue of provisional 
registration later after the break, but for now, how binding 
would the views of the experts be? In mediation I would imagine 
that if you say yes, this is what the expert say then it is 
binding on both of you. Have you reached that stage when you 
will say what the experts say binds both of you? 
  [Mdlalose] Actually we've reached that point. We've said 
there will be no point in approaching international experts if 
at the end of the day when they have given us their point of 
view we would say but I didn't accept that. We would be able to 
accept their point of view. 
  [Zuma] Definitely. That is what we discussed, and that's 
what we came to understand. 
  [Mashokwe] And Mr. Zuma, Mr. Mdlalose, I have to go back to 
an ad break, I'll be back just after this. Don't go away. 
[commercial break] 
  Gentlemen, let's talk about this issue of provisional 
registration of the IFP. Time is against you, 4 March is the 
deadline again. Will it be possible for you to have registered 
by then, or do you depend on the outcome of mediation? 
  [Mdlalose] Well, the issue of provisional registration is to 
be discussed by the IFP's central committee. If we decide we 
should make provisional registration, we will do so. That of 
course must clearly be understood not to mean commitment to 
taking part in the elections. It means commitment to saying, we 
put our name there, and if at the end of the road we decide we 
are going to go in for elections, we are clear that we go in for 
elections. But later on if we find that there is no way we can 
undertake to do elections, then we don't. 
  [Mashokwe] It seems to water down this whole historic 
agreement, as it were. It will look like you are saying, we may 
come in, we may not. What would push you to come in? 
  [Mdlalose] But we have been very clear about that. We have 
said it so many, many times, that there are a number of things 
that we have placed before the government and we have placed 
before the African National Congress, and when those things are 
undertaken we march on to elections. Before they are 
undertaken, we have got problems. 
  [Mashokwe] Is this not a new ball game now from the one 
that.... 
  [Mdlalose, interrupting] A new ball game? 
  [Mashokwe] Yes, are we talking about new things in this one? 
  [Mdlalose] Oh no, come, we placed our ideas and our 
suggestions before the government and before the ANC a long time 
ago, and we consolidated them on 19 December 1993. We put them 
in black and white in what we call the Yellow Paper. Everybody 
knows about that. A new ball game? That's surprising! 
  [Mashokwe] I am trying to understand one little thing. What 
are your non-negotiables as the IFP? 
  [Mdlalose] We have put those papers to the whole world. We 
are saying, so far as the constitution is concerned the 
provinces must have powers, and those powers must be unfettered, 
and they should be able to be exercised by those provinces even 
in the future, not to be removed so easily by the central 
government without the proper acceptance by the provinces 
themselves, and by all the structures of government. Secondly, 
we are saying in order that those functions may be exercised the 
provinces must have power to have money, to collect money, that 
is, the fiscal powers of the provinces must be enhanced. 
Thirdly, we are saying the provinces as such must be able to 
have their own constitution, and to have a constitution, of 
course, in line with the general constitution of the whole 
country, but they must be able to make up their own 
constitutions and put them before everybody. 
  [Mashokwe] But have these things not been addressed by these 
concessions? 
  [Mdlalose] No, no. No, no. They have not been sufficiently 
addressed. 
  [Mashokwe] The ANC, why don't you give the IFP what they 
want 
so that we march on to elections come 27 April? Is it difficult? 
  [Zuma] Leslie, I don't think it is a question of giving the 
IFP want they want, it's a question of negotiating. I think we 
have been involved in negotiations for quite a long time, 
including the very package that the ANC has announced in the 
recent past, which is again an indication of how flexible the 
ANC can be. And I think the very fact that we had a meeting 
today is an indication that all of us are keen to discuss and 
find one another in the process. I think what is critical in 
negotiations is a spirit of being ready to give as well as take, 
and I think this is what we are doing, and this is what we would 
like all parties to be able to do, and I think we have done 
that, and I think we are in the process of perhaps even looking 
at the responses that the IFP is making to our package that we 
have come up with. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, Dr. Mdlalose says here and now that 
those concessions do not meet with their demands, therefore the 
two of you are not finding each other yet. What else do you 
have to do? Do you know what you have to do in order to meet 
their demands? Are you prepared to do that? 
  [Zuma] I think what we are prepared to do is to debate the 
issues. I am not certain whether we have had enough time with 
the IFP to sit down and look even at what the IFP says, it 
doesn't mean anything, because if we debated the matters we 
might actually emerge with a position where we could be even 
much closer. I think it is a question of us looking at this 
package, and looking at the criticism that the IFP is leveling 
against the package, and arguing back, because we do not believe 
if one has heard some noises, that all the objections that the 
IFP is making are not debatable. We think they are still 
debatable, and I am sure they would feel the same. 
  [Mashokwe] I see that you know in your h?ad, but could I 
just 
go back to Mr. Zuma? You've had a chance with the 19 December 
-- the Yellow Paper that is being stated here. Have you 
addressed their concerns? Are going to be addressing these 
concerns at all? 
  [Zuma] We have, we have addressed the concerns, and this is 
what we are saying -- negotiations, ever since they began more 
than two years ago, the business has been to address the 
concerns of other parties, and I think it goes on. And I think 
even the fact that today we have come to discuss some 
possibility of the international kind of people participating, 
as well as even the IFP saying -- we could register after 
consulting with our principal on the provisional basis -- is an 
indication of the process. I think the process is on. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Mdlalose? 
  [Mdlalose] Well, I agree entirely with what Jacob is saying. 
The issue is this -- it's not just a matter of yes, no, to an 
issue. It's an issue of, what does this involve? How far can 
this be taken? Take for example the issue of powers, powers for 
the provinces. It isn't just one power. There are several 
powers that are mentioned, and then, when you consider those 
powers in a sense you say how much of that power to be taken by 
the province or by the state will do, as we would prefer to say? 
Now then, you've discussed that and somebody might say, all 
right, that power may be given but it should be in the context 
that the national government will have a say over what you have 
got. Then we have to negotiate that. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Mdlalose, it's almost like somebody who is 
watching could say the IFP has an attitude of -- if you don't 
give us what we want, we don't take part in the elections. Is 
that true? 
  [Mdlalose] Well, that would be a wrong interpretation. 
  [Mashokwe] What is the right one? 
  [Mdlalose] We are saying, for the sake of South Africa, and 
that must be importantly understood. For the sake of South 
Africa, the constitution is best when it has this, that, or the 
other feature. We have already, in fact, considered many things 
even though we would not have liked to have considered those 
issues, but we have considered them in a spirit of understanding 
and reaching some consensus. So we see these powers have got to 
come up and we have mentioned them, and then of course the other 
party will say -- no, yes, you can have that, but not that far, 
then they well know we can't. We must have it at least thus 
far. So that there is negotiation. Negotiation is not just a 
matter of saying A or B. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, I hear that it sounds very reasonable, but in 
actual fact here we have.... 
  [Mdlalose, interrupting] It is in fact, it is in fact 
reasonable... 
  [Mashokwe, continuing] I say it sounds reasonable, but out 
there the reality is that -- the chief minister said he does not 
recognize the authority of the TEC [Transitional Executive 
Council]. Now, the text here says: The responsibility for peace 
and the end of violence rests with the government. Again 
shifting the goal posts, shifting the blame to the government. 
Are you not as leaders supposed to be taking this 
responsibility on your shoulders and saying to your supporters: 
Stop it? 
  [Mdlalose] But I don't think you have read that statement 
correctly. We have said it clearly that there is a 
responsibility on our part to redouble our efforts, those are 
the words we have said. It means we go on to our 
constituencies, we go on to the people on the ground, we go on 
to the structures of our parties, we meet ever so often with our 
branches and let them know that they must tolerate one another. 
We take part in the peace committee structures. There is a 
regional Dispute Resolution Committee, there are also the local 
dispute resolution committees. For example here in Natal we 
have got six centers that are actually manned by various people. 
Since certain instances some of our members don't turn up, in 
certain instances some of the ANC members do not turn up. So we 
have got to get to our people and say: Look, turn up. And that 
is not government, it's our parties. We are going to press them 
to go and take part in these dispute resolution committees... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] OK.... 
  [Mdlalose, continuing] ...and then we say the government 
might as well do its part. We are not saying that's only the 
government. 
  [Mashokwe] Let me hear it from the ANC. Are you also 
redoubling your efforts, redoubling the issue of no revenge 
killings? How do you interpret it? 
  [Zuma] Definitely, that's what we are saying. There are 
efforts which have been undertaken by both organizations, 
because it doesn't necessarily mean nothing has happened between 
the two organizations in an attempt to stamp out violence. We 
are saying we are going to redouble that effort. in other 
words, as two organizations we want to ensure that the peace 
structures that we are party to, and every other thing, 
including new initiatives, we are going to do everything we can. 
But we are then saying, there is a voice that comes from the 
government if there is a kind of violence. They will say this 
is between the IFP and the ANC, let them sort it out. We are 
saying, while we have got the responsibility to deal with the 
matters that we have just spelt out, the government at the end 
has the responsibility to ensure that there is law and order in 
this country, not to pass the buck and say -- violence is there, 
we can't do anything about it, it is a matter between the IFP 
and the ANC. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay, I have to ask again on this issue of 
provisional registration. Will this influence in any way your 
relationship with the other members of the Freedom Alliance? 
  [Mdlalose] Well, it may. We are working as a party to make 
decisions on our own as a party, but naturally we communicate 
our ideas to our partners in the Freedom Alliance. 
  [Mashokwe] Do you think they will be disappointed with your 
move? 
  [Mdlalose] I won't talk on their behalf, they are big enough 
to make those decisions. 
  [Mashokwe] Let us try and get to the root of this. You have 
moved from an alliance that said it will not take part before A, 
B, C, and Z, etc. You've taken a stand now -- provisional 
registration. Is that not in the same tone. It seems to me 
it's not in the same tone with your friends in the Freedom 
Alliance. 
  [Mdlalose] The first thing to recognize is the we have not 
decided on having those provisional registrations done yet. We 
are going to refer them to our Central Committee -- we have said 
that before. There has not been a decision as yet, but we are 
an independent party. If we think that is the right thing to be 
done, that will be so, then we'll inform the other parties. We 
have power to make our decisions; they also have power to make 
their own decisions. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, let me go back to you. The issue of the 
ANC and socio-economic reconstruction development. Are we in a 
situation now where we could say you are going to be able to 
pursue this, say within the Natal region? 
  [Zuma] Certainly, that is our aim. That is what we would 
like to do. All that we are doing, basically we would like to 
have peace and stability. We don't think it is a good thing 
that our people should be killing one another, because if 
there's violence there is no peace and stability, then you 
cannot address the question of reconstruction and development. 
That has to take place within the context and environment that 
is conducive. If there is violence, there is destruction of 
property, burning of houses, etc.; then you cannot have that 
kind of situation. That is why the issue of stopping violence 
is a cardinal question that here, particularly Natal, we've got 
to work so closely all of us to ensure that we succeed. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, let us look at the new task group. In the 
past when the leaders had met they have come up with meeting -- 
with task groups or committees. How effective is this one going 
to be which is charged with bringing back peace in this area [as 
heard]? How are you going to go about it practically on the 
ground? 
  [Zuma] We believe that in order to follow up the decisions 
taken today and the discussions and other agreements reached 
before, we do need the task force that is going to ensure that 
the kind of double efforts that we are talking about are 
actually put in place. It has to meet and plan as to how do we 
in practice take these decisions and implement them and ensure 
that decisions, like the two leaders visiting various areas, are 
undertaken. I think we, by the task force, we are trying to 
ensure that our decisions don't suffer delay in implementation 
-- and also which implementation -- that they should be 
implemented quickly and effectively. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Mdlalose? 
  [Mdlalose] And that also there should be facilitation of the 
national peace structures at local levels. 
  [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, I have to ask you this. It would 
appear you have avoided in this statement here the issue of the 
king and the monarchy. What is the agreement there, because 
they live close to the hearts of.... 
  [Mdlalose, interrupting] We discussed the issue of the king 
and we have not included it in our statement. It's a lot of 
concern and there are a lot of sensitivities about that. But we 
went into that and we did not feel it was our duty really to 
make pronouncements on that issue. 
  [Mashokwe] But it is an issue that South Africans would want 
to know about. Mr. Zuma, is it not important to tell us what 
you discussed at least? 
  [Zuma] The issue was discussed as Dr. Mdlalose says we will 
not necessarily put it in a statement, but there was an 
indication from the ANC's position for an example that the ANC 
recognizes and respects the king, and I think you should be 
aware that in the ANC's position the respect of the traditional 
leadership has been pronounced. Even the interim constitution 
that is there does provide this, and we believe that in the 
provincial constitution which will deal with the peculiarities 
of Natal as Natal, that issue will certainly be accommodated. 
But we did not necessarily discuss it with an aim to conclude 
the issue, because we know the issue is under discussion. 
That's why we thought it was not necessary to put it in the 
statement here. 
  [Mashokwe] Does provisional constitutions [as heard] make 
enough room for the kingdom of Zululand in your view, Dr. 
Mdlalose? 
  [Mdlalose] Provincial constitutions? 
  [Mashokwe] Yes, the ones that have been agreed upon. 
  [Mdlalose] Well, from the point of view of IFP we have 
provision for the position of the king. 
  [Mashokwe] Are you satisfied with those pronouncements that 
the ANC has come up with in that regard? 
  [Mdlalose] There is a lot still to be discussed. I mean, 
the ANC have made their comments about it, but there is nothing 
that's finalized, as Mr. Zuma said. 
  [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, I have to ask you this in conclusion. 
Which of you believe that there is a need for a Zulu volkstaat 
[homeland]? Do you believe there is a need, Mr. Zuma? 
  [Mdlalose] A Zulu volkstaat? We have not spoken about a Zulu 
volkstaat [laughter from Zuma]. And that is not equivalent to a 
Zulu kingdom. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, let me get this quickly, you're left with 10 
seconds. 
  [Zuma] No, but the Zulu kingdom is there. It has been there. 
It is not a question of debate about it. I think what is being 
debated is the role and the place of it constitutionally. I 
don't think there's anyone who debates or disputes the fact of 
the Zulu kingdom. 
  [Mdlalose] The Zulu kingdom is there. It has been there for 
centuries. And no one is going to abolish that. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Mdlalose, Mr. Zuma, thank you for talking to 
us. That was Newsline from Durban and thank you for watching, 
good night.

  [Text] The kwaZulu Legislative Assembly caucus has 
supported the agreement reached between Mr. Mandela and Dr. 
Buthelezi on international mediation. However, it questioned 
the deadline for the registration of political parties, saying 
there could be no solution if the process of registering parties 
ran its course before mediation could bring effective solutions 
to the constitutional crisis.

<F P=106> [Report bu Craig Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 2 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Wednesday [2 March] called for a 
Zulu kingdom separate from the rest of South Africa and said the 
kwaZulu government could not be held responsible for the Zulu 
nation's anger if elections proceeded without this demand being 
met. Addressing a kwaZulu legislative assembly caucus meeting in 
Ulundi, Mr Buthelezi said: "We need to separate the kingdom of 
kwaZulu from the rest of South Africa." 
  "If this can be done through a constitutional principle in 
the 1993 Constitution then we will entertain constitutional 
amendments to this effect." 
  If the African National Congress and the SA Government went 
ahead with the April poll without the Zulu king's demands being 
met, "the kwaZulu government cannot be held responsible for the 
anger of the Zulu nation". 
  Mr Buthelezi made no mention of his talks with ANC [African 
National Congress] President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday at which 
he agreed to consider registering the IFP for South Africa's 
first all-race elections in April. 
  Repeating his rejection to recent constitutional 
concessions, 
the IFP president said these did not even begin to address 
demands for exclusive provincial powers, autonomous regional 
taxing powers, and the protection and guarantee of regional 
constitutions against arbitrary decisions of the constituent 
assembly. 
  King Goodwill Zwelithini was demanding formal recognition 
and 
constitutional accommodation of the kingdom of kwaZulu, he 
added. Furthermore, the constitution had to make provision for 
the "establishment of a constitution by the provincial 
legislature of kwaZulu/Natal which shall recognise and protect 
the institution, status and role of the king of the Zulus, the 
kingdom of kwaZulu and the traditional leaders as well as their 
powers with regard to indigenous laws, customs, culture, 
language and land tenure system". 
  The "intractable" problem concerning the problem of King 
Zwelithini and the kingdom of kwaZulu could not be resolved 
through amending sections of the present constitution, but 
through a constitutional principle only. The new constitutional 
principle on self-determination was not compatible with the 
king's demands, said Mr Buthelezi. 
  "The position of our government regarding the failure of the 
SA Government and the ANC to accommodate our reasonable demands 
remains exactly the same as before. 
  "To deny the citizens of kwaZulu the right to 
self-determination is a savage attempt to strip us of our 
cultural heritage, to belittle the traditional importance of his 
majesty the king of the Zulus, and to eradicate all evidence of 
our Zulu existence." 
  Mr Buthelezi again slammed the ANC for "manipulating" the 
constitutional process to subject Zulus to the "illegitimate 
sovereignty of the ANC/SA Communist Party alliance without our 
consent, without these people having defeated us, and against 
our will". 
  "As far as his majesty the king is concerned, elections in 
kwaZulu can only take place once this issue of sovereignty has 
been resolved." 
  The Zulu nation was demanding an end to the illegitimate 
domination of its territory, said Mr Buthelezi, and "what the 
king is demanding is not so wild when one has been watching the 
ease with which the (State President F W) de Klerk government 
has just handed back Walvis Bay to Namibia".

  [Text] Cape Town March 3 SAPA -- The Freedom Alliance [FA] 
would make a decision on registering for the elections once 
there was a clear response to its proposal for international 
mediation, its leaders decided in Cape Town on Thursday [3 
March]. At a meeting in a Constantia hotel it was decided to 
appoint a committee to investigate all the ramifications of 
mediation action. 
  The decision to go ahead would rest with the Inkatha Freedom 
Party's [IFP] Central Committee on Friday, which must consider 
IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's offer of provisional 
registration for the election. 
  The leaders of the Freedom Alliance, Mr Buthelezi, President 
Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg of the 
Conservative Party and Gen Constand Viljoen of the Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front] met at the cellars in Constantia and 
started their deliberations shortly after 10:30AM on Thursday. 
  After almost three hours of talks the Bophuthatswana Foreign 
Minister Rowan Cronje made a brief statement on their behalf. 
  He said in view of the present state of affairs the alliance 
members had endorsed Mr Buthelezi's initiative to break the 
deadlock -- his call for international mediation. "It would be 
presumptuous of us to say who should be called to mediate." He 
said that would still have to be decided. "We are waiting for a 
response of Mr Nelson Mandela to the proposal put by Chief 
Buthelezi." 
  Only then could the framework and agreement to the terms of 
mediation be determined. "Time is important. It is important 
for both mediation, which can take place very speedily, and for 
registration." 
  Mr Buthelezi was asked whether he believed mediation could 
take place and registration effected in time for the elections. 
"That is not determined by myself, it doesn't depend on me. If 
the (IFP) Central Committee decides to register then it means 
that it is accepted in principle." 
  He stressed that he personally had not decided to register 
but had suggested mediation in that regard, a proposal which 
would be put to the IFP Central Committee. 
  For this purpose he had moved forward Saturday's Central 
Committee meeting by one day. In that way he could not be 
accused of meaningless gestures as the deadline for registration 
is on Friday midnight. 
  Dr. Hartzenberg also confirmed the alliance's stand. "The 
whole matter of registration is connected to mediation," he 
said. He would not speculate on the hypothetical ANC agreement 
to the mediation proposal. 
  Asked about possible dissension within CP ranks regarding 
participation or non-participation in the elections, he said it 
had been thoroughly discussed and a decision had been taken. 
  The alliance leaders were concerned about what Mr Cronje 
called the unilateral suspension of negotiations by the 
government. "Does it mean they don't want us in the election?" 
Mr Buthelezi asked. "We would like an inclusive settlement 
before the elections."

  [Text] Durban March 3 SAPA -- State President F W de Klerk 
said on Thursday [3 March] he did not believe there was enough 
time for mediation to bring the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] back 
into South Africa's transition and urged ongoing dialogue to 
achieve this end. "I don't think mediation is a very 
expeditious means," he told reporters after meeting community 
leaders in Pietermaritzburg -- part of his election roadshow 
through Natal. "Time is of the essence," he said, adding that 
direct dialogue was the best way to overcome differences. 
  Mr de Klerk told parties intent on boycotting the election 
that they were "shooting themselves in the foot". 
  On reports of a split in the Conservative Party [CP], Mr de 
Klerk said it did not surprise him, as he believed there was 
strong support by CP members at grassroots level to contest the 
April poll. 
  In reply to a question, Mr de Klerk said he did not feel 
intimidated by venturing into kwaZulu territory, saying he had 
not received any negative reaction from IFP President Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi on his journey into that region. 
  Mr de Klerk will on Friday afternoon visit strife-torn 
Umbumbulu south of Durban, a district of kwaZulu which has been 
wracked by years of political violence. 
  Mr de Klerk also said he had discussed issues such as 
abortion and satanism with a group of church, local government, 
traditional and other leaders in Pietermaritzburg on Thursday 
morning. On abortion, he said he believed the NP [National 
Party] policy which outlawed unnatural birth except under 
exceptional circumstances, was a good one. Only when the life 
of a mother was in jeopardy did the NP believe abortion should 
be considered. Mr de Klerk moved to central Pietermartizburg 
later on Thursday.

  [Text] Cape Town March 2 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk on 
Wednesday [2 March] advised Freedom Alliance parties to register 
for the election to ensure their voice was heard and so that 
they could participate in negotiations. "My advice is for them 
to register and participate. They will not be giving anything 
away but will ensure their voice being heard; that they will be 
represented; and will fully become part of the continuing 
negotiation process," he said at Tuynhuys after meeting 
Portuguese Foreign Minister Dr Jose Barroso. 
  "Participation does not prevent anyone from continuing with 
negotiations." He said that after his talks on Tuesday evening 
with Freedom Alliance leader Gen Constand Viljoen, the ball was 
now in the Alliance's court. 
  "We would like some specific proposals and then negotiations 
can continue. These can be concluded before the elections for 
implementation after the elections. I believe such an agreement 
would be better for all concerned. 
  "Reneging after the election will be visible for everyone to 
see, will leave more than a bad tase and would have 
international focus." A signed agreement could contribute to 
defusing tensions. 
  Mr de Klerk would not comment on his discussions with Gen 
Viljoen except to say he had the impression there was a move for 
the election date to be shifted. He had stressed the process had 
reached the stage when it had to continue on its course. 
  He did not foresee Parliament being recalled again soon 
because "the strength of the amended constitution which we 
passed for federalism is such that there is no reason for them 
(the Alliance) not to participate."

  [Text] The newly founded African Christian Democratic 
Party, the ACDP, has launched its manifesto. It aims to provide 
a platform for what it calls the silent majority who want peace. 
The ACDP says its image, unlike those of other parties, is not 
scarred by the past. The party's president-elect, Reverend 
Kenneth Meshoe, says he had a message from God to form a party 
which will represent Christians. The party's main policy will 
be to bring about peace through the word of God. 
  [Begin Meshoe recording] We are meeting a need that nobody 
at 
the moment is meeting. Most South Africans do believe in God. 
That is why when you talk of bringing God back into government, 
they are comfortable with that. [end recording] 
  Reverend Meshoe says unlike other parties they will be 
consistent in carrying over the message of peace.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha says a party 
cannot come to power, no matter with what majority, if it cannot 
cope with the economic challenges of Africa. Addressing a 
National Party gathering in Johannesburg's southern suburbs last 
night, Mr. Botha said the ANC [African National Congress] was so 
busy with its internal political work that it was forgetting 
about the world. He said a new government could not afford to 
have large budget deficits or loans that the economy could not 
carry. 
  [Begin Botha recording] Not only South Africans possess 
holiday homes. A vast number of overseas investors possess 
holiday homes. A vast numbner of people from abroad have farms 
in this country. They have invested in this country. Business 
corporations, business companies from all over Europe and from 
America have game farms, they have holiday homes, and the 
government that touches those rights will get into trouble with 
the governments of those citizens whose rights are in this way 
affected, and tax everybody out of existence. [end recording] 
  Mr. Botha went on to say that the ANC was to blame for the 
problems experienced within the peacekeeping force. 
  [Begin Botha recording, in Afrikaans] That is the kind of 
thing you get with the aggressive insistence of the ANC to get 
its way over us. Let the ANC have its way, and the whole 
defense force will end up like that peacekeeping force. [end

discovered 
they were being paid at the lowest rate for their particular

approved the lowest rates. 
  A TEC management committee delegation would also visit the

About 80 percent of the force went on strike on Tuesday, and 
many left the base because they did not receive the top scale 
for their rank as promised earlier. A force spokesman said many 
of the deserters have returned. He said every day lost could 
have a disruptive effect since it was affecting the training of 
the troops, which was now in its final stages.

  [Text] Cape Town March 1 SAPA--The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] has resolved that the R[rand]90-billion housing 
plan announced by Housing Minister Louis Shill should be 
suspended until the controversy about the matter has been 
settled, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
news reported on Tuesday [1 March]. The Council could not agree 
on another resolution, which among other things asked for the 
minister's action to be condemned. 
  Democratic Party negotiator said Mr Shill should be allowed 
to explain his position before such a resolution could be 
accepted. African National Congress [ANC] Secretary General 
Cyril Ramaphosa said the housing scheme was still under 
discussion at a multiparty level within the housing forum. 
  Mr Shill was summoned to appear before the TEC at its next 
sitting in Pretoria to answer questions from the Council and the 
National Housing Forum. 
  The ANC, the ANC-aligned SA [South African] National Civic 
Organisation and the National Housing Forum have said the 
minister's announcement was unilateral and "blatant 
politicking". The announcement had damaged the process of 
achieving concensus on housing subsidy policy and thereby 
delayed the delivery of housing. By announcing an "incomplete" 
housing guarantee scheme, long and sensitive negotiations 
undertaken to bring the banks into the delivery of low income 
housing might also now be jeopardised, they claimed.

national housing, Mr. Louis Shill. The party said it would not 
recognize any such contracts signed before the election, and 
said the scheme would have to be sanctioned by the Transitional 
Executive Council before being implemented. The ANC added that 
it would oppose any attempt by the National Party to preempt the 
electoral right of the voters to pass their judgment on housing. 
  The Transitional Executive Council has decided that the 
scheme should be suspended until differences on the issue have 
been resolved. Mr. Shill claimed that politically motivated 
organizations wanted the provision of housing delayed until a 
new government was in power.

<F P=106> [By political correspondent Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town March 1 SAPA -- ANC [African National 
Congress] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa has called for the 
resignation of National Housing Minister Louis Shill for trying 
to hijack political benefit for the National Party [NP] 
government by announcing a multi-billion housing programme. Mr 
Ramaphosa made the call in a resoluation submitted to the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] at its Cape Town sitting on 
Tuesday. [1 March] 
  Quoting newspaper reports and producing the official media 
release, he said Mr Shill had arrogantly proceeded to make an 
announcement on an as yet incomplete package negotiated by the 
multi-party National Housing Forum [NHF]. "He is clearly taking 
the housing issue and making it a party political matter," he 
said. 
  Mr Ramaphosa told the council that when it was heard that Mr 
Shill was going to make the announcement, he was asked to wait 
and do so jointly with the NHF. "They (NHF) say the announcement 
is premature and has the potential to put at risk everything 
they have done." 
  It was quite clear that by making the announcement Mr Shill 
was trying to demonstarte to the country that one party, the NP 
government, was solely responsible for the plan. "He is abusing 
his position as a minister by using a package negotiated at a 
multi-party forum to boost the fortunes of the National Party. 
  "It is the most arrogant, the cheapest shot Mr Shill could 
take on an issue like this," he said. Housing was a national 
issue and had to be handled on a multi-party level. The issue 
affected the levelling of the playing field (the primary 
function of the TEC). Mr Shill had made it unlevel. 
  "We have had enormous problems with this minister." When the 
housing board was formed he had made it clear he would not be 
dictated to. "This minister must be brought to book." He should 
be brought before the council, along with the NHF, to explain 
his actions. 
  "I would like to say that this government is on its way out, 
and that ministers should not make announcements on issues that 
affect all our people without first making sure at multi-partyy 
level that there is agreement." 
  After listening to the response of some members, including 
Dr 
Dawie de Villiers, who called for fuller information before 
condemnatory action was taken, Mr Ramaphosa called for the 
minister's resignation. "We have had good relations with other 
ministers who have constrained themselves and not acted on a 
unilateral basis but consulted on a multi-party basis." 
  He named Dr de Villiers and the complicated issue of 
cellular 
phones. The minister of finance and of foreign affairs were 
other examples. 
  Mr Shill's actions was upsetting the tenuous balance which 
the council was trying to establish over the transition. "He has 
done the country a disservice -- he must go," Mr Ramaphosa said. 
  The debate on his proposal was adjourned to allow efforts to 
be made to get Mr Shill to attend the session and explain 
himself.

<F P=106> [Report by E. van Wyk] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 1 SAPA -- Housing Minister Louis 
Shill on Tuesday [1 March] denied that the government's 
announcement of a R[rand]90 billion housing plan was premature 
and accused the National Housing Forum [NHF] of delaying tactics 
to obstruct its implementation. 
  "By frustrating the housing process rather than encouraging 
it, my impression is that the forum has now yielded completely 
to political influences which sole purpose is to delay the 
delivery of housing until after the election for political 
gain," Mr Shill said in a statement. 
  Discussions with mortgage lending organisations were far 
advanced and it would be "sad" if the forum should try to impede 
progress in this regard. He was reacting to NHF criticism that 
the announcement was unilateral, premature and jeopardised a 
resolution on the housing crisis. 
  Mr Shill pointed out that the scheme had been negotiated 
with 
housing role players for about a year and that it had been 
recommended by the fully representative National Housing Board. 
  "The government has not been premature in announcing the 
scheme. If anything, we stand accused of allowing the NHF of 
delaying the process for too long." [as received] 
  The NHF had literally since its inception delayed the 
discussions on the grant scheme, he said. "The suggestion that 
we have to delay the process -- which in fact means that the 
regional housing boards cannot proceed with their task until the 
administrative arrangements have been approved by the forum -- 
is preposterous. This decision was based on lengthy discussions 
and expert advice. Any accusations of premature and unilateral 
action is based on a frustration of not being able to delay 
matters any further." 
  Citing examples, Mr Shill said in March last year the NHF 
declared December 1993 as their target date for resolving the 
subsidy policy but the body did not start discussions until 
September 1993 despite requests by him. 
  It was then agreed by the Department of National Housing and 
the NHF that the target date for finalising the subsidy policy 
would be November 1993, but through further delays documentation 
was only agreed upon on December 14 1993, after which it was 
submitted to the National Housing Board for advice. 
  "The National Housing Board recommended that the minister 
(Mr 
Shill) proceed with the scheme but at this late stage the NHF 
insisted on further changes and wanted to refer the matter to 
their plenary meeting on March 14, 1994." 
  He was happy to discuss housing matters with the forum but 
the decision to proceed with the scheme and when to announce it 
remained his responsibility, Mr Shill said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Durao Barroso is in South Africa. 
He will meet the Portuguese community at a time of great 
uncertainty in the country. The Portuguese are concerned about 
the political changes. Maria de Lurdes Torcato was at the 
airport when the minister arrived. 
  [Begin recording] [Torcato] Durao Barroso is going to Cape 
Town where he is to meet President de Klerk. Tomorrow he is 
expected to meet Nelson Mandela at home in Johannesburg at 0730. 
He is also to meet the President of PAC, the leader of the 
Conservative Party, and General Viljoen of the Afrikaner 
National Front. Durao Barroso's arrival coincided with the 
registration of the Luso African Party, Lusap, which hopes to 
obtain the votes of the Portuguese community and to elect at 
least one MP, at the national or regional level, who will 
represent the interests of this important linguistic minority in 
South Africa. Durao Barroso spoke about the new party. 
  [Barroso] Obviously, I cannot and will not, as a 
representative of the Portuguese people, comment on matters of a 
party political nature. It is up to the Portuguese residing 
here, those who have he right to vote -- many can now vote 
because they have been here for over five years -- to make their 
choice conscienciously and freely. I will not in any way say 
what they should do. They are adults with the ability to 
discern, with full use of their rights, to make the choices 
which they believe to be the best for themselves and their 
families. However, I can make a general recommendation, in the 
name of the Portuguese government, and that is that they 
participate, participate in the transition process, that they do 
not exclude themselves, and that they never set up a ghetto. 
This would be in my opinion very negative. For the Portuguese 
set themselves up in a, shall we say, ghetto of the political 
system, or to decline to participate...[pauses] it is important 
for them to be associated to the transition at the moment. It 
is important to feel really integrated and that the South 
African society recognizes them also as active members in this 
transition and in this society. But as for their political 
choices, it is not up to me to comment. 
  [Torcato] Tomorrow Durao Barroso will open the conference on 
the transition to democracy and regional cooperation, organized 
by the South African Institute for External Relations. [end

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Housing Scheme Becomes `Political Football' -- Johannesburg 
THE CITIZEN in English on 2 March in its page-6 editorial 
comments on Housing Minister Louis Shill's announcement of a 90 
billion rand housing plan, saying "it is a shame that a vast 
housing scheme for the low-income group should be turned into a 
political football, to be kicked around by the ANC [African 
National Congress] and its associates." It is also "a disgrace" 
that the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) should not only 
call for the schemes's suspension but summon a minister before 
it to explain his actions. "But then the TEC has gone far beyond 
the State President's original intention that it should have 
advisory and not executive powers. It intends to run the 
country ahead of the election and it refuses to allow the 
government to take decisions without its consent, even on such 
matters as a housing scheme which brings great benefits to 
poorer people. It is not that Mr Shill has jumped the gun, but 
that the ANC and its allies are pointing the gun at Mr Shill and

  Mandela-Buthelezi Meeting Breaks Talks Deadlock -- Referring 
to the Mandela-Buthelezi meeting, Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English on 3 March in a page-14 editorial states that "whether 
it had been broken, breached or merely dented, something had 
happened to the deadlock." "Emotionally, we have a new lease on 
the hope of peace. The outlines of a compromise are discernible. 
The ANC and the Government should now, while feelings are warm 
and spirits high, drop their insistence on so much overriding 
central power. The Freedom Alliance should forgo its insistence 
on the restoration of the pre-colonial Zulu monarchy and the 
establishment of an ethnically exclusive Afrikaner volkstaat 
[homeland]." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Buthelezi Changes Negotiating Style -- It is "premature and 
wishful thinking" to believe that the Mandela-Buthelezi meeting 
represents a breaking of the talks deadlock, says a page-8 
editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 3 March. 
Buthelezi changed his "negotiating style" and "instead of 
responding to Mandela's approach with the usual, gruff `this 
proposal is fatally flawed', was `all smiles'." An explanation 
for Buthelezi's new approach is that faced with pressures, 
Buthelezi and Inkatha decided on the new approach "because they 
needed extra breathing space to avoid a poll they are likely to 
lose. The process of international mediation could also help 
them regain some moral high ground." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Intimidation Campaign Against De Klerk -- An editorial on 
page 10 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 25 February says: 
"Intimidation is an evil which cannot be easily erased during 
the current election campaign. It is clear that no political 
party can be declared entirely innocent, but nevertheless a 
certain pattern is beginning to take form." "What emerges is 
that President F.W. de Klerk, as leader of the National Party, 
has all too often been on the receiving end from ANC supporters. 
In contrast, ANC leader Mr. Nelson Mandela is able to address 
his followers relatively unhindered. Mr. Tony Leon of the 
Democratic Party was this week able to move through Alexander 
township peacefully, as was Minister Roelf Meyer through Soweto. 
Examples of the campaign against President de Klerk were 
evident during his visits to the various regions...reaching a 
low point...when he was struck by an object thrown at him, and 
at Kimberley...where a meeting had to be cancelled for his 
safety. It is clearly no coincidence that these attacks follow 
bitter personal criticsm of President de Klerk by Mr. Mandela." 
  Homeland Sets Time Bomb Ticking -- In his "Political Beeld" 
column on the same page Willie Kuhn warns: "Even among those who 
ought to know better, a dangerous oh-well-why-not approach has 
emerged -- give the right wing their homeland, so there can be 
peace in the land." "Therein lies the danger -- that half-baked 
plans will be accepted in order to achieve temporary peace; but 
this will set a time bomb ticking." He adds: "What happened at 
Newcastle this week is an indication of the explosive force 
which can be triggered by homeland claims. The right wing says 
Newcastle belongs to it, the Zulus consider it as part of the 
Zulu kingdom, the ANC supporters believe it is part of South 
Africa -- and the Indians are probably wondering how they are 
going to be Pakistanized. Even in Standerton the right wing and 
the ANC are fighting for possession." "A homeland cannot be 
established through emotional force," as this "would simply 
repeat and multiply the mistakes of the past. Sober reasoning 
is needed, rather than irresponsible surrender." "There must be 
thousands of right wingers who realize that a homeland cannot be 
simply wished into being. The blacks in the so-called homeland 
towns will not simply evaporate; nor will they accept sudden 
alien status in their own country." "These right wingers cannot 
close their eyes to the creation of a tragedy in South Africa." 
  ID Document Fraud Causes Concern -- An editorial on page 8 
of 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 28 February says: "The 
alleged fraud involving the issuing of identity documents to 
young Zimbabweans entering northern Transvaal legally or 
illegally is reason for great concern. Should the allegations 
prove to be true, it could mean that thousands of Zimbabweans 
will be able to vote in the April election. Apart from the fact 
that this would be illegal, the implications of such voting are 
enormous. Such foreigners could even play a decisive role in 
the election in the north of the country. Part of the problem 
appears to be that Shangaan-and Venda- speaking blacks live on 
both sides of the South African-Zimbabwean border. As a result 
of a lack of jobs, and sometimes food, in Zimbabwe, many of 
these people enter the northern Transvaal and they can be 
mistaken for, and registered as, South African citizens." "We 
hope that the Department of Home Affairs and the electoral 
commission will investigate these allegations urgently and get 
hold of the offenders."

  [Text] Libreville, 2 Mar (AFP) -- The fifth conference of 
African finance ministers today severely criticized the recent 
"substantial and uncoordinated" devaluation of the CFA franc. 
The criticisms are contained in the resolution the participants 
adopted in Libreville on the last day of the meeting held under 
the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Africa. 
  During the public examination of the draft resolution, only 
Cote d'Ivoire's delegation intervened for the removal of the 
portion saying that "sudden, substantial, and uncoordinated 
devaluations are inefficient solutions in the African context." 
Also, Cote d'Ivoire did not want the resolution to say that the 
devaluation of the CFA franc was "caused by external and 
internal pressures on African countries." 
  In the text that was adopted, the ministers and their 
representatives called on the IMF and the World Bank to 
henceforth take "a critical look at the issue of efficiency of 
substantial devaluations in African countries. This is mainly 
in view of the inflexible structures of the continent's 
economies and, in particular, the steady fall in the prices of 
basic cash crops." 
  The resolution also stressed the "negative effects of 
substantial and non-coordinated devaluations on interregional 
cooperation and integration" when describing the 50-percent 
devaluation of the CFA franc decided on 11 January.

  [Text] Accra, 2 Mar (GNA/PANA) -- Twelve people were killed 
and 21 others wounded when soldiers shot to disperse a crowd 
that besieged the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) in Tamale, 
Ghana's northern regional capital on Monday [1 March], police 
said in Accra on Tuesday. Nine of the victims died during the 
incident while three died later in hospital, a police spokesman 
said. 
  He said the crowd had marched on the bank when word went 
round that a Kokomba man was inside to cash some money, 
apparently to lynch him. "The bank called in the soldiers after 
the crowd refused to heed appeals to disperse after failure to 
convince them that no Kokomba man was inside", the police 
spokesman said. When the soldiers failed to disperse the crowd 
by shooting into the air, "they started shooting into the crowd 
which had by then started stoning them". 
  The incident has undermined the relative calm that had 
slowly 
returned to the municipality over the past two weeks, after 
previous incidents of rioting, killings, arson and looting, in 
the wake of the Kokomba-Nanumba ethnic conflict, which later 
engulfed the north to include the Dagombas and Gonjas. The 
Tamale municipality is predominantly Dagomba. 
  The National Mobilisation Programme (NMP) said over 120,000 
people have so far been registered as refugees and are being 
held in schools, mosques, church compounds, police stations and 
military barracks in the conflict areas. 
  More than 1,000 corpses had been buried following the 
fighting, which erupted after a Nanumba killed a Kokomba man in 
a marketplace row over the price of a guinea fowl. Several 
others either died in the bush or were thrown into rivers or 
burnt alive in their houses. 
  The police said all markets within the Tamale Municipality 
had been temporarily closed down and a night curfew continues 
while a three-month state of emergency has been clamped on the 
conflict areas of Gushiegu/Karaga, Zabzugu/Tatale, east Gonja, 
Nanumba, Saboba/Chereponi and Yendi. 
  Meanwhile, police said three persons were injured Tuesday 
night when a grenade exploded at the yam market in Accra, 
popularly known as "Kokomba market" because the Kokombas who are 
mainly yam farmers are engaged in the supply and distribution of 
the food stuff to that market. They named the three, who were 
described as traders, as Kwaku Sasu and Eric Danso, on admission 
with serious injuries and Joseph Asare, who had been treated and 
discharged. 
  "No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion and no 
one has been arrested. But we believe the incident is a 
spillover of the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in the northern 
region", they said. 
  They said one unexploded grenade was found at the site of 
the 
incident, and that the injured were asleep when the grenade 
exploded. Police said three men in military uniform were seen 
in the market area about the time of the incident and that 
investigations are going on. 
  The National Electoral Commission (NEC) has postponed 
indefinitely the district election slated for 22 March in the 
entire northern region and parts of the Volta and Brong-Ahafo 
regions which experienced a spillover of the conflict.

  [Text] It seems as if the government and the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] are finally 
reaching agreements on specific principles and modalities of 
national reconciliation and may soon close down this topic. 
Today, more than ever before, the news blackout was reinforced 
in Lusaka. The only information that our correspondent in 
Lusaka was able to obtain is that the negotiating teams continue 
to meet and in view of the time they took for discussions [words 
indistinct]. Pedro Manuel reports. 
  Good evening! The press was not able to obtain any kind of 
information on the peace talks between the government and UNITA 
today. This is because, first, the morning session lasted more 
than usual and second, after this afternoon's session, the 
negotiating teams began to hold their own meetings, which are 
still going on. According to reports, the parties are expected 
to once and for all conclude discussions on specific principles 
and modalities of national reconciliation. The information that 
only two points remain to be discussed in this topic, has not 
been denied yet. 
  What is more, in view of today's intense movement it is very 
probable that the mediators have set a deadline to reach an 
agreement on national reconciliation. Sources here say the 
parties have already reached agreements on issues such as 
administrative decentralization and UNITA's participation in the 
country's administration.

  [Text] The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 
Amendment Bill and the Electoral Amendment Bill have both been 
approved by Parliament. 
  The Constitutional Bill was approved by 115 votes to 33, 
while the Electoral Bill was approved by 170 votes to 28. 
Dissenting parties to the Constitutional Bill in the House of 
Assembly were the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], the Conservative 
Party [CP] and Independent MP's aligned to the Afrikaner 
Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front -- AVF]. The CP reiterated 
its rejection of the amendments saying they had been inspired by 
communists. CP leader, Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg, said that the 
constitution provided for a unitary state and that none of the 
amendments changed this. 
  The National Party [NP] and the Democratic Party [DP] 
supported the bill saying the Freedom Alliance had received 
everything it had asked for. The amendments, among other 
things, grant further regional powers, introduced the principle 
of a volkstaat [homeland], and permit a double ballot. The five 
IFP members in the house joined the NP, DP, and ANC [African 
National Congress] in voting for the Electoral Bill. It was 
opposed by members of the CP caucus and independent MP's aligned 
to the AVF. 
  Parliament also approved a resolution empowering the state 
president to extend the operation of the 1990 Indemnity Act for 
a further year until 17 May 1995.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Very little is being said about the state of play in 
the border row between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi 
Peninsula and the islands in the Gulf of Guinea. The region has 
been the scene of clashes, of troop movements, and flight of 
populations of Nigerian nationals. Now, President Eyadema of 
Togo has turned up in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, setting 
speculative tongues wagging. On the line to Yaounde, Ajoa 
Yeboah-Afari asked our reporter, William Moles, if it was known 
what President Eyadema was doing there: 
  [Begin recording] [Moles] Well, nothing has been said, 
especially, yet. In fact, the government has been tight-lipped 
over all the negotiations that have been going on in the last 
few weeks. But I do know that President Eyadema met with 
President Paul Biya this morning for half an hour, but I have 
just missed them at the Hilton at lunch time. I just heard from 
sources at state television that he is now on his way to Abuja. 
They also said that he had sent his foreign minister to Abuja 
on Monday [28 February]. So, I don't think there is much doubt 
that he is here in some kind of negotiating role between Nigeria 
and Cameroon. Also, sources at the Foreign Ministry here told 
me that President Omar Bongo from Gabon will also be arriving in 
Yaounde shortly. State radio reported earlier on this week that 
he wanted to use his experience to negotiate between Nigeria and 
Cameroon over the Bakassi dispute. 
  [Yeboah-Afari] We understand that there is also a French 
naval vessel nearby. Can you confirm this? 
  [Moles] Yes, I can confirm this. I have had confirmation of 
this from the French Embassy here. At the Nigerian Embassy, 
they are rather alarmed by the arrival of this French frigate 
they call the (Vondemiere). It came to the port in Douala last 
night with a crew of about 90 sailors. At the French Embassy 
they say that it is just here for a routine surveillance trip 
and that they were also here last September. But obviously, the 
Nigerians here are naturally a bit skeptical about that. 
  [Yeboah-Afari] Well, we understand that the French Embassy 
are saying that the current round of negotiations are going on 
quite smoothly. What would you say to this? 
  [Moles] Well, they haven't actually revealed a great deal 
about negotiations. All they did say to me was that there has 
been some progress in the negotiations after their meetings in 
Abuja on Tuesday [1 March], and they also said that the fierce 
pronouncements of Baba Kingibe, Nigeria's foreign minister, in a 
press conference yesterday, were rhetorical and they didn't 
really say the atmosphere in which they talks were conducted. 
They really have not said much more than that. [end recording]

  [Text] Yaounde, 3 Mar (AFP)--Cameroonian President Paul 
Biya said today in Yaounde that he wanted a "peaceful, final, 
and lasting solution" to the border dispute between his country 
and Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula. In a very short 
statement on national television following the visit of Togolese 
President Gnassingbe Eyadema, President Biya expressed his 
"desire to seek a final, lasting, and peaceful solution," the 
television quoted him as saying. "My brother and friend Eyadema 
and I had similar views on the development and promotion of 
peace on the continent," Mr. Biya added. 
  President Biya, who was publicly mentioning this conflict 
for 
the first time, did not comment on the latest declarations by 
Nigerian External Relations Minister Babagana Kingibe. The 
Nigerian minister said yesterday that the situation at the 
border "could explode if nothing is done quickly to return to 
dialogue." 
  President Eyadema, who has been asked to mediate in the 
dispute between the two countries, called on African leaders "to 
do everything to find an African solution to the conflict," 
according to national television. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry 
said today that Cameroon has requested intervention by the OAU 
in the dispute. Egypt is the current chairman of the OAU. This 
request will be examined at an emergency meeting of the OAU, 
which was created in June 1993 for the prevention and settlement 
of inter-African conflicts. 
  At the end of his discussions with his Cameroonian 
counterpart, President Eyadema went to Nigeria where he met the 
head of state, General Sani Abacha, sources close to the 
Nigerian presidency in Abuja pointed out.

  [Excerpts] The border dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria 
on the Bakassi Peninsula has taken on a new dimension. Nigerian 
Foreign Minister Babagana Kingibe says the situation could 
become explosive if something is not done quickly to get back to 
dialogue, but above all, he directly attacked France. In the 
view of the Nigerian foreign minister, Paris is a party to the 
border conflict. [passage omitted] 
  The French delegation, which was in Nigeria, returned to 
France today after further talks with the Cameroonian 
authorities. Catherine Colonna, deputy spokesperson of the 
French Foreign Ministry, summed up the results of these visits, 
in answer to questions put to her by Adala Benraad: 
  [Begin recording] [Colonna] The mission returned early this 
morning. Its members are going to give an account of their 
talks to the French authorities. It was a mission of 
fact-finding and discussion; it was not a question of mediation 
or anything else. We spoke to both sides in the same terms; 
that is, the situation is still worrying and the tension between 
the two countries over their disagreement is a matter of concern 
to us. Also, we believe the international community should help 
the two sides to achieve a solution to their disagreement by 
peaceful means. 
  [Benraad] Is the matter going to be referred to the Security 
Council or the International Court of The Hague? 
  [Colonna] Cameroon asked that the matter be referred to the 
Security Council several days ago. France, which has been 
chairman of the Security Council since 1 March, has held 
consultations on the matter, and, in accordance with its duty as 
chairman, will make a decision regarding this meeting. [end

  [Text] Yaounde, 3 Mar (AFP) -- Cameroonian media ran a 
number of articles today on the Nigeria-Cameroon border 
conflict. The media ran numerous calls to be "vigilant," and 
questioned the possibility of a possible "costly war." 
Independent newspapers openly criticized the "silence" observed 
by the Yaounde government on the matter. 
  The weekly LA NOUVELLE EXPRESSION ran an article titled 
"Sani 
Abacha Wants a War" in which it disclosed that France, which has 
sent a high-ranking delegation to the two countries, was "now 
caught in the middle," involved in a nonaggression pact with 
Cameroon and caught up with "its interests" in Nigeria. 
  Yaounde media were especially critical of the manner in 
which 
Cameroonian authorities are handling the situation. LE MESSAGER 
says that the decision made by the country and announced on 21 
February to take the matter to the International Court of 
Justice at The Hague is "inadmissible" due to "improper 
procedure." 
  Furthermore, the newspapers blame the government for its 
"silence." Neither Paul Biya nor his government has expressed 
an opinion on the conflict on the Bakassi Peninsula. LA DETENTE 
denounced "the impotence of a decaying power." 
  Other newspapers, such as PERSPECTIVES HEBDO, describe the 
conflict as "a crude plot by foreign secret services" and that 
"Paul Biya and Sani Abacha are taking this opportunity to divert 
the attention of the people." 
  Only LA DETENTE condemns some of its colleagues who "have a 
tendency to enjoy the misfortunes of the regime," especially by 
spreading rumors, like DIKALO, which stated that the 18 and 19 
February clashes killed "180 people on the Nigerian side and 
four on the Cameroonian side." LA DETENTE reminded the public 
that "this is a very serious issue." 
  Cameroonian television invited Cameroonians to be 
"vigilant." 
In a program broadcast during the evening of the 2 March 
conflict, Cameroonian television asked the public "to sleep with 
one eye open, because the enemy never sleeps." The presenter, 
reacting to a Nigerian proposal suggesting a bilateral 
settlement of the conflict without foreign interference, stated 
that this proposal was "a trick to deceive Cameroonians." 
However, he added that Cameroon and Nigeria had no interest in 
"engaging in a costly war." 
  Recalling the principle of the inviolability of the border, 
the television said that "Cameroon was ready to defend any part 
of its national territory. In the television studio, jurists 
and professors in the field of international relations denounced 
"Nigeria's moves toward annexation," reaffirming the 
"non-negotiable character of Bakassi, which is an integral part 
of Cameroon." 
  The television presenter also affirmed that about three 
million Nigerians were living in Cameroon and regretted that

  [Text] Ndjamena, 3 Mar (AFP) -- Chadian Interior Minister 
Abderamane Izzo today accused Moise Kette, chairman of the 
National Awakening Committee for Peace and Democracy [CSNPD], a 
political and military movement operating in the south of Chad, 
of causing the failure of the recent peace talks in Bangui. 
"Through the CSNPD's fault and because of its intransigence, we 
were only able to examine a certain number of problems," the 
minister, who led the government delegation to the Bangui talks 
at the end of February, stated on national radio. The objective 
of these talks, which were held under the auspices of the 
Central African Republic [CAR] authorities, was to sign a peace 
agreement between the government and the CNSPD. They only 
resulted in the signing of a simple joint communique between the 
two sides. 
  "Right from the start, the CSNPD laid down conditions. When 
one goes to a negotiation and starts with conditions, it often 
does not bode well," Mr. Izzo added. Despite this, he added, 
"we examined these conditions, but the meeting was only able to 
agree on matters of principle, particularly on the cease-fire, 
the withdrawal of the republican guards from the south of the 
country, and the free movement of goods and persons." 
  According to reliable sources, Moise Kette had demanded at 
the opening of the talks the withdrawal of the republican guards 
-- an elite unit under the exclusive orders of President Idriss 
Deby -- as well as the holding of a referendum within a short 
time in order to institute federalism in Chad. The republican 
guards have been accused of molesting civilians in the south of 
the country, thus provoking a massive exodus towards the CAR. 
In June 1993, a cease-fire agreement was signed between the 
Chadian Government and the CSNPD.

  [Text] Libreville, 3 Mar (AFP) -- President Omar Bongo 
today invited "all the leaders of legally recognized political 
parties" to meet him on 7 March, following the civil strife that 
claimed nine lives in Libreville last week, according to 
official sources. This meeting is "part of necessary 
consultations with various national political actors with a view 
to reinforcing democracy," a communique published by the 
government daily L'UNION stated. 
  The government blamed the main opposition party, the 
National 
Lumberjacks Rally [RNB] and its leader, Father Paul Mba 
Abessole, for the violence that erupted in several districts of 
the capital, following a general strike called by a labor union 
close to the opposition. The labor union was demanding wage 
increases in the aftermath of the 11 January CFA franc 
devaluation. 
  The RNB has not yet made a decision either to participate or 
not in the 7 March meeting. Its general assembly is slated for 
tomorrow, a party spokesman disclosed.

<F P=106> [Article by C.B.: "Controversial Transition in Zaire"] </F>
  [Text] The High Council of the Transitional 
Republic-Parliament met this week in Kinshasa, holding a plenary 
session after one month's suspension of activities. But it 
appears that many irreconcilable differences remain, on the 
appointment of army chiefs, governors of the provinces and 
diplomatic representatives, and control of the Central Bank. 
  A particularly lively debate is promised on Article 76 of 
the 
proposed constitution which lays down the procedure for 
appointing the prime minister. 
  The UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] wants Mr. 
Tshisekedi, who was elected by the national conference, to be 
confirmed in his position without a vote, while President 
Mobutu's supporters would like to be able to choose other 
candidates. It is this which has produced the candidacy of Mr. 
Kengo Wa Dondo, leader of the Union of Democratic Independents 
and former prime minister, who is known for his previous firm 
government. Paradoxically, his candidacy divides Mr. Mobutu's 
supporters at least as much as it does the Tshisekedi camp, as 
they fear that a political expert will be even more skilled at 
thwarting any maneuvering, imposing his authority, and 
guaranteeing a transition outside the president's control. 
  Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo seems all the more dangerous to the 
Mobutu 
presidency as he apparently has no very long term political 
ambitions and would be prepared to stake his reputation on a 
proper management of the transitional period. 
  The West is continuing to carefully watch the Zairian 
crisis, 
but it seems that pressure on Mobutu to agree to power sharing 
has yet to produce results. Meanwhile, France has granted, "on 
humanitarian grounds," a temporary visa to the president's wife 
so that she can visit one of her children who is seriously ill 
in Paris.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Meles Zenawi on the occasion of the </F>
98th anniversary of victory in the Battle of Adwa; place and 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The main objective of the 
transitional period is to draft and approve the country's 
constitution with the full participation of the people and, 
based on this, to hand over power to a constitutionally elected 
government. The government is committed to this objective. 
Because of the government's efforts to ensure that the people 
take part in drafting the future constitution, more than 16 
million people have debated the draft constitution. [passage 
omitted] 
  I want to confirm that the transitional government will take 
all the necessary steps to ensure that the transitional period 
is democratic and successful and that it will create a conducive 
atmosphere for parties to participate in the constitutional 
congress. Although it is clear that the government's and 
peace-loving people's desire and efforts are to make sure that 
the constitutional process is a success, there are people who 
are still opposed to it. These people, who are living abroad 
and within the country, are struggling to halt or change the 
direction of the transitional path. There is a basic issue 
which we want to confirm to these people once and for all. The 
programs and structures set up to end the transitional period 
victoriously will not be changed under any circumstances. 
  The transitional period will end in accordance with the time 
and direction determined. The struggle to change this is 
nothing but a daydream, so I call on these dreamers to change 
their ideas and to declare publicly that they want to pursue 
their objectives in a peaceful way, and participate in the May 
elections and other programs of the transitional period. The 
democratic path embarked on in our country does not seek to 
isolate others. The legal and democratic participation of all 
will rather strengthen the transitional process. [passage 
omitted] 
  It must be clear that although the government is ready to 
help dreamers if they publicly declare their readiness to pursue 
their objectives peacefully and to participate in the elections, 
it will not accept any kind of attempt to halt the transition 
programs or structures, whether directly or indirectly. 
  Concerning the economy, it is no secret for the Ethiopian 
people that our economy has problems because of mismanagement by 
the previous regime and civil war. However, because of the 
steps taken by the transitional government and the people's 
efforts, the economic situation has improved in the past two 
years. 
  It may be recalled that last year alone the economy grew by 
7.6 percent. This progress was achieved because of the progress 
made in the agricultural and other economic sectors, especially 
the increase in production in the industrial sector. The 
various economic policies of the government also played a major 
role in development. This year, although the government had 
planned that the economy would grow by 5.6 percent, according to 
the prevailing situation the expected growth will not exceed 3.5 
percent. The main reason for this is because of the prevailing 
drought which has seriously affected agricultural production. 
[passage omitted] 
  As a result of the government's efforts it has been possible 
to limit the displacement and death of our people. However, it 
is very difficult to contain the situation by the efforts of the 
government and the people alone. It requires the assistance of 
the donor (?agencies). In this regard, on behalf of the victims 
and the Ethiopian people in general, I would like to extend my 
appreciation to the donor countries and agencies for the 
assistance they have rendered so far, however, the extent of the 
assistance and the (?means) of delivery are not helping us to 
contain the situation. We call on the donor countries to extend 
their assistance, bearing in mind the dangerous consequences at 
stake. 
  The other issue which should be raised in connection with 
our 
economic activities is the ongoing restructuring process in the 
civil service. It may be recalled that after the formation of 
regional administrations, these regional administrations had 
problems regarding expertise. As a result of this, and the huge 
number of civil servants in the (?cities), it was necessary to 
carry out a restructuring in the central government's offices. 
[passage omitted] 
  The objective of the restructuring process is not to suspend 
employees, but to transfer employees from the central 
government's offices to regional administrations. However, some 
people are being dismissed because they refused to work in 
regional administrative offices. So conscientious employees 
should not fear that they will be affected by the restructuring 
process. 
  Dear Ethiopians, the remaining tasks for the fulfillment of 
the transitional process are no greater than those we have 
achieved so far. We have managed to overcome the difficult ones 
in a proper and positive way. The major remaining task is the 
adoption of the draft constitution which will enable us to form 
a people's government. So far, the process is going smoothly 
and I am sure that it will be concluded successfully. The 
transitional government is, more than ever before, on the side 
of the people concerning the above key issue, and concerning the 
improvement of the economy and combating the problem of drought 
and, in general, maintaining the prevailing peace and further 
strengthening the democratic system. Thank you.

  [Excerpts] KANU's [Kenya African National Union] Apili 
Wawire was today declared the winner of the Lugari by-election 
after trouncing his closest rival, Burudi Nabwera. [passage 
omitted] The hotly contested race, seen as a battle between KANU 
and FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya, saw 
repeat results of the 1992 general elections when Wawire, on a 
FORD-Asili ticket, beat Nabwera then seeking reelection on a 
KANU ticket. Today's counting was temporarily stopped for 50 
minutes, from 0730, after protests from FORD-Kenya officials. 
The counting, however, resumed at 0820. 
  With the results from Lugari, KANU now controls 103 seats in 
Parliament, FORD-Kenya 30, FORD-Asili 28, Democratic Party of 
Kenya 22, and the smaller parties -- Kenya Social Congress, 
Kenya National Congress and PICK [Party for Independent 
Candidates of Kenya] -- each with one seat. Two seats remain 
vacant following the death of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga in Bondo, 
FORD-Kenya, and Josephat Karanja, the late FORD-Asili MP for 
Githunguri who will be buried today.

  [Excerpts] General service unit [GSU] and regular policemen 
fired into the air and sealed off the biggest polling station in 
Lugari [western Kenya] for 30 minutes during by-election voting 
yesterday. There was no explanation for the siege of Lumakanda 
divisional headquarters but FORD [Forum for the Restoration of 
Democracy]-Kenya officials claimed it was "psychological 
warfare" intended to intimidate voters. 
  Even after the paramilitary unit had withdrawn, armed 
policemen patrolled the periphery of the station. Reports from 
around the constituency indicated little serious violence but 
there were persistent reports of irregularities including the 
expulsion of a cabinet minister from a polling station. [passage 
omitted] 
  There were near-riots at Chekalini polling station when 
voters hurled stones at KANU [Kenya African National Union] 
candidate Apili Wawire when he arrived in a convoy of nine 
vehicles packed with people singing party songs. 
  The by-election pitted the former Lugari member, Mr Wawire, 
who defected from FORD-Asili, against Mr Burudi Nabwera, a KANU 
defector to FORD-Kenya, and Mr Nathan Fedha (FORD-A). 
  Voting, at least in the early hours, appeared to be slow. 
  It was three P.M. when heavily armed security personnel in 
combat and anti-riot gear blocked the entrance to the township 
polling station and sealed off the Lumakanda headquarters. Six 
shots were fired into the air but no reasons were given for the 
action. 
  Opposition leaders held a 30-minute meeting with the 
provincial police officer and at 3:30 P.M., the GSU lorry and 
policemen who had blocked the entrance to the station were 
withdrawn. [passage omitted] 
  There was a high turnout at the three newly-created and 
controversial sub-stations of Savala, Mahanga and Lumani. 
[passage omitted] By 1:30 P.M., only 800 people at the [Lugari] 
township station -- the largest in Lugari with seven streams -- 
had cast their votes out of the registered 7,000.

  [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today 
said he was concerned that certain embassies were showing open 
support for subversive elements operating in the country in the 
name of democracy. The president said it was saddening that 
some opposition groups had issued threats of terrorism in the 
run-up to the Lugari by-election, but no embassy had protested 
over it. 
  The president said the failure by the embassies to condemn 
the threats showed that they supported subversion and were 
putting democracy in the country at risk. President Moi was 
speaking at State Lodge, Eldoret, this afternoon when he 
received a goodwill delegation of elders from Uasin Gishu 
District, who paid him a courtesy call. 
  He said true democracy was only possible in an atmosphere 
where wananchi [citizens] are free to elect their leaders 
without any intimidation. President Moi termed the demand by 
certain embassies to observe the Lugari by-election as an 
interference in the internal affairs of the country. Such 
demand said the president was tantamount to supervision and 
neocolonialism. [passage omitted]

  [Text] We have just heard that for about half an hour this 
morning about 20 Somalis directed fire at the former Italian 
Embassy in Mogadishu, in which a unit of the Italian contingent 
is based. 
  Guards returned fire, as did the crews on two caterpillar 
vehicles that were returning to the base when they also came 
under attack. 
  No Italians have been hurt. The Somalis fled shortly 
afterward and it is not known if any of them were hurt. The 
motives behind the attack are not yet known.

  [Excerpt] Before we go, let us return live to Mogadishu, 
where our correspondent Carmen Lasorella is inside the embassy 
that was attacked by Somali rebels a few hours ago. What is the 
current situation? 
  [Lasorella, on telephone] The situation is that the calm did 
not last very long. About 15 minutes ago Somali snipers started 
firing at the embassy again. The shots are coming from several 
different positions. It is not heavy gunfire but the shots are 
still coming. The servicemen inside the embassy are returning 
fire with machine-guns. Helicopters have also been requested. 
Two helicopters are now here and flying over the embassy to 
provide air cover. 
  Before this latest attack started, a small group of 
caterpillar vehicles was heading for the port with Italian 
Commander General Carmine Fiore, who was to return to 
headquarters at Balad. The operation has now been suspended. 
The general is here with me, inside the embassy. 
  All possible security measures have been put into operation, 
because even though, as I have said, the gunfire is not heavy, 
the shots are still coming. Shots are coming from several 
different positions around the embassy -- from the south and 
from the side of the embassy. Italian soldiers are returning 
fire from the guard towers...[passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Italian Embassy in Mogadishu has been 
attacked. [passage omitted] Our correspondent Carmen Lasorella 
reports from the embassy in Mogadishu. 
  [Lasorella] I am calling you from the embassy, where 
everything is back to normal. There are no signs of tension -- 
not even on the road. 
  Outside the embassy, the usual groups of Somalis are 
crouching on the ground. Inside, servicemen are going about 
their normal duties, although all defense positions have been 
reinforced. 
  Only three hours ago the air was ablaze with heavy gunfire, 
which lasted about half an hour. The embassy was attacked from 
several different positions, with shots fired at the southeast 
side of the building, at the main entrance on the road, and at 
an internal facade off the road. 
  According to estimates, at least 30 Somalis armed with 
automatic rifles and Kalashnikovs were involved in the attack. 
Italian servicemen returned fire from inside the embassy 
compound, as did two VCC [expansion unknown] caterpillar 
vehicles that were coming from the port. The vehicles had two 
Red Cross women and an Italian journalist from the INTERARMA 
periodical on board. The VCC came under a hail of snipers' 
bullets and returned fire with machine guns and automatic 
rifles. Four helicopters also became involved and circled the 
embassy for some time, but did not fire. 
  None of the Italians were hurt, but one of the Somalis was 
killed and another seriously wounded. 
  But why did this attack take place this morning? Servicemen 
say it is to apply pressure. On the eve of the Italian 
withdrawal from the country, the Somalis want to draw attention 
to their problems, obtain more aid and compensation for damage 
allegedly suffered.

  [Text] Johannesburg, March 4 SAPA -- It was not the 
Afrikaner Volksfront's [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] policy to 
become involved in hit squad activites, AVF leader Gen Constand 
Viljoen said on Friday [4 March]. He was speaking against the 
background of a SOWETAN newspaper report of an alleged rightwing 
plot to murder African National Congress Secretary-General Cyril 
Ramaphosa. Gen Viljoen said the story was probably aimed at 
discrediting the rightwing. 
  The unfortunate assassination of SA Communist Party General 
Secretary Chris Hani was a clear example of an incident from 
which the country, and especially the AVF, had not benefited at 
all. "On the contrary, it caused more damage. 
  "I as a person am not involved in the alleged activities and 
play no role in such planning. 
  "If I should become aware of such planning I would report it 
to the police and do everything possible to prevent such a 
dangerous deed." 
  Mr Ramaphosa said on Radio 702 he had been left numb by the 
reports. "It causes a great deal of concern that there could be 
a bunch of people out there who want to eliminate one." 
  The WEEKLY MAIL on Friday ran a story about an alleged 
rightwing war plan to hijack the SA Defence Force's Rapid 
Deployment Force and strategic installations and to "neutralise" 
hostile generals at the outbreak of hypothetical hostilities.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Whitfield, political correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town -- The Conservative Party [CP] is so 
racked by internal dissent that it could see a breakaway 
right-wing group registering for the election. A group of CP 
MPs made it clear during a caucus meeting yesterday that they 
believed the party should go to the polls. 
  One source said they had effectively "thrown down the 
gauntlet". They argued that if the right wing could get support 
for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] council -- provided for in 
the Interim Constitution this week -- it could force a new 
government to seriously consider allowing for the creation of 
such a homeland. 
  Developments in Durban during the meeting between ANC 
[African National Congress] president Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu 
Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi were increasing the pressure 
on the party leadership. Some members of the caucus said 
bluntly that if the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and 
Bophuthatswana did provisionally register for the election, the 
CP would be making a fatal error not to do the same. 
  Yesterday afternoon a CP MP said the party had taken no 
decision on whether to follow Buthelezi's lead. The party 
leadership had been trying to establish contact with Buthelezi 
for clarity on his plans. There were attempts to call a meeting 
of the Freedom Alliance as soon as possible, and CP leader Dr 
Ferdi Hartzenberg had held extensive discussions with Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front] (AVF) leader General Constant 
Viljoen since he arrived in Cape Town late on Tuesday. 
  A prominent CP member said some rightwingers had considered 
forming a breakaway organisation to contest the election. Those 
in favour of this move were waiting to see whether the CP as a 
whole, or the AVF, would decide to take part, he said. He 
believed a major consideration was finding a "face" -- a 
well-known leader who could draw support -- to lead a breakaway 
party. 
  It it understood that younger MPs like brothers Pieter and 
Corne Mulder were among the prime movers in the participation 
lobby. Respected MP for Parys Dr Piet Gous is also thought to be 
in favour of contesting the election. A senior CP source said 
a major factor behind the cracks in the party was the fact that 
some younger MPs saw their careers going down the drain. 
  There also appears to be disillusionment with Hartzenberg's 
leadership. Another party member said the divisions were not 
about what the party should be striving for, but how to achieve 
it.

  [Text] The Conservative Party [CP] says there is absolute 
solidarity in its ranks, and it has accused what it called the 
left-wing media of trying to cause divisions in the right wing. 
The party's chief secretary, Dr. Lem Theron, said the reason 
for the campaign was the success achieved by the CP during the 
past 12 years in establishing a bastion for the political 
aspirations of Afrikaners and their desire for freedom and 
independence. 
  The Mulder brothers, members of the Afrikaner Volksfront's 
[Afrikaner National Front] negotiating team, say there are no 
differences within the Conservative Party about the ideal of an 
Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] and the need to attain such a 
state as soon as possible. Dr. Pieter Mulder said in a 
statement by himself and his brother, Corne Mulder, that they 
were still convinced that a volkstaat should be seen as part of 
the solution to South Africa's problems.

  [Text] Pretoria March 3 SAPA -- Conservative Party [CP] MP 
Piet Gous on Thursday [3 March] rejected the 
"government-inspired" attempt to sow division among rightwingers 
and suggestions that he was committed to participation in the 
elections. "I have never experienced any yearning to betray my 
people in the Orange Free State or my party," Dr Gous, who 
represents the Parys constituency, said in a statement. 
  Dr Gous said African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson 
Mandela and ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had repeatedly 
stated that plans were being made for South Africa to become a 
unitary state and that there would be no Afrikaner volkstaat 
[homeland]. "Measured against these utterances, it is clear 
that if a volkstaat does not come into being before the April 27 
elections, the legal implication that it could possibly come 
into being after that date, is meaningless." Any reasonable 
person could see that the so-called constitutional concessions 
would not realise the ideal of the Afrikaner people, he said. 
"Therefore, it is impossible to convince us to participate in 
such an election." 
  Dr Gous called for something concrete, not vague promises, 
to 
create the basis for positive negotiations. 
  Dr Gous was one of eight CP MPs named by the SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] as having been absent during 
parliamentary voting on amendments to the interim constitution 
and the electoral act. The SABC claimed this could indicate a 
possible split in the party over participation in the elections.

Mr. Chairman, by participating in the election, we will only be 
helping to give it legitimacy. We will be helping to give it 
credibility. What's more, we will become party to subjecting 
our people to a communist government. And as I said, Mr. 
Chairman, that constitution and that South Africa will not be 
tenable. Let us not be party to keeping it artificially alive. 
We must do everything possible to bring about its collapse as 
soon as possible. [end recording]

  [Text] Cape Town March 1 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council's [TEC] Management Committee was directed to take 
effective political and security steps on Tuesday [1 March] to 
ensure that the election went ahead unhindered in Natal. A 
resolution adopted unanimously at a Council meeting in Cape Town 
urged it to ensure that the people of Natal were freely able to 
exercise their right to vote. Supporting the motion, ANC 
[African National Congress] Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa 
said Natal posed the greatest challenge to the TEC's authority. 
He said people were being trained and armed by white 
conservative farmers in Northern Natal with the apparent aim of 
"serving the stated goal of certain parties" that no election 
would be held in the territory. "The TEC cannot pussy-foot 
around this issue. We have to act firmly and demonstrate that 
the TEC's powers are enforceable." 
  Mr Ramaphosa said the TEC had to reaffirm its commitment to 
free and fair elections throughout the country on April 27 and 
no single province should be exempted. With the co-operation of 
the South African Government, a climate conducive to free and 
fair elections could be created in Natal. 
  Chairman Zam Titus said important steps had already been 
taken to ensure that elections went ahead unhindered throughout 
the country. "We are now looking at reinforcing what is there 
already."

  [Excerpts] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] today 
expressed concern over the training of between 500 and 1,000 
people at Umfolozi. The TEC said the government should deploy 
the defense force in this area to ensure a free and fair 
election. [passage omitted] 
  There was also heated debate following a resolution that the 
TEC [Transitional Executive Council] said must be relayed to the 
president and be entered in the Constitution of the country to 
ensure that people residing in Bophuthatswana and other areas 
are able to vote freely. It was proposed that security forces be 
deployed in these areas and ballot boxes be placed at polling 
places on the Bophuthatswana border so that voters do not have 
to travel long distances to cast their vote, as the people of 
Bophuthatswana resumed their South African citizenship legally 
on 1 January 1994, including public servants, the police and the 
defense force. 
  [Begin Cyril Ramaphosa recording, in English] To allow all 
our people in Bophuthatswana, and we have up to 2 million of 
them, to go and vote knowing that they exercise their vote 
freely and fairly, and that they will be protected by South 
African security forces, if the Bophuthatswana Defense Force 
ever seeks to do anything. But this resolution goes further, 
Mr. Chairman. It calls on the civil servants in Bophuthatswana, 
the soldiers, policemen, nurses, judges and magistrates and 
everyone else to know that they are not going to be left in the 
lurch when the rationalization process takes place. So it calls 
on them to have full confidence in what we are doing. Already 
there is unrest in Bophuthatswana. Civil servants are up in arms 
and they are up in arms because they have deep uncertainties of 
what the future holds for them. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Kathryn Strachan] </F>
  [Text] The SAP [South African Police] strategy for policing 
the election was an unprofessional plan with major gaps, EC and 
Independent Electoral Commission security adviser Mike Brogden 
said yesterday. 
  Speaking at Wits [Witwatersrand] University's Centre for the 
Study of Violence, Brogden said that once the administrative 
staff had been subtracted from the SAP's manpower of 140,000, it 
left fewer than 70,000 effective police officers. This amounted 
to a totally inadequate number of two to three officers to each 
polling station on the three voting days. 
  The SAP planned to call all police officers from their usual 
duties, leaving these tasks to inadequately trained reserve 
policemen during this volatile period. Brogden questioned the 
quality of policing and policemen's knowledge of electoral 
procedure. Another criticism was the lack of contingency plans 
if things failed to go smoothly. 
  The plan was also very centralised, which was an obstacle 
given the time taken to relay a message from Pretoria to 
peripheral areas. There were no plans to coordinate with 
emergency services. Nadia Levine, a researcher from the 
centre's policing project, highlighted the plan's vagueness and 
the lack of detail about its implementation. She said it failed 
to focus on the various problems the different regions would 
experience. 
  SAP spokesman Brig Francois Cronje countered criticism of 
the 
plan being too centralised, saying the SAP's 10 regions had a 
high degree of independence. For this reason the plan was 
intended to be only a guideline, and the regions would be able 
to develop their own plans according to circumstances on the 
ground. He said reservists would be used only in trouble-free 
areas. Contingency plans were in place, but could not be 
disclosed. 
  SAPA reports that President F.W. de Klerk told Parliament 
yesterday that government had a contingency plan to counteract 
violence or any threat to the election but it would not be made 
public. "I will ensure that the election is free and fair." 
The law would be brought into effect and the security forces 
applied against any effort to deny voters their rights. The TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council] would also be brought into play. 
  SADF [South African Defense Force] spokesman Maj Merle Meyer 
said troops would be deployed to assist. Some citizen force 
members were also being called up to replace soldiers seconded 
to the National Peacekeeping Force.

  [Text] Pretoria, March 1, SAPA--Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] leader Gen. Constand Viljoen on Tuesday 
[1 March] said he seriously doubted whether many right-aligned 
soldiers would be willing to collaborate with the government in 
its efforts to suppress "their own people. Gen Viljoen was 
reacting in a statement to State President F.W. de Klerk's 
"continued threats" to clamp down on Afrikaners with the help of 
the security forces. 
  Mr. de Klerk warned in Parliament on Monday that the 
government would use every means at its disposal, including 
security forces to prevent any party from hindering any person 
in his democratic right to vote, or from hampering the 
elections. The Freedom Alliance has indicated it will boycott 
the elections. 
  Gen. Viljoen said problems should not be solved through 
force 
but through negotiations and, if necessary, the elections could 
be postponed. "I would like to remind the state president that 
the South African Defence Force [SADF] of 1994 is not the SADF 
of 1984. Not in capacity, training or experience. Yet a very 
competent part of the defence force, the most competent part, 
consists of many of our supporters." 
  The government and the African National Congress [ANC] had 
failed to grant the Freedom Alliance its right to self- 
determination, he said. "Through their arrogance and complete 
disregard for the just demands of the Alliance, they have 
created anger and frustration which is bound to burst out in the 
open. It is time they accept the responsibility for this anger. 
The correct way to solve these problems is not through force 
but through negotiations and, if necessary, to shift the 
election date. It will be justifiable in the light of the 
requirement for peace in this country." 
  Although the AVF's demands had not been accommodated by the 
government and the ANC "we are now threatened with force if we 
do not comply with the dictated political dispensation which 
amounts to terms of surrender." 
  Although the AVF's demands had not been accommodated by the 
government and the ANC, "we are now threatened with force if we 
do not comply with the dictated political dispensation which 
amounts to terms of surrender." The AVF's action thus far had 
been directed against the interim constitution that could result 
in a communist state, Gen. Viljoen said. "A soldier is loyal to 
the values and norms of his nation, of which the constitution is 
intended to be the product. Our people, being part of the 
defence force of this country ... realise that it (the interim 
constitution) does not represent their values. I sincerely 
doubt whether many of our soldiers, under these circumstances, 
will be willing to collaborate with the government in its 
intended efforts to suppress their own people." 
  Gen. Viljoen wanted to know why the government was suddenly 
so keen to act against Afrikaners while, he said, the ANC 
continued with its "political cleansing campaign" countrywide. 
"Why does the government threaten to bomb us into submission by 
using our own security forces, while Azanian Peoples Liberation 
Army terrorists are granted indemnity for terror acts such as 
the St. James church massacre?"

Friday [4 March] in a bid to solve the pay grievances which 
sparked a strike by 3,100 members of the National Peacekeeping

members of the TEC Management Council would visit the De Brug 
training camp, near Bloemfontein, on Monday to present the 
force's commander Maj-Gen Gabriel Ramushwana with a solution to 
the problem. 
  Capt Loots said the majority -- 98 per cent -- of the 
trainees who went on strike on Monday had returned to work, 
following a visit to the camp by TEC representatives.

  [Text] Pretoria March 4 SAPA -- Developments at the 
National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] at De Brug are damaging the 
image of all participants in the force, Justice Minister Kobie 
Coetsee said on Friday [4 March]. He said in a statement the

  [Text] The government is determined to go ahead with its 
announced housing project worth 90 billion rands despite the 
ANC's [African National Congress] efforts to keep business from 
getting involved in the project. The ANC has threatened that 
the new government will probably not be able to honor the 
contracts. This evening National Housing Minister Louis Shill 
spoke to Ed Herbst about it: 
  [Shill, in English] I think that's a very intimidating 
attitude. I cannot believe that any organization that believes 
they have a part to play in the future South Africa -- and that 
part is going to be played from May month onward -- would want 
to prevent the building of houses. Many of the grounds which we 
are doing under this present scheme -- and which was evolved 
together with the forum in which the ANC plays a very major role 
-- are only going to be developed into houses from May, June and 
July month onward. They would be cutting off their noses to 
spite their face. My appearing at the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Committee] yesterday was meeting my responsibilities 
as a minister in this government to provide information to the 
organization like the TEC of my own volition. They have no 
right to summons me, and they will have no right to summons me 
for next Tuesday either. And the fact that I will be turning up 
there is because I would like to have clarity on this matter and 
I am sure the forum would like it as well. Maybe we can help 
sort the matter out and get back to a normal keel and have the 
politicians out of the business of housing.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on 3 March on the SAPA PR Wire </F>
Service] 
  [Text] Housing. The problem is staggering 3.5 millions 
housing units needed just to catch up with the backlog. Over 5 
million people in misery in urban squatter camps and informal 
settlements, their numbers rising by over 200,000 a year; 
thousands more in unacceptable urban hostels; an unknown number 
in farm and rural slums. This is not something to be dealt with 
in some vote-catching `number contest', like that recently 
unveiled -- and then withdrawn -- by the NP [National Party] and 
Minister Shills. 
  Housing the homeless will be one of the most critical 
challenges the new government will face. The ANC [African 
National Congress] in government will give it an urgent 
priority. An immediate start will have to be made on it as soon 
as the new government is formed. The framework of the ANC policy 
is clear. It rests on the ANC belief that all South Africans 
have a right to decent and affordable housing; that government 
must take on the responsibility of directing the management of 
the available financial, manpower and material resources in 
order to translate that right into actual homes. 
  The programme we have adopted is also staggering. It 
proposes to speed up house building vastly so as to provide 1 
million houses within the first five years; to achieve an annual 
rate of building of 350,000 houses a year, (compared with the NP 
government's record figure of 50,000 in 1992). That scale of 
action will provide affordable for low income families in town 
and country. It will break the backlog of homelessness and 
hostel squalor within ten years. No one should underestimate 
the magnitude of that task. 
  But can it be done? We are confident that, with the ANC in 
the driving seat of government, it can. Our programme is not 
simply a set of aims. It is a realistic statement of the state 
action that will be taken during the early days of an ANC 
government. 
  We propose to set up a single national housing department to 
replace the wasteful 14 departments left behind by the NP 
government. We propose to commit greatly increased funds to the 
housing programme, rising to 5 percent of the state budget with 
five years. We propose to challenge private financial 
institutions to match the state contribution of R[rand]50 
billion over ten years, the funds to be vested in a housing 
finance bank which will co- ordinate housing subsidies and home 
loan guarantees. 
  We will ensure that the available funds are used to meet 
national priorities, namely: (a) the provision of affordable 
public and subsidised housing together with a rented sector, 
especially for low-income families in town and country; (b) a 
thorough programme of reconstruction of urban hostels into 
acceptable standard family or single-person homes; (c) the 
upgrading of existing subsidised housing to meet agreed national 
minimum standards of construction and service provision. 
  We will seek to persuade employers and trade unions to plan 
the provision of housing for their own employees, in reasonable 
proximity to the workplace. We will explore the possibilities 
of providing tax or other financial incentives to encourage 
acceptable schemes. 
  In accordance with our overall democratic approach, we will 
strip away the existing covers of secrecy and confidentiality 
which should housing policies. We will insist on full public 
disclosure by all housing bodies of all information relating to 
plans and decisions; that policy making is open and transparent; 
that all housing organisations are publicly accountable for 
their actions; and that proper arrangements are made for public 
participation in policy planning at all levels. This will 
apply, inter alia, to the setting of minimum constructional 
standards, the selection of sites and appropriate services for 
new housing, the overall planning of housing schemes, the 
allocation of funds to both public and private sector schemes. 
  We will ensure that the national priorities in other fields 
are taken fully into account in housing matters. Accordingly, 
wherever financial parameters can be maintained, we will insist 
that preference be given to labour intensive schemes in order to 
put the jobless back to work; and that preference in allotting 
contracts is given to small contractors and suppliers in order 
to redress past discrimination in favour of big business and 
white entrepreneurs. 
  These are the basic elements of the ANC programme. It has 
been developed with inputs from many other organisations which 
are co-ordinated within the National Housing Forum. At this 
time it is possible that in that forum further specific 
propositions may emerge which will be incorporated in our actual 
programme in government. It is not yet clear which aspects of 
delivery and execution of a national housing programme will 
finally be devolved to regional or provincial government 
structures. But this statement sets out the ANC national 
programme. It will form the guidelines and set the parameters 
for all ANC members in public office at any level of the 
administration.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Call for CP, IFP To Register for Election -- Johannesburg 
THE 
CITIZEN in English on 3 March in a page-6 editorial notes that 
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi "is 
wise" to keep his "options open" by considering to provisionally 
register his party for the election. He can participate in the 
election "if he succeeds in getting his basic demands addressed, 
or he can continue to boycott the election if they are not." 
THE CITIZEN's advice to the Conservative Party (CP) is to 
"register -- and decide what you want to do afterwards." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Anxiety Over National Peacekeeping Force -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 4 March in a page-14 editorial believes there 
are "real reasons for anxiety" over the National Peacekeeping 
Force (NPKF) members' strike over pay. The strike, as well as 
reports of "drunkenness, insubordination, desertion and racism 
within the ranks" reinforces perceptions of the NPKF as "an 
ill-disciplined, if not mutinous force." "To top it all, the 
NPKF commander and former military ruler in Venda, Gabriel 
Ramushwana, has been accused of being in receipt of money from 
the Venda Pension Fund to which he is not entitled." "Meant to 
serve as a model for the future, the NPKF has so far been a 
generator of gloom." 
  No Time for International Mediation -- A second editorial on 
the same page welcomes international mediation if it will bring 
Buthelezi back into the constitutional process. "But it needs 
to be realised that the mere logistics of this process are 
daunting." The mediators would need more time "than is 
available before the April election, which it would now be 
highly unwise if not downright impossible to postpone." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Inadequate Security for Election Process -- "How many times 
have we heard government and police spokesman saying that 
`violence will not be tolerated'?" notes a page-10 editorial in 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 4 March. "With the best 
will in the world, police cannot guarantee public safety." Just 
as worrying as the security of the polling stations is "the 
problem the police will face in combating ordinary crime with 
their depleted numbers on election days. If 70,000 policemen 
are indeed going to be on election duty, who is going to be on 
the beat, or chasing criminals?" Although thousands of foreign 
monitors will be on hand, "their job is to observe, not keep the 
peace." "It is hoped that security chiefs will swallow their 
pride and call on the expertise of their knowledgeable critics 
in revising their strategies." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  `Disjointed' Freedom Alliance -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 4 March in a page-10 editorial notes that the latest 
reports are that "the Conservative Party is so racked by 
internal dissent that it could see a breakaway rightwing group 
registering for elections. There is general confusion and 
distress -- not unexpected for a strange and disjointed grouping 
united only by expedience -- in the Freedom Alliance. There is 
likewise uncertainty in Natal and, it must be said, in the rest 
of the country. For all these reasons Mandela must have read 
the signals well -- there can be no lasting solution to the 
country's problems without Buthelezi's inclusion and active 
co-operation." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  `Political Opportunism' in New Housing Scheme -- "Housing 
Minister Louis Shill's unveiling of the government's massive new 
housing subsidy scheme is a classic example of political 
opportunism jeopardising political progress," points out Cape 
Town CAPE TIMES in English on 2 March in a page-6 editorial. 
"If the National Housing Forum [NHF] is correct, and Mr Shill 
has jeopardised the scheme through a premature announcement, he 
and his party will have much to answer for. The NHF and the ANC 
[African National Congress] for that matter should, however, 
avoid making the threat self-fulfilling." "Just as the 
incumbent government does not deserve all the blame for failures 
in the transition process, it cannot claim exclusive ownership 
of the successes either." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  Official Indifference To Township Bloodletting -- 
Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 4-10 
March in 
a page-16 editorial says: "At first sight, the swift reaction 
by state and private institutions to the Merriespruit slimes dam 
disaster seemed to send messages of old. In sharp contrast to 
the absence of meaningful response to violence on the East Rand, 
where the average weekend death toll matches that of the dam 
burst, the 15 white fatalities and destruction of property in 
the [Orange] Free State provoked the prompt declaration of a 
disaster area. Massive aid appeals were launched, topping 
R[rand] 1 million within a week. Why, we might ask, have 
government and the public not been able to react in a similar 
fashion to the wholesale destruction of the communities of 
Thokoza, Katlehong, and Vosloorus? Why is it that an apparent 
act of God can generate a sense of urgency, while the daily 
bloodletting in the townships meets increasing official 
indifference?" 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  De Klerk Shows `Welcome' Leadership -- Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 1 March says in a page-10 editorial: "In his 
address to Parliament yesterday, State President de Klerk showed 
why he, as an analytical thinker, has no equal in the government 
and the National Party. In a short, powerful address he 
analyzed the state of constitutional negotiations and summed it 
up in a nutshell, and with a single stroke laid bare the 
political opportunism of the leaders of the Freedom Alliance. 
His conclusions were equally convincing: there is no longer any 
reasonable excuse for nonparticipation in the election and the 
national constitutional process." "For the first time he left 
no doubt among Freedom Alliance and left-wing radicals that the 
government would use every means at its disposal, including the 
security forces, to protect the democratic process. The 
firmness with which he declared that the police and the defense 
force would defend the integrity of the state and the 
constitution points to a newly found confidence in their loyalty 
-- an assurance which all democrats will welcome and the kind of 
leadership which the majority of South Africans expect of him. 
President de Klerk's understanding of the concern of the Zulu 
king and his followers over the future of the monarchy is only 
partially shared. We do not believe that the Zulu king ought 
necessarily to hold a unique position in any constitution. In 
South Africa, with its unique ethnic diversity, such ethnic 
exceptions create a recipe for ethnic conflict." 
  PAC Hostility Toward Journalists Intolerable -- A second 
editorial on page 10 says: "The Pan-Africanist Congress' [PAC] 
open hostility towards journalists, and in particular white 
journalists, is becoming intolerable." "At the weekend PAC 
leaders and supporters called for the summary shooting of white 
journalists attending the funeral of PAC's Sabelo Phama in 
Transkei. The guns of the organization's armed wing should be 
turned on the white journalists, mourners said." "This kind of 
naked racism is worrying. In the emotionally laden atmosphere 
of such a funeral things could easily have taken a tragic turn. 
Until the PAC leadership publicly repudiates these statements, 
the PAC should not be surprised if journalists give a wide berth 
to its election rallies. And that could only be to the 
disadvantage of the PAC itself." 
  Criticism of Peacekeeping Force Members' Strike -- The 
strike 
by National Peacekeeping Force members "necessitates urgent and 
real steps by authorities and leaders involved in the government 
in the transition process," says a page-10 editorial in 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 2 March. "It just does not 
seem as though the peace force is getting its act together." 
"If there is so much disaffection in the peace force, how on 
earth will it succeed in ensuring peace during the election 
itself?" "South Africa's political leaders must realize that 
the problems in the peace force have the pontential to make the 
transition, which is already proving to be very difficult, even 
more so. Which is why urgent steps must be taken." 
  Housing Issue Too Politicized -- A second editorial on page 
10 of BEELD says: "National Housing Minister Louis Shill 
yesterday landed in the crossfire once again over his efforts to 
ease the problems of South Africa's millions of homeless people. 
In the Transitional Executive Council yesterday Mr. Cyril 
Ramaphosa of the ANC went so far as to demand Mr. Shill's 
resignation" for having allegedly acted without the approval of 
the National Housing Forum. "The announcement of the housing 
scheme, said Mr. Ramaphosa, was made for political gain in the 
run-up to the election. Last year Mr. Moses Mayekiso on several 
occasions accused Mr. Shill of unilateral action. As was the 
case then, it is difficult to separate valid critism from 
politically motivated criticism. One thing is certain: the 
whole issue of housing has for a long time been highly 
politicized. In the circumstances, one could hardly imagine 
that Mr. Shill could believe he could issue such an important 
announcement unilaterally. The ball is now in Mr. Shill's court 
to prove that he acted with the necessary support of the 
National Housing Forum." 
<H6>  ILANGA </H6>
  Call for Community Protection -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu for 
28 
February-2 March in a page-4 editorial notes it is a "mere eight 
weeks" before election day. ILANGA cannot figure out "when the 
ANC, and other groups that are campaigning, will begin preparing 
to ensure a peaceful election. We do not know when the 
government itself will flex its muscle to put some fear into 
these lawbreakers who insist on disrupting the lives of people." 
"Ideally voters should be experiencing peace already in their 
communities. Even those from overseas cannot bring peace if 
there is no peace within the country. We have peace agreements 
that were signed by various groups in the country, they too are 
broken day and night and nobody cares. Parties on the election 
campaign trail have their rallies disrupted by lawless groups, 
and some party leaders even end up canceling meetings in some 
areas." "The nation is without any protection. It has become a 
cardinal sin to belong to a political party, and yet Mr. de 
Klerk and others say there can be no disruption of elections. 
Does this mean that the protection of the masses will only 
begin on election day? We feel that the protection of 
communities should have long begun, so that come election day 
all is quiet, with everyone wary of disturbing the peace, but as 
things are now, lives are in danger. When will the campaign to 
protect the people of this country from strife begin?"

  [Excerpts] The United States has demanded more 
responsibility from the Angolans. The MPLA [Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola] and UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] have until the end of the month to 
reach some agreement. The two sides are responsible for the 
death and misery of thousands of people. Now if they do not 
reach an agreement, U.S. economic aid will be canceled. Anabela 
Gois. 
  [Gois] [passage omitted] When faced with the ultimatum, 
Alcides Sakala [UNITA's representative in Brussels] did not 
hesitate: UNITA is negotiating with goodwill, if the talks are 
dragging on the blame lies fully with the MPLA. 
  [Sakala] One cannot put things in those terms. As you 
know UNITA has made all the possible concessions in order that 
the peace process might advance. At the moment those backing a 
war solution are the MPLA who launched this offensive against 
our positions. The MPLA is totally responsible. 
  [Gois] Naturally, the MPLA has a different opinion. Despite 
not having official knowledge of the American ultimatum, 
Aldemiro Vaz da Conceicao [presidential spokesman] said that 
only UNITA is creating obstacles to an agreement. 
  [Conceicao] The process is taking a long time, not only 
because of the complexity of the issues being discussed and of 
the nature of the conflict, but also because of the time-wasting 
tactics by UNITA, who is interested in seeing the process drag 
on forever. We will do our utmost to find a solution as soon as 
possible. 
  [Gois] Not even a U.S. ultimatum appears to be enough, for 
now, to make UNITA and the Angolan Government express their 
willingness to alter their negotiating strategy. Time will tell 
whether the United States' threats bear fruit.

  [Text] UNITA wants to know which government posts it will 
be allocated. A source at the [Lusaka] peace talks said UNITA 
is refusing to negotiate further on national reconciliation 
without knowing about its participation in central and 
provincial power. According to the same source, the Angolan 
Government is willing to hand over some posts to Savimbi's 
movement but it does not agree to negotiate the sharing of power 
in Lusaka in view of the results of the September 1992 elections.

  [Text] The Lusaka peace talks are set continue today. 
Contrary to what was expected, there was no plenary meeting 
yesterday. The mediators took turns meeting the two sides in a 
bid to find some kind of agreement. Diplomatic sources have 
said, though, that no such agreement was forthcoming and the 
mediators would have to make similar efforts today. 
  Jardo Muecalia, the National Union for the Total 
Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] representative in Washington, said yesterday 
that he was optimistic about the outcome of the Lusaka peace 
talks. He also expressed the hope that the Luanda government 
would change its attitude. Asked to comment on the talks, 
Ambassador Muecalia said progress had been made with regard to 
military and political issues. He noted, however, that such 
progress had only been possible thanks to the many concessions 
UNITA has made. He added he hoped the government would also 
make concessions.

  [Text] Eduardo dos Santos continues to display his 
murderous wrath against innocent civilians in Bengo Province. 
On 1 and 2 March, Cuban, South African, and Katanguese 
mercenaries, in the service of the Futungo de Belas Palace, once 
again shelled civilians, using long- and medium-range 
self-propelled artillery. The mercenaries shelled the villages 
of Catota and Batuqueiro, on the outskirts of Nambuangongo, 
causing heavy casualties. 
  Kandimba Kavava, health director in the region, told our 
correspondent Octavio Mulangui that 13 civilians, including 
children, women and old people, were killed in the attack, while 
about 48 civilians were seriously wounded. 
  What is more, the mercenaries destroyed the local hospital 
and 12 civilian houses. The wounded have been admitted to 
Nambuangongo Central Hospital where they are receiving medical 
assistance. More than one-third of them have been seriously 
wounded by Soviet BM-21 rockets.

  [Text] Democratic Party for Progress-Angolan National 
Alliance, PDP-ANA, supporters in Uige and Zaire Provinces are 
disappointed with the United Nations' failure to provide 
information concerning the whereabouts of PDP-ANA leader 
Nfulumpinga Lando Vitor. He is believed to have been arrested 
in February of this year, after Andre Santana Pitra Petroff, the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, 
MPLA-PT, government's interior minister, had accused him of 
incitement in the incidents that led to Bloody Friday on 22 
January of last year in which many citizens of Bakongo origin 
were murdered by the MPLA-PT's police. PDP-ANA had accused the 
MPLA-PT government of involvement in that massacre. 
  Once the PDP-ANA's militants had learned that their leader 
had been detained, they asked the United Nations to intervene 
and secure his release, but so far nothing has been said 
concerning Lando Vitor's whereabouts. This matter is beginning 
to worry the Angolan opposition.

  [Text] The secretary general of the Organization of African 
Unity, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, said in Maseru yesterday that he 
is satisfied that the situation in Lesotho had returned to 
normalcy following the recent crisis caused by rivalry between 
two warring factions in the Royal Lesotho Defense Force. 
  Speaking at a press conference at the end of his two-day 
visit to Lesotho, Dr. Salim said stability was important not 
only for Lesotho, but for the rest of the continent. He said he 
had studied a report by the special envoy of the OAU secretary 
general to South Africa, Ambassador Legwaila Legwaila of 
Botswana, whom he sent to Lesotho after the crisis to assess the 
situation. 
  The government had embarked on a consultation process which 
was continuing to bring the two former rival groups in the army 
together. The demands of the army were being formulated by a 
20-man strong unit and discussed by a committee of four 
principal secretaries, namely of foreign affairs, defense, 
finance and home affairs. [Lesotho Foreign Affairs Minister] 
Mr. Qhobela said the army demands would be sifted by the 
committee and submitted in a final report to the minister of 
defense. Dr. Salim and his entourage left Lesotho yesterday.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Rasalama Active Forces Political </F>
Department on 1 March; place not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Political Department notes the following: 
students' concern over their bursaries; the rushed increase in 
civil servants' wages that still does not meet their demands; 
the explosion in prices and inflation, both of which penalize 
the people; the prices of rice, bread, drugs and even that of 
charcoal for households; and the decision by the government to 
reduce the list of imported goods, which contradicts the spirit 
of liberalization and competition and can only surely favor the 
emergence of black or parallel markets indicating inconsistency 
and immaturity in the government's management methods. The 
Rasalama Active Forces Political Department, which always 
remains side by side with the people and is ready to continue 
the struggle, draws the government's attention in particular to 
the seriousness of this situation, an example of which is the 
coming civil servants' strike. The Active Forces Political 
Department calls on the government to find rapid and appropriate 
solutions to these insufferable problems. 
  The Political Department believes that the prime minister 
has 
only two choices left: He should either resign or should 
replace ministers who are incompetent.

  [Text] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello today granted 
his usual Friday news conference to the Mozambican and foreign 
media. Viewing the latest developments in the Mozambican peace 
process, the UN special representative said he was happy that 
the government had decided to start demobilizing its forces 
without waiting for the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] 
to do the same. Aldo Ajello noted that this is a sensible and 
important initiative and he added that work must start now to do 
away with what he described as technical red tape, so that 
government and Renamo can start demobilizing their troops as 
soon as possible. Those troops are currently confined to 
assembly areas. 
  [Begin Ajello recording, in English with passage-by-passage 
translation to Portuguese] I have said that the decision of the 
government is extremely positive and I would like to stress this 
point because I think that it is one of few gestures of 
confidence that we have recorded since the peace process began. 
I think that Mr. Dhlakama understood that and I think his 
statement this morning was correct. 
  Mainly, what the government did was to recognize Renamo's 
good faith. Renamo was having problems producing its lists of 
men to be demobilized, but it really wanted to demobilize them. 
The government offered to get the process under way 
unilaterally. It was a good and wise decision. At the same 
time, it helps to build confidence all around. 
  As for Renamo, I have its first list here. This list was 
drawn up in conjunction with our officials, so that each soldier 
will have his own serial number, thereby allowing us to identify 
each soldier. We will do everything that is needed to [words 
indistinct] all that data is on our computers. You must be 
aware that there have been some misunderstandings concerning 
this list. However, I do not think they will be repeated. 
  I can see, though, that the government's gesture has 
produced 
a positive gesture from the other side, even if this is only a 
small list. Nonetheless, our people are working on upcoming 
lists. [end recording] 
  UN Special Representative Ajello said that the Finance 
Ministry is working hard to process documentation relating to 
the subsidies to which soldiers on both sides are entitled. 
That UN official also disclosed that 45 percent of the 
government forces expected at the assembly areas have already 
been registered. A total of 50 percent of the Renamo forces 
have already been registered. In his opinion, the existing gap 
is being rapidly bridged.

  [Text] Mozambican Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] 
movement has expressed concern about the latest government 
decision to demobilize its troops as soon as possible regardless 
of whether or not Renamo is ready to do the same. 
  Renamo said the demobilization of troops from both sides 
will 
start simultaneously and in line with a set timetable. The 
demobilization should have begun two days ago, but the United 
Nations did not submit a list of names of Renamo soldiers 
waiting to be demobilized. 
  Meanwhile, the United Nations special representative to 
Mozambique, Mr. Aldo Ajello, has reaffirmed that Mozambique's 
first multiparty elections will only be held if troops from both 
sides are demobilized. He dismissed earlier reports that the 
United Nations might allow the elections to take place even if 
the Mozambican Government and Renamo still have their respective 
armies.

positive the government's decision to unilaterally and partially

  [Text] As was the case yesterday, another meeting of the 
Cease- Fire Commission failed to take place in Maputo this 
afternoon, because of the absence of the Mozambique National 
Resistance's delegation. The meeting was scheduled to discuss 
four main points: the destruction of obsolete war materiel at 
assembly areas, the transfer of weapons from assembly areas to 
regional depots, the start of demobilization process, and 
incidents in some assembly areas belonging to Renamo.

  [Text] Kenyan Foreign Minister Stephen Musyoka today ended 
a three-day official visit to Mozambique at the invitation of 
his counterpart, Dr. Pascoal Mocumbi. During his visit, Mr. 
Musyoka held talks with Dr. Pascoal Mocumbi on bilateral 
cooperation between Mozambique and Kenya. 
  The two countries cooperate in the fields of health, 
culture, 
agriculture, trade, and education. An agreement for the purpose 
was signed between the two countries in 1991 when Mozambican 
President Joaquim Chissano paid a visit to Kenya. 
  During the talks in Maputo, the two sides decided to create 
a 
joint commission aimed at boosting their cooperation. Kenya has 
offered to host the first meeting of the commission in Nairobi 
on a date to be announced. The Kenyan foreign minister abruptly 
canceled a news conference he was scheduled to give in Maputo 
this morning on the last day of his visit, claiming that he had 
other businesses at the same time, which could not be postponed.

  [Text] There is more embarrassment for the government of 
President Chiluba in Zambia. The capital, Lusaka, already 
branded the center for the international illegal drug trade, is 
now being branded the center of another criminal racket. It 
seems if you have an expensive car stolen in southern Africa, it 
is quite likely to turn up in Lusaka, as Joe Mwinga reports in 
this fax from Lusaka: 
  An international ring of car thieves is doing a roaring 
business, swooping top cars for hard drugs, and into the bargain 
causing the Zambian Government extreme embarrassment. Last 
month, a Mercedes Benz car belonging to the Namibian Prime 
Minister, Hage Geingob, surfaced here in Lusaka a few days after 
it was stolen from Windhoek. Three weeks later, seven cars, 
including a Toyota Land Cruiser belonging to the International 
Labor Organization, were stolen from Mozambique. They were 
later intercepted in Lusaka, and now yet another car belonging 
to a leading politician in the sub-region has surfaced in 
Lusaka. The ANC [African National Congress] president, Nelson 
Mandela, recently had his family car, a Mercedes Benz, stolen 
from South Africa. Investigators traced the car to Lusaka, 
where its new owner, a senior bank official is insisting he 
bought the car through the normal channels and has refused to 
relinquish it. The ANC representative in Lusaka, Jaffat 
Ndhlovu, told me this morning that the Mandela family is taking 
legal action to get the car back.

  [Text] The Zimbabwean Supreme Court has repealed a 
34-year-old law used by the Rhodesian and the Zimbabwean 
Governments to stop political opponents holding public 
demonstrations. 
  The court ruled that the section of the Law and Order 
Maintenance Act that made demonstrations illegal, unless they 
had the approval of the police, was in conflict with the 
Zimbabwean Bill of Rights which guaranteed freedom of 
association. The challenge to the law was brought by members of 
the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions who were arrested in 
1992 for staging a procession in Harare after police refused to 
approve it. 
  They pleaded not guilty on the grounds that the law 
infringed 
their constitutional rights and the case was referred to the 
Supreme Court.

  [Text] The authorities in Zimbabwe have revealed that the 
first white-owned farm seized under controversial legislation to 
resettle landless black farmers has instead been leased to a 
government minister. Officials said the 3,000-hectare farm was 
intended for more than 30 landless peasant families. Instead, 
the five-year lease was granted to the former Agriculture 
Minister Witness Mangwende who is now the education minister. 
The white dominated Commercial Farmers Union has criticized the 
allocation of a farm to a minister, saying it is an abuse of the 
land reform program. The Agriculture Ministry has defended the 
deal, saying it was covered by the Tenant Resettlement Scheme 
for the rental of commercial property.

activists do with the legacy of their founding father, President 
Houphouet-Boigny? These crucial questions were raised by 
PDCI-RDA Secretary General Laurent Dona-Fologo at a meeting with 
members of the party's political bureau at the party house in 
Cocody yesterday afternoon. 
  This is the party's first meeting since the death of 
President Houphouet-Boigny. On the occasion, Mr. Dona-Fologo 
announced that the PDCI-RDA will hold its extraordinary congress 
in April as stipulated in Article 25 of the standing rules. The 
congress will focus on the vacant party chairmanship post and 
the need to fill that prestigious post. [passage omitted]

  [Text] ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia], one of the three signatories of Liberia's Cotonou 
Peace Accord, along with the interim government, and Charles 
Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Forces of Liberia], seems to 
be in some difficulties. There have been reports that its 
soldiers at Tubmanburg have been refusing to allow ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African State Cease-fire Monitoring 
Group] troops to deploy, insisting that they should receive 
money in exchange for the arms they surrender. They have sacked 
their representative on the Transitional Council that is 
supposed to guide the country to elections later this year. And 
now ULIMO's chairman, Alhaji Koromah, has called us up from 
Monrovia to say there is fresh fighting going on. Josephine 
Hazely asked him what his claim was: 
  [Begin recording] [Koromah] Well, it is very unfortunate 
that today we have had to send a letter to ECOMOG informing them 
on an emergency basis that Charles Taylor's NPFL has launched 
unprovoked attacks for the past three days against ULIMO 
positions, one in the Salayie district near the town of Golu, 
under the command of one so-called Major Black Gina of the NPFL. 
They attacked our forces, wounding three of them, and fierce 
fighting is now going on. 
  [Hazely] Where is the other attack? 
  [Koromah] The other attack is in the Foya district, a place 
called Palm Bay Farm, commonly called Vietnam, where General 
Faya of the NPFL, along with the Revolutionary United Front 
forces, have attacked the surrounding villages and killed about 
24 to 26 civilians. Our forces have engaged them and for the 
past four days fierce fighting has been going on. He is busy 
attacking... [pauses] making fresh attacks on our position which 
we have no alternative but to resist. 
  [Hazely] Are you sure of your facts here, Alhaji Koromah, 
because people will find these claims that you are making 
unbelievable. Why would Mr. Taylor want to attack ULIMO 
positions at this time? Why? 
  [Koromah] We don't know, because we have been hearing lots 
of rumors that he wants to connect by land between Bong County 
and Sierra Leone. A lot of [words indistinct] born in Sierra 
Leone, because he wants to send some of his arms, his military 
arms, to Fode Sankor so that when the government is seated he 
can launch a full-scale attack. And also he does not intend to 
be disarmed totally. He wants an opportunity of unseating the 
government. So clearly because the attacks that we are getting 
are coming from both the Sierra Leone end and the Bong County 
end. So this confirms the speculation that he is trying to make 
a land connection between Bong County and Sierra Leone, but that 
cannot be...[pauses] we cannot accept that to be a monkey 
wrench, because he threw a monkey wrench in this peace process. 
  [Hazely] But where are the peacekeepers? I thought, 
perhaps, the peacekeepers -- UNOMIL [United Nations Observe 
Mission in Liberia] -- are all over Liberia keeping watch. 
  [Koromah] They are not all over, they are not all over. 
They are in few places closer to Monrovia. 
  [Hazely] Yesterday, we got a report that your forces were 
refusing to hand over their weapons to the peacekeeping force, 
the African peacekeeping force, and they were saying they wanted 
money in exchange. Is this perhaps... [pauses] these claims you 
are making, could it not be that you want to deflect attention 
from the problems within your organization? 
  [Koromah] Well, let me tell you something. I told one of 
your colleagues before that your reporter that you have here 
must be in the employ of somebody because, in the first place, 
ECOMOG will not tell you that they sent any troops toward Po 
River, and whatever contingent of ECOMOG, he should ask them if 
they even went near Po River. There was nobody present, there 
has been no schedule for Po River and Tubmanburg where our 
headquarter is, and we have made it clear that the troops will 
be deployed in Boming Hills as they are deployed in Gbarnga. 
  [Hazely] Couldn't there be a split in your movement also in 
terms of the replacing of Dr. Mohammed Sheriff with Thomas Ziah 
and perhaps your troops are fighting over that, and you are 
claiming now that it is Taylor who is fighting? 
  [Koromah] That has nothing to do with the attacks against 
our forces. What I am trying to say about the attacks can be 
verified. The areas are approachable so that shouldn't be a 
mystery to you. If there are problems within our organization, 
okay, that is natural, and we are going to deal with those 
problems today and tomorrow and you will hear the results of 
that particular problem of the question of how elections are 
carried out in the Council of State. But that does not mean we 
will sit here and allow that to cover the heinous crime of 
attacks against not only ULIMO soldiers but also the 24 to 36 
elders and children that were killed. The Kissi people in Foya 
district were killed by General Faya, who is also a Kissi, but 
he is a general of NPFL. He is says that his people are 
exposing him to ULIMO, and I think everybody has listened to 
this particular interview from the Foya district that are now in 
Lofa can attest to this. [end recording]

  [Text] Vandals committed acts of violence in Bamako 
yesterday evening. Traffic lights in the Koura neighborhood of 
Bamako were destroyed, and electricity substations in 
Kinsambougou and (Bagadajeda) were damaged. The Jamana 
publishing house and the annex of the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs were also seriously damaged. The police made some 
arrests. (?CNID Fato Yirouaton) sent us a communique calling 
for the immediate release of the Association of Malian Students 
and Pupils [AEEM] secretary general, Yehia Zarawana, and his 
friends, in order that a frank and constructive dialogue might 
be initiated. This is the sole condition needed to get the 
country out of the crisis. According to the (?CNID), it has 
always fought for democratic ideals and cannot accept repression 
against the AEEM, which is an important component of the 
democratic movement.

  [Text] The communication and culture minister held the 
weekly press briefing at his office this morning. He spoke 
about the arrest of the Association of Malian Students and 
Pupils secretary general, as well as the latest upsurge in 
violence. Boubakar Toure has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Toure] The minister first spoke on the 
cabinet's adoption of a draft bill on methods of taxing public 
contracts in the state budget. This measure was aimed at 
avoiding double tax exemptions and curbing government spending. 
The minister and the newsmen spoke at length on recent 
developments in the school crisis, especially the confirmation 
that the AEEM secretary general had been arrested, as well as 
the violent incidents of 2 March. Minister Cheickna Kamissoko 
was unequivocal about this. He condemned vandalism and stated 
that no one was above the law. Zanarawa had to be brought to 
justice. 
  [Kamissoko] Yehia Zarawana was indeed arrested yesterday 
morning by the police. Just like the other students who had 
been arrested before him, he will have to answer for acts that 
he has publicly acknowledged and admitted to in a radio 
broadcast. It is at his instigation and that of his association 
that students, and others who were not even students -- this has 
been proven by those who were judged initially -- set up 
roadblocks and vandalized public and private buildings, 
property, and health vehicles and [words indistinct] 
Unfortunately, the same thing happened last year in the 
suburbs. That was the result of an action that he masterminded 
and claimed responsibility for. The situation is very clear: 
When one accepts responsibility for a criminal act one has to 
answer for it. In that sense, no one can be above the law. 
  [Toure] The minister also stressed that this could have a 
spillover effect on highway banditry. He urged parents to 
assume their responsibilities. Furthermore, he said the 
government was open to dialogue and that schools would be 
reopened as soon as the situation was favorable. When 
questioned on the situation in the north following Saloum 
Bilal's death, the minister conceded that tension was high in 
the region, and that a commission of enquiry would be dispatched 
to the area to throw more light on the matter. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin 
arrived in Bamako early this afternoon on a 48-hour visit. He 
was welcomed upon his descent from the plane by Mrs. Sy Kadiatou 
Sow, the minister of foreign affairs, Malians abroad and African 
integration and Jean-Didier Roisin, the French ambassador to 
Mali. The French cooperation minister spoke, among other 
things, on the backup measures taken by France in the wake of 
the devaluation. [passage omitted] Concerning an eventual 
second devaluation, an issue raised at the recent African 
finance ministers meeting in Libreville, this is what Mr. 
Roussin had to say: 
  [Begin Roussin recording] I was not in Libreville. However, 
I had the pleasure of holding a telephone conversation with 
President Bongo. I also read the report from that meeting, and 
I did not glean anywhere the possibility of a second 
devaluation. The wisdom of the African heads of state is such 
that this information seems to me erroneous. [end recording]

Togolese head of state held talks earlier with Cameroonian 
President Paul Biya.

  [Text] The Togolese president, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, 
flew to Abuja this evening from Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, to 
discuss with the head of state, General Sani Abacha, the 
Nigerian-Cameroon affairs over the Bakassi Peninsula. President 
Eyadema had held about two and half hours' discussion with 
President Paul Biya in Cameroon before coming to Abuja. His 
talks with the Nigerian head of state took place at the special 
lounge of the Abuja International Airport. The meeting lasted 
about one and a half hours, after which President Eyadema 
returned to Lome. Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, 
Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, later talked to State House 
correspondents on the meeting: 
  [Begin recording] [Kingibe] Well, as you know, the relations 
between Nigeria and Togo, they have always been excellent and 
very, very close. Nigeria and Togo have always taken 
initiatives jointly, initiatives of a kind that is aimed at 
advancing the process of integration, the process of 
understanding, and the process of cooperation in our subregion. 
And it is in this context of regular and close consultation 
between Togo and Nigeria that the President of Togo came for 
about a three-hour visit. Of course, when two leaders of the 
region, like they did, meet, of course they would discuss 
current issues, they would discuss issues of concern to the 
region, issues of concern to the OAU, and that kind of review 
of... 
  [Unidentified Correspondent, interrupting] Excuse me, sir. 
The Togolese head of state was supposed to have held some two 
hours' meeting with the Cameroonian president. What would he 
bring by way of the kind Cameroonian [words indistinct]? 
  [Kingibe] I am sure that the president of Togo would have 
briefed the head of state on the consultations he might have 
held with the president of Cameroon. Mind you, I think it is a 
presumption that they would have discussed the dispute over the 
Bakassi. But whatever it is, they held a tete-a-tete meeting, a 
closed-door meeting between the two of them. We have been 
informed that the meeting had been in the usual brotherly 
atmosphere, and had been fruitful, and that both leaders emerged 
happy from the meeting. 
  [Correspondent] What is the latest situation at the Bakassi 
Peninsula? 
  [Kingibe] Well, I think that troops are maintaining their 
code of conduct, which is, not to be provocative, not to provoke 
any incidents and maintain their positions, and not to initiate 
any action, except perhaps in self-defense. And it has been 
quiet since, and I am glad about that because we do need a quiet 
atmosphere in the field in order to allow us to take up the 
diplomatic way forward. 
  [Correspondent] Have you heard anything on President Biya's 
proposals to Nigeria? 
  [Kingibe] The position is that when earlier on, before the 
introduction of a new element by the arrival of the French 
troops, we were in close consultation and constant touch. And 
the process of consultation between the two heads of state led 
to our head of state inviting the president of Cameroon to come 
to Abuja for discussions. And after further consultations the 
president of Cameroon accepted it. In fact, he suggested that 
perhaps, symbolically, they should meet at a border town, and he 
suggested that perhaps Maiduguri would be a symbolically more 
appropriate place to meet. To which the head of state agreed. 
And the head of state went further -- as a gracious host -- to 
say to President Biya that he can pick or choose any date of 
convenience to him, he is waiting for him. And we are at this 
stage, and I am sure that the meeting will come off as soon as 
President Biya consults his diary, and a convenient time is 
found, I am sure he will come.

  [Excerpts] New York, 3 March (PANA) -- Nigeria has launched 
a diplomatic offensive at the United Nations to counter that of 
Cameroon in their dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula in the Gulf 
of Guinea. Nigeria's deputy permanent representative to the UN, 
Isaac Ayewa, said on Thursday [3 March] that the mission had 
embarked on a "one-on-one consultation" with members of the UN 
Security Council to [word indistinct] Nigeria's side of the 
dispute. 
  On Tuesday, Cameroon took the dispute to the UN when its 
foreign minister, Ferdinand Oyono, sent a letter to the world 
body requesting an urgent meeting of the Security Council over 
the dispute. [passage omitted] 
  The Nigerian mission on Thursday met the Non-aligned caucus 
of the 15-member Security Council, of which Nigeria is a member. 
Ayewa said that the main thrust of the mission's efforts was to 
"stall the actual consideration of the subject matter" by the 
council to give bilateral discussions by the two countries a 
chance. A reliable source said Abuja would soon reply to the 
Cameroonian letter. 
  "Nigeria believes in good neighbourliness, and since there 
is 
a [word indistinct] swell of goodwill between Nigeria and 
Cameroon, the two countries should be able to solve their 
problems without any international mediation," the source said. 
  The council, presided over by the French ambassador, 
Jean-Bernard Merimee, the rotational president for the month of 
March, met on Thursday to consider its programme of work, but 
did not discuss the dispute. Nigeria's ambassador to the U.S., 
Zubair Kazaure, has also briefed State Department officials and 
some members of the U.S. Congress on the conflict. [passage

  [Text] Lagos, March 3 (AFP) -- About 100 students from 
Niger, currently on hunger strike, are occupying their embassy 
in Lagos in protest against the non-payment of arrears of 
bursary allowance by Niamey, a student spokesman said Thursday 
[3 March]. 
  The students, who last Monday began a "sit-in" strike at the 
embassy and who have disrupted activities at the mission, 
Wednesday sent a telex message to authorities in Niamey on their 
grievances, Adamou Tahirou, Vice President of the Union of Niger 
Students in Nigeria, told AFP. 
  Niamey has also yet to pay the students, who are studying 
sciences, banking, engineering, computer science, business 
administration and arts in Nigerian universities, registration 
fees for last year and this year as well as other allowances, 
Adamou said. 
  In a telex message Wednesday by the embassy, a copy of which 
was shown to AFP, the mission urged the government of Niger to 
send buses to Nigeria to "repatriate" the students immediately 
because the embassy might not be able to take care of the cost 
of the hospitalisation of the students, some of whom are already 
suffering from "physical weakness". 
  "The students are in a catastrophic situation" following 
non-payment of seven months of arrears of their allowances, 
according to the embassy. 
  Niger's ambassador to Nigeria, Maman Mansour, confirmed to 
AFP the "sit-in" strike of the students and the debt of seven 
months arrears of grants to the students.

evening following a short working visit to Cameroon and Nigeria. 
He was met at the Lome-Tokoin International Airport by Premier 
Koffigoh and several ministers. Following military honors, the 
head of state and the prime minister met in the Airport VIP 
Lounge, where they spoke for several minutes. President 
Eyadema's visits to Yaounde and Abuja came at a time of high 
tension between the two countries. The tension resulted from the 
border dispute over the Bakassi Peninsular. In Yaounde, 
President Eyadema held a long discussion with President Paul 
Biya. He did the same with General Abacha in Abuja. President 
Eyadema and his delegation were pleased with contacts made with 
the authorities of the two countries. President Eyadema was 
accompanied by Mr. Barry Moussa Barque, his special adviser; 
Foreign Minister Fambare Natchaba, Defense Minister Inoussa 
Bouraima, and Former Minister Atsu Koffi Amegah.

Houphouet-Boigny? These crucial questions were raised by

Cocody yesterday afternoon. 
  This is the party's first meeting since the death of 
President Houphouet-Boigny. On the occasion, Mr. Dona-Fologo 
announced that the PDCI-RDA will hold its extraordinary congress 
in April as stipulated in Article 25 of the standing rules. The 
congress will focus on the vacant party chairmanship post and 
the need to fill that prestigious post. [passage omitted]

  [Text] ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia], one of the three signatories of Liberia's Cotonou 
Peace Accord, along with the interim government, and Charles 
Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Forces of Liberia], seems to 
be in some difficulties. There have been reports that its 
soldiers at Tubmanburg have been refusing to allow ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African State Cease-fire Monitoring 
Group] troops to deploy, insisting that they should receive 
money in exchange for the arms they surrender. They have sacked 
their representative on the Transitional Council that is 
supposed to guide the country to elections later this year. And 
now ULIMO's chairman, Alhaji Koromah, has called us up from 
Monrovia to say there is fresh fighting going on. Josephine 
Hazely asked him what his claim was: 
  [Begin recording] [Koromah] Well, it is very unfortunate 
that today we have had to send a letter to ECOMOG informing them 
on an emergency basis that Charles Taylor's NPFL has launched 
unprovoked attacks for the past three days against ULIMO 
positions, one in the Salayie district near the town of Golu, 
under the command of one so-called Major Black Gina of the NPFL. 
They attacked our forces, wounding three of them, and fierce 
fighting is now going on. 
  [Hazely] Where is the other attack? 
  [Koromah] The other attack is in the Foya district, a place 
called Palm Bay Farm, commonly called Vietnam, where General 
Faya of the NPFL, along with the Revolutionary United Front 
forces, have attacked the surrounding villages and killed about 
24 to 26 civilians. Our forces have engaged them and for the 
past four days fierce fighting has been going on. He is busy 
attacking... [pauses] making fresh attacks on our position which 
we have no alternative but to resist. 
  [Hazely] Are you sure of your facts here, Alhaji Koromah, 
because people will find these claims that you are making 
unbelievable. Why would Mr. Taylor want to attack ULIMO 
positions at this time? Why? 
  [Koromah] We don't know, because we have been hearing lots 
of rumors that he wants to connect by land between Bong County 
and Sierra Leone. A lot of [words indistinct] born in Sierra 
Leone, because he wants to send some of his arms, his military 
arms, to Fode Sankor so that when the government is seated he 
can launch a full-scale attack. And also he does not intend to 
be disarmed totally. He wants an opportunity of unseating the 
government. So clearly because the attacks that we are getting 
are coming from both the Sierra Leone end and the Bong County 
end. So this confirms the speculation that he is trying to make 
a land connection between Bong County and Sierra Leone, but that 
cannot be...[pauses] we cannot accept that to be a monkey 
wrench, because he threw a monkey wrench in this peace process. 
  [Hazely] But where are the peacekeepers? I thought, 
perhaps, the peacekeepers -- UNOMIL [United Nations Observe 
Mission in Liberia] -- are all over Liberia keeping watch. 
  [Koromah] They are not all over, they are not all over. 
They are in few places closer to Monrovia. 
  [Hazely] Yesterday, we got a report that your forces were 
refusing to hand over their weapons to the peacekeeping force, 
the African peacekeeping force, and they were saying they wanted 
money in exchange. Is this perhaps... [pauses] these claims you 
are making, could it not be that you want to deflect attention 
from the problems within your organization? 
  [Koromah] Well, let me tell you something. I told one of 
your colleagues before that your reporter that you have here 
must be in the employ of somebody because, in the first place, 
ECOMOG will not tell you that they sent any troops toward Po 
River, and whatever contingent of ECOMOG, he should ask them if 
they even went near Po River. There was nobody present, there 
has been no schedule for Po River and Tubmanburg where our 
headquarter is, and we have made it clear that the troops will 
be deployed in Boming Hills as they are deployed in Gbarnga. 
  [Hazely] Couldn't there be a split in your movement also in 
terms of the replacing of Dr. Mohammed Sheriff with Thomas Ziah 
and perhaps your troops are fighting over that, and you are 
claiming now that it is Taylor who is fighting? 
  [Koromah] That has nothing to do with the attacks against 
our forces. What I am trying to say about the attacks can be 
verified. The areas are approachable so that shouldn't be a 
mystery to you. If there are problems within our organization, 
okay, that is natural, and we are going to deal with those 
problems today and tomorrow and you will hear the results of 
that particular problem of the question of how elections are 
carried out in the Council of State. But that does not mean we 
will sit here and allow that to cover the heinous crime of 
attacks against not only ULIMO soldiers but also the 24 to 36 
elders and children that were killed. The Kissi people in Foya 
district were killed by General Faya, who is also a Kissi, but 
he is a general of NPFL. He is says that his people are 
exposing him to ULIMO, and I think everybody has listened to 
this particular interview from the Foya district that are now in 
Lofa can attest to this. [end recording]

  [Text] Vandals committed acts of violence in Bamako 
yesterday evening. Traffic lights in the Koura neighborhood of 
Bamako were destroyed, and electricity substations in 
Kinsambougou and (Bagadajeda) were damaged. The Jamana 
publishing house and the annex of the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs were also seriously damaged. The police made some 
arrests. (?CNID Fato Yirouaton) sent us a communique calling 
for the immediate release of the Association of Malian Students 
and Pupils [AEEM] secretary general, Yehia Zarawana, and his 
friends, in order that a frank and constructive dialogue might 
be initiated. This is the sole condition needed to get the 
country out of the crisis. According to the (?CNID), it has 
always fought for democratic ideals and cannot accept repression 
against the AEEM, which is an important component of the 
democratic movement.

  [Text] The communication and culture minister held the 
weekly press briefing at his office this morning. He spoke 
about the arrest of the Association of Malian Students and 
Pupils secretary general, as well as the latest upsurge in 
violence. Boubakar Toure has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Toure] The minister first spoke on the 
cabinet's adoption of a draft bill on methods of taxing public 
contracts in the state budget. This measure was aimed at 
avoiding double tax exemptions and curbing government spending. 
The minister and the newsmen spoke at length on recent 
developments in the school crisis, especially the confirmation 
that the AEEM secretary general had been arrested, as well as 
the violent incidents of 2 March. Minister Cheickna Kamissoko 
was unequivocal about this. He condemned vandalism and stated 
that no one was above the law. Zanarawa had to be brought to 
justice. 
  [Kamissoko] Yehia Zarawana was indeed arrested yesterday 
morning by the police. Just like the other students who had 
been arrested before him, he will have to answer for acts that 
he has publicly acknowledged and admitted to in a radio 
broadcast. It is at his instigation and that of his association 
that students, and others who were not even students -- this has 
been proven by those who were judged initially -- set up 
roadblocks and vandalized public and private buildings, 
property, and health vehicles and [words indistinct] 
Unfortunately, the same thing happened last year in the 
suburbs. That was the result of an action that he masterminded 
and claimed responsibility for. The situation is very clear: 
When one accepts responsibility for a criminal act one has to 
answer for it. In that sense, no one can be above the law. 
  [Toure] The minister also stressed that this could have a 
spillover effect on highway banditry. He urged parents to 
assume their responsibilities. Furthermore, he said the 
government was open to dialogue and that schools would be 
reopened as soon as the situation was favorable. When 
questioned on the situation in the north following Saloum 
Bilal's death, the minister conceded that tension was high in 
the region, and that a commission of enquiry would be dispatched 
to the area to throw more light on the matter. [end recording]

arrived in Bamako early this afternoon on a 48-hour visit. He 
was welcomed upon his descent from the plane by Mrs. Sy Kadiatou 
Sow, the minister of foreign affairs, Malians abroad and African 
integration and Jean-Didier Roisin, the French ambassador to 
Mali. The French cooperation minister spoke, among other 
things, on the backup measures taken by France in the wake of 
the devaluation. [passage omitted] Concerning an eventual 
second devaluation, an issue raised at the recent African 
finance ministers meeting in Libreville, this is what Mr. 
Roussin had to say: 
  [Begin Roussin recording] I was not in Libreville. However, 
I had the pleasure of holding a telephone conversation with 
President Bongo. I also read the report from that meeting, and 
I did not glean anywhere the possibility of a second 
devaluation. The wisdom of the African heads of state is such 
that this information seems to me erroneous. [end recording]

Togolese head of state held talks earlier with Cameroonian 
President Paul Biya.

  [Text] The Togolese president, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, 
flew to Abuja this evening from Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, to 
discuss with the head of state, General Sani Abacha, the 
Nigerian-Cameroon affairs over the Bakassi Peninsula. President 
Eyadema had held about two and half hours' discussion with 
President Paul Biya in Cameroon before coming to Abuja. His 
talks with the Nigerian head of state took place at the special 
lounge of the Abuja International Airport. The meeting lasted 
about one and a half hours, after which President Eyadema 
returned to Lome. Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, 
Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, later talked to State House 
correspondents on the meeting: 
  [Begin recording] [Kingibe] Well, as you know, the relations 
between Nigeria and Togo, they have always been excellent and 
very, very close. Nigeria and Togo have always taken 
initiatives jointly, initiatives of a kind that is aimed at 
advancing the process of integration, the process of 
understanding, and the process of cooperation in our subregion. 
And it is in this context of regular and close consultation 
between Togo and Nigeria that the President of Togo came for 
about a three-hour visit. Of course, when two leaders of the 
region, like they did, meet, of course they would discuss 
current issues, they would discuss issues of concern to the 
region, issues of concern to the OAU, and that kind of review 
of... 
  [Unidentified Correspondent, interrupting] Excuse me, sir. 
The Togolese head of state was supposed to have held some two 
hours' meeting with the Cameroonian president. What would he 
bring by way of the kind Cameroonian [words indistinct]? 
  [Kingibe] I am sure that the president of Togo would have 
briefed the head of state on the consultations he might have 
held with the president of Cameroon. Mind you, I think it is a 
presumption that they would have discussed the dispute over the 
Bakassi. But whatever it is, they held a tete-a-tete meeting, a 
closed-door meeting between the two of them. We have been 
informed that the meeting had been in the usual brotherly 
atmosphere, and had been fruitful, and that both leaders emerged 
happy from the meeting. 
  [Correspondent] What is the latest situation at the Bakassi 
Peninsula? 
  [Kingibe] Well, I think that troops are maintaining their 
code of conduct, which is, not to be provocative, not to provoke 
any incidents and maintain their positions, and not to initiate 
any action, except perhaps in self-defense. And it has been 
quiet since, and I am glad about that because we do need a quiet 
atmosphere in the field in order to allow us to take up the 
diplomatic way forward. 
  [Correspondent] Have you heard anything on President Biya's 
proposals to Nigeria? 
  [Kingibe] The position is that when earlier on, before the 
introduction of a new element by the arrival of the French 
troops, we were in close consultation and constant touch. And 
the process of consultation between the two heads of state led 
to our head of state inviting the president of Cameroon to come 
to Abuja for discussions. And after further consultations the 
president of Cameroon accepted it. In fact, he suggested that 
perhaps, symbolically, they should meet at a border town, and he 
suggested that perhaps Maiduguri would be a symbolically more 
appropriate place to meet. To which the head of state agreed. 
And the head of state went further -- as a gracious host -- to 
say to President Biya that he can pick or choose any date of 
convenience to him, he is waiting for him. And we are at this 
stage, and I am sure that the meeting will come off as soon as 
President Biya consults his diary, and a convenient time is 
found, I am sure he will come.

  [Excerpts] New York, 3 March (PANA) -- Nigeria has launched 
a diplomatic offensive at the United Nations to counter that of 
Cameroon in their dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula in the Gulf 
of Guinea. Nigeria's deputy permanent representative to the UN, 
Isaac Ayewa, said on Thursday [3 March] that the mission had 
embarked on a "one-on-one consultation" with members of the UN 
Security Council to [word indistinct] Nigeria's side of the 
dispute. 
  On Tuesday, Cameroon took the dispute to the UN when its 
foreign minister, Ferdinand Oyono, sent a letter to the world 
body requesting an urgent meeting of the Security Council over 
the dispute. [passage omitted] 
  The Nigerian mission on Thursday met the Non-aligned caucus 
of the 15-member Security Council, of which Nigeria is a member. 
Ayewa said that the main thrust of the mission's efforts was to 
"stall the actual consideration of the subject matter" by the 
council to give bilateral discussions by the two countries a 
chance. A reliable source said Abuja would soon reply to the 
Cameroonian letter. 
  "Nigeria believes in good neighbourliness, and since there 
is 
a [word indistinct] swell of goodwill between Nigeria and 
Cameroon, the two countries should be able to solve their 
problems without any international mediation," the source said. 
  The council, presided over by the French ambassador, 
Jean-Bernard Merimee, the rotational president for the month of 
March, met on Thursday to consider its programme of work, but 
did not discuss the dispute. Nigeria's ambassador to the U.S., 
Zubair Kazaure, has also briefed State Department officials and 
some members of the U.S. Congress on the conflict. [passage

  [Text] Lagos, March 3 (AFP) -- About 100 students from 
Niger, currently on hunger strike, are occupying their embassy 
in Lagos in protest against the non-payment of arrears of 
bursary allowance by Niamey, a student spokesman said Thursday 
[3 March]. 
  The students, who last Monday began a "sit-in" strike at the 
embassy and who have disrupted activities at the mission, 
Wednesday sent a telex message to authorities in Niamey on their 
grievances, Adamou Tahirou, Vice President of the Union of Niger 
Students in Nigeria, told AFP. 
  Niamey has also yet to pay the students, who are studying 
sciences, banking, engineering, computer science, business 
administration and arts in Nigerian universities, registration 
fees for last year and this year as well as other allowances, 
Adamou said. 
  In a telex message Wednesday by the embassy, a copy of which 
was shown to AFP, the mission urged the government of Niger to 
send buses to Nigeria to "repatriate" the students immediately 
because the embassy might not be able to take care of the cost 
of the hospitalisation of the students, some of whom are already 
suffering from "physical weakness". 
  "The students are in a catastrophic situation" following 
non-payment of seven months of arrears of their allowances, 
according to the embassy. 
  Niger's ambassador to Nigeria, Maman Mansour, confirmed to 
AFP the "sit-in" strike of the students and the debt of seven 
months arrears of grants to the students.

He was met at the Lome-Tokoin International Airport by Premier 
Koffigoh and several ministers. Following military honors, the 
head of state and the prime minister met in the Airport VIP 
Lounge, where they spoke for several minutes. President 
Eyadema's visits to Yaounde and Abuja came at a time of high 
tension between the two countries. The tension resulted from the 
border dispute over the Bakassi Peninsular. In Yaounde, 
President Eyadema held a long discussion with President Paul 
Biya. He did the same with General Abacha in Abuja. President 
Eyadema and his delegation were pleased with contacts made with 
the authorities of the two countries. President Eyadema was 
accompanied by Mr. Barry Moussa Barque, his special adviser; 
Foreign Minister Fambare Natchaba, Defense Minister Inoussa 
Bouraima, and Former Minister Atsu Koffi Amegah.

<F P=106> [By Dirk van Zyl] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town Mar 3 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi made it clear on Thursday [3 March] 
that the proposed international mediation to resolve South 
Africa's constitutional deadlock was a new bottom-line. And he 
said that once the frame of reference of such mediation had been 
set, he would personally be willing to start campaigning for an 
election. The IFP Central Committee would decide on Friday 
whether the party should provisionally register before the 
Friday midnight deadline for the April election. 
  Addressing journalists and businessmen in Cape Town, Mr 
Buthelezi said he had "come to the end" of the current 
constitutional road. "Only this international mediation might 
open a new chapter," he said in answer to a question at a press 
conference after he had addressed the Cape Town Chamber of 
Commerce. 
  Mr Buthelezi revealed that the Freedom Alliance had, at a 
meeting in Cape Town earlier on Thursday, accepted international 
mediation in principle to resolve South Africa' constitutional 
deadlock. He told the business luncheon -- at which he had 
arrived about an hour late because of the Alliance meeting -- 
that he had "just been told" that the African National Congress 
[ANC] working committee had also decided in principle there 
should be international mediation. 
  Mr Buthelezi and ANC President Nelson Mandela agreed in a 
joint statement after meeting in Durban on Tuesday that the 
possibility of international mediation should be explored to 
resolve outstanding constitutional deadlocks. Mr Buthelezi told 
the businessmen on Thursday that the interim constitution, as it 
stood, would give rise to the politics of violent recrimination 
when it was found that "it polarises South Africa and destroys 
the prospects of producing the national unity in which there 
will emerge the national will to establish a democracy and make 
it work".

  [Excerpt] Johannesburg March 3 SAPA--The African National 
Congress [ANC] on Thursday [3 March] gave notice it had 
apparently accepted international mediation, saying a joint 
ANC/Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] task force should be established 
to address "the specifics" of this proposal. The ANC's national 
working committee said in a statement in Johannesburg it had 
received a full report of the March 1 meeting between ANC 
President Nelson Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
and that it "warmly welcomed the positive outcome of the 
meeting". 
  Committee members had discussed the idea of international 
mediation, proposed by Mr Buthelezi, as a way of resolving 
outstanding differences between the two parties, and had agreed 
to explore this route. "To pursue the matter further with the 
IFP, the ANC proposes the establishment of a joint task team to 
address the specifics and agree upon mutually acceptable terms 
of reference." 
  The committee had also decided to set in motion discussions 
with the IFP on other outstanding issues, including future 
meetings between their respective leaders. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Umtata March 3 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] leader Nelson Mandela is to meet Zulu King Zwelithini to 
discuss the issue of a separate Zulu kingdom. Speaking on 
Thursday [3 March] after a meeting with Organisation of African 
Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim in Umtata in Transkei, 
Mr Mandela said a Zulu homeland was a point raised during his 
meeting with Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi earlier this week. "I indicated to Mr Buthelezi this 
was a matter we were prepared to discuss directly with the king 
and we requested Mr Buthelezi to arrange a meeting. We are 
awaiting a response," Mr Mandela said. 
  The ANC had decided in principle to accept international 
mediation, but it had not yet discussed the structure through 
which this would take place. "But the principle has been 
formally accepted and we have conveyed this fact to Mr 
Buthelezi," he said. 
  Mr Mandela said he had briefed Mr Salim on the latest 
political developments during their hour-long meeting in the 
offices of the Transkei Military Council in Umtata. Mr Salim 
said he had been encouraged by the discussions he had had with 
Mr Mandela, Mr Buthelezi, State President F W de Klerk, the Pan 
Africanist Congress leadership and the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front]. "What has encouraged me more is the 
meeting the president of the ANC had with Mr Buthelezi. From 
all indications, it was very constructive. I believe and I'm 
hopeful that arising from the serious discussions and 
understandings arrived at there, the prospects for the country 
are certainly brightened," Mr Salim said. 
  The OAU looked forward to a peaceful election. A successful 
outcome was vital not only to the people of South Africa, but to 
the continent as a whole. The attention of the international 
community was focused on this country, he said. "We want to see 
an emergent, stable South Africa which can play a central role 
in Africa and can be an important factor of stability for our 
continent," Mr Salim said.

<F P=106> [Report by A Thomson] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 3 SAPA -- Motivation to vote in 
the April elections is high, according to the results of a 
survey for Matla Trust published on Thursday [3 March]. The 
research initiatives survey of 8,004 respondents shows 83 per 
cent of black voters and 85 per cent of white voters intend 
casting ballots. However, only 50 per cent of coloureds and 55 
per cent of Indians intend voting. The survey shows six per 
cent of blacks, eight per cent of whites, 19 per cent of 
coloureds and 23 per cent of Indians intend abstaining. 
  Motivation to vote among blacks is highest in the Eastern 
and 
Western Cape (93 and 95 per cent) and lowest in Natal and the 
Eastern Transvaal (74 per cent). Among coloureds, it is lowest 
in the Western Cape (47 per cent) and in the North-West Region 
(46 per cent). Indian voters in the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region are more motivated than those 
in Natal (62 and 54 per cent). 
  Women are less motivated than men in all regions except the 
Western Cape. The gender gap is between seven and 12 per cent, 
except in the Eastern Transvaal where 85 per cent of men and 62 
per cent of women will vote, and Natal where 80 per cent of men 
and 68 per cent of women will go to the polls. The gender gap 
is highest among Indians, at 29 per cent. 
  Principal reasons for not voting are confusion about 
political events, personal reasons (such as "too old", "against 
religion") and ignorance about elections and voting. Among 
blacks, lack of identity documents is the fifth most important 
reason for not voting. The survey also shows the secrecy of the 
ballot is either doubted or mistrusted by about 25 per cent of 
voters. Belief in ballot secrecy is highest among blacks, at 81 
per cent. The figure for whites is 77 per cent, for coloureds 
70 per cent and for Indians 74 per cent.

<F P=106> [By Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Excerpts] Cape Town March 3 SAPA -- International 
mediation and the government's attitude to it has become the key 
to a quick and inclusive constitutional settlement. This became 
clear as the Freedom Alliance closed ranks on Thursday [3 March] 
and backed the mediation initiative proposed by IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi with the African 
National Congress' [ANC] national working committee also giving 
it the green light. 
  The proposal, made at the Buthelezi/Mandela summit on 
Tuesday, now needs only the government's backing to ensure 
agreement by the majority in the multiparty negotiating process. 
[passage omitted] 
  Mr F W de Klerk and his government will now have to give its 
response to the mediation proposal, an option not popular with 
the NP [National Party] government in the past. An 
all-inclusive settlement has, however, become a clear priority 
for the two major parties and there seems little chance, 
observers say, that Mr de Klerk will resist ANC President Nelson 
Mandela in accepting it. The Angola/Namibian settlement is 
cited as a clear precedent of successful international mediation 
involving South Africa. 
  The Alliance backing came after a three-hour meeting between 
leaders at a Constantia Hotel in the Cape on Friday morning. 
Speaking on their behalf, Alliance Chairman and Bophuthatswana 
Foreign Minister Rowan Cronje said they were backing the 
intiative and were united on the issue. It was up to the ANC to 
indicate its acceptance of the offer. 
  Mr Buthelezi said the offer was made in return for a 
recommendation to his Central Committee to register 
"provisionally" to give negotiators a chance to find a 
settlement. He rejected Mr de Klerk's view, expressed in 
Parliament on Wednesday, that negotiations could continue to 
reach agreements which could be implemented after the elections. 
"We want a settlement before elections," he said. 
  The Alliance accused the government of having unilaterally 
suspended negotiations, but the new initiative has given the 
process new momentum which the government will find difficult to 
resist. 
  Mr de Klerk acknowledged the IFP offer in Parliament on 
Wednesday with careful wording which clearly left the door open. 
  Asked whether there was enough time, Mr Cronje said at the 
Thursday summit the principle first had to be accepted before 
details of the who, where and when could be negotiated. He made 
it clear the Alliance was taking its cue from the IFP Central 
Committee's decision on Friday which in turn was subject to ANC 
acceptance. 
  Mr Buthelezi's response was that if the IFP Central 
Committee 
accepted the initiative it was implicit that it considered there 
was enough time to negotiate and participate in the elections, 
although the Alliance and the IFP's position remained that the 
election date itself had to be postponed. Although there is 
virtually no chance of the latter, senior negotiators said on 
Thursday night a concession by the government and the ANC on 
international mediation was now a logical next step. 
Postponements of technical deadlines could then follow. 
  The Alliance was confident enough to appoint a committee to 
deal with the details of such a process once the IFP's Central 
Committee decided in favour of it.

  [Excerpts] There is still a good chance that members of the 
Freedom Alliance will register for the elections. They have 
accepted international mediation in principle to resolve South 
Africa's deadlock. This followed an alliance meeting in Cape 
Town today. Conrad Burke reports: 
  [Burke] [passage omitted] The names of possible mediators 
that have been suggested so far include the Italian-based Venus 
Commission, the German Constitutional Court, the Swiss-based 
International Institute for Federalism, American former Chief 
Justice Warren Burger, and the Carter Center, which has been 
involved in Ethiopia. But getting this together could take time. 
  On the other hand, if the ANC [African National Congress] 
and 
the Government signal a positive response, the Freedom 
Alliance's parties could go ahead and register before midnight 
tomorrow and tighten up on the nuts and bolts of mediation over 
several days. There is a slim possibility that the registration 
deadline could be amended, but even this won't afford them much 
time. Candidates' lists need to be submitted in six days' time.

  [Text] The leader of the National Party, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, 
says the elections cannot be postponed to allow time for 
international mediation to break the constitutional deadlock. 
Addressing a meeting in Durban last night, Mr. de Klerk said the 
government had not been consulted on this issue, and that he 
needed a concrete proposal to be tabled before it could be 
considered. However, he had serious reservations as to whether 
international mediation could address the issues at stake. Mr. 
de Klerk said he was open to negotiations to reach agreement for 
implementation after the elections. 
  Mr. de Klerk said he was disappointed with the Freedom 
Alliance's actions regarding the amendments proposed by the 
government to break the constitutional deadlock. He described 
the alliances' reaction as inadequate, as the government's 
proposals address the core of the problems. Mr. de Klerk said 
he rejected the alliance's efforts to play down the latest 
amendments.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, kwaZulu chief </F>
minister and Inkatha Freedom Party leader, in the Cape Town 
parliamentary studio by Max du Preez on the "Agenda" program -- 
live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Du Preez] Earlier I referred 
to the state president's statements earlier tonight that there 
is not enough time for foreign mediation. What is your reaction 
to that? 
  [Buthelezi] Well I don't know. Mr. de Klerk has always been 
saying there is no time for this, there is no time for that, 
there's this deadline and that deadline, and really it's 
something that depresses me immensely, Mr. du Preez, because I 
think that the main thing is to find a solution. What is the 
use of meeting deadlines, as happened in Angola, and still have 
mayhem like that in the country. I think that it's important 
for us to find solutions, rather than to gallop regardless of 
whether we find a solution or not. 
  [Du Preez] Now I suspect then what Mr. Moosa said about the 
election date being cast in stone, that you will also not be 
very happy with that statement? 
  [Buthelezi] Well I'm not happy with it because it's based -- 
in fact from the very beginning, you know Mr. du Preez, without 
rehashing, you know, arguments that have taken place at the 
multiparty talks, you know, in Kempton Park -- from the very 
beginning, the very idea of fixing a date before there was a 
constitution was wrong. But we provisionally accepted the date 
on the proviso that certain things should come first. But those 
things which should have come first did not even come first, and 
that is why our teams or delegations had to walk out of Kempton 
Park. 
  [Du Preez] I put it to the other two gentlemen earlier -- I 
think viewers and voters will imagine now that this is the next 
deadlock: that the Freedom Alliance parties will come in and say 
we have not had enough time -- the ANC [African National 
Congress] and government saying it's virtually cast in stone. 
Do you have sympathy with the position that there could be 
violence -- it would be a massive disappointment to a large 
majority of the people -- if we had to move the date from the 
27th of April? 
  [Buthelezi] Well I think that is propaganda that is being 
built by both the government, Mr. de Klerk, and also by the 
leaders of the ANC that, you know, people are itching to have 
the 27th, they are itching for that regardless of the result, 
regardless of whether there is an all inclusive solution. I 
mean that is their attitude all along, and it's propaganda, of 
course, which has become a hype, sort of deliberately created, 
you know, in their public relations work. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ulundi March 4 SAPA -- Inkatha Central Committee 
members gathered in the kwaZulu capital of Ulundi on Friday [4 
March] morning to decide on the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
provisional registration for the April elections. Sources said 
the meeting was expected to endorse IFP President Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi's proposal for provisional registration, pending 
international mediation on the constitutional deadlock. 
  Friday's meeting also follows the ANC's acceptance of 
mediation, opening the way for Inkatha's registration before the 
Friday midnight deadline. 
  Central Committee members were tight-lipped on their arrival 
for the 10AM Ulundi meeting. IFP sources said on Thursday 
however that details of mediation and the time period remaining 
for electioneering would also come under the spotlight at the 
meeting. 
  Inkatha officials said it could last several hours.

  [Text] An opinion poll conducted for the SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] has found that the majority of 
blacks in Natal-KwaZulu want King Goodwill Zwelithini to be the 
head of the province. The poll released today found that even 
supporters of the king believed he was wrong to be so 
politically involved with the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. 
  Asked to rate leaders on a scale of 1-10, the king came 
first 
with an average of 6.64. The second most popular leader is Mr. 
Nelson Mandela with 5.8, followed closely by Chief Buthelezi 
with 5.37, and State President F.W. de Klerk with 5.04. The 
ANC's [African National Congress] candidate for premier in 
Natal, Mr. Jacob Zuma, received a negative rating from nearly 
half the sample.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Durao Barroso and Nelson 
Mandela have met in South Africa. Both came out in favor of 
peace and of a peaceful channeling of the South African 
electoral process. 
  [Correspondent Antonio Mateus] An election boycott poses a 
potential conflict situation in South Africa. After meeting the 
South African president, the ANC [African National Congress] 
president, and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] president, 
Barroso still has reservations regarding the future of this 
country. The consensus between the government and the ANC raises 
hopes of a peaceful transition but this is not enough. Six 
weeks away from the elections the objective is to extend 
participation in the process. Barroso's message was echoed by 
some of those involved, anxious to prevent the worst. Barroso 
found today in Mandela an attentive listener to the Portuguese 
experience of transition in Africa. 
  [Mandela, in English with superimposed Portuguese 
translation] They have had a lot of experience regarding 
the problems that South Africa will have to face, because the 
former colonies, Angola and Mozambique, had difficult 
experiences that we do not want to see repeated in this country. 
I have found the exchange of opinion with him [Barroso] very 
useful in that regard. 
  [Mateus, interviewing Barroso on the street] After the 
brief contacts, are you more optimistic regarding the future of 
this country, or is it too early to say? 
  [Barroso] I still have many reservations because I think 
that 
until we can ensure that everyone will participate there will be 
the potential for destabilization. Essentially, I think there 
is a great consensus in South Africa -- for which it would be 
enough that the ANC and the National Party saw eye to eye -- but 
it is important for that agreement to be as widespread as 
possible in order to reduce to a minimum the potential for 
destabilization of some forces. [passage omitted]

RDP that if things take a turn for the worse in South Africa 
steps will be taken to make it possible for Portuguese nationals 
to leave the country. He was speaking in Johannesburg to our 
correspondent Carlos Pacheco. 
  [Pacheco] The Portuguese Government has plans for the 
repatriation of Portuguese nationals should things worsen in 
South Africa. Minister Durao Barroso gave no details, but 
confirmed that planning is in progress to enable us to respond 
to a worst-case scenario. However Durao Barroso is confident of 
a positive evolution in South Africa and does not believe that 
repatriation will be necessary. The foreign minister also 
denied rumors that Portuguese nationals are returning home in 
massive numbers, stating that the figures supplied by the 
Portuguese Embassy show nothing out of the ordinary. 
  [Begin Barroso recording] If in the past, in extreme 
conditions, we were able to receive our compatriots [post-1974 
return from the African colonies], now we would certainly be 
able to receive them much better. But this is not our goal, nor 
is it, I believe, the goal of most of the Portuguese who have 
settled here. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Themba Molefe] </F>
  [Text] The African National Congress [ANC] has increased 
security around its leadership after being informed of a 
rightwing plot to assassinate Mr Cyril Ramaphosa. 
  The ANC has confirmed that Afrikaner Volksfront [National 
Front -- AVF] co-leader General Constand Viljoen "volunteered" 
information linking the plot with covert military operations. 
The ANC has, however, not divulged the full details of 
Viljoen's information and referred inquiries to him. 
  SOWETAN has learned that Viljoen approached the ANC with the 
information because he wanted to draw suspicion away from his 
people who, he said, were not part of the conspiracy. Viljoen 
was this week travelling around the country on AVF and Freedom 
Alliance business and could not be contacted for comment. ANC 
chief media officer Mr Carl Niehaus said the organisation had 
stepped up security, especially around Secretary-General 
Ramaphosa, in the light of the threat. ANC leaders have been 
targets of rightwing forces for some time, and several leaders 
have been killed in suspected plots. The most prominent was Mr 
Chris Hani, while SACP [South African Commun?st Party] chairman 
Mr Joe Slovo has also been a target.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 4 SAPA -- Police would seek an 
immediate interview with Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- 
AVF] co-leader General Constand Viljoen in connection with a 
reported plot to assassinate African National Congress [ANC] 
Secretery General Cyril Ramaphosa, police said on Friday [4 
March]. 
  Law and Order Ministry Spokesman Craig Kotze was reacting to 
a report in Friday's SOWETAN newspaper which said Mr Ramaphosa's 
security had been stepped up after Gen Viljoen had "volunteered" 
information to the ANC linking the alleged plot with covert 
military operations. 
  The SOWETAN said it had learned Gen Viljoen had approached 
the ANC with the information "because he wanted to draw 
suspicion away from his people who, he said, were not part of 
the conspiracy". 
  Mr Kotze told SAPA police would take immediate steps "to get 
to the bottom of this matter and in this regard will seek an 
immediate interview with Gen Constand Viljoen. This matter is 
seen in an extremely serious light as South Africa cannot afford 
a repetition of the Chris Hani affair." 
  Gen Viljoen could not immediately be traced for comment.

  [Excerpts] The Council of Ministers yesterday held an 
extraordinary meeting chaired by Prime Minister Anatole 
Kanyenkiko. [passage omitted] The first point on the agenda of 
the Council of Ministers was a briefing on the state of security 
in the country. It was introduced by the minister of state 
charged with interior and public security and expanded by the 
minister of national defense. The briefing noted that security 
was slowly returning to normal inside the country, while in 
Bujumbura, especially in Kamenge, this morning the situation 
worsened. It should be noted that arms are being kept almost 
everywhere in the country, particularly in the capital. The 
council therefore recommends an in-depth study of ways to 
install appropriate mechanisms to disarm the public. Members of 
the government also deeply deplored the balkanization trends 
currently affecting Bujumbura. 
  In the face of the generalized insecurity in Burundi, the 
Council of Ministers found it necessary to put in place 
operational structures charged with following up and solving on 
a daily basis questions related to security. The people will be 
regularly informed about the steps taken to that effect. The 
council recommended the strengthening of the National Security 
Council. The media were called upon to support the government's 
action towards restoring security, especially in the mayorship. 
The members of the government believe that the solution to the 
crisis will necessarily pass through a judicial process devoid 
of complacency and with the cooperation of the various bodies of 
the police and the people. 
  Last, in order to emphasize its determination to bring about 
a rapid return to security and peace in the country, the council 
decided that until further notice it would meet at least once a 
week to study the security problem as a priority. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Cameroon appears keen to play 
down the situation. We spoke to Augustin Kontchous, spokesman 
for the Cameroon Government and communications minister: 
  [Begin Kontchous recording] We on the Cameroonian side do 
not 
want to see the crisis escalate, but we do not control all the 
factors. We cannot do anything about the Nigerian position. The 
Nigerians came and occupied a part of Cameroonian territory. The 
Cameroonian Armed Forces are on the ground to prevent the 
Nigerians from going any further. We cannot see in what way the 
French could complicate the situation. For a start, the French 
are not present in the theater of operations, they are far from 
the theater of operations. It is in case the Nigerians were to 
make the situation worse that perhaps the French would [word 
indistinct], not perhaps, certainly. France would implement the 
defense accords that exist between Cameroon and France. 
  None of this is very good in the current world context. Like 
yesterday, we do not see what would be the use of bellicose 
spirits, of war. Perhaps this bellicose mobilization has aims 
other than war itself. We do not know. [end recording]

  [Text] Yaounde, 5 Mar (AFP) -- Cameroon is ready "for any 
eventuality," in its border conflict with Nigeria, even though 
"Yaounde's option remains the search for a peaceful solution," 
Cameroonian Communications Minister Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni 
stated today. 
  Stating the stand of the Cameroonian Government on the 
Bakassi Peninsula for the first time in public, Mr. Kouomegni 
asserted that "we are within our rights and our option is still 
finding a peaceful solution to the problem." 
  "This solution can only be found through the strict respect 
for each country's territorial integrity -- that of Cameroon and 
of Nigeria. It is for this reason that Cameroon has informed 
international institutions and does not rule out any initiative, 
be it bilateral or multilateral," added Mr. Kouomegni who was 
speaking at a news conference. 
  "However, if war is imposed on us, we must go to war and we 
will count on the bravery of our soldiers who have so far given 
an excellent demonstration of their bravery and we will count on 
our allies, including France, whose readiness to help us has 
remained intact," the minister continued, adding: "We recognize, 
and this is very clear, that this option would be harmful for 
our two states. We do not wish for it."

  [Text] Yaounde, 5 Mar (CAMNEWS/PANA) -- Invoking a military 
defense pact, Cameroon said Saturday [5 March] that the French 
military presence in the west African country was aimed at 
assessing "the situation" on island in the Bakassi Peninsula 
claimed by Cameroon and Nigeria. 
  Cameroon State Minister for Communications Kontchou Augustin 
Kouomegni said Saturday at a press conference in Yaounde, the 
capital, that heightened French military and diplomatic activity 
was aimed at averting the possibility of a war between the two 
African neighbors. Kontchou said Cameroon can only go to war if 
it was imposed on her. "We are fully committed to solve all our 
problems peacefully and we call on Nigeria to do the same," he 
said. 
  Dismissing Nigeria's claim to the oil rich peninsula, 
Kontchou said Cameroon had allowed Nigerian settlers on the 
islands to continue living there out of good neighborliness,"but 
this does not mean that the land belongs to Nigeria." In a 
letter to the United Nations Security Council dated 28 February 
requesting a debate on the matter, Cameroon alleged that Nigeria 
violated its territorial integrity by attacking its troops 
stationed in the peninsula on 18 February. Cameroon said also 
that Nigeria annexed two villages in the disputed area on 31 
December 1993. 
  Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema met Camerooonian 
President Paul Biya and Nigerian leader Sani Abacha on Thursday 
in efforts to resolve the dispute. 
  Cameroon bases its claim to the peninsula on a 1913 
agreement 
between Britain and Germany. It said former Cameroonian 
President Ahmadou Ahidjo and Nigerian leader Yakubu Gowon signed 
an accord which reinforced Cameroon's ownership. 
  Nigeria said the Gowon-Ahidjo Agreement was not binding 
because it was not ratified by the Supreme Military Council, the 
then ruling body in Nigeria.

  [Text] The Chadian Government and the National Awakening 
Committee for Peace and Democracy [CNSPD] are still not on the 
same wavelength. Chadian Interior Minister Abderamane Izzo 
yesterday accused the CSNPD leader, Moise Kette, of being 
responsible for the failure of recent talks in Bangui. Moise 
Kette, in return, blames the failure of the Bangui talks on the 
government in an interview with Raphael Mbadinga. 
  [Begin recording] [Kette] Ndjamena blames us for the failure 
of the roundtable negotiations. We categorically reject this, 
as we think that it is Ndjamena which is to blame for the 
failure. We raised the real problem which has been tearing Chad 
apart for over 30 years: the form of the state. Each time we 
raise this problem, the government delegation retreats behind 
the idea of sovereignty so that it will not have to discuss the 
issue, although it well knows that this is the problem which has 
been undermining the country for 34 years. 
  [Mbadinga] Will the negotiations resume shortly? 
  [Kette] I think the mediating parties are maintaining 
contacts with the two parties and each party has gone back to 
its base to receive fresh instructions before coming back to the 
negotiating table. As far as we are concerned, for the Chadian 
problem to be definitely resolved we would prefer that all other 
political- military forces -- political parties and civil 
associations -- take part in the second meeting so that we bury 
the hatchet once and for all. [end recording]

  [Text] Libyan and Chadian delegations met this morning at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Their discussions centered on 
the application of the verdict of the International Court of 
Justice at The Hague, which was handed down a month ago. For 
Chad, the meeting is to examine with the Libyan delegation how 
the Chadian administration could take back the Aouzou Strip or 
fix the date for the withdrawal of Libyan forces from the 
Chadian territory. The nine-member Libyan delegation, led by 
'Umar Mustafa al-Muntasir, secretary of the General People's 
Committee for External Liaison and International Cooperation, 
arrived this morning in Ndjamena at the invitation of the 
Chadian Government. After welcoming the Libyan delegation, 
Foreign Minister Fakadi Lokna stated that this meeting is in 
line with contacts between the leaders of the two countries 
following the pronouncement of the verdict by the International 
Court of Justice. Let us listen to him. 
  [Begin Lokna recording] Our meeting today must enable us to 
examine the modalities for the execution of the verdict 
pronounced on 3 February by the International Court of Justice. 
I would like to assure you that my delegation has come here 
with the strong determination and an open mind to discuss with 
you the timetable for this withdrawal which will usher in a new 
era in the relations between our two countries. I am convinced 
that a rapid implementation of the verdict of the International 
Court of Justice will enable us to strengthen the basis for the 
fruitful cooperation that we are all yearning for. [end 
recording] 
  'Umar Mustafa al-Muntasir, leader of the Libyan delegation, 
noted that the verdict of the International Court of Justice is 
a permanent solution for the problem. 
  [Begin al-Muntasir recording, in Arabic fading into French 
translation] We think that the verdict of the International 
Court of Justice provided a permanent solution for the problem 
which existed between us. We must therefore agree to implement 
the (?agreements) between our two countries, including the 
decision of the International Court of Justice. We are 
therefore prepared to implement those agreements and accords as 
best as we can. I assert that we will endeavor to seriously 
implement all the decisions on which we have agreed and work 
seriously to build strong relations for the future well-being of 
our two countries. [end recording]

  [Text] In Zaire, President Mobutu's party, the Popular 
Movement of the Revolution [MPR], has reacted to an opposition 
leader's harsh statement. Convention of Nationalist Reformers 
Chairman Jacques Matanda announced two days ago that the radical 
Zairian opposition would launch an armed struggle to paralyze 
the country and force President Mobutu to quit. Jacques Matanda 
also said, quote: Mobutu can be overthrown, the main thing is to 
start it. As one might imagine, the MPR, the former sole party, 
has reacted to the statement. The party's European 
representative, Jean-Paul Huamba, has expressed his displeasure 
at Mr. Matanda's statement. He spoke to Mohamed Youssouffou 
Saliou. 
  [Begin Huamba recording] Any idea of democracy that includes 
violence and any kind of undemocratic behavior must be rejected. 
Mr. Matanda has no right to incite people to violence, as 
Zairians are currently seeking a political solution to their 
problem through the High Council of the Republic-Transitional 
Parliament [HCR-TP]. The MPR, therefore, finds Mr. Matanda's 
statement in Luanda offensive. We have only just signed the 
Palais de Marbre agreement, which welcomed negotiators and 
former parliamentarians into the HCR- TP. He could have waited 
until the constitutional document governing the transitional 
period has been formulated, as this will clarify the political 
situation. [end recording]

the Katanga Parliamentary Group; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Katanga parliamentary group of the High Council 
of the Republic [HCR] was surprised by the publication of your 
article "Katanga Withdraws From the Premiership Race." We found 
it surprising because there is no indication whether the author 
of the article is Katangese. Moreover, the author's anonymity 
is not even disturbed when he speaks on behalf of all members of 
the HCR. This is why we insist on making the following 
clarification: 
  Members of the HCR from Katanga Province of all shades of 
opinion have formed the Katanga Parliamentary Group governed by 
a bureau, which is the sole organ authorized to speak for them. 
No decision of the kind mentioned in the article has been made 
by its plenary session. A decision to engage in or withdraw 
from the premiership race is the responsibility of the plenary 
session of their parliamentary group, which acts freely and 
independently in matters under its jurisdiction. We therefore 
categorically deny this information, which is likely to harm 
Katanga's interests. We call on you to publish our rejoinder in 
the same place the original article was published for the sake 
of justice. 
  [Signed] For the Bureau of the Katanga Parliamentary Group: 
Copresidents Mulongo Mukalai, HCR member, and Mpondo Wabanga,

  [Excerpt] The fourth session of the Eritrean National 
Assembly was held in Asmara from 2 to 4 March 1994 and adopted 
the following resolutions: 
  1. Formation of the Eritrean Government: Recalling the 
decision made by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front [EPLF] 
Central Committee in its seventh session; transitional decree 
No. 37/1993 proclaiming the establishment of the Government of 
Eritrea and the National Assembly; and the resolutions of the 
Third Congress of the EPLF that the Eritrean National Assembly 
comprise 75 members of the Central Council of the People's Front 
for Democracy and Justice, and by an equal number of popularly 
elected members, the National Assembly has resolved that the 
former executive body comprising ministers and provincial 
administrators be replaced by competent cabinet ministers, 
hence: a) basing itself on the above resolution, the National 
Assembly has decided to amend decree No. 37/1993 on the 
formation, duties, and competencies of the Eritrean Government 
and to adopt decree No. 52/1994; b) that the institutions 
formerly operating independently at authority level, such as 
those for road, sea and air transport, be reconstituted to 
ministerial level and named the Ministry of Transport; also 
noting the importance of tourism to our country's economy, the 
National Assembly resolved to establish a Ministry of Tourism by 
excising the sector from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. 
The National Assembly accordingly resolved that a 16-man 
cabinet be formed to be chaired by the president and that it 
should hold monthly meetings. 
  2. Formation of a Constitution Commission: Conscious of the 
need to start drafting a transitional constitution with full 
popular participation, of studying the preparations made in the 
past, and having discussed recommendations made by experts on 
the formation and responsibilities of a constitutional 
commission, the National Assembly: a) adopted the decree on the 
formation of a constitutional commission and b) elected 42 
members of the Constitutional Commission including seven members 
of the Executive Council and also the chairman, deputy chairman, 
and the secretary of the commission, with the chairman of the 
National Assembly being empowered to fill any vacancy arising in

  [Text] The commissioner of police, Shedrach Kiruki, refuted 
reports in yesterday's DAILY NATION, which alleged that the 
general service unit and the regular police fired in the air and 
sealed off the biggest polling station in Lumakanda for 30 
minutes. A statement to Kenya Broadcasting Corporation from 
police headquarters clarified that there was no explosion in the 
township as alleged by some FORD [Forum for the Restoration of 
Democracy]-Kenya officials. Police investigations further 
confirmed to members of the public, FORD-Kenya officials and the 
press that a government vehicle was backfiring and misfiring. 
The commissioner of police described the report as malicious 
and meant to tarnish the good name of the police force.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi, today 
said that the government was going to make a formal protest 
against some friendly countries to Kenya for their persistent 
interference in the country's internal affairs. The president 
noted that, as a sovereign state, Kenya deserves respect from 
these nations the way it respected them. Saying that these 
countries were partisan, the president wondered why their 
embassies had not disassociated themselves from the subversive 
elements operating in the country in the name of democracy. The 
president gave examples of the tribal clashes started by the 
opposition and their assertion of terrorism as areas where these 
countries never came up to condemn. President Moi noted that he 
had implemented a lot of conditions by the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, IMF, and wondered why these 
countries have not appreciated all these efforts. President Moi 
was speaking at Eldoret showground when he officially opened 
this year's Uasin Gishu Agricultural Show. 
  At the same time, President Moi once again criticized a 
section of the local press for their lack of patriotism and 
thriving on lies and sensationalism. He disclosed that it was 
now clear that these newspapers have a hidden agenda, and told 
Kenyans to be on the lookout. 
  The president observed that the KANU [Kenya African National 
Union] government has for a long time been the target of 
intimidation and said should the country be pushed to civil war, 
then Kenyans should know who pushed them that far. He 
challenged those subversive elements in the country to come out 
and state whether they do not want a united nation instead of 
hiding behind the song of democracy. 
  Saying that violence breeds violence, President Moi told 
those friendly countries to Kenya to take time off to understand 
the way Kenyans live, instead of rushing to call for changes in 
the country. President Moi reiterated that although he has been 
tolerant for quite some time now, tolerance has a limit. 
[passage omitted] 
  Once again, President Moi told civil servants, including the 
police, that the government will not enter into any negotiations 
over their loyalty to the government of the day. He told the 
commissioner of police to make it clear to the police that they 
had an obligation to serve the government in power loyally or 
risk dismissal. He gave an example of the armed forces who, 
despite being officers and soldiers drawn from all over the 
country, lived harmoniously as a family. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mombasa District Kenya African National Union 
chairman Shariff Nassir today accused the British Government of 
assisting youths of the unregistered Islamic Party of Kenya 
[IPK] to flee to Britain, where they declare themselves as 
refugees. Nassir claimed that two-thirds of the IPK youth had 
left the country for Britain as self-made refugees. 
  Addressing a news conference in Mombasa today, Nassir, an 
assistant minister for information and broadcasting, noted that 
yesterday's stone-throwing incident in Mombasa was the work of 
remnants of IPK youth who wanted to create a crisis, which they 
would use as an excuse to flee the country. Nassir asked the 
government to investigate cases in which businessmen in the old 
town of Mombasa were assisting Muslim youths to flee to Britain. 
  When contacted, the British High Commission declined to 
comment.

responding to requests by Malawi Congress Party (MCP) on how 
best to win the elections. 
  Mr. Kiti, who was receiving nine defectors from opposition 
parties at KANU headquarters today, said that it was due to the 
cordial relationship between KANU and MCP over the years that 
KANU had agreed to respond to the Malawi Congress Party's 
request. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The national chairman of the Uganda People's 
Congress, UPC, Haji Badru Wegulo, has been arrested by the 
police on charges of publishing seditious materials against the 
government and the president of Uganda. In the booklet entitled 
"The 1994 Constituent Assembly Elections," the UPC position is 
claimed to portray the National Resistance Movement, NRM, of 
President Yoweri Museveni as a foreign occupation government and 
dominated by foreigners. 
  Wagulo, who was arrested this morning by police officers at 
the UPC headquarters in Kampala, was due to appear in court this 
afternoon, but Chief Magistrate Jorokamu Bamwine, who was to 
hear the case, refused to hear it because Wegulo was brought in 
after office hours. 
  The charge sheet says Wegulo and others still at large in 
February in Kampala did utter, print, publish for sale and 
caused the booklet to be distributed.

  [Text] There has been another arms theft at the Ouidah 
Military Camp. A large quantity of arms and ammunition 
disappeared last night. The armory guard is said to have left 
his guard post to have something to eat between 2100 and 2130. 
When he returned he found the armory door ajar. Seven rocket 
launchers, [name indistinct] automatic pistols, assault rifles, 
magazines, and 300 cartridges had already disappeared. The camp 
officials were alerted and an initial search led to the 
discovery of some cartridges but most of the arms and ammunition 
are still missing. 
  This theft, which is not the first at the Ouidah Camp, is 
happening at a time when security problems have increased and 
tension has risen slightly after the CFA franc devaluation.

<F P=106> [By Iddi Ali] </F>
  [Text] Accra, Mar 4 (AFP) -- Gunmen seriously wounded 10 
passengers when they opened fire on a bus in northeastern Ghana, 
which has recently seen a major flare-up of tribal strife, press 
reports said Friday [4 March]. 
  The bus was attacked just after leaving the town of Salaga, 
330 kilometres (205 miles) north of Accra, for Tamale, 90 
kilometres (about 55 miles) further north, one passenger told 
the DAILY GRAPHIC. 
  The driver forced his passage through the ambush and pressed 
on to Tamale, the paper said. 
  On Tuesday, Ghanaian military police killed 14 people and 
wounded 15 others when they intervened after tribal clashes at 
Tamale, according to a new official toll released Friday. 
  The soldiers opened fire after an angry crowd composed 
mainly 
of Dagombas, who had clashed with members of the Konkomba tribe, 
ignored warning shots and was set to attack the troops, an 
Information Ministry statement said. 
  The government, which Thursday sent a team headed by Defence 
Minister Mahama Iddrisu to the region, has expressed its 
"deepest regrets for the incidents" and conveyed its "profound 
condolences" to the families of those who died. 
  Initial investigations indicated that the Dagombas launched 
their attack at Tamale, after the Konkombas had collected their 
pay from a bank, the statement added. 
  Early last month, tribal strife claimed at least 1,000 lives 
in northeastern Ghana. The army brought about a fragile truce 
in mid- February after a state of emergency was declared in the 
region. 
  That fighting between Konkombas on the one hand and 
Nanumbas, 
Dagombas and Gonjas on the other was started by a brawl in a 
market-place at Yendi, 440 kilometres (270 miles), north of here. 
  The two communities, separated by their tribal backgrounds, 
social status and religious practices, have been fiercely 
antagonistic for more than 20 years. 
  In 1981, a dispute over a game of cards eventually led to 
1,500 deaths. 
  Ghanaian press reports said that troops sent to the 
northeast 
with orders to disarm the rival tribes did not dare to venture 
into the bush, which hampered their operations considerably.

  [Text] Twenty-one shotguns, 73 packets of ammunition, and 
18 ammunition belts have been seized by the police in a raid at 
the Konkomba yam market in Accra. Also seized were two shotguns 
wrapped in a map and concealed under the driver's seat of a 
vehicle. During the operation, a total of 30 suspects were 
rounded up, most of whom are Konkombas. 
  Briefing newsmen after the operation, the greater Accra 
regional police commander, Mr. Joseph Mprah, said the shotguns 
were hidden in the roofs of yam stalls, which also serve as 
residence for the traders at the market. He stated that the 
exercise is the result of information reaching his office that 
the Konkomba market is used as a source of arms supply to the 
north. Mr. Mprah said the inspector general of police, Mr. 
Kwofie, therefore ordered the operation as a way of eliminating 
the source of arms supply and ensuring that all arms are 
retrieved from the warring parties in the conflict. 
  He appealed to arms and ammunition dealers in the country to 
complement the government's efforts for peace by being 
circumspect in their business transactions. He asked them to 
place the national interest above their personal interests and 
refuse the sale of arms to anyone bearing a suspicious permit or 
one with a name belonging to the conflict zone. The exercise 
was later extended to the timber market, where 32 persons were 
arrested for dealing in Indian hemp.

<F P=106> [From "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] In Liberia, the seating of the transitional 
government on Monday [7 March] continues to look increasingly 
doubtful due to the rivalry within Alhaji Koromah's ULIMO 
[United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction. 
Signs of a split in the movement first began to emerge with the 
sacking of Dr. al- Mohamed Sheriff as ULIMO's representative in 
the transitional council. This was followed by a claim by 
Alhaji Koromah that the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia] of Charles Taylor were attacking ULIMO in Lofa and Bong 
counties but this claim was promptly denied by ULIMO's very own 
military head, Roosevelt Johnson. And now more evidence of a 
widening gap between the two men and their supporters have come 
to light. From Monrovia, Nienate Allison telexed this report. 
  The rift in Alhaji Koromah's ULIMO is deepening. There was a 
shoot-out last night between Koromah loyalists and forces in 
favor of Roosevelt Johnson. The shooting, lasting for several 
hours, occured near the Po River bridge just outside Monrovia 
and sources said the situation remains confused today. 
  Travelers who arrived here today from ULIMO headquarters in 
Tubmanburg said tension started building up when ULIMO leader, 
Alhaji Koromah, ordered the disarmament of elements of the Krahn 
ethnic group -- the second largest fighting force in ULIMO. 
They said Koromah loyalists had disarmed all Krahn elements in 
areas covering Kre and southwards toward the Po River bridge 
where they met some resistance and decided to return to 
Tubmanburg. However, they returned later in the day with 
reinforcement and succeeded in disarming Roosevelt Johnson 
loyalists. Thereafter, Roosevelt Johnson ordered troops from 
his base in Kakata, 35 miles north of Monrovia, into the Po 
River area to tighten security. Sources said that shooting 
broke out finally between the two sides and lasted into the 
early morning hours. On Thursday, the cracks in ULIMO were 
highlighted. In an interview on Focus on Africa, Koromah 
alleged that forces of Charles Taylor's NPFL were attacking 
ULIMO forces in Salayie. Roosevelt Johnson, chairman of ULIMO's 
military wing, denied Koromah's claim and yesterday accused him 
of attempting to derail the peace process. 
  Meanwhile in another development, ULIMO today named (Dex 
Tayowo) as its representative on the five-man transitional state 
council. Tayowo, a Krahn, was an immigrant captain and until 
his appointment served as ULIMO press coordinator. He replaces 
Thomas Ziah, also a Krahn, who was sacked from the council on 
Thursday.

  [Text] Monrovia, March 6 (AFP) - The West African force 
that is to begin disarming Liberia's various factions Monday [7 
March] will use force if necessary to accomplish its mission, 
John Inienger, the commander of the ECOMOG [Economic Community 
of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force said 
Sunday. 
  Inienger said in an interview aired on national radio that 
the UN-supervised force would be "evenhanded" and "neutral" but 
warned that "any party acting alone or in contract to frustrate 
disarmament will be forced to disarm." He said he was aware the 
disarmament process would be lengthy and fraught with obstacles 
but that his force is "resolved and committed to bring about 
total peace to Liberia." 
  But so far the Nigerian-led ECOMOG force which began 
deploying here last Tuesday has made little headway as it 
attempts to fan out across the country. Local observers fear 
that an internal power dispute among leaders of one of the 
country's two main factions, the United Liberation Movement 
(ULIMO) could scuttle the peace process. 
  On Sunday ULIMO's military command, headed by General 
Roosevelt Johnson, issued a communique announcing that the 
president of the movement, Alhaji Koromah, had been dismissed. 
Johnson is from the Krahn ethnic group and Koromah from the 
Mandingo group. 
  Johnson in his communique accused Koromah of engaging in 
"inconsistent activities which the movement considered obstacles 
in the peace process" and rejected his decision earlier this 
week to dismiss Thomas Ziah, an ULIMO representative appointed 
to the country's State Council, an interim collegial presidency 
which is to rule the country between March 7 and September 7. 
  Koromah's stand against Ziah was apparently prompted by the 
latter's refusal to support ULIMO representative Mohamed Sheriff 
to the presidency of the transitional government on February 28. 
  As a result, David Kpormakor, an interim government 
representative, was elected president of the State Council, a 
decision immediately contested by the ULIMO representatives. 
  Meanwhile Koromah on Friday ordered his followers to disarm 
members of the Krahn ethnic group, a decision that resulted in a 
shootout that left four Krahn members injured.

  [Text] Nigeria has formally responded to allegations made 
against her by Cameroon on the dispute over the Bakassi 
Peninsula. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, 
the minister of external affairs, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, 
refuted Cameroon's claims that Nigeria violated its territorial 
integrity and annexed its land. Nigeria expressed surprise at 
the steps taken by Cameroon to internationalize the issue before 
the commencement of summit talks by the two countries to resolve 
the issue. Such steps, Nigeria said, included the invitation of 
French troops to the area, initiating a process with the 
International Court of Justice at The Hague, and bringing the 
matter to the attention of the OAU chairman. 
  Giving the background to the dispute, the letter explained 
that on the 31st of last December, Nigerian troops were 
dispatched to the Nigerian Bakassi Peninsula to avert a violent 
clash between communities in Akwa Ibom and the Cross River 
States who were laying claim to the Bakassi settlements, but 
following the concern expressed by Cameroon on the Nigerian 
troops' movement, the minister of external affairs visited 
Yaounde to explain the troops' movement to President Paul Biya. 
The Cameroonian foreign minister also visited Abuja with a 
message from President Biya, and both sides agreed to resolve 
the issue peacefully. The Nigerian note said that surprisingly, 
while peaceful dialogue was proceeding, Cameroonian soldiers 
from their position launched an attack on the Nigerian troops 
first on 14 February and again on the 18th and 19th of the same 
month. The Nigerian troops felt obliged to defend themselves, 
but they were ordered to cease fire as soon as the attack on 
them stopped. 
  The letter expressed the hope that the Security Council 
would 
encourage the initiative for a bilateral resolution of the 
dispute. Nigeria called on all third parties to refrain from 
acts which could internationalize or aggravate the situation.

  [Text] The Federal Government says it is unwilling to 
mobilize troops in the Bakassi Peninsula, now a subject of 
dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon, to (?defuse) tension in 
the area. Nigeria has, however, opted to establish her presence 
in a portion of the disputed region, which is the bone of 
contention between two Nigerian communities. The director of 
information at the defense headquarters, Brigadier General Fred 
Chijuka, clarified the Federal Government's position today on a 
Radio Nigeria program, "Behind the Headlines." Brig. Gen. 
Chijuka explained that the government was keeping a close watch 
on developments in the area, while making all contingency 
arrangements.

  [Text] Calabar (Nigeria), 6 Mar (PANA)--Nigeria's chief of 
Army Staff, Major General Mohamed Chris Alli, at the weekend 
paid a two-day visit to troops at the Bakassi Peninsula which is 
disputed by Nigeria and Cameroon. Military sources in Calabar, 
the capital of Nigeria's Cross River State on Sunday [6 March], 
said the "routine" visit was to Army units in the state, 
including the disputed oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula. Informed 
sources said the Army chief was in the area to reassure the 
troops about Nigeria's diplomatic efforts to resolve the dipsute 
peacefully. 
  According to reports in Calabar on Sunday, the situation in 
the disputed territory was calm after reported skirmishes on 18 
and 19 February. Nigeria has denied a Cameroonian report that 
there was a clash in the area saying that its own troops were 
fired on by Camerooninan gendarmes, but did not return fire. 
  Cameroon has taken the case to the United Nations and 
informed the International Court of Justice at The Hague and the 
Organisation of African Unity (OAU). 
  Nigeria has also intensified diplomatic efforts after it 
accused France of introducing "an elemement of war" by sending 
its paratroopers, a frigate and arms to Cameroon under their 
defence pact. France last week sent a diplomatic mission to 
Cameroon and Nigeria, while Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema 
also met the leaders of the two countries in another diplomatic 
move to avert hostilities.

Nigeria to be used as a testing ground by the superpowers over 
the boundary issue with Cameroon. The (Monkrala Katsina) 
[traditional ruler's title], Alhaji Tukuri Idriss, gave the

Tukuri Idriss, who is also the district judge of Bakuri in 
Bakuri local government of Katsina State, stressed the need for 
Nigeria and Cameroon to resolve the Bakassi Peninsula issue 
amicalbly without foreign interference. He noted that the issue 
had been existing since the 1914 amalgamation and that the 
matter should be taken seriously to avoid war between the two 
nations. The (Monkrala Katsina) expressed the fear that should 
war break out, France would, along with other Western nations, 
fight Nigeria.

  [Excerpt] Lagos, March 6 (AFP) -- Nigeria is wary about 
joint military manoeuvres planned for Monday [7 March] between 
France and Benin, which come amid conflict with another 
French-backed neighbour, the daily GUARDIAN said Sunday. 
  France recently sent troops to its former colony Cameroon, 
which is at odds with Nigeria over their border in the oil-rich 
Bakassi Peninsula. Last week it also sent a warship to the 
Cameroonian port of Douala. 
  "There is no way you can say you want to ease tension with 
all this show of might," the GUARDIAN quoted a Nigerian official 
as saying, renewing Friday's accusations that Paris was 
escalating the dispute with Cameroon. The manoeuvres and an 
"increasing French military presence" were seen as "part of 
gun-boat diplomacy by Paris to intimidate Nigeria," the paper 
wrote. 
  But French diplomats in Lagos said the French-Benin 
manoeuvres starting Monday had been planned for a year, "long 
before conflict broke out on the other border, and all countries 
in the region had been given notice." "The defence attache of 
the Nigerian embassy in Benin, and two Nigerian military 
observers, are taking part in the manoeuvres," the diplomats 
said. 
  Officials in Paris said the arrival of the ship, due to be 
replaced by a smaller vessel from the French Navy on Monday, was 
part of "routine" movements which had nothing to do with the 
Cameroonian border conflict. 
  In an effort to dispel Nigerian suspicions, Paris has also 
insisted that only about 15 "technical military assistants" were 
sent to Cameroon at its own request, and that France wanted to 
see a peaceful resolution of the conflict. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Lagos, 7 March (AFP) -- Nigerian military 
authorities announced Monday [7 March] that they will send 
observers to joint military manoeuvres involving Beninese and 
French troops expected to begin the same day in neighbouring 
Benin. France "requested us to send observers and the Nigerian 
Armed Forces decided to send them at the weekend", defence 
spokesman General Fred Chijuka told AFP. 
  The military authorities expect a report from the Nigerian 
observer team sent to witness to military manoeuvres, he added. 
Nigeria, he said, must have been requested to send observers to 
clear any lingering doubts about the aim of the military 
exercise, especially since France has been accused by Abuja of 
allying with Yaounde over a current border dispute between 
Nigeria and Cameroon. 
  The tension between the two countries generated as a result 
of a dispute over the ownership of Bakassi peninsula has abated 
and Nigerian military authorities believe that the military 
manoeuvres might have been planned before now, said Chijuka. 
[passage omitted] 
  The fact that the military manoeuvres were to start at this 
moment of conflict between Yaounde and Abuja might be a 
"coincidence", he said. Sunday, press reports here quoted 
Nigerian officials as being suspicious of the military exercise, 
describing it as "a show of might" at the moment of crisis. 
"When they return, our people should be able to tell us" the 
exact situation of things, Chijuka said. 
  In another development, the military administrator of one of 
the states bordering the disputed territory has said Nigeria was 
making plans to solve refugee problems that may crop up as a 
result of the conflict. The military administrator of Akwa Ibom 
state, Colonel Yakubu Bako, said that necessary logistics have 
been put in place in the state to tackle refugee problem, the 
official NAN reported late Sunday. "We are expecting that 
problem, we have worked out the logistics and submitted it to 
the Nigeria federal government", Bako told journalists. 
  Although the state was not having refugee problems at the 
moment, Bako said he has initiated moves to hold talks with his 
colleagues in Abia and Cross River, two states neighbouring on 
Akwa Ibom over the matter. The independent CONCORD newspaper 
reported Sunday that an average of 300 displaced Nigerians 
fleeing Cameroon arrive daily in Ikang, a border village in 
Cross River State. The newspaper report has not been officially 
confirmed.

  [Text] The Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state are 
going to meet very soon to settle their territorial dispute. 
For the moment, the tense atmosphere between the two countries 
has cooled off. This disclosure was made this afternoon by 
Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Babagana Kingibe who was 
granted audience in Lome II by the head of state, General 
Gnassingbe Eyadema. Let's listen to the Nigerian diplomat. 
  [Begin recording] [Kingibe] My visit to Togo today is in 
line 
with regular consultations between Nigeria and Togo especially 
when a problem arises in our region or between our two 
countries. As you are aware, the Togolese president has taken an 
initiative which has deeply touched all Nigerians by going to 
Cameroon and Nigeria to see if he could offer some sort of 
mediation in this small problem between Nigeria and Cameroon. 
So, I have come here in this context and presently there is a 
Togolese delegation in Abuja. My Togolese counterpart is 
currently in Abuja. So, you see that it is normal for Nigeria 
and Togo to always have regular and very close contacts and 
consultations. 
  I have come here in this context and I am highly satisfied 
with the outcome of my talks with the president. I came to 
convey some suggestions and viewpoints of President Sani Abacha 
and I am very pleased with the observations made by President 
Eyadema on this viewpoints. I am happy to confirm that, thanks 
to President Eyadema's personal intervention and also to other 
measures adopted by President Sani Abacha and President Paul 
Biya, the present tension has cooled off a great deal. Calm 
prevails now, and the two governments -- the two leaders -- have 
demonstrated their desire to engage in fraternal dialogue and to 
avoid internationalizing the dispute. So, the prevailing 
atmosphere is very, very satisfactory now. Calm now prevails. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Will the heads of state meet? 
  [Kingibe] By the grace of God. 
  [Correspondent] And will the meeting come very soon? 
  [Kingibe] I hope very, very soon. But the truth is that no 
precise date has been fixed now. However, I am very confident 
that a meeting will be held very, very soon. [end recording]

  [Text] In continuation with his diplomatic move aimed at 
resolving the dispute over Bakassi Peninsula between Nigeria and 
Cameroon, Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Babagana Kingibe 
was in Lome, the Togolese capital, this evening to deliver a 
special message from General Sani Abacha to the Togolese leader, 
President Gbassingbe Eyadema. The meeting between Ambassador 
Kingibe and the Togolese president, which lasted half an hour, 
was witnessed by Nigeria's envoy in Togo, Ambassador Vincent 
Okobi, and the Togolese foreign minister, Mr. Fambare Natchaba. 
Correspondent Shegun Adeluye, who was in the minister's 
entourage, asked Ambassador Kingibe what was achieved from the 
diplomatic visit. 
  [Begin Kingibe recording] In light of these conversations, I 
am very optimistic that the situation is going to improve day by 
day until such a time that we can have the dialogue between 
ourselves and our brothers, the Cameroonians, and we shall be 
able to resolve our problems and bring ourselves [words 
indistinct] to this dialogue. I think that with the conditions 
at this point in time are getting more and more favorable toward 
that end. I am sure that the initiative by President Eyadema 
and others will all go a long way in contributing to create the 
right atmosphere that will enable us to resolve this problem 
once and for all in a very peaceful manner. [end recording] 
  The foreign affairs minister said he is confident that 
General Eyadema is experienced and trustworthy enough to 
contribute meaningfully to the peaceful resolution of the 
Nigeria-Cameroon border dispute.

  [Text] National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola's [UNITA] rebels have shelled Chiobo area in Cabinda 
Province, near the border with the Republic of Zaire. The area 
was recaptured by the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] a few days ago. 
UNITA has been shelling the area from Zairian territory. On 
the situation in Cabinda FAA's Colonel Manuel Paiva said: 
  [Begin Paiva recording] UNITA has been carrying out 
offensive 
movements, particularly in northern Cabinda Province. This has 
caused certain instability at (Candozinsi) and (Chombo). UNITA 
troops, coming from Zaire, have been shelling areas and carrying 
out terrorist actions, ambushes, and attacks on government 
positions in those areas. 
  In response, our forces expelled the enemy in certain areas, 
notably Chimbuande and Choco. In brief, we can say that the 
political and military situation is relatively calm, since our 
forces were able to put the enemy on the defensive and establish 
greater tranquility and security in northern Cabinda. [end

  [Text] The political and military situation in northern 
Angola is characterized by war. This was revealed by Army 
General Abilio Kamalata Numa, chief of the general staff of the 
northern front, in an interview with the Voice of the Resistance 
of the Black Cockerel and TERRA ANGOLANA newspaper. According 
to Genertal Numa, Luanda is carrying out a full military 
offensive, totally disrespecting the Lusaka peace talks. It 
wants to capture positions under the control of the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the 
provinces of Zaire, Uige, Bengo, and Cuanza Norte. 
  General Numa said the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] relies on the assistance of 
mercenaries from different nationalities, including Portuguese 
marines stationed in Cabinda Province. He said MPLA-PT warships 
cruise along the Cabinda-Luanda corridor weekly, carrying lethal 
materiel. 
  However, Commander Kamalata Numa reaffirmed UNITA's desire 
to 
continue to find peace through dialogue, but stressed that the 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola will henceforth not 
tolerate any kind of provocation. He said UNITA was carrying 
out all kinds of defensive measures to defend the strategic city 
of Soyo. In conclusion, General Numa stressed that UNITA will 
not be held responsible for damage to oil installations in the 
event of an attack on Soyo.

  [Text] Army General Abilio Kamalata Numa, chief of staff 
for the northern front, says Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola [MPLA] troops are trying to enter diamond rich areas 
of Lunda Province. 
  Gen. Numa said a huge motorized column left Dondo for 
N'Dalatando a few hours ago. The column consists of more than 
2,000 men, 13 tanks, 12 TM bridgelayers, four B-30 guns, two 
IL-46 guns, six AG-17 rocket launchers, and 20 logistical and 
personnel carriers. Two Mi- 25 helicopters stationed in 
Cambamba and several fighter bombers stationed in Luanda are 
also part of the column. Gen. Numa said the ongoing offensive 
is aimed at the civilian residents of N'Dalatando. 
  Turning to Bengo Province, Gen. Numa said the Luanda 
government is also involved in an offensive in that province. 
He said People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FAPLA] units intend to take the District of Quibaxe in order to 
establish a support base to mount an attack on Uige. He said 
heavy clashes are taking place in Ucua District, and National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces are 
fighting bravely. Heavy MPLA troop movements have been reported 
in Muxaluando area of Bengo Province. FAPLA forces have been 
ordered to head to Vista Alegre and N'Zeto. Fierce clashes are 
also taking place on the Ambriz-N'Zeto axis. 
  Gen. Numa said the MPLA-Labor Party is being assisted by 
Katangese mercenaries, many of whom have been captured. As a 
whole, Gen. Numa said he is confident that UNITA forces will 
succeed.

  [Text] There is enormous evidence that the Futungo de Belas 
regime is not interested in peace. Recently, more lethal 
equipment arrived at the Luanda airport at night coming from 
Brazil, the DPRK, Russia, Israel, and Argentina. Such an 
attitude is dangerous to the current atmosphere of expectation 
in Angola, since the negotiators in Lusaka are about to reach an 
agreement. The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] alerts the international community, particularly 
the United States to persuade the Futungo regime to abdicate its 
warmongering thoughts. UNITA also says that the Luanda regime 
has on various occasions tried to hinder the success of the 
Lusaka talks. The Luanda regime will be responsible for a 
possible failure in the process. UNITA believes that there is 
no possibility of establishing peace through a military solution 
in Angola, as stated recently by UNITA President Dr. Jonas 
Malheiro Savimbi in an interview with AFP journalists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoty by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Geneva; date not given--recorded; 
in English with superimposed translation into Portuguese] 
  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Which countries provide 
aid to UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola]? Is South Africa directly involved? 
  [Chikoty] Yes, we know that South Africa continues to deny 
that. As you know, recently there was a court case involving 
three South African pilots accused of ferrying weapons from 
South Africa to Angola in 1993. That confirms what we have been 
saying all along. 
  We also know that there is an important logistical base in 
Zaire. It is headed by Colonel (Karizer). You should know that 
I was also a UNITA member. Col. (Karizer) lives in Kinshasa, 
and he supervises all the logistical aid earmarked for UNITA 
camps. Basically, all neighboring countries -- namely, Namibia, 
Botswana, and Zambia have revealed that in 1993 a considerable 
number of aircraft from South Africa overflew their territories 
and landed in southern and eastern Angola. Now the aircraft 
land in Zaire and then proceed to Angola. 
  So, as you can see Zaire and South Africa are involved in 
the 
dispute. UNITA enjoys a great deal of assistance. UNITA has 
offices in the United States, Portugal, England, and France. We 
do not know what form of assistance they get from the 
governments of those countries, though we think there is a 
degree of tolerance. 
  We believe UNITA has become a terrorist organization now 
that 
elections have been held in Angola. There is no justification 
for the claim that UNITA is fighting communism in Angola and for 
human rights and democracy. We believe the cold war is over. 
The only way of assisting Angola's democratic development is to 
stop the war. One cannot allow UNITA to destroy everything and 
kill innocent people.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama today showed RTP his shadow cabinet. 
The Renamo leader said he is ready to take over power, but he 
will accept remaining in opposition. Our correspondent in 
Maputo, Fernando Magalhaes, met Renamo's shadow cabinet: 
  [Magalhaes] This is Renamo's first shadow cabinet and Afonso 
Dhlakama introduced it to us: 
  [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] This is Minister for Internal 
Administration Albino Faife. This is Agostinho Murrial, 
information minister. This is Minister of Agriculture Paris 
[Raul] Baza. [end recording] 
  [Magalhaes] He also introduced us to the recently appointed 
aides of provincial governors. This will be a way of sharing 
regional government that many Frelimo people fear will paralyze 
its government. 
  [Begin recording] [Magalhaes] Will this shadow government 
dynamize or paralyze the country's activities? 
  [Dhlakama] It will dynamize them. It will help the 
reintegration and reunification of the country. 
  [Magalhaes] The appointment of the aides was decided at the 
first Dhlakama-Chissano summit, which took place in Maputo on 3 
September 1993. Maybe this is the beginning of a government of 
reconciliation which the international community wants to see 
still before the elections. Do you hope to win the elections? 
  [Dhlakama] Well. 
  [Magalhaes] Or do you hope to win the next? 
  [Dhlakama] Well, I want to make it clear that I did not 
fight 
for power but rather, I fought for democracy and freedom and I 
have already won. We will have to see whether I will win the 
elections or not. We will have to see. I have hope that the 
results will be good. [end recording]

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] President 
Afonso Dhlakama has expressed his leadership's readiness to 
begin to demobilize his movement's troops beginning next week. 
At a meeting with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim 
today, Afonso Dhlakama spoke of the efforts being made to 
prepare for the elections, with the establishment of the 
National Elections Commission and the Elections Administration 
Technical Secretariat. He also spoke of good relations existing 
with President Chissano. On the occasion, the Renamo leader 
deplored the canceling of logistical assistance to his movement 
by the government, which he says violates the General Peace 
Accord. 
  In turn, the OAU secretary general hailed the parties for 
the 
achievements made during the pacification of Mozambique. He 
also promised to encourage the international community to assist 
the Mozambican peace process in every way. 
  Radio Mozambique learned this from Raul Domingos, Renamo's 
head of the political affairs department, in a telephone contact.

  [Text] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello says that 
contradictory decisions by the Supervision and Control 
Commission [CSC] and the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] have 
contributed toward the delays in the demobilization of 
government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] troops. 
The UN official noted that, though the CSC had decided that 
demobilization should begin on 1 March, the CCF ordered that, 
until Renamo had produced its lists, the government should not 
send its lists to the Finance Ministry to have demobilization 
subsidies paid out. 
  Aldo Ajello announced that greater control is to be exerted 
on the CCF in the future. The UN special representative also 
disclosed that the first UN police contingent is scheduled to 
arrive in Mozambique before the end of this month. The UN 
Security Council recently endorsed the deployment of more than 
1,000 UN policemen in this country to observe the work done by 
the police of the Republic of Mozambique.

  [Text] The United Nations special representative in 
Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, has been giving details of the 
arrangements for the deployment of more than 1,000 UN police 
observers in Mozambique, following a Security Council resolution 
last month. Mr. Ajello told a Maputo press briefing today that 
1,144 UN police will be deployed in three phases. 
  This month should see the arrival of UN police headquarters 
staff. Thirty-six police for regional centers and 327 observers 
for the 11 provincial capitals. From April to June, 70 percent 
of the 720 UN police to be deployed at districts and lower 
levels should be in place. A full police contingent must be in 
place one month before the country's first multiparty elections 
due to be held in October this year. Mr. Ajello said the UN 
police would be very useful for the unification of the territory 
and the republic's administration. He guaranteed that the 
Mozambican police should freely enter Renamo-held areas. 
  Mr. Ajello found it very encouraging that Renamo leader 
Afonso Dhlakama yesterday reiterated his commitment to unifying 
the country under a single administration. Mr. Ajello said he 
believed that both Renamo and the government were now strongly 
committed to implementing the peace process on time. He said 
there could be no question of postponing the elections until 
1995 because both sides understood that [words indistinct].

  [Text] There was no plenary meeting at the Lusaka peace 
talks yesterday, but important steps were nevertheless taken to 
restore peace in this country. The Voice of Resistance of the 
Black Cockerel has learned that the mediators have presented a 
new general document to the negotiating parties, who responded 
to it yesterday. It is not known yet how the two sides responded 
to that document because the official mediator continues to 
demand secrecy. 
  Meanwhile, Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] information secretary, 
told Radio France Internationale yesterday that talks were on 
the right track and progress was being made. 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] The talks are going very well 
indeed. In practical terms, we have reached consensus 
concerning more than 50 percent of all the issues that have been 
raised. I would like to [words indistinct] the sides have 
agreed that there should be a major campaign after an accord has 
been signed to promote a spirit of tolerance and trust that 
would allow its implementation. We have also reached an 
understanding concerning a very important role by a free press 
that would serve the whole nation. Obviously, decentralization 
is a very important point. We have not reached complete 
agreement on that score yet, but we have covered more than three 
quarters of the ground needed to achieve that goal. 
  As for the issue of participation by UNITA deputies in the 
National Assembly, or Parliament, it is true that there is an 
understanding but, unfortunately, that issue has run into some 
difficulties because we are of the opinion that there must be no 
interference in the choice of UNITA deputies to take up seats in 
Parliament. It will be up to the UNITA leadership to choose the 
deputies who will be in Parliament, those who will be in 
government -- at whatever level -- and those who will be working 
in other areas. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What about the government posts 
that UNITA has been demanding? 
  [Valentim] The talks are continuing but we have reached an 
agreement that that matter should be discussed (?on the ground).

  [Text] National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola's [UNITA] rebels have shelled Chiobo area in Cabinda 
Province, near the border with the Republic of Zaire. The area 
was recaptured by the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] a few days ago. 
UNITA has been shelling the area from Zairian territory. On 
the situation in Cabinda FAA's Colonel Manuel Paiva said: 
  [Begin Paiva recording] UNITA has been carrying out 
offensive 
movements, particularly in northern Cabinda Province. This has 
caused certain instability at (Candozinsi) and (Chombo). UNITA 
troops, coming from Zaire, have been shelling areas and carrying 
out terrorist actions, ambushes, and attacks on government 
positions in those areas. 
  In response, our forces expelled the enemy in certain areas, 
notably Chimbuande and Choco. In brief, we can say that the 
political and military situation is relatively calm, since our 
forces were able to put the enemy on the defensive and establish 
greater tranquility and security in northern Cabinda. [end

  [Text] The political and military situation in northern 
Angola is characterized by war. This was revealed by Army 
General Abilio Kamalata Numa, chief of the general staff of the 
northern front, in an interview with the Voice of the Resistance 
of the Black Cockerel and TERRA ANGOLANA newspaper. According 
to Genertal Numa, Luanda is carrying out a full military 
offensive, totally disrespecting the Lusaka peace talks. It 
wants to capture positions under the control of the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the 
provinces of Zaire, Uige, Bengo, and Cuanza Norte. 
  General Numa said the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] relies on the assistance of 
mercenaries from different nationalities, including Portuguese 
marines stationed in Cabinda Province. He said MPLA-PT warships 
cruise along the Cabinda-Luanda corridor weekly, carrying lethal 
materiel. 
  However, Commander Kamalata Numa reaffirmed UNITA's desire 
to 
continue to find peace through dialogue, but stressed that the 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola will henceforth not 
tolerate any kind of provocation. He said UNITA was carrying 
out all kinds of defensive measures to defend the strategic city 
of Soyo. In conclusion, General Numa stressed that UNITA will 
not be held responsible for damage to oil installations in the 
event of an attack on Soyo.

  [Text] There is enormous evidence that the Futungo de Belas 
regime is not interested in peace. Recently, more lethal 
equipment arrived at the Luanda airport at night coming from 
Brazil, the DPRK, Russia, Israel, and Argentina. Such an 
attitude is dangerous to the current atmosphere of expectation 
in Angola, since the negotiators in Lusaka are about to reach an 
agreement. The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] alerts the international community, particularly 
the United States to persuade the Futungo regime to abdicate its 
warmongering thoughts. UNITA also says that the Luanda regime 
has on various occasions tried to hinder the success of the 
Lusaka talks. The Luanda regime will be responsible for a 
possible failure in the process. UNITA believes that there is 
no possibility of establishing peace through a military solution 
in Angola, as stated recently by UNITA President Dr. Jonas 
Malheiro Savimbi in an interview with AFP journalists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoty by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Geneva; date not given--recorded; 
in English with superimposed translation into Portuguese] 
  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Which countries provide 
aid to UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola]? Is South Africa directly involved? 
  [Chikoty] Yes, we know that South Africa continues to deny 
that. As you know, recently there was a court case involving 
three South African pilots accused of ferrying weapons from 
South Africa to Angola in 1993. That confirms what we have been 
saying all along. 
  We also know that there is an important logistical base in 
Zaire. It is headed by Colonel (Karizer). You should know that 
I was also a UNITA member. Col. (Karizer) lives in Kinshasa, 
and he supervises all the logistical aid earmarked for UNITA 
camps. Basically, all neighboring countries -- namely, Namibia, 
Botswana, and Zambia have revealed that in 1993 a considerable 
number of aircraft from South Africa overflew their territories 
and landed in southern and eastern Angola. Now the aircraft 
land in Zaire and then proceed to Angola. 
  So, as you can see Zaire and South Africa are involved in 
the 
dispute. UNITA enjoys a great deal of assistance. UNITA has 
offices in the United States, Portugal, England, and France. We 
do not know what form of assistance they get from the 
governments of those countries, though we think there is a 
degree of tolerance. 
  We believe UNITA has become a terrorist organization now 
that 
elections have been held in Angola. There is no justification 
for the claim that UNITA is fighting communism in Angola and for 
human rights and democracy. We believe the cold war is over. 
The only way of assisting Angola's democratic development is to 
stop the war. One cannot allow UNITA to destroy everything and 
kill innocent people.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama today showed RTP his shadow cabinet. 
The Renamo leader said he is ready to take over power, but he 
will accept remaining in opposition. Our correspondent in 
Maputo, Fernando Magalhaes, met Renamo's shadow cabinet: 
  [Magalhaes] This is Renamo's first shadow cabinet and Afonso 
Dhlakama introduced it to us: 
  [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] This is Minister for Internal 
Administration Albino Faife. This is Agostinho Murrial, 
information minister. This is Minister of Agriculture Paris 
[Raul] Baza. [end recording] 
  [Magalhaes] He also introduced us to the recently appointed 
aides of provincial governors. This will be a way of sharing 
regional government that many Frelimo people fear will paralyze 
its government. 
  [Begin recording] [Magalhaes] Will this shadow government 
dynamize or paralyze the country's activities? 
  [Dhlakama] It will dynamize them. It will help the 
reintegration and reunification of the country. 
  [Magalhaes] The appointment of the aides was decided at the 
first Dhlakama-Chissano summit, which took place in Maputo on 3 
September 1993. Maybe this is the beginning of a government of 
reconciliation which the international community wants to see 
still before the elections. Do you hope to win the elections? 
  [Dhlakama] Well. 
  [Magalhaes] Or do you hope to win the next? 
  [Dhlakama] Well, I want to make it clear that I did not 
fight 
for power but rather, I fought for democracy and freedom and I 
have already won. We will have to see whether I will win the 
elections or not. We will have to see. I have hope that the 
results will be good. [end recording]

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] President 
Afonso Dhlakama has expressed his leadership's readiness to 
begin to demobilize his movement's troops beginning next week. 
At a meeting with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim 
today, Afonso Dhlakama spoke of the efforts being made to 
prepare for the elections, with the establishment of the 
National Elections Commission and the Elections Administration 
Technical Secretariat. He also spoke of good relations existing 
with President Chissano. On the occasion, the Renamo leader 
deplored the canceling of logistical assistance to his movement 
by the government, which he says violates the General Peace 
Accord. 
  In turn, the OAU secretary general hailed the parties for 
the 
achievements made during the pacification of Mozambique. He 
also promised to encourage the international community to assist 
the Mozambican peace process in every way. 
  Radio Mozambique learned this from Raul Domingos, Renamo's 
head of the political affairs department, in a telephone contact.

  [Text] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello says that 
contradictory decisions by the Supervision and Control 
Commission [CSC] and the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] have 
contributed toward the delays in the demobilization of 
government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] troops. 
The UN official noted that, though the CSC had decided that 
demobilization should begin on 1 March, the CCF ordered that, 
until Renamo had produced its lists, the government should not 
send its lists to the Finance Ministry to have demobilization 
subsidies paid out. 
  Aldo Ajello announced that greater control is to be exerted 
on the CCF in the future. The UN special representative also 
disclosed that the first UN police contingent is scheduled to 
arrive in Mozambique before the end of this month. The UN 
Security Council recently endorsed the deployment of more than 
1,000 UN policemen in this country to observe the work done by 
the police of the Republic of Mozambique.

  [Text] The United Nations special representative in 
Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, has been giving details of the 
arrangements for the deployment of more than 1,000 UN police 
observers in Mozambique, following a Security Council resolution 
last month. Mr. Ajello told a Maputo press briefing today that 
1,144 UN police will be deployed in three phases. 
  This month should see the arrival of UN police headquarters 
staff. Thirty-six police for regional centers and 327 observers 
for the 11 provincial capitals. From April to June, 70 percent 
of the 720 UN police to be deployed at districts and lower 
levels should be in place. A full police contingent must be in 
place one month before the country's first multiparty elections 
due to be held in October this year. Mr. Ajello said the UN 
police would be very useful for the unification of the territory 
and the republic's administration. He guaranteed that the 
Mozambican police should freely enter Renamo-held areas. 
  Mr. Ajello found it very encouraging that Renamo leader 
Afonso Dhlakama yesterday reiterated his commitment to unifying 
the country under a single administration. Mr. Ajello said he 
believed that both Renamo and the government were now strongly 
committed to implementing the peace process on time. He said 
there could be no question of postponing the elections until 
1995 because both sides understood that [words indistinct].

  [Text] National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola's [UNITA] rebels have shelled Chiobo area in Cabinda 
Province, near the border with the Republic of Zaire. The area 
was recaptured by the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] a few days ago. 
UNITA has been shelling the area from Zairian territory. On 
the situation in Cabinda FAA's Colonel Manuel Paiva said: 
  [Begin Paiva recording] UNITA has been carrying out 
offensive 
movements, particularly in northern Cabinda Province. This has 
caused certain instability at (Candozinsi) and (Chombo). UNITA 
troops, coming from Zaire, have been shelling areas and carrying 
out terrorist actions, ambushes, and attacks on government 
positions in those areas. 
  In response, our forces expelled the enemy in certain areas, 
notably Chimbuande and Choco. In brief, we can say that the 
political and military situation is relatively calm, since our 
forces were able to put the enemy on the defensive and establish 
greater tranquility and security in northern Cabinda. [end

  [Text] The political and military situation in northern 
Angola is characterized by war. This was revealed by Army 
General Abilio Kamalata Numa, chief of the general staff of the 
northern front, in an interview with the Voice of the Resistance 
of the Black Cockerel and TERRA ANGOLANA newspaper. According 
to Genertal Numa, Luanda is carrying out a full military 
offensive, totally disrespecting the Lusaka peace talks. It 
wants to capture positions under the control of the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the 
provinces of Zaire, Uige, Bengo, and Cuanza Norte. 
  General Numa said the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] relies on the assistance of 
mercenaries from different nationalities, including Portuguese 
marines stationed in Cabinda Province. He said MPLA-PT warships 
cruise along the Cabinda-Luanda corridor weekly, carrying lethal 
materiel. 
  However, Commander Kamalata Numa reaffirmed UNITA's desire 
to 
continue to find peace through dialogue, but stressed that the 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola will henceforth not 
tolerate any kind of provocation. He said UNITA was carrying 
out all kinds of defensive measures to defend the strategic city 
of Soyo. In conclusion, General Numa stressed that UNITA will 
not be held responsible for damage to oil installations in the 
event of an attack on Soyo.

  [Text] Army General Abilio Kamalata Numa, chief of staff 
for the northern front, says Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola [MPLA] troops are trying to enter diamond rich areas 
of Lunda Province. 
  Gen. Numa said a huge motorized column left Dondo for 
N'Dalatando a few hours ago. The column consists of more than 
2,000 men, 13 tanks, 12 TM bridgelayers, four B-30 guns, two 
IL-46 guns, six AG-17 rocket launchers, and 20 logistical and 
personnel carriers. Two Mi- 25 helicopters stationed in 
Cambamba and several fighter bombers stationed in Luanda are 
also part of the column. Gen. Numa said the ongoing offensive 
is aimed at the civilian residents of N'Dalatando. 
  Turning to Bengo Province, Gen. Numa said the Luanda 
government is also involved in an offensive in that province. 
He said People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FAPLA] units intend to take the District of Quibaxe in order to 
establish a support base to mount an attack on Uige. He said 
heavy clashes are taking place in Ucua District, and National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces are 
fighting bravely. Heavy MPLA troop movements have been reported 
in Muxaluando area of Bengo Province. FAPLA forces have been 
ordered to head to Vista Alegre and N'Zeto. Fierce clashes are 
also taking place on the Ambriz-N'Zeto axis. 
  Gen. Numa said the MPLA-Labor Party is being assisted by 
Katangese mercenaries, many of whom have been captured. As a 
whole, Gen. Numa said he is confident that UNITA forces will 
succeed.

  [Text] There is enormous evidence that the Futungo de Belas 
regime is not interested in peace. Recently, more lethal 
equipment arrived at the Luanda airport at night coming from 
Brazil, the DPRK, Russia, Israel, and Argentina. Such an 
attitude is dangerous to the current atmosphere of expectation 
in Angola, since the negotiators in Lusaka are about to reach an 
agreement. The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] alerts the international community, particularly 
the United States to persuade the Futungo regime to abdicate its 
warmongering thoughts. UNITA also says that the Luanda regime 
has on various occasions tried to hinder the success of the 
Lusaka talks. The Luanda regime will be responsible for a 
possible failure in the process. UNITA believes that there is 
no possibility of establishing peace through a military solution 
in Angola, as stated recently by UNITA President Dr. Jonas 
Malheiro Savimbi in an interview with AFP journalists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoty by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Geneva; date not given--recorded; 
in English with superimposed translation into Portuguese] 
  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Which countries provide 
aid to UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola]? Is South Africa directly involved? 
  [Chikoty] Yes, we know that South Africa continues to deny 
that. As you know, recently there was a court case involving 
three South African pilots accused of ferrying weapons from 
South Africa to Angola in 1993. That confirms what we have been 
saying all along. 
  We also know that there is an important logistical base in 
Zaire. It is headed by Colonel (Karizer). You should know that 
I was also a UNITA member. Col. (Karizer) lives in Kinshasa, 
and he supervises all the logistical aid earmarked for UNITA 
camps. Basically, all neighboring countries -- namely, Namibia, 
Botswana, and Zambia have revealed that in 1993 a considerable 
number of aircraft from South Africa overflew their territories 
and landed in southern and eastern Angola. Now the aircraft 
land in Zaire and then proceed to Angola. 
  So, as you can see Zaire and South Africa are involved in 
the 
dispute. UNITA enjoys a great deal of assistance. UNITA has 
offices in the United States, Portugal, England, and France. We 
do not know what form of assistance they get from the 
governments of those countries, though we think there is a 
degree of tolerance. 
  We believe UNITA has become a terrorist organization now 
that 
elections have been held in Angola. There is no justification 
for the claim that UNITA is fighting communism in Angola and for 
human rights and democracy. We believe the cold war is over. 
The only way of assisting Angola's democratic development is to 
stop the war. One cannot allow UNITA to destroy everything and 
kill innocent people.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama today showed RTP his shadow cabinet. 
The Renamo leader said he is ready to take over power, but he 
will accept remaining in opposition. Our correspondent in 
Maputo, Fernando Magalhaes, met Renamo's shadow cabinet: 
  [Magalhaes] This is Renamo's first shadow cabinet and Afonso 
Dhlakama introduced it to us: 
  [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] This is Minister for Internal 
Administration Albino Faife. This is Agostinho Murrial, 
information minister. This is Minister of Agriculture Paris 
[Raul] Baza. [end recording] 
  [Magalhaes] He also introduced us to the recently appointed 
aides of provincial governors. This will be a way of sharing 
regional government that many Frelimo people fear will paralyze 
its government. 
  [Begin recording] [Magalhaes] Will this shadow government 
dynamize or paralyze the country's activities? 
  [Dhlakama] It will dynamize them. It will help the 
reintegration and reunification of the country. 
  [Magalhaes] The appointment of the aides was decided at the 
first Dhlakama-Chissano summit, which took place in Maputo on 3 
September 1993. Maybe this is the beginning of a government of 
reconciliation which the international community wants to see 
still before the elections. Do you hope to win the elections? 
  [Dhlakama] Well. 
  [Magalhaes] Or do you hope to win the next? 
  [Dhlakama] Well, I want to make it clear that I did not 
fight 
for power but rather, I fought for democracy and freedom and I 
have already won. We will have to see whether I will win the 
elections or not. We will have to see. I have hope that the 
results will be good. [end recording]

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] President 
Afonso Dhlakama has expressed his leadership's readiness to 
begin to demobilize his movement's troops beginning next week. 
At a meeting with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim 
today, Afonso Dhlakama spoke of the efforts being made to 
prepare for the elections, with the establishment of the 
National Elections Commission and the Elections Administration 
Technical Secretariat. He also spoke of good relations existing 
with President Chissano. On the occasion, the Renamo leader 
deplored the canceling of logistical assistance to his movement 
by the government, which he says violates the General Peace 
Accord. 
  In turn, the OAU secretary general hailed the parties for 
the 
achievements made during the pacification of Mozambique. He 
also promised to encourage the international community to assist 
the Mozambican peace process in every way. 
  Radio Mozambique learned this from Raul Domingos, Renamo's 
head of the political affairs department, in a telephone contact.

  [Text] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello says that 
contradictory decisions by the Supervision and Control 
Commission [CSC] and the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] have 
contributed toward the delays in the demobilization of 
government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] troops. 
The UN official noted that, though the CSC had decided that 
demobilization should begin on 1 March, the CCF ordered that, 
until Renamo had produced its lists, the government should not 
send its lists to the Finance Ministry to have demobilization 
subsidies paid out. 
  Aldo Ajello announced that greater control is to be exerted 
on the CCF in the future. The UN special representative also 
disclosed that the first UN police contingent is scheduled to 
arrive in Mozambique before the end of this month. The UN 
Security Council recently endorsed the deployment of more than 
1,000 UN policemen in this country to observe the work done by 
the police of the Republic of Mozambique.

  [Text] The United Nations special representative in 
Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, has been giving details of the 
arrangements for the deployment of more than 1,000 UN police 
observers in Mozambique, following a Security Council resolution 
last month. Mr. Ajello told a Maputo press briefing today that 
1,144 UN police will be deployed in three phases. 
  This month should see the arrival of UN police headquarters 
staff. Thirty-six police for regional centers and 327 observers 
for the 11 provincial capitals. From April to June, 70 percent 
of the 720 UN police to be deployed at districts and lower 
levels should be in place. A full police contingent must be in 
place one month before the country's first multiparty elections 
due to be held in October this year. Mr. Ajello said the UN 
police would be very useful for the unification of the territory 
and the republic's administration. He guaranteed that the 
Mozambican police should freely enter Renamo-held areas. 
  Mr. Ajello found it very encouraging that Renamo leader 
Afonso Dhlakama yesterday reiterated his commitment to unifying 
the country under a single administration. Mr. Ajello said he 
believed that both Renamo and the government were now strongly 
committed to implementing the peace process on time. He said 
there could be no question of postponing the elections until 
1995 because both sides understood that [words indistinct].

  [Excerpts] It has been a day of sensational developments on 
the election front. The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] decided at 
the eleventh hour to register conditionally for participation in 
next month's election. The party's national chairman, Dr. Frank 
Mdlalose, is on his way from Ulundi to Kempton Park by plane to 
register the IFP. Over the next four hours -- at midnight -- it 
will be all over for political parties that have not yet 
registered for the election. [passage omitted] 
  At Ulundi, the Central Committee of the IFP made a 
last-minute decision. For news from Ulundi we switch over live 
to Gary Alfonso. 
  [Alfonso] Good evening from here in Ulundi, where it has 
been 
a very busy day. Inkatha's Central Committee eventually 
decided, after a meeting of more than seven hours, to pass the 
resolution that they would in fact register. Dr. Frank Mdlalose 
is already on his way to Johannesburg where he will register the 
IFP conditionally as a party to take part in the election. TV 
News has just spoken to some of the members of the committee 
after the meeting and they were all cautiously optimistic. I 
have in my hand here the resolution and one of the significant 
decisions is of course the first one -- that they will register 
conditionally to take part in the election, but they also add 
that the decision does not mean that the IFP supports the 
current state of discussions or the transitional constitution. 
There are two clauses that are perhaps very important at this 
stage. The first is that mediation is also necessary to revise 
the election process and that of course means that the mediation 
can be employed and according to the IFP, to possibly postpone 
the election date, and that is what the clause says here. The 
role of the king must also be looked at by the mediators. 
  A little while ago we spoke to Chief Minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi and this is what he had to say about this decision. 
  [Begin Buthelezi recording, in English] In the first place, 
we don't want anyone to have any illusions that this means any 
shift in our position as far as our rejection of the 1993 
interim constitution is concerned because we still have those 
reservations about that, and really, that is the reason why we 
seek international mediation because all the negotiations have 
flopped, they have come to naught. So therefore the very first 
thing that should be done is mediation itself, and we are very 
happy that the ANC [African National Congress] has endorsed this 
resolution of the Central Committee passed on the 12th which, 
after our discussions with Mr. Mandela, has also been accepted 
in principle by the ANC. So Monday, I expect Dr. Mdlalose and a 
committee to look at the question of terms of reference for such 
a mediation and what kind of people can conduct the mediation 
itself. So those are things that come first. So we would like 
to make it clear that there can be no progress unless that goes 
forward first before we go on to the other steps that we should 
be taking in terms of the Electoral Act. And then also we would 
like also to say that we expect the mediation also to include 
mediation [as heard] -- it should not in any way undermine any 
of the steps that his majesty the king has taken as far as the 
kwaZulu kingdom is concerned, and we have of course also 
informed members of the Freedom Alliance already this afternoon 
what we have decided. We were together yesterday and they 
endorsed my stand and the stand of the Central Committee at our 
meeting in Cape Town, and we are informing them now, and we are 
going to meet in that committee where Dr. Mdlalose is, members 
of Central Committee present [as heard] as well as members of 
the Freedom Alliance. So I hear that also...[interrupted by 
announcer] [end recording]

  [Text] The leader of the Afrikaner Volksfront [National 
Front], General Constand Viljoen, has provisionally registered a 
party called the Freedom Front for the coming election. The 
step came only hours after the leader of the IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party], Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, had provisionally 
registered his party. 
  Gen. Viljoen said he had realized after the IFP decision 
that 
the freedom of the Afrikaner people to exercise their options 
would be limited if he did not apply for provisional 
registration. He said participation in the election would 
depend on whether negotiations or international mediation 
delivered the desired results. 
  Gen. Viljoen said the Volksraad [National Assembly] would 
decide in Pretoria today whether the Freedom Front would 
participate in the election. The party has until 1200 [1000 
GMT] this afternoon to make any changes to the party's name. 
  A spokesman for the IFP, Miss Sue Vos, said a final decision 
on the IFP's participation in the election would depend on a 
meeting of the Freedom Alliance on Monday [7 March], and talks 
with the ANC [African National Congress] on Tuesday. 
  Parties participating in the election have until 4:30 
Wednesday afternoon to confirm their participation by submitting 
the names of their candidates. 
  The chief negotiator for Bophuthatswana, Mr. Rowan Cronje, 
says Bophuthatswana could consider participating in the election 
if the deadline for registration is extended. 
  The leader of the National Party, Mr. F. W. de Klerk, has 
welcomed the IFP's decision to register provisionally for the 
election. However, he said that he regretted that there were 
conditions attached to the IFP's participation.

  [Text] In a dramatic development late last night, with only 
minutes to go before the deadline for election registration was 
due to expire, Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader 
Constand Viljoen made his appearance and signed up 
provisionally. The development came only hours after the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] also announced its decision to 
register. 
  Gen. Viljoen, a former South African Defense Force chief, 
insisted, however, that his party's decision had still to be 
confirmed by the front's controlling Volksraad [National 
Assembly] today. A total of 29 parties have registered for the 
election. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Caro Kriel] Gen. Constand 
Viljoen made his surprise entrance at 15 minutes before 
midnight. He said the registration was provisional, because the 
Volksfront did not have enough time to discuss the IFP's 
decision to contest the elections provisionally. 
  [Viljoen] No, I didn't come to register tonight, because the 
decision from the IFP, a member of our alliance, came this 
evening, and then our controlling bodies will only be meeting 
tomorrow, and because of the deadline, and because of the fact 
that the [Independent Electoral Commission, IEC, Chairman] Judge 
[Kriegler] has said to us that this is the real deadline, we 
decided to come and discuss with the officials here tonight 
whether, if we hand in all our papers and refer the case to the 
controlling body tomorrow, then we can by phone confirm that it 
is OK, they can carry on. 
  [Kriel] But IEC officials confirmed the registration and 
said 
the party had paid the 70,000 rands deposit. The party, 
registered under the name Freedom Front, has until 12 noon today 
to change its name. 
  Earlier the IFP delegation, headed by the party's national 
chairman, Dr. Frank Mdlalose, arrived to register. This was 
provisional, pending negotiations on international mediation 
concerning key constitutional issues. Dr. Mdlalose also denied 
any split in the Freedom Alliance. 
  [Mdlalose] People have wanted to see a split ever so often. 
There's no split. We are different parties, and we formed the 
Freedom Alliance as a negotiating alliance. 
  [Kriel] As midnight drew closer, other parties also 
registered, among them the African Moslem Party, the African 
Moderates Congress, and the Federal Party. 
  [Federal Party spokesperson Frances Kendall] It's the poor 
people, the ordinary people, that get sidelined all the time. 
Nobody in the end ever reaches their needs. 
  [Kriel] And a maverick party, calling themselves the Soccer 
Party. 
  [First unidentified Soccer Party member] We've only just 
finished a game, and, you know, sport comes first. We were 
playing with the other guys in our neighborhood. 
  [Second unidentified Soccer Party member] We believe we are 
the only fit party, actually, to represent the voters. We're 
the only guys fit to govern. Yes, the sporting party. [end

  [Text] Johannesburg March 5 SAPA -- ANC [African National 
Congress] National Chairman Thabo Mbeki hailed the registration 
of the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] to participate in the April election as 
a step towards peace and stability. 
  Addressing the Socialist International Africa Committee in 
Johannesburg on Saturday, Mr Mbeki said the ANC had always 
strived for an inclusive political settlement so that the 
outcome of South Africa's first democratic election could be 
accepted as legitimate. "We salute leaders of these political 
formations for their sense of patriotism." 
  AVF Directorate Chairman Gen Constand Viljoen provisionally 
registered the Freedom Front to contest the elections. The IFP 
has also registered provisionally to contest the elections, 
provided their constitutional demands were settled by 
international mediation. 
  The ANC sincerely hopes the registration of these parties 
would indeed lead to their participation in the elections, he 
added. "The ANC was of the view that it was important that the 
negotiated resolution of the South African conflict should be an 
inclusive process, with the participation all political parties 
irrespective of size." 
  He said the multiparty negotiations had produced an interim 
constitution, which the majority of South Africans could claim 
as their own, which was important to achieve legitimacy and 
stability of the political settlement. "We have bee very 
concerned that the elections should be accepted by all South 
Africans, as a legitimate instrument to bring the country to a 
democratic settlement," Mr Mbeki said. 
  "The greatest danger to the holding of free and fair 
election 
is political violence. The parties which registered on Friday 
night had been saying openly, that not only would they boycott 
the elections, but would in fact disrupt the elections. The 
effect of their registration hopefully helps to address that 
matter to some degree, to the extent that they would then not 
disrupt the elections." 
  The ANC believes that amendments to the interim constitution 
addressed the concerns of the IFP, but the organisation would 
continue with further negotiations with the party, he added. 
"We are prepared to enter into an agreement which the ANC would 
consider to be binding on itself." 
  The ANC was also committed to further discussion with the 
Afrikaner rightwing around their demand for a "volkstaat" 
[homeland], provided their self-determination did not contradict 
the principle of non-racial democracy. "In the process of 
considering the issue of an Afrikaner volkstaat we have to be 
bound by principles of non-racialism and democracy." 
  Mr Mbeki thanked the Socialist International and its member 
parties for the supported they had given to the ANC and the 
struggle to overthrow apartheid.

  [Text] Pretoria Mar 5 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront's 
[AVF, Afrikaner National Front] transitional representative 
assembly decided in Pretoria on Saturday [5 March] that the AVF 
would not participate in the April election, the AVF's 
transitional President Ferdi Hartzenberg said. He was addressing 
a public session of the assembly after it met in committee 
during the course of the morning. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said AVF Gen Constand Viljoen's decision to 
register the organisation on Friday night for the election was 
"good," but the assembly had considered all the benefits and 
drawbacks on Saturday and decided not participate in the 
election -- unless its demands were met by the government and 
the African National Congress. 
  The AVF was not prepared to subject its nation to a 
communist 
government. The only way left for the Afrikaner to achieve a 
peaceful solution was to stand up and state his demands. The 
nation should be pointed in the right direction and mobilised to 
achieve freedom and self-determination. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said the Freedom Alliance [FA] members were 
free to each make their own decision as to whether to 
participate in the poll or not. Different decisions would not 
affect the FA's unity, he said. 
  Dr Hartzenberg's announcement was applauded by rightwing 
supporters who attended the open session of the assembly's 
meeting in the Dutch Reformed Church synodal centre. All the 
leading rightwing figures, including the Mulder brothers, 
Afrikaner Weersstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] 
leader Eugene Terreblanche and Gen Viljoen, were present.

  [Text] Hopes that the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner 
National Front] would take part in the country's first 
multiracial elections have been dashed. Despite General 
Constand Viljoen's last-minute registration of the Freedom 
Front, the Volksfront today rejected participation in the 
election. Johan Claasen was at today's Volks Representative 
Council meeting. 
  [Begin recording] [Claasen] Today's decision comes as a blow 
to followers of Gen. Viljoen who tried to keep the door open for 
participation in the election. The council's president, Dr. 
Ferdi Hartzenberg, retained enough support against such a move. 
  [Hartzenberg, in Afrikaans] Since they are insisting that 
the 
only way we can show our support for a volkstaat [homeland] is 
through this election, and because that is not an acceptable 
test to us, the council decided that it will stand by the 
decision it adopted two week's ago -- that it will not 
participate in the 27 April election. 
  [Claasen] Gen. Viljoen said he abided by the decision. The 
registration of the Afrikaner Vryheids Front [Freedom Front] 
would now be allowed to lapse. 
  [Viljoen] You cannot deregister, it will simply elapse when 
you don't hand in your list of candidates. 
  [Claasen] The decision not to take part in the election was 
taken behind closed doors in Pretoria's Synod Center. But talk 
among volkstaters noted that the general was rapped on the 
knuckles for his apparent single-handed decision to register. 
Some right wingers were more outspoken. 
  [Unidentified right winger in Afrikaans] We say that this 
country is our country, and that is why we are not prepared to 
enter this election. 
  [Claasen] Many supporters waited patiently for hours outside 
before they were allowed into the meeting. They also wanted to 
know where the final borders of their volkstaat would be. Dr. 
Hartzenberg told them that a final map had been drawn up, but 
members of the council would have to study it before it could be 
accepted. [end recording] 
  Today's decision by the Volksfront not to participate in the 
election means that last night's registration by Gen. Viljoen of 
the Freedom Front becomes null and void. A total of 29 parties 
registered for the election -- eight of them just beat the 
midnight deadline.

  [Text] Pretoria March 5 SAPA -- Nothing would change the 
Afrikaner Volksfront's [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] decision 
to boycott the elections unless there was finality on the 
volkstaat [homeland] issue, AVF leader Gen Constand Viljoen said 
on Saturday. Addressing a news conference in Pretoria after the 
rightwing transitional assembly's decision to boycott the 
elections, Gen Viljoen ruled out all possibility of continuing 
with the electoral process. 
  His dramatic 11th-hour registration of the Freedom Front on 
Friday night would be allowed to lapse and no candidate lists 
would be submitted, Gen Viljoen said. The "provisional" 
registration of the Freedom Front had been a "strategic option" 
to put to the transitional assembly but was rejected at the 
session. 
  The decision had not been taken unanimously but by a "vast 
majority." 
  Both Gen Viljoen and transitional assembly "President" Ferdi 
Hartzenberg denied there was a split looming in the AVF's ranks 
over the issue of going to the polls. 
  Gen Viljoen said he was happy with the rightwing 
transitional 
assembly's decision. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said the boycott would diminish the 
legitimacy 
of the polls and the AVF would not be part of subjecting the 
Afrikaner people to communist rule. Continued pressure would be 
placed on the polls, he added. They still wanted a plebiscite or 
a referendum to determine support for the volkstaat and its 
borders. 
  "I have an obsession to arrive at a position where my people 
will survive," the general added. International mediation was 
still an option and negotiations would carry on, he said. 
  Said Dr Hartzenberg: "We and others are not accommodated and 
the ball is in court of government and the African National 
Congress." 
  The borders of the volkstaat were not made known on 
Saturday, 
but the map had been distributed among transitional assembly 
members and would be discussed at a later stage, he added. 
  Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] 
leader Eugene Terreblanche also expressed his satisfaction with 
the decision. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said AVF Gen Constand Viljoen's decision to 
register the organisation on Friday night for the election was 
"good," but the assembly had considered all the benefits and 
drawbacks and decided not participate in the election. 
  Referring to the "provisional" registration for the polls by 
the Inkatha Freedom Party, an AVF Freedom Alliance [FA] partner, 
Dr Hartzenberg said the FA members were free to each make their 
own decision as to whether to participate in the poll. Different 
decisions would not affect the FA's unity, he said. 
  Dr Hartzenberg's announcement was applauded by rightwing 
supporters who attended the open session of the assembly's 
meeting in the Dutch Reformed Church synodal centre. All the 
leading rightwing figures, including the Mulder brothers, were 
present. Outside the venue, rightwingers displayed a banner 
criticising Gen Viljoen's provisional registration. It said 
participation in the election would amount to treason.

<F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring and Dirk van Eeden] </F>
  [Text] Rampant Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] 
leaders yesterday swept aside an attempt by former SADF [South 
African Defence Force] chief Constand Viljoen and his moderate 
generals to register a right-wing party for the April elections. 
  After a bitter nine-hour crisis meeting, in which numerous 
personal insults were directed at General Viljoen, hardline 
Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg announced 
triumphantly to rapturous applause: "We will not take part in 
the elections." 
  The crisis was sparked by a last-minute decision by General 
Viljoen to have included on the ballot an organisation known as 
the Freedom Front, with himself as leader. 
  He did so in response to the decision by the Inkatha Freedom 
Party -- the Volksfront's leading ally in the Freedom Alliance 
-- to register provisionally for the elections on Friday [4 
March] night. 
  General Viljoen said after yesterday's meeting he had 
registered for strategic purposes. It has been established that 
he did so without Dr Hartzenberg's blessing. 
  After the meeting's decision, however, General Viljoen said 
the registration of the front would now lapse. 
  The decision by the Volksraad -- the AVF's transitional 
parliament -- to allow the registration to lapse was taken by 73 
votes to 20 in a secret ballot insisted upon by CP MPs Corne and 
Pieter Mulder, part of General Viljoen's moderate faction. 
  Those who spoke in favour of the decision to register during 
the stormy meeting included Major-General Tienie Groenewald, 
Lieutenant-General Kobus Visser, Lieutenant-General Koos 
Bischoff, CP Cape leader Jan Hoon, the Mulder brothers and 
another CP MP, Petrus Groenewald. 
  General Viljoen said he would remain in the AVF and would 
abide by the decision. "I won't abandon the idea of a volkstaat 
[homeland]. I have an obsession to arrive at a point where my 
people will survive." 
  However, Dr Peter Mulder seemed resigned to the fact that he 
would not be returning to Parliament. 
  "There is a short route and a long route to obtaining a 
volkstaat. It now seems they want to take the long route," he 
said. "The decision went against us. But I'm a fighter; I will 
win in the end." 
  Dr Hartzenberg thanked General Viljoen for his "foresight in 
making the provisional registration". He had done so in the 
best interests of the organisation. But the election was not 
an acceptable test of support for the volkstaat idea, and the 
AVF was not prepared to give ligitimacy to the constitution by 
taking part. 
  The AVF, added Dr Hartzenberg, would continue to put 
pressure 
on the election in pursuit of the ideal of self-determination. 
It would also continue to press for a referendum to test 
support for a volkstaat. 
  Yesterday's decision, announced after the meeting held 
behind 
closed doors, followed a night of high drama on Friday. 
  For the Volksfront, founded on May 19 last year, it was the 
night of the generals, starting with a flurry of one-on-one 
meetings and ending with a late-night dash from Pretoria to the 
World Trade Centre in Kempton Park. 
  The generals -- Viljoen, Groenewald (former military 
intelligence [Counter Intelligence Division] chief), Visser 
(former CID chief) and Koos Bischoff (former SADF chief of 
staff, planning) -- learned of the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
decision to register provisionally for the elections on the 
SABC's [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 6PM news. 
  At 8PM, a small group of Volkfront employees crossed the 
street from their headquarters in Hatfield, Pretoria to watch 
the main news bulletin at a restaurant. 
  They were still not sure the IFP had "handed in the papers" 
at the World Trade Centre, and it was not until 9PM that they 
received confirmation that the IFP's Dr Frank Mdlalose had, in 
fact done so. 
  General Viljoen left the Volksfront headquarters at 8PM to 
keep an appointment with a foreign diplomat. When he returned 
30 minutes later, his face was strained. 
  Shortly before 9PM, General Groenewald arrived, followed 15 
minutes later by Afrikaner Volkswag [Afrikaner National Watch] 
leader Professor Carel Boshoff and CP MP for Pretoria West 
Joseph Chiole. Also at the meeting were the Mulder brothers. 
  At 9.17PM, a visibly agitated General Visser entered the 
building. 
  Just eight minutes later, General Viljoen, General Visser 
and 
Professor Boshoff left. Reliable sources said yesterday they 
had gone to Dr Hartzenberg's house. 
  What was said at that meeting is not known, but events moved 
swiftly from then on. 
  General Bischoff entered Volksfront headquarters at 9.40PM. 
At 9.58PM, Mr Chiole ran from the building and was heard to 
mutter "time is running out". 
  He returned soon afterwards, but at 10.56PM, he and 
Volksfront spokesman Stephan Manning left in a hurry, speeding 
off in Mr Chiole's red Alfa. 
  They were on their way to pick up a cheque for 
R[Rand]70,000, 
the amount needed to register the Vryheids-front -- Freedom 
Front -- for the polls. 
  General Viljoen, accompanied by Professor Boshoff, General 
Visser and General Bischoff, left for the World Trade Centre at 
11.01PM. 
  At some stage in the evening, sources said, General Viljoen 
consulted Dr Hartzenberg, who refused to agree to registration 
before the Friday midnight deadline. 
  He had pointed out that any decision to take part in the 
election would have to be taken by the Volksraad at its meeting 
yesterday afternoon. 
  General Viljoen impressed on Dr Hartzenberg that the 
chairman 
of the Independent Electoral Commission, Mr Justice Johan 
Kriegler, had said the deadline for registration was final and 
that a decision had to be taken immediately. 
  On arrival at the World Trade Centre, General Viljoen said 
he 
had come to talk to registration officials "to see if I can 
persuade them to let me hand in the papers and the cheque 
provisionally, subject to approval by the Volksraad". 
  He later issued a statement saying that due to the IFP's 
decision to register provisionally, he had realised freedom to 
exercise "the strategic options" of the Afrikaner people would 
be "severely restricted) if the right wing did not follow suit. 
  "Due to the limited time available, this decision could not 
be approved in advance by the Afrikaner Volksfront," he said.

  [Text] General Constand Viljoen's position as a leading 
figure in right-wing politics is under pressure. His dramatic 
eleventh hour registration of a new party for the election was 
rejected overwhelmingly yesterday in a secret vote by the 
decision-making structures of the National Front -- and he has 
apparently retreated. 
  But in political circles the big question this week is 
whether General Viljoen is going to sit back in the face of this 
setback. There is a possibility that he will submit a 
candidates' list of his new party -- the Freedom Front -- even 
before Wednesday [9 March] for participation in the election. 
If he does not do it, his registration will lapse. 
  In such a breakaway from the National Front, he could 
possibly be followed by at least six Conservative Party [CP] 
MP's who are known to be pro-election men and who have been 
pressuring the CP to participate. They are the brothers Pieter, 
MP for Schweizer-Reneke, and Corne Mulder, MP for Randfontein; 
Mr. Willem Botha, MP for Uitenhage; Mr. Joseph Chiole, MP for 
Pretoria West; Mr. Pieter Groenewald, MP for Stilfontein; and 
Mr. Leon Louw, MP for Welkom; Cape Province CP leader Jan Hoon's 
name was also mentioned in this regard. 
<H5>  Marathon Meetings </H5>
  Yesterday's drama in right-wing politics took place against 
the background of very tense marathon meetings which began at 
0700 and lasted until just before 1600. 
  The feeling among the majority of people, who had gathered 
from the early morning in front of the Synod Hall, was 
predominantly against General Viljoen. RAPPORT has even been 
told that arrangements were made for him to leave the hall 
through a side door in the event of tempers becoming so heated 
that his safety would have been in jeopardy. 
  General Viljoen, co-leader of the Afrikaner National Front, 
first came on the firing line during a morning session of the 
National Front's Executive Council and later the People's 
Representative Assembly. 
<H5>  Acted Unilaterally </H5>
  One thing that he was castigated for was acting unilaterally 
when he registered the Freedom Front as a party for the coming 
election on Friday night. This is probably the reason why the 
registration was not made in the name of the National Front. 
  While Constand Viljoen had informed CP leader and his 
co-leader in the National Front, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, late on 
Friday night that such party was going to be registered, at the 
end of it all he had acted against Dr. Hartzenberg's wishes. 
  At a news conference after yesterday's meeting, Dr. 
Hartzenberg did not want to commit himself on what he said to 
General Viljoen on Friday night. 
  General Viljoen's registration acts directly against the two 
previous decisions by the National Front -- one of them as 
recent as a week ago. Just this week Dr. Hartzenberg had even 
said that the CP would not participate in the election as there 
was "nothing new on the table." 
<H5>  Secret </H5>
  Notwithstanding the "official" mood within the National 
Front, plans to register were pursued secretly. This emerges 
from the fact that the new party's emblem had been designed some 
time ago, the forms had been ready for a while, and the 
necessary registration fee had already been raised. 
  Despite the intimate get-together between him and General 
Viljoen, yesterday Dr. Hartzenberg tried to hide the differences 
within the National Front while speaking in "parliament." He 
said General Viljoen had acted properly by registering the party 
as he had the interests of the National Front at heart. 
  "When he heard on Friday evening that the Inkatha Freedom 
Party had registered provisionally, he immediately went to 
register so that the National Front could get a chance to think 
about the matter at its leisure this morning. 
  "Since the government did not want to give us the 
opportunity 
to test our support in a plebiscite, but had instead insisted 
that this must be done in an election, the council stands by its 
decision of two weeks ago not to take part in the election." 
  The crisis in the National Front boiled over on Friday after 
an all-day meeting of the Front's Executive Council and attempts 
by the government and the ANC [African National Congress] to 
persuade General Viljoen to participate in the elections. 
  By Friday night, while the clock for registration was 
ticking 
away minute by minute, a storm was raging inside the National 
Front's inner circles. 
  It was ultimately the late night decision by the Inkatha 
Freedom Party to register that brought the pro-election members 
in thee National Front into motion and that culminated in Gen. 
Viljoen's dramatic journey to Kempton Park. 
As of press time, there was as yet no consensus on a map for a 
proposed Afrikaner homeland. A week ago instructions had been 
given for such a map to be drawn up as this would strengthen the 
National Front's claim for such a homeland.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 6 SAPA -- Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front, AVF] members had not entirely surrendered their 
efforts to persuade hardliners to take part in the April 
elections, AVF co-chairman Tienie Groenewald said on Sunday [6 
March]. "There will be more efforts to convince people in the 
AVF that we should keep our options open," Gen Groenewald said. 
  "There is little chance that the AVF as a front will 
register. But I don't think the matter has been put on ice," he 
said. 
  The AVF decided on Saturday not to register for the 
elections 
after its leader Constand Viljoen had registered a Freedom Front 
for the poll. His decision was prompted by the move by the AVF's 
Freedom Alliance partner, the Inkatha Freedom Party, to register. 
  Gen Groenewald said it was no secret that some AVF members 
supported taking part in the election ane that they would 
continue efforts to get the election boycotters round to their 
point of view. He said Monday's meeting with the alliance 
partners -- Bophuthatswana and the IFP -- would help determine 
the AVF's course of action. 
  If the registration of the Freedom Front is allowed to 
lapse, 
the AVF may be the only alliance party staying out of the 
election. In an indication that it was preparing to register, 
Bophuthatswana has arranged for a late registration if the 
homeland's cabinet decides on Monday to join the elections. 
  Gen Groenewald said the AVF would also be examining what 
results international mediation may be able to deliver. 
  He said talks with the African National Congress on a 
political accord on a volkstaat [homeland] would continue. He 
said more successful talks on the issue on Friday might have 
secured AVF registration by giving Gen Viljoen something with 
which to convince his followers of the need to take part in the 
poll.

  [Text] This morning's CITIZEN newspaper reports a plot to 
assassinate Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader 
Constand Viljoen if he continues his efforts to take the front 
into the election. The plot allegedly has its origin in 
militant groups within the Volksfront who are violently opposed 
to the election. The shock revelations come after a weekend of 
drama which saw General Viljoen registering the front without 
the go ahead of its executive. The registration was later 
withdrawn.

<F P=106> [Report by N Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 7 SAPA--Neither the police nor 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] spokesman Stephen 
Maninger could confirm reports on Monday [7 March] of a plot to 
assassinate AVF Chairman Gen Constand Viljoen. 
  The threat reportedly emanates from the right-wing's 
militant 
factions which oppose AVF leaders' initiatives to participate in 
the elections and to continue negotiations for a "volkstaat" 
[homeland]. 
  A report in a morning newspaper, THE CITIZEN, said AVF 
transitional president Ferdi Hartzenberg was shocked by news of 
the plot, and that hitherto slack security for Gen Viljoen would 
be improved. 
  The AVF's transitional representative assembly on Saturday 
took a majority decision to reject an option to participate in 
the elections, secured by Gen Viljoen when he registered a 
Freedom Front party for such purposes. AVF Gen Tienie 
Groenewald said on Monday the debate on possible participation 
would continue as long as it was possible to keep alive Gen 
Viljoen's provisional registration of the party. 
  Pointing to the considerable "no" vote in the elections, 
observers said the right wing could count on enough electoral 
support to secure a number of parliamentary seats. 
  Serving Conservative Party MPs and liberal AVF elements may 
argue that those seats should be filled by AVF members -- even 
as a "tactical breakaway" grouping from the AVF -- rather than 
to let them fall to the National Party or Democratic Party. 
  In Mmabatho on Monday, President Lucas Mangope's cabinet 
will 
decide whether to participate in the April elections. 
  Speaking on Radio 702 on Monday, the Freedom Alliance 
Chairman and Bophuthatswana Minister of State Rowan Cronje 
declined to be drawn on the outcome of the cabinet meeting, or 
on what effect labour unrest in Bophuthatswana had had on the 
homeland government's thinking.

  [Text] The president of Bophuthatswana, Mr. Lucas Mangope, 
says his party will not register for the elections until 
international mediation has been called in to help resolve the 
problems surrounding the constitution. 
  The Bophuthatswanan cabinet will meet on Monday to make a 
final decision on the issue. The cabinet meeting will also 
discuss the present strike by Bop [Bophuthatswana] civil 
servants which has virtually paralyzed the civil service. The 
civil servants are striking over pension pay-outs and salaries. 
They are also demanding the resignation of the director general 
of the broadcast services of Bophuthatswana. 
  President Mangope said he could not blame civil servants for 
being concerned about their money falling into the hands of a 
new South African Government. He said the South African 
Government, in partnership with the ANC [African National 
Congress], could not be trusted with his people's pension funds. 
He said the only way for civil servants to receive their 
pension money was to resign. 
  President Mangope was opening the ruling Christian 
Democratic 
Party Youth Congress in Mmabatho this morning.

  [Text] Pretoria March 5 SAPA -- If Bophuthatswana wished to 
register for the election, the government would be prepared to 
negotiate with the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] and 
Transitional Executive Council to make the necessary 
arrangements for the postponement of registration. 
Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said this in a 
statement on Saturday [5 March], after talks with the homeland 
government about the possibility of it entering the election. 
  Welcoming the registration by the Inkatha Freedom Party and 
the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front], through the 
Vryheidsfront [Freedom Front], Mr Meyer said the government was 
still waiting for the African National Congress's 
recommendations about international mediation. "Aspects that 
must still be cleared out include the aims of international 
mediation, how it will be embraced, how long-winded it will be 
regarding the constitution itself, what the process and 
structure will be and who will be invited to become involved in 
it." 
  Mr Meyer said once it had been established what 
recommendations had been made, the government would be able to 
give attention to the matter. "The government still believes 
specific recommendations about the improvement of the 
constitution can still be achieved in direct negotiations 
between parties, and that international mediation is not 
necessary. Negotiations emanating from agreements between 
involved parties will honoured, with an eye open for amendments 
to the constitution by the new parliament, after elections."

<F P=106> [Report by Enrico Kemp] </F>
  [Text] Pietersburg March 6 SAPA -- African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela has proposed extending 
the registration date for the April elections in order to 
include parties still outside the process. 
  Addressing about 20,000 people at a rally to commemorate 
International Women's Day at the Pietersburg Stadium on Sunday 
[6 March], he said there would be no peace if some political 
players remained outside the transitional process. "I am still 
prepared to talk to those who refuse to register. I have said I 
am prepared to go down on my knees to ensure peace in the 
country," he said. 
  Mr Mandela said he would urge the ANC, its allies and the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to accept his proposal 
that there should be no deadlines regarding registration for the 
elections. "Even after Friday night, absolute patience and the 
ability to understand the fears of others." 
  Earlier Mr Mandela said there were people who were prepared 
to contribute to building a new South Africa, but whose efforts 
had been rebuffed. "These are temporary setbacks to such men of 
integrity and vision and they should not be discouraged. The 
future does not belong to a minority that wants to cling to 
outdated policies, but belongs to those who have vision and 
courage." 
  Thousands of people from all over the Northern Transvaal 
packed the stadium to hear the ANC leader's address. Mr Mandela 
was applauded wildly when he arrived at the stadium on the back 
of a bakkie [pickup] and briefly walked along the stands waving 
and smiling at the crowd. 
  Later on Sunday he will travel to Magoebaskloof where he is 
scheduled to meet Chief Samuel Nxumalo of Gazankulu's Ximoko 
People's Progressive Party.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 7 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana's 
cabinet, faced with the one of the biggest decisions in its 
16-year-history, began meeting on Monday [7 March] morning to 
decide whether to register for the April elections, a source at 
President Lucas Mangope's Office said. 
  The meeting is against a background of a civil service 
strike 
that threatens to cripple the homeland as strikers demand the 
return of their pension contributions and re-incorporation into 
South Africa. 
  The cabinet must decide whether to register alongside its 
Freedom Alliance partner, the Inkatha Freedom Party, and 
Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front. 
  Although the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front], of which 
Gen Viljoen is chairman, decided on Saturday against 
registration, the Freedom Front could still participate in the 
elections. Attempts are being made to persuade moderates to 
follow through with the registration. 
  Hopes for Bophuthatswana's inclusion in the electoral 
process 
were further boosted when African National Congress President 
Nelson Mandela said in Pietersburg on Sunday that the deadline 
for registration could be extended. 
  A spokesman for the Office of Minister of Constitutional 
Development Roelf Meyer said on Monday that if the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] would accept the registration of 
Bophuthatswana's ruling Christian Democratic Party on Monday 
afternoon, "the government will not obstruct that". He said any 
objection to the late registration would be based on practical 
rather than political objections. "Whatever the IEC can 
accommodate, that will be okay with the government," the 
spokesman said. 
  A Bophuthatswana government source said a representative 
would be flown to Johannesburg to register if the cabinet 
decided on participation.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 7 SAPA -- The Bophuthatswana cabinet 
on Monday [7 March] morning decided against participating in the 
April elections, a Bophuthatswana government spokesman said. 
"The Bophuthatswana cabinet decided it was opposed to 
registering for the South African elections in April. The 
cabinet also decided the matter should be addressed by a full 
sitting of the Bophuthatswana Parliament. A special full 
parliamentary sitting has been called for Tuesday, March 15," 
spokesman Alwyn Viljoen said. 
  The decision was taken at a special cabinet meeting on 
Monday 
morning in the midst of a civil service strike that is 
threatening to cripple the homeland. President Lucas Mangope 
went from the meeting to a government building where he was due 
to address striking teachers and health workers. 
  Earlier he told strikers that if they wanted to continue 
their strike they should go home. Only government workers at 
management level had remained at their posts by Monday 
lunchtime, a government source said. The strikers are demanding 
that their pensions be paid out and that Bophuthatswana be 
re-incorporated into South Africa. 
  Bophuthatswana's decision does not necessarily disqualify 
its 
ruling Christian Democratic Party from participating in the 
elections. Both government and African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela have indicated the deadline for 
registration could be shifted. However, the Independent 
Electoral Commission has said practical considerations made late 
registrations difficult. 
  Bophuthatswana arrived at its decision as its Freedom 
Alliance partners -- the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front] -- began meeting in Pretoria to 
devise the alliance's approach to international mediation of 
South Africa's constitutional dispute.

  [Text] Umtata March 5 SAPA -- The United Nations should be 
asked to mediate in South Africa's constitutional crisis African 
National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela said on Saturday. 
Speaking to about 12,000 people at an ANC rally in Umtata he 
also welcomed the Inkatha Freedom Party and Afrikaner 
Volksfront's [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] move to register 
for the elections as "one of the most exciting decisions of the 
past few days". 
  The ANC had accepted the principle of international 
mediation 
but still had to discuss it with the 29 political parties which 
had now registered, "and I have no doubt we will be able to 
resolve that question," he said. "Thinking on mediation should 
not centre on individuals, or organisations linked to a 
particular country. 
  "We must think in terms of experienced international 
organisations which will set up a structure which will deal with 
the question of a constitution, violence and peace." 
  South Africa was going to be a member of the United Nations, 
the Organisation of African Unity, the Commonwealth and the 
non-aligned movement and was going to have a very close 
relationship with the European Community. "These are the 
organisations that must be entrusted with the task of 
international mediation. 
  "All of them are members of the UN organisation and if we 
deal with that body then the international community as a whole 
will be involved. 
  "I will go to any meeting where we are going to negotiate 
this issue with the suggestion we should trust this important 
task to an organisation of which we are going to be members and 
which have enormous experience in these types of mediations." 
  Welcoming the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and AVF 
registration decision he said "these are leaders who like us are 
thinking in terms of serving South Africa." The ANC might differ 
with them on number of issues but deciding to register for the 
election they were making it possible for the process to be all 
inclusive and were giving the people of South Africa a wider 
choice on who should represent them in government. 
  "Our idea is one of a government of national unity which 
will 
give the perspective of unity and the more parties that 
register, the more it will be possible for us to have a credible 
and legitemate government of national unity."

  [Excerpts] Durban March 6 SAPA -- Groups of killers swept 
through an African National Congress [ANC] stronghold in the 
war-torn Bhambayi shack settlement north of Durban late on 
Saturday [5 March] night, leaving a trail of blood and 
confusion. There were conflicting reports as to the number of 
people killed, with residents saying eight people were dead and 
seven were injured, while police said 11 were murdered. 
  What prompted the killings mystified residents, but a local 
ANC leader attributed them to the ongoing conflict between the 
rival "red" and "green" gangs, linked to the ANC and Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] respectively. 
  Residents in the ANC strongholds of Angola and Cuba -- an 
area of about 3km square -- reported that gunmen attacked 
different homes between 10 pm and midnight. [passage omitted] 
  Saturday's killing spree was probably aimed at stirring up 
conflict in the area and linked to rivalry between the reds and 
the greens. 
  Mr Blose [ANC's "office bearer in the area"] said Cuba and 
Angola had been peaceful recently and the last killings had been 
in adjoining Congo in January when nine people died. Black SA 
Defence Force soldiers who spoke Zulu should be deployed to keep 
the peace as joint ANC/IFP/police monitoring of the area had 
shown limited results, said Mr Blose. 
  He said Saturday's attacks would probably lead to an 
escalation of violence in Bhambayi, where more than 250 lives 
have been lost since conflict erupted in late 1992. 
  The settlement appeared calm on Sunday.

  [Text] Durban March 6 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday [6 March] 
called for the disbanding of the SA Police's Internal Stability 
Division [ISD]. Reacting to the killing of 11 people in Bhambayi 
north of Durban on Saturday evening, Mr Ramaphosa claimed the 
ISD was responsible for the death of thousands of people 
throughout the country. 
  The ANC would not only demand the withdrawal of the ISD from 
the townships, but that it be completely disbanded, he said. Mr 
Ramaphosa and other regional ANC leaders were to visit Bhambayi 
on Sunday afternoon.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 6 SAPA -- The latest killings in 
Bhambayi, north of Durban, were a grim warning that the 
intolerance of African National Congress [ANC] and Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] supporters would deprtve people of freely 
exercising their democratic right of choice during the 
elections, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said on Sunday [6 
March]. Reacting to the murder of at least eight people in the 
squatter settlement, Mr Kriel said continuing violence showed 
the ANC and IFP leadership cared only about power and not about 
people's lives. 
  Both organisations had had years to end their power struggle 
but their leaders had only used people's lives as pawns in their 
power game. "The ANC and IFP pay only lip service to peace and 
democracy but have done nothing to control their supporters," 
said Mr Kriel in a statement issued to SAPA.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 7 SAPA -- ANC [African National 
Congress] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa's claim that the 
Internal Stability Division [ISD] was responsible for the death 
of thousands of people was a "blatant lie", Minister of Law and 
Order Hernus Kriel said on Monday [7 March]. He was reacting to 
charges by the ANC leader at a Natal election rally that the ISD 
should disband, following the massacre of 11 people on Saturday 
night in Bhambayi, north of Durban. 
  The call showed how blind the ANC was to the real causes of 
violence, Mr Kriel said. "This attitude can only inflict more 
death and misery on the people because while Mr Ramaphosa and 
the ANC waste time and energy falsely blaming the SA Police, the 
true causes of violence go unaddressed." Mr Ramaphosa should 
address the real causes of violence -- political intolerance and 
control of supporters, instead of throwing away the opportunity 
to work for peace at grassroots level, Mr Kriel added.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  "Crumbling of the Freedom Alliance" -- The Johannesburg 
SUNDAY TIMES in English on 6 March in a page-22 editorial states 
that "the crumbling of the Freedom Alliance on Friday has 
demonstrated the relentless power of the underlying political 
forces that are reshaping this country: neither the Inkatha 
Freedom Party, nor the white right wing, and least of all 
Bophuthatswana, can withstand the pressure." "The immediate 
source of pressure, of course, is the election, with its 
necessary deadlines." "However, the truly relentless pressures 
lie deeper, beyond the reach of mere politicians, and it has 
been these underlying pressures that came into play, especially 
in Bophuthatswana, this week." "The people who have all but 
brought down Mangope's regime are South Africa's hidden actors. 
They are million of ordinary black folk who destroyed 
apartheid, and in whose hands the destiny of South Africa 
lies.....they, and not President de Klerk and his reformers, 
ended apartheid." In conclusion the paper writes that "South 
Africa needs only political stability and reasonably sensible 
economic policies to burst out of the stagnation of the past 
three decades, and the elections are the first, necessary, step 
towards stability. At the same time, there is an vital role for 
men like Chief Buthelezi and General Viljoen to play in 
fashioning the final constitution, in curbing the lust for power 
which is evident in the ANC [African National Congress], and in 
ensuring representation for the widest range of views in 
Parliament. Welcome them to the fray." 
<H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>
  IFP Registration for Election -- "Inkatha Freedom Party 
(IFP) 
leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's decision to `provisionally' 
register for the elections, should be treated with caution," 
begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 6 March in a 
page-6 editorial. "It should be remembered that before his 
meeting with ANC leader, Nelson Mandela, he shot down the whole 
idea of participating in the elections." Buthelezi's 
"vacillation" "simply deepens the opinion of political observers 
who have found Buthelezi to be a man who is simply interested in 
shifting goalposts to avoid the elections at all costs. 
Creating an uncertainty about the future has been one of the 
effective instruments in creating tension in the black 
townships. This has also planted fertile seeds of political 
violence and wanton criminal acts of lawlessness." "While the 
ANC's commitment to an all-inclusive settlement is commendable, 
Buthelezi should not be allowed to delay the long-awaited 
elections for his personal reasons." "ANC and the government 
should not bend over backwards for Buthelezi anymore. Now is 
the time to go forward with or without him." 
  TEC Standstill Criticized -- In a second editorial on the 
same page, the SUNDAY NATION reports that "with less than two 
months to go before the April 27 election, the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] seems unable to perform its tasks 
adequately." "As things stand now, the TEC has been unable to 
reassure people in Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu-Natal about" 
whether or not they will be able to vote. Additionally, items 
brought before the TEC are "never finalised immediately after 
presentation. They are often referred to later sittings. 
Occasionally the TEC has had to wait until certain situations 
were out of control before taking a decision." Concluding the 
SUNDAY NATION writes that "the TEC really needs to jack up if we 
are to continue having confidence in it. We want to believe 
that there is no better structure to turn to during this 
transition. But the TEC should sharpen its teeth and take its 
rightful place in the hearts of our people." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  ANC Propaganda Machine Running Out of Steam -- A page-22 
editorial in RAPPORT of 6 March in Afrikaans writes that in the 
Western Cape the ANC "is no longer so talkative, and in Natal 
this week it was dealt two stiff blows." President F. W. de 
Klerk's visit to this province and the type of reception 
accorded him should be something that not only Mr. Nelson 
Mandela "should sit up and take note of, but also the communist 
archenemy, Mr. Harry Gwala. Even those opinion polls that 
predict a runaway victory for the ANC have been more cautious 
lately. The premature ANC choruses of demands and those big 
promises also seem to have taken -- hopefully for good -- a back 
seat." Mr. de Klerk's campaigning had resounding successes 
among the Indian and colored populations in Natal where he made 
no attempt to glorify the National Party's past mistakes, but 
instead asked for forgiveness. "But," he asked, "has the ANC 
ever said sorry for its wrong deeds? Has it become a new 
party?" The second blow for the ANC was Mr. Mandela's meeting 
with Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The ANC propaganda machine had 
tried to make it appear as if it were the biggest gesture of 
reconciliation and a victory for Mr. Mandela. "With dubious 
success." It is no longer a question of what did Mr. Mandela 
say to Mr. Buthelezi to change his mind, but rather "what did 
Mr. Buthelezi say to Mr. Mandela to make him sing a different 
tune?" Mr. Mandela's grim face after the meeting told a story. 
"The shrewd Mr. Buthelezi had unmasked Mr. Mandela and the 
ANC's propaganda."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Call for International Mediation Welcome -- Johannesburg THE 
CITIZEN in English on 4 March in its page-6 editorial welcomes 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi's call for international mediation to 
resolve the constitutional impasse. "To our mind, the 
government should accept mediation, and the ANC [African 
National Congress] should consider delaying the election for a 
short period" to achieve an inclusive settlement. 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Right Wing `Myopic Blunder' To Withdraw Election 
Registration 
-- "The Afrikaner Volksfront's [National Front -- AVF] decision 
to overrule the grouping's provisional registration for next 
month's election is a myopic blunder which could have grave 
consequences both for South Africa and the right-wing cause 
itself," notes a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English on 7 March. By repudiating Viljoen, "the AVF has shown 
that it is a deeply divided organisation. It has done further 
harm to its cause by implicitly dissociating itself from the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party], which registered provisionally for the 
election only a couple of hours before Viljoen." "History is 
likely to judge the AVF's decision to opt for the boycott route 
harshly. Had the Freedom Alliance contested the election as an 
electoral alliance -- an option which Viljoen made possible by 
registering the AVF as the Freedom Front -- it might have 
succeeded in forcing the NP [National Front] into third place 
after the ANC and itself. As the second most powerful bloc in 
the new parliament, the alliance would have been in a strong 
position to advance its cause within the new constitution." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Warning Against Government-Business Cooperation -- "Tokyo 
Sexwale's call for a `chorus of advice' from the business 
community is welcome evidence that the ANC has no doubts that 
government and business must co-operate if South Africa is to 
manage the rapid economic development we need," notes a page-8 
editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 7 March. 
"But Sexwale and his party must be alive to the danger of that 
`chorus of advice' degenerating into self-interest lobbying." 
BUSINESS DAY points out that the National Party held regular 
talks with business which resulted in a relationship "that 
relied on political favours, the distortions of protectionism, 
secret loans and so on. It was a relationship that allowed many 
businesses to hide behind incomplete disclosure, which was 
regularly justified as being `in the national interest'." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  Mandela-Buthelezi Meeting Emits `Conflicting Signals' -- 
Cape 
Town CAPE TIMES in English on 3 March in a page-8 editorial 
finds it "difficult to read" the meeting between Nelson Mandela 
and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi "amid the 
welter of apparently conflicting signals going out to the world, 
with Chief Buthelezi one minute appearing to entertain the idea 
of Inkatha registering as a party and contesting the election -- 
and the next minute preaching an alarming, explosive brand of 
Zulu nationalism and insisting that failure to recognise the 
sovereignty of the kingdom of kwaZulu would have dire 
consequences in `Zulu anger'."

understanding concerning a very important role by a free press 
that would serve the whole nation. Obviously, decentralization 
is a very important point. We have not reached complete 
agreement on that score yet, but we have covered more than three 
quarters of the ground needed to achieve that goal. 
  As for the issue of participation by UNITA deputies in the

deputies who will be in Parliament, those who will be in 
government -- at whatever level -- and those who will be working 
in other areas. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What about the government posts

  [Text] Army General Abilio Kamalata Numa, chief of staff 
for the northern front, says Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola [MPLA] troops are trying to enter diamond rich areas 
of Lunda Province. 
  Gen. Numa said a huge motorized column left Dondo for 
N'Dalatando a few hours ago. The column consists of more than 
2,000 men, 13 tanks, 12 TM bridgelayers, four B-30 guns, two 
IL-46 guns, six AG-17 rocket launchers, and 20 logistical and 
personnel carriers. Two Mi- 25 helicopters stationed in 
Cambamba and several fighter bombers stationed in Luanda are 
also part of the column. Gen. Numa said the ongoing offensive 
is aimed at the civilian residents of N'Dalatando. 
  Turning to Bengo Province, Gen. Numa said the Luanda 
government is also involved in an offensive in that province. 
He said People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FAPLA] units intend to take the District of Quibaxe in order to 
establish a support base to mount an attack on Uige. He said 
heavy clashes are taking place in Ucua District, and National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces are 
fighting bravely. Heavy MPLA troop movements have been reported 
in Muxaluando area of Bengo Province. FAPLA forces have been 
ordered to head to Vista Alegre and N'Zeto. Fierce clashes are 
also taking place on the Ambriz-N'Zeto axis. 
  Gen. Numa said the MPLA-Labor Party is being assisted by 
Katangese mercenaries, many of whom have been captured. As a 
whole, Gen. Numa said he is confident that UNITA forces will 
succeed.

  [Text] Ulundi March 4 SAPA -- The Inkatha Fredom Party 
[IFP] on Friday decided to conditionally register for South 
Africa's first all-race election in April. 
  The IFP said any further steps in its participation in the 
electoral process would be conditional on mediation to try to 
resolve outstanding consttational differences, mediation on 
amendng the 1993 constitution "and rationalisng the electoral 
process and timetable to translate constitutional agreements 
into a fair and free election in which all parties can compete 
on an equal footing". 
  Mediation had also to relate to whatever steps Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini might decide upon to secure the interests of 
the kingdom of kwaZulu, the IFP decided. It added that mediation 
was also required on the constitutional resolution and the 
investigation of criminal violence. 
  The IFP said it would inform leaders of its partners in the 
Freedom Alliance of its decision and would "seek their agreement 
and co-operation in developing a satisfactory way forward".

<F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Ulundi March 4 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] on Friday [4 March] said it would register for the April 
elections but would only contest the poll pending mediation on 
amending the constitution and rationalising electoral timetables. 
  This emerged after a six-hour IFP Central Committee meeting 
in Ulundi during which IFP Chairman Frank Mdlalose was 
authorised to travel to the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park 
to register the party in terms of the electoral act before 
midnight on Friday. 
  But, the IFP stressed, registration did not imply any change 
in its basic negotiation position and should not be construed as 
acceptance of the amended interim constitution. The party would 
only contest the elections after mediation on constitutional 
differences and the electoral process and timetables. 
  The IFP was not demanding a postponement of the April 26-28 
elections, but wanted mediation on this deadline to ensure all 
parties could contest elections on an equal footing, said 
Central Committee member Mr T C Memela. 
  IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi told reporters at a 
briefing he would only begin electioneering once there had been 
mediation. "There's no point in campaigning under this 
constitution, which we reject, before it's amended. 
  "We have stated categorically we are not prepared to 
participate in the election under this constitution as it 
stands, without amendments being accepted." 
  An IFP resolution said the party would inform leaders of its 
Freedom Alliance partners about its decision and seek their 
agreement and co-operation in developing a satisfactory way 
forward. 
  It was also decided that mediation should also be related to 
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's demands for sovereignty and the 
party assured the monarch it would not prejudice any of his 
negotiation position during mediation. 
  While Mr Buthelezi said the process leading to mediation had 
not yet got off the ground, he noted that the African National 
Congress [ANC] had accepted the principle and was ready to begin 
discussion with the IFP as soon as possible. 
  To this end, ANC Deputy Secretary General Jacob Zuma would 
lead a delegation in talks with the IFP.

Angola [UNITA] has once again attacked Portugal. The UNITA 
commander in northern Angola today accused Portuguese marines of 
fighting alongside Angolan government troops in the struggle to 
retake positions in the oil-rich areas. In Portugal, the navy 
has denied this. According to Commander Camilo Alves there are 
no serving marines fighting on Angolan territory. 
  [Begin Alves recording] First, we are not aware of the

made a rare public appearance, attending a church service in the 
city of Blantyre. Dr. Banda went to a Roman Catholic church to 
commemorate those killed during the campaign for independence 
from Britain. Dr. Banda, who is officially in his late 80s, but 
widely believed to be much older, underwent brain surgery in 
South Africa last year. He returned home in October and was 
last seen in public on 1 January. Dr. Banda has ruled Malawi

  [Text] The unarmed opposition parties have accused the 
government of edging out and discriminating against political 
parties by not permitting their effective participation in the 
elections scheduled for October. In a memorandum submitted to 
the president of the republic, the opposition parties say under 
the prevailing conditions it is difficult for them to take part 
in the elections on an equal footing with the Mozambique 
Liberation Front and the Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo]. The memorandum says the government has no right to 
monopolize the State General Budget, alleging that the budget 
comes from tax payers, including members of the unarmed 
political parties. 
  The political parties rejected what they described as Renamo 
maneuvers designed to divide the country into two occupied 
areas. The parties demanded the immediate abolition of so-called 
Renamo areas and their rapid reintegration into state 
administration. 
  Speaking to newsmen after he received the memorandum, the 
president of the republic said he believed the unarmed 
opposition parties will not demand an immediate response to 
their grievances because these require an in-depth assessment of 
the situation. Joaquim Chissano said it is necessary for the 
country's leading forces to work closely. 
  Yesterday's meeting was requested by the unarmed political 
parties.

  [Text] Bujumbura, March 7 (AFP) - Up to 200 people were 
killed in weekend clashes with ethnic overtones between 
civilians and soldiers in an outlying district of Bujumbura, 
Radio Burundi reported Monday [7 March]. Witnesses said some 20 
bodies were brought out of the northern Kamenge district after 
fighting between civilians mainly of the Hutu majority, and the 
powerful army, which largely comprises the Tutsi minority. 
  Police said 40 people had been killed but the interior 
ministry said the death toll could be as high as 200, the radio 
said. Humanitarian aid sources said some of the civilians had 
firearms. 
  The rest of the capital was quiet, but the situation has 
been 
extremely unstable in Burundi since a section of the army 
mounted an unsuccessful coup in October against the Hutu 
government elected the previous June, killing President Melchior 
Ndadaye. An estimated 100,000 people were killed in ethnic 
clashes after the coup attempt and another 700,000 fled the 
country. 
  The reason for the latest shooting, which began Friday and 
intensified Saturday, was still unknown. 
  Two Italian doctors with the Belgian arm of the Medecins 
Sans 
Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) organisation were wounded 
Saturday as they drove through the district in a car, aid 
sources said. They said the atmosphere in Kamenge was still 
very tense, adding that the use of firearms by civilians is a 
comparatively recent phenomenon. 
  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it 
had evacuated three wounded people from the district Monday, on 
top of four brought out Saturday.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Interior and National Security Minister </F>
Jean-Claude Dobanga Boti in Bangui on 6 March--recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, dear fellow citizens. The 
Central African Republic has installed political democracy. It 
has become a state where there is the rule of law. Since his 
investiture, the elected president of the Republic has always 
preached dialogue with all the social and political groups of 
the nation. He has made social justice and dialogue the 
watchwords of his national policy. Unfortunately, this political 
will for reconciliation and national reconstruction is not 
accepted by a good number of Central Africans. 
  As the minister of interior and national security, and to 
support the head of state's policy, I have continued to receive 
in my office some lost sons of the country who deliberately take 
pleasure in acts of social agitation and socio-political 
upheavals. Despite my appeals for order and national unity, I 
have observed and recorded facts of partisan dissentions and 
disorders, marked by (?obscene) and irresponsible demonstrations 
organized by small groups still pining for an era fresh in the 
minds; an ear which supported the very people who caused its 
fall [words indistinct] arms. Some people have organized 
hotbeds in some areas in the capital with the sole aim of 
disturbing public peace and disrupting the smooth running of our 
democratic and republican institutions. These hotbeds are 
marked by acts of aggression against strangers and French 
technical assistants. These are innocent targets who are faced 
with armed attacks in their homes. 
  All these purely barbaric acts only aim at destabilizing the 
democratically elected and recently installed government. 
Considering the manifest dishonesty insincerity of these [word 
indistinct] agitators (?sponsored and trained) by [words 
indistinct] which mistake democracy with anarchy, I make it my 
duty, as the minister in charge of our country's internal 
security and guarantor of public order and (?peace), to make a 
public appeal to the national and international community. I 
appeal to the organizations for the defense of human rights to 
witness this situation. I cannot continue to tolerate such acts 
of political agitation, social upheavals, and public disorder in 
a state where there is the rule of law. 
  As the minister of interior and national security, I have 
the 
duty to install state authority in order to guarantee the 
regalia of a democratic state. So, beginning with this warning, 
I am giving firm instructions to the competent police to ask 
them to ensure, in the implementation of the country's laws, 
that all the (?enemies) of democracy are exposed. Thank you.

  [Text] Chad and Libya are still seeking to reach an 
agreement on Libya's withdrawal from the Aozou Strip. Delegates 
of the two countries have been meeting in Ndjamena since 4 March 
without reaching an agreement. The Libyan delegation is even 
asking for the postponement of the meeting. Lucien Mpoungui 
reports: 
  [Begin Mpoungui recording] During the discussions, the 
Chadian delegation proposed the examination and drawing up of an 
agreement on a timetable for the withdrawal of the Libyan 
Administration and Army from the Aozou Strip following the 
recent verdict of the International Court of Justice of The 
Hague, which asserts that the more than 14,000 square km of 
territory belongs to Chad. In fact, the Libyans are calling for 
the postponement of the deliberations because they consider that 
before examining the withdrawal issue, the implementation of the 
framework agreement signed in Algiers in 1991 must be completed. 
In the said agreement, the two parties essentially undertook to 
respect the verdict of the international court of justice. 
  Libya is reportedly demanding, in exchange for the return of 
the Aozou Strip to Chad, the repatriation of 500 Libyan 
prisoners in the United States. The Chadian delegation has said 
that the decision of the UN court is binding on the two parties 
and that its implementation cannot be subject to any 
precondition. Thus, despite long discussions the delegations 
stuck to their positions, whereas in the wake of the 
announcement of the Hague court, Colonel al- Qadhdhafi said the 
Chad-Libya dispute had come to an end. 
  According to last minute reports, the Ndjamena talks on the 
Aozou Strip have been postponed and no date has been announced 
for their possible resumption. [end recording]

  [Text] Ndjamena, 7 Mar (AFP) -- The Chadian-Libyan talks in 
Ndjamena over Tripoli's withdrawal from the Aozou Strip "have 
failed," Chadian Interior Minister Abderamane Izzo Miskine said 
today following the adjournment of the talks. He was speaking 
at a news conference. Asked to comment about a possible 
resumption of the discussions, the minister was skeptical 
stating that in his views the talks were "a failure" because 
they did not attain their goal. Adding that Chad remained "open 
to dialogue," Mr. Izzo stated that "we shall no longer hesitate 
on the legal means to recover our land," meaning that his 
country might go to the UN Security Council to force Libya to 
evacuate the Aozou Strip following the 3 February ruling by the 
International Court of Justice [ICJ] at The Hague. This decision 
reaffirmed Chad's sovereignty over this desert territory 
situated at the border between the two countries and occupied by 
Libya for more than 20 years. "The Chadian delegation has noted 
that the Libyans are simply refusing to discuss any question 
relating to the implementation of that ruling, preferring to 
drown this crucial matter in a multitude of redundant issues," 
Mr. Izzo explained. 
  The two Chadian and Libyan delegations this morning 
adjourned 
their discussions which began on 4 March as soon as Libyan 
President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi announced that the conflict was 
"settled for good" by the ICJ's ruling. According to a Chadian 
communique, the talks were stalled following Libya's intention 
to demand the implementation of a general agreement signed by 
the two countries in Algiers in 1989. "Considering that the 
Algiers general agreement has become completely redundant, Chad 
rejected this proposal which constitutes an unacceptable 
condition," Mr. Izzo added. In addition to the implementation 
of the Algiers general agreement which provides, in particular, 
for the release of war prisoners, the Libyan delegation "pressed 
for" the signing of "a treaty of cooperation and good 
neighborliness before the implementation of the ruling," the 
minister said. The Libyan delegation also said it was competent 
to decide the withdrawal or the timetable saying that this 
"issue can only be solved by technicians," Mr. Izzo stated. He 
described the Libyan demands as "a diversion." The Libyan 
delegation was received today by President Idriss Deby for talks 
on which no details were given.

  [Text] Ndjamena, March 7 (AFP)--Negotiations on a 
withdrawal of Libyan troops from the disputed Aouzou Strip in 
northern Chad have broken down, Chadian Interior Minister 
Abderamane Izzo said Monday [7 March]. 
  Last week Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi said the 
dispute between Tripoli and Ndjamena over the territory "was 
definitively over" following a decision on February 3 by the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague which recognised 
Chadian sovereignty over the strip. 
  Libyan troops have occupied the virtually empty territory 
for 
more than 20 years. 
  The two countries have often clashed militarily over the 
land, a remote strip of 114,000 square kilometres (45,600 square 
miles) reputed to contain substantial deposits of uranium and 
manganese. 
  Izzo accused the Libyan delegation here of evading the issue 
of a troop withdrawal by "drowning this crucial question in a 
mass of diffuse problems." 
  He told a press conference that he was doubtful the talks 
which began Friday would resume. The negotiations had failed to 
achieve their purpose, he said. 
  "We will not beat about the bush any more over the legal 
means for recovering our land," Izzo said, hinting that Ndjamena 
could appeal to the UN Security Council to force Libya to 
evacuate the territory. 
  A government statement earlier said the talks had broken 
down 
over a demand by Libya that a previous accord, signed in Algiers 
in 1989 and calling for the release of prisoners of war, be 
implemented. 
  "Given that the Algiers accord has been totally overtaken by 
events, Chad rejected this proposal which constituted an 
unacceptable prior condition," Izzo said. 
  The Libyan delegation was also demanding the signing of a 
friendship and cooperation treaty prior to the execution of the 
World Court's decision, along with the release of Libyan war 
prisoners. 
  The delegates said they had no authority to decide on the 
principle of a withdrawal or on the dates, these being "up to 
technicians to decide," Izzo added, describing the Libyan 
demands as "diversions." 
  The Libyan delegation held talks with Chad President Idriss 
Deby, but the content of the talks was not revealed.

AL-HAYAH That a Broad Front for the Opposition Is Close To Being 
Formed; a Chadian Opposition Leader Accuses France of Supporting 
the Deby System for the Sake of Its Own Oil Interests"] 
  [Text] Paris--The president of the Movement for Democracy 
and Development in Chad, Moussa Medella, confirmed in an 
interview to AL-HAYAH yesterday that the Chadian opposition will 
not participate in the elections anticipated to take place in 
the coming spring. He said that his movement has liaisons under 
way with the goal of forming a broad front, bringing together 
cells of the opposition, and working towards the realization of 
a democratic arrangement in the country, after President Idriss 
Deby's failure to do so. 
  Medella accused the French Government of offering support to 
President Deby because he resorted to increasing the French 
companies' share in Chadian oil. But he at the same time took 
into consideration that there is no comprehensive solution to 
the Chadian crisis without French sponsorship of any agreement 
that is achieved. 
  He believes that the Chadian people have not enjoyed any 
type 
of democracy and stability since independence. He accused Deby 
of duplicity in his positions "because, when he is in France, he 
makes statements that it does not take him long to renounce when 
he is in Sudan, for example." 
  The opinion of Medella, who held the post of minister of 
health and social affairs in the era of former President 
Goukouni Oueddei, is that Chad is presently in a dilemma because 
of the economic situation that he described as "below zero" and 
because of the emigration of about 60 percent of the people to 
the neighboring countries because the civil war in Chad is 
continuous. 
  He mentioned that, in facing this reality, the movement is 
striving, for the sake of democracy, for the polarization of the 
greatest number possible of the Chadian cells opposed to "the 
formation of a broad front striving for a settling of the 
situation existing presently in the country. If it becomes clear 
that the settlement is not possible beyond compromise with the 
system, nothing will remain before us except the use of a 
military solution." 
  He added that the liaisons have produced positive results up 
to this point. He said that the opposition cells will hold a 
meeting within a week or two, in a location he refused to 
disclose, to work toward the agreement on the establishment of a 
broad front, "keeping away from religious, tribal, and 
ideological memberships and supporting anything that has to do 
with the interests of the Chadian people." 
  He attacked the national conference that was held 
approximately one year ago in Chad. He said that his movement 
rejected participation in it in light of President Deby's 
authority over the military, political, and economic 
installations in the country, "which means that the conference 
was no more than an occasion throughout which the participants 
expressed their viewpoints without reaching any decisions." 
  He said that his movement, which presented a positive 
initiative on the occasion of the holding of the national 
conference and announced a truce in its confrontation with the 
governmental powers, found itself subjected to attacks on the 
part of these powers the evening of the conference. He pointed 
to the fact that the goal in organizing the conference was "to 
mislead international public opinion and to help Deby appear on 
the exterior as a democratic man at the same time that he was 
gathering all the power into his own hands and was not leaving 
any area open to others to participate in the decisionmaking." 
  Concerning the elections expected to take place next spring, 
Medella said that the Chadian opposition cells found in the 
country, whose number is estimated to be around 45, are seeking 
the materials required for participation in the elections. He 
said that the armed opposition represented in his movement, 
present in the Lake Chad region, in addition to other groups of 
armed opposition found outside the regions of governmental 
authority, is refusing to participate in "formal" elections such 
as this. 
  He confirmed that the issue of the elections will be at the 
heart of the discussions that the opposition cells will carry on 
during the coming meeting and that they will demand national 
reconciliation, defining the groundwork for reestablishing the 
army, and working toward the return of the emigrants and the 
exiled before any elections take place. He confirmed that the 
opposition cells are all joining each other in the view that 
holding elections under the present circumstances is impossible. 
<H5>  The Islamists in Chad </H5>
  Concerning the scope of the importance of the Islamic cells, 
he said that Chad is facing several problems, such as ignorance, 
poverty, and conflict, among the political elements, each of 
which want to play a prominent role. He made it clear that among 
these elements are those striving to use the Arabic culture 
against the French and those striving for the opposite. There 
are also elements calling for the establishment of an Islamic 
system. 
  He added that whoever knows the composition of Chad realizes 
the impossibility of establishing any republic having a 
religious character, be it Islamic or Christian. "Our issue is a 
national issue and not a religious one, and we do not accept the 
establishment of an Islamic system." 
<H5>  French Interests </H5>
  He accused the West, specifically France, of supporting 
Deby, 
believing that he would apply true democracy in Chad, "but the 
latter is subject to a narrow view in his practice of governing, 
especially after he worked to strengthen the influence of the 
individuals of his family toward government in a way that is 
alienated from the public interest." 
  He stated clearly his belief that the continuance of French 
support for the present system, in spite of its failure to 
achieve practical advancement in the area of upholding human 
rights, "might be attributable to Deby's undertaking to 
strengthen the share of the French oil companies in Chad." He 
pointed out that France's share in Chadian oil presently ranges 
between 22 and 25 percent, at a time when former Chadian 
President Hissein Habre had refused to give the French companies 
a share that they were demanding, calculated at 11 percent. 
  He said that Deby took this risky step to guarantee the 
support of the French for his remaining in power, but they were 
getting to the point where they were realizing the scope of his 
failure. He confirmed that any dialogue existing in Chad for the 
sake of attaining a settlement of the existing situation must be 
by the sponsorship of France, in its capacity as the side 
capable of guaranteeing the attainment of what is due. 
  Concerning the sources of his movement's funding, he said 
that it is self-financed and "that it is difficult to verify 
that." He made clear that the basic source of this funding is 
the residents of the Lake Chad region, which is subject to the 
movement's authority and which is known for its natural 
resources and animal wealth. He said that these residents are 
paying taxes to the movement, on their exports of local 
products, the value of which is estimated at half the value of 
the governmental taxes. Likewise, a large portion of the arming 
of the movement has its source in what it captures from the 
government forces.

  [Text] President Pascal Lissouba arrived in Paris this 
evening for a two-day working visit. The Congolese president 
will hold talks with French President Francois Mitterrand and 
Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin. 
  Before his departure, President Lissouba was a guest of 
"Africa Midday" progam, during which he took the opportunity to 
give details on his political initiatives and also on the 
setting up of a national union government which he says is a 
difficult task: 
  [Begin Lissouba recording] I am willing to set up a union 
government, but people are still in possession of weapons. 
Imagine appointing someone who the representatives of the other 
factions disagree with. What would that minister do? Do you 
think he would be able to cross Bacongo, Diata, or other areas 
safely? It is not an easy task. 
  I thought it would be possible and I tried to do it, but 
from 
the very start each member of government wanted a party 
government and not a national union government. However, a 
party government, which we experienced for about four to five 
months, was a mess. No minister was answerable to the head of 
government. I would summon some of them for a meeting, and they 
would not come. They would first seek advice from the leader of 
their party before answering to the invitation of the head of 
state. And you call this a national union government? No, this 
is not the case. 
  Those who are dreaming of a party government will have to 
wait for a review of our Constitution, and we will do just that 
when the time comes. Believe me, we still have a long way to 
go. I come from the forest part of the country. I know that 
the growth of a tree is a slow process, but that should not 
prevent me from either felling that tree or immediately thinking 
of replacing it. [end recording]

  [Text] In Gabon, the national and higher education union as 
well as the postal, social security, Electricity and Water 
Company workers' unions are calling for a four-day strike as of 
tomorrow in protest against the dismissal of (Jean-Claude Mengue 
Volo), the post and telecommunications union chairman. Apart 
from that, political activity in the country seems to be 
focussed on the consultations convened by President Omar Bongo 
for today. 
  From all indications, the preparatory meeting for the 
consultations was not held. The opposition says it is in favor 
of the consultations. It called for dialogue following the 
recent bloody clashes in Libreville but wants several conditions 
to be met before taking part in the consultations. These 
include the lifting of the state of alert and the holding of 
discussions elsewhere other than at the Presidential Palace. As 
Pierre-Louis Agondjo-Okawe -- the opposition second in command 
-- stated at a news conference this afternoon, the opposition 
also wants the United Nations, the OAU, the European Union, the 
United States, France, and Canada to mediate. Jean-Valere 
Mbinamanza was at the conference. 
  [Begin Agondjo-Okawe recording] There should absolutely be 
international participation in order to guarantee the true 
implementation of what we say and decide upon. We do not want 
to be taken for a ride, as happened with the so-called 
monitoring committee that was set up after the national 
conference. That happened because negotiations were held among 
Gabonese. This time, we want a third party to guarantee that 
what is decided upon will be implemented. The most important 
thing in our view is to have transparent democracy. [end

  [Excerpts] President Habyarimana today made a one-day visit 
to Uganda, accompanied by the minister of defense. Landouald 
Ndasingwa, the minister of social affairs, was absent although 
he was supposed to be present. There must be a good reason for 
this. 
  There are many reasons for the visit. Reports say that 
President Habyarimana may have gone to Uganda to ask Ugandan 
President Yoweri Museveni, to help him make the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] accept the decisions of the interparty 
meeting that President Habyarimana chaired. It has been said 
that, after his visit to Uganda, President Habyarimana will go 
to Tanzania with the same message. 
  The decisions that he wants the RPF to accept are known to 
you. The parties rejected them but later accepted them after 
being terrorized and after becoming afraid of experiencing what 
happened to their friend [Felicien Gatabazi] who had just been 
killed. To us, it is clear that Habyarimana and his henchmen 
want to maintain the status quo. They are doing everything 
possible to torpedo the Arusha agreement. [passage omitted] 
  Terrorism forced the parties to agree to the plans. Even the 
Liberal Party accepted to sacrifice the rights of deputies who 
had been elected by the people so that President Habyarimana 
could give them peace at last. Now it is said that the purpose 
of his visit is to ask the Ugandan president to help him 
convince the RPF. This is a hard job for him because the 
terrorism he has been using on other parties will have no effect 
on the RPF. 
  It is clear now in our country that there are two opposing 
groups of parties. On one side, there is President 
Habyarimana's bloc comprising the Republican National Movement 
for Democracy and Development [MRND] and others who want to keep 
the status quo and want to forcefully obtain laws that give them 
advantages while those who have the interests of the country at 
heart are thrown aside. On the other side, there is the RPF and 
other parties, which want to have democracy in Rwanda and laws 
that benefit the entire country. That is why they want the 
Arusha agreement be respected fully, so that people's rights are 
respected such as the right of being elected. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa yesterday 
presided over the weekly cabinet meeting. [passage omitted] On 
the state of the nation, the cabinet observed that there is 
effective calm throughout the whole country. The cabinet 
however condemned the fallacious statement made by a politician 
to the effect that there are disturbances in the northwestern 
part of the country. Contrary to that politician's false 
allegation, the government asserts that there is no detachment 
of the Special Presidential Division in that part of the country 
or a disturbing presence of the Sudanese Army on the Sudan-Zaire 
border. 
  The government deplores the fact that at the time when all 
Zairians are awaiting definite solutions to our problems from 
the Palais du Peuple, some fellow citizens in search of the 
sensational are taking the liberty to sow doubt in the minds of 
the people for unavowed reasons, and are systematically deriding 
our Armed Forces with outrageous statements. 
  In the face of such culpable irresponsibility, the 
government 
wishes to remind everyone that henceforth any statement 
discrediting our Armed Forces will be punished with the 
strongest force. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hopes of a speedy end to a strike by public servants 
in Bophuthatswana were dashed today when President Lucas Mangope 
walked out of a crisis meeting aimed at resolving the issue. 
President Mangope called on the striking workers to outline 
their problems, but they insisted that he should address them 
first. 
  The strike, which has paralyzed most of the essential 
services in the territory, has resulted in cancellations at the 
many luxury hotels in the area, and Sun City has admitted that 
it is being badly affected. 
  One of the demands by the strikers is the reincorporation of 
Bophuthatswana into South Africa. Earlier today the 
Bophuthatswana cabinet decided that the territory would not take 
part in the election.

  [Text] Mmabatho Mar 7 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana's President 
Lucas Mangope said on Monday that he was optimistic that 
international mediation could lead to a constitutional agreement 
before the April election. Bophuthatswana's "Information 
Service" mouthpiece quoted Mr Mangope as saying at a news 
conference in Mmabatho that the homeland government was 100 per 
cent behind the Freedom Alliance's call for a mediated 
settlement. "Depending on the competence of the mediators and 
the terms of reference, it is conceivable that an agreement will 
be reached before the elections," Mr Mangope said. He said 
Bophuthatswana's main concern was not to meet deadlines, but to 
find solutions. 
  He told reporters that the Bophuthatswana parliament would 
have to decide whether or not it would contest the election. 
The Bophuthatswana cabinet had been unable to make this 
decision before the registration deadline on Friday because it 
first had to consult with parliament on the issue. The 
implications that participation in the election would have on 
Bophuthatswana's 16-year-old independence also had to be 
considered. He stressed that the value his country placed on 
independence and freedom was underestimated by people who 
believed that Bophuthatswana had not agreed to join the election 
was because it was afraid of defeat. "We have worked hard in 
this country to achieve what we have, and we are not prepared to 
give that away lightly," Mr Mangope said. 
  Responding to a question on the spate of go-slows and 
strikes 
in the Bophuthatswana civil service, Mr Mangope said that the 
government had made contingency plans which would be implemented 
if necessary.

  [Excerpts] Tension in Bophuthatswana has increased, 
following a decision by President Lucas Mangope's cabinet not to 
register for the election. A full session of the country's 
parliament will decide next week on participation in the April 
election. Reports of a troop build-up on the South African side 
of the border were denied by the defense force this evening, and 
the South African Police have said they are not aware of any 
unusual police activities in the area. Civil servants have 
still not turned up for work and continue to demand the 
immediate pay-out of their pensions. Soldiers are guarding the 
entrances to government buildings and several streets in the 
capital, Mmabatho. 
  The South African ambassador to Bophuthatswana, Dr. Tjaart 
van der Walt, said this evening there is deep-seated 
dissatisfaction in the civil service, but that he does not 
expect immediate action at this stage. He told Television News 
that a delegation of Bophuthatswana businessmen called on him 
this morning and informed him of their intense disappointment 
over the cabinet's decision. He said he had conveyed this to 
the government of Bophuthatswana. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Pik Botha says he regrets Bophuthatswana's 
decision not to participate in the election. He said he 
believes that that country cannot survive independently. He 
told Johan Claassen that Bophuthatswana is not as economically 
independent as it claims to be. 
  [Begin Botha recording] President Mangope usually quotes a 
figure, saying, I believe, that they receive up to 70 percent of 
their income from their own sources. That's not true. You see, 
he is including the income from the Customs Union, which of 
course will be stopped after the election. A whole range of 
money transfers will stop. That country will not have the money 
to pay its people. I have never wanted to turn off the tap, 
because I knew that they would then be unable to pay their 
nurses, their teachers, their other government officials. They 
will pay their police and their defense force, but those with 
civilian duties will not be paid, and we will get the blame. 
But I am almost certain that a new government will stop all 
these transfers. So there is only darkness ahead for 
Bophuthatswana. There is no other realistic alternative for 
them but to come and participate in the election, and make their 
contribution to a peaceful southern Africa. [end recording]

  [Text] The government has warned Bophuthatswana that a new 
government will turn off the economic taps to the territory 
unless free political activity is allowed there. Foreign 
Affairs Minister Pik Botha appealed to moderates within the 
Bophuthatswana cabinet to reconsider a decision not to 
participate in the election. He expressed concern that the 
continuing strikes in the territory could spill over into South 
Africa and said the government would insist on free political 
activity in Bophuthatswana. 
  Mr. Popo Molefe of the ANC [African National Congress] said 
his party would insist that budget allocations to Bophuthatswana 
be halted. He said the ANC would also support the 
intensification of mass action in support of free political 
activity. 
  Meanwhile, reacting to the furor caused by his cabinet's 
decision, President Mangope has said that he is prepared to die 
for the independence of Bophuthatswana if necessary. He said 
neither the Transitional Electoral Council [as heard] nor the 
Independent Electoral Commission would be allowed to operate in 
Bophuthatswana unless the government decided to register for the 
election. 
  However, President Mangope expressed optimism that mediation 
could lead to agreement to parties before the election. 
[sentence as heard] He said it was now up to the Bophuthatswana 
parliament to decide whether the state would participate in the 
election.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 7 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] will ensure budget allocation transfers to 
Bophuthatswana are halted to force the homeland government to 
allow canvassing for a free and fair election, ANC Election 
Commission head Popo Molefe said on Monday [7 March]. 
Addressing a media conference, Mr Molefe said the ANC would 
support the intensification of mass action in Bophuthatswana to 
ensure free political activity. "Bophuthatswana should be 
blockaded as a non-military step to force the homeland 
government to stop political persecution," he said. "The ANC 
election offices in the homeland were bombed on Monday as part 
of the campaign of harassment against the organisation including 
disruptions of voter education meetings." 
  Mr Molefe, the ANC premier nominee for the North Western 
Region which includes Bophuthatswana, called on State President 
F W de Klerk to act more firmly against the homeland and take 
away its powers. He suggested steps to force the homeland to 
allow political activity, including: 

  -  transitional executive council intervention; 
  -  the independent electoral commission erect polling booths in 
the area; 
  -  blockading the homeland to prevent entry of South African 
goods; 
  -  stopping the annual budget allocation to the homeland; and, 
  -  cutting financial loans to Bophuthatswana. 

    Mr Molefe said tourists should be discouraged from going to

economy and lead to a loss of jobs, but added it was more 
important to stop tyranny.

<F P=106> [Report by G Arde] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 7 SAPA--There is a "strong likelihood" 
the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] will not observe Wednesday's [9 
March] deadline for the submission of its election candidate 
list to the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], it emerged 
on Monday. Reaffirming this view from IFP National Chairman 
Frank Mdlalose on a radio interview, spokesman Ed Tillet said 
"we don't see any pressure on us". 
  "I don't see the IFP observing that deadline at all. A 
national settlement is far more important than artificial dates. 
The first thing we have to do is secure a national settlement 
which will accommodate the aspirations of the vast majority. 
We'll draw up a candidate list only after attempts at 
international mediation, and providing those attempts are 
successful...We haven't worried about it at all," Mr Tillet said. 
  The IFP spokesman said he was confident the IEC would allow 
flexibility on the issue of late registration. "There has to be 
room for flexibility on this; we're talking about a life or 
death situation here," he said. 
  IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje said the party's registration 
would lapse if its candidate list was not submitted by 4.30PM on 
Wednesday. "If they have any difficulty they would need to talk 
to us. We'll try to be as helpful as we can," Mr Cronje said, 
adding he knew of no communication from the IFP on the matter by 
Monday afternoon. "It's difficult to say what plan can be made; 
it depends on the nature of the party's problem," he said in 
response to a suggestion that the deadline might be waived. 
  Mr Tillet said it would be almost impossible to finalise the 
party's list by the deadline because the list would have to be 
caucused and then verified at a regional level.

<F P=106> [Report by J Saunders] </F>
  [Text] Port Elizabeth March 7 SAPA -- The elections should 
be postponed to ensure a fair and inclusive settlement Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on 
Monday [7 Monday]. But he gave no indication of when he had in 
mind. "Without an all-inclusive election we really do run the 
risk of our country sliding into the abyss we are so clearly 
staring in the face," he told about [word indistinct] guests at 
Port Elizabeth's German Club. "But if the IFP is to take part 
in the election, then attention will have to be directed at 
possibly postponing the election to a later date. It is grossly 
unfair that the IFP be put at an unfair disadvantage in fighting 
the election when we have devoted our undivided attention to 
achieving a dispensation which will ensure democracy and 
prosperity." 
  Citing Angola as an example, he told the guests the election 
was not a magic wand that would make the country's problems 
disappear. The Angolan elections were observed by a myriad of 
monitors but "just look at what's going on there now". 
  "While many observers feel that delaying the election would 
precipitate increased violence, I do not agree. It is far 
better to spend a little more time in ensuring that we achieve 
an all-inclusive constitution that works, than to rush a 
settlement which will not be worth the paper it is written on." 
  Mr Buthelezi said the interim constitution as it stood now 
was spawning a liberation election. "The fight is about which 
party will emerge to write the next constitution. I think the 
small parties will concentrate on policy issues, but the larger 
parties are going to be locked into a battle for the commanding 
position to be the only party which can introduce a new 
constitutional text to the constitution-making body, the 
constituent assembly. For the African National Congress [ANC] 
it will be a last act in a grand revolutionary strategy." 
  Mr Buthelezi said neither the IFP nor the Freedom Alliance 
would instigate a worsening of the civil war South Africa was 
facing. Rather, he believed, "there will be terrible fights in 
elections to gain the position in which your party can dictate 
the constitutional future". 
  "The parties which made bids for this awesome power, and 
lost, will not smile and settle down to working under a ruling 
party...This constitution and the elections under it are going 
to polarise our county and sow the seeds for future conflict." 
  Mr Buthelezi said the latest so-called confessions by the 
ANC 
made no concession on provincial powers and functions. Under 
the interim constitution, regions had less powers than the 
kwaZulu government already had. "There is not one area where 
the regions will alone have the final say over matters affecting 
only them. The arrogance of the ANC indeed holds no bounds. It 
seems to escape the ANC that the Freedom Alliance will not 
participate in the election until all our bottom line demands 
are met. I am sorry to say that even the fact that we 
registered last Friday for elections does not necessarily mean 
we are going to participate if mediation does not take place 
before that." 
  Mr Buthelezi said a meeting was under way in Cape Town on 
Monday to decide the kind of international mediation the IFP 
would settle for, and the party's national chairman would meet 
the ANC on Tuesday. "With due respect, even bodies like the 
United Nations are not right to deal with this question."

  [Text] Three newspapers this morning report that General 
Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front will contest next month's 
election after all. However, this cannot be confirmed at this 
state. According to the NATAL MERCURY, THE CAPE TIMES, and 
BUSINESS DAY, the decision was taken at a secret meeting last 
night. The papers said this development would almost certainly 
bring about a split among right wingers. It is reported that 
the front, which was registered as a party late on Friday night, 
will submit lists of candidates before the deadline tomorrow. 
The papers add that the leader of the Afrikaner Freedom 
Foundation, Professor Carel Boshoff, has also joined the group 
that is to take part in the election .

  [Text] Pretoria March 8 SAPA -- The pro-election faction of 
the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] is 
still considering participating in the April election, Afrikaner 
Vryheidstigting [Freedom Foundation] leader Carel Boshoff said 
on Tuesday. He was reacting to speculation that a group of 
Boereparliament members who supported AVF Gen Constand Viljoen's 
registration of the Freedom Front party would indeed submit a 
candidates list, contrary to an AVF transitional representative 
assembly decision last Saturday. 
  Speaking on Radio 702 on Tuesday, Prof Boshoff said the 
group 
was still considering whether to submit such a list, and the 
issue was still being negotiated. "I am convinced an effort 
should be made to resolve the deadlock," Prof Boshoff said. "We 
therefore think we should continue with negotiations in own 
ranks to establish whether we should not participate in the 
election. At this moment no final decision has been made and 
the matter is still being discussed." 
  Every effort should be made to prevent another split in 
Afrikaner ranks, but Prof Boshoff thought the main issue was 
whether it was possible to break the deadlock. 
  Last Saturday the AVF's transitional representative assembly 
voted by 73 votes to 20 to boycott the election unless it was 
granted a volkstaat [homeland].

  [Text] Pretoria March 7 SAPA -- Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front, AVF] Constitutional Committee 
Chairman Fanie Jacobs said on Monday [7 March] he was not aware 
of pro-election AVF leaders lobbying secretly to take part in 
the April poll. This meant Gen Constand Viljoen's registration 
of the Freedom Front would lapse if no list of candidates was 
submitted by Wednesday, and the AVF would continue to set up 
democratic alternative structures to secure a volkstaat 
[homeland], he said. But reports and AVF sources said there was 
agitation for rightwing participation in the elections. 
  Reacting to the Bophuthatswana cabinet's decision to follow 
the AVF's example and boycott the election, Mr Jacobs said: "I 
am not surprised." 
  The AVF's transitional representative council would meet 
soon 
to adopt the AVF's constitution and finalise the volkstaat's 
borders, he said. 
  AVF Directorate member Gen Tienie Groenewald on Monday ruled 
out participation in the elections "at this stage". He told 
Radio 702 that due to Saturday's majority decision to boycott 
the elections: "There is no doubt that the AVF will at this 
stage not participate in the elections." He rejected talk of 
AVF participation in the polls as speculation and issued a 
statement saying suggestions to this effect were aimed at 
driving a wedge in rightwing ranks. 
  There was lively debate in the AVF on the strategy to attain 
an Afrikaner volkstaat, he conceded. In spite of differences on 
how to attain a volkstaat, he said, unity among Afrikaners was 
paramount. "If there is a split in our basis then our aim (of a 
volkstaat) is not attainable." 
  "We must find a way to prove our support. We'd hoped for a 
plebiscite or a referendum (to determine support and establish 
the borders of a volkstaat) but that had not been agreed to by 
the government," Gen Groenewald told the radio station. 
  The AVF sources said on Monday that pro-election elements in 
the rightwing front argued that participation in the polls would 
not constitute an endorsement of the interim constitution or 
that they wanted to become part of the new South Africa. 
"Participation would merely be to determine support and the 
borders for a volkstaat and to show the world that we have broad 
support for an Afrikaner homeland." 
  Emerging from Saturday's transitional assembly meeting Gen 
Viljoen, defeated by hardliners, told a news conference that 
"absolutely nothing would change the AVF's mind not to 
participate in the elections unless there was finality on the 
volkstaat itself". 
  AVF spokesman Stephen Maninger on Monday said he was not 
aware of an alleged plot to assassinate Gen Viljoen. Mr 
Maninger said the AVF's standpoint remained that people should 
boycott the election, but should people insist on voting, they 
should not support the National Party, which, he said, was 
trying to gain rightwing votes through scare tactics.

<F P=106> [Report by Fred de Lange and SAPA] </F>
  [Text] The pro-election faction the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front, AVF] yesterday claimed there was a 
plot to assassinate General Constand Viljoen if he attempts to 
continue his efforts to take the Volksfront into the election. 
  The plot allegedly has its origin in militant groups within 
the Volksfront who are violently opposed to the election. The 
president of the Volks [Afrikaner people] Representative Council 
of the Volksfront, Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, yesterday expressed his 
shock about the allegations and said immediate steps would be 
taken to improve security for Gen Viljoen. 
  After a weekend of high drama which saw Gen Viljoen 
desperately trying to keep the Volksfront's options open by 
registering for the election without the permission of the 
executive of the Volksfront, Dr Hartzenberg reluctantly admitted 
there was now a small chance for the Volksfront to take part in 
the election. 
  But sources in the Volksfront said Gen Viljoen's efforts now 
placed him in real danger of being assassinated. "We have 
information that elements within the Volksfront violently 
opposed to the election have made plans to murder Gen Viljoen 
should he decided to complete formalities on the registration of 
the Freedom Front," THE CITIZEN was told yesterday. 
  Although the Volksraad [national council] vote was 72 to 20 
against registration, it is claimed there is substantial 
grassroots support in favour of it. 
  The pre-election group claim the Volksraad could be forced 
within the next couple of days to change its decision. There 
was also a strong possibility that Gen Viljoen could go ahead, 
in any case, to complete the registration even if the Volksraad 
did not change its decision. He would be supported, it is 
claimed, by a substantial number of members of the Volksfront 
who did not support the Conservative Party, but backed Gen 
Viljoen himself as "leader of the Afrikaner nation". 
  Dr Hartzenberg yesterday admitted there still was a chance 
for the Volksfront to take part in the election. While the 
Volksfront was aiming for an election for a volkstaat [Afrikaner 
homeland], there was a "small possibility" of taking part in the 
mainstream constitutional process. 
  This would depend on developments today and tomorrow on 
final 
agreements to get the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] to complete 
its registration for the election. Dr Hartzenberg said while he 
still maintained that international mediation was not necessary 
for a solution, it all depended on what was offered by the ANC 
[African National Congress] and the government before the final 
deadline for the submission of candidate lists expired on 
Wednesday evening. 
  Should this be adequate -- and he doubted it would -- the 
Volksfront could still submit a candidate's list and complete 
the registration. He stressed, however, that an accommodation 
of the IFP did not automatically mean an accommodation of the 
Volksfront. 
  "There is always time to save the process and we will look 
sympathetically to any proposal," said Dr Hartzenberg. He 
expressed his shock at the allegations of plans to assassinate 
Gen Viljoen and said he could hardly believe it. 
  "I would believe this from our political opponents, but 
never 
from our own people", Dr Hartzenberg said. Although the 
security arrangements around Gen Viljoen had been stepped up in 
the past, Dr Hartzenberg said immediate action would be taken to 
improve this even further. 
  General Tienie Groenewald, a member of the AVF directorate, 
said yesterday that, Afrikaner Volksfront members had not 
entirely surrendered their efforts to persuade hardliners to 
take part in the April elections. "There will be more efforts 
to convince people in the AVF that we shouldpkeep our options 
open," Gen Groenewald said. 
  "There is little chance that the AVF as a front will 
register. But I don't think the matter has been put on ice," he 
said. 
  Gen Groenewald said it was no secret that some AVF members 
supported taking part in the election and that they would 
continue efforts to get the election boycotters around to their 
point of view. 
  Today's meeting with the alliance partners -- Bophuthatswana 
and the IFP -- would help determine the AVF's course of action. 
Gen Groenewald said the AVF would also be examining what 
results international mediation might be able to deliver. 
  Talks with the African National Congress on a political 
accord on a volkstaat would continue. More successful talks on 
the issue on Friday might have secured AVF registration by 
giving Gen Viljoen something with which to convince his 
followers of the need to take part in the poll.

  [Text] Giyani, Gazankulu March 6 SAPA -- Gazankulu's Ximoko 
Progressive Party has ousted three executive members responsible 
for registering the party for the elections and has thrown its 
weight behind the African National Congress [ANC]. 
  At a special congress in Giyani on Saturday [5 March] the 
party gave the thumbs up to Chief Samuel Nxumalo as its 
president and resolved to have the party's registration for the 
elections canceled in court. 
  Secretary-General Ed Ngobeni and Treasurer A D Mahatlani, 
who 
are part of the group which registered the party, were replaced 
with Chris Fankomo and L M Nkuna respectively. 
  The position of vice-president, held by Edward Mhinga, who 
is 
also with the rival group, was done way with by the conference 
which was attended by about 200 people. 
  The conference decided the opposition group, which voted at 
a 
conference in Phalaborwa last week to remove Chief Nxumalo as 
president, be stopped from using the Ximoko Progressive Party 
name. 
  At a joint rally held at Giyani Stadium with the ANC, Chief 
Nxumalo told a crowd of more than 10,000 to vote for the ANC.

<F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 4 SAPA -- An African National 
Congress [ANC] government would downplay South Africa's role as 
a regional power in southern Africa, ANC foreign affairs 
director Thabo Mbeki said on Friday. Mr Mbeki was presenting a 
discussion paper, Foreign Policy in a Democratic South Africa, 
to members of the media and diplomatic corps at the World Trade 
Centre in Kempton Park. 
  The document outlines South Africa's likely international 
orientation after the April elections. Rather than projecting 
itself as a regional power, South Africa would emphasise 
co-operation as defined in agreements with fellow southern 
African nations. It would attempt to address the marginalisation 
of the African continent in the world economy and would join the 
Organisation of African Unity. 
  "Closer regional co-operation and economic integration after 
apartheid will benefit the entire region," the document says. "A 
democratic South Africa should explicitly renounce all hegemonic 
ambitions in the region. It should resist all pressures to 
become the regional power at the expense of the rest of the 
sub-continent. Instead it should seek to become part of a 
movement to create a new form of economic interaction in 
southern Africa based on principles of mutual benefit and 
interdependence." 
  South Africa would contribute to conflict resolution 
mechanisms and peacekeeping in Africa. South Africa would also 
take part in discussions about the United Nations and would 
support efforts to "democratise" that body by giving 
traditionally less powerful nations more scope and influence. 
  The foreign policy document stresses South Africa's role in 
promoting human rights around the world. South Africa would 
actively involve itself in international forums in pursuit of 
this goal. 
  An ANC government would foster links with the Islamic 
community of the Middle East and follow international law and 
practice in its relations with Asian countries. Relations with 
the European Community would be emphasised as well as bilateral 
relations with individual European countries. 
  Diplomatic ties would also be established with Cuba. "We 
believe that Cuba's right to self-determination is important in 
the maintenance of international norms and principles," the 
document says. 
  It notes its concern at the failure to finalise the Uruguay 
Round of talks on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs 
(GATT) and says this could lead to damaging protectionism among 
the northern countries. 
  On the UN, the document says: "We support endeavours to 
democratise the UN. This entails reviewing the brief of both the 
General Assembly and the Security Council." 
  On security, the document says South Africa will sign the 
Geneva Convention and protocols and will be committed to 
resolving disputes peacefully. 
  South Africa would actively support non-proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  South Africa would return to the Commonwealth. 
  A new foreign service would be established independent of 
party political considerations. "We will immediately take steps 
to ensure that, within a reasonable period, the diplomatic corps 
will be fally representative of South Africa's people," the 
document notes.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on 7 March on SAPA PR Wire </F>
Service] 
  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] remains firmly 
committed to a free and fair elections campaign, where all 
parties will have access to all voters. During the last few 
weeks the ANC has been criticised for the actions of people who 
claim ANC membership. Our opponents can rest assured that we 
will do everything in our power to protect their right to 
campaign. We ourselves are the victims of large scale 
intolerance and in many parts of South Africa we are not able to 
campaign. 
  We have fought long and hard for the right to vote and all 
of 
us who are serious about democracy must protect each other's 
rights in the electoral process. But we must caution other 
parties to make adequate security arrangements when they enter 
areas where many voters are hostile to them. We take very 
stringent precautions when our leaders speak in right wing or 
hostile areas. Each party has a responsibility to work closely 
with the SAP [South African Police] and the peace committees and 
must provide its own marshals to protect its leaders and 
supporters. 
  Our opponents can expect us to control our members, but we 
cannot provide protection against the millions of South Africans 
who were deeply wronged by apartheid and who may express their 
anger in irresponsible ways. We will however do our best reach 
every ANC supporter and to especially target supporters who have 
in any way interfered with the freedom of other parties. 
  Our message to our members is simple: We will not tolerate 
any intimidation threats or violence against our opponents. ANC 
members who break electoral code of conduct will be disciplined 
by our structures as well as face prosecution for crimes under 
the electoral act. We have nothing to gain from violence and 
intimidation. If you do not like a party or its policies, stay 
away from their meetings and activities. Our task is to take 
our message to the voters and to persuade them that the ANC is 
the best party to run this country. 
  We have been accused of paying lip service to political 
tolerance. To ensure tolerance amongst our members the ANC has 
embarked upon the following: Our elections campaign manual 
forbids any disruption of political meetings. We have trained 
monitors for every branch to deal with breaches of the electoral 
code of conduct. A letter from the president of the ANC, 
Comrade Nelson Mandela, has been sent to every branch, region 
and office-bearers. A poster with an accessible version of the 
electoral code of conduct for political parties has been 
dispatched to all regions and branches throughout the country. 
During the week of the 13 March, the ANC is dispatching senior 
ANC and ANC Youth League leaders to all ANC regions to ensure 
that the message of tolerance reaches out to all our members and 
supporters. 
  The ANC believes that it has already been partially 
successful and would like to point out that the National Party 
and the DP [Democratic Party] have had many peaceful visits to 
areas where the ANC has undisputed majority support. 
  The fact that disruptions have been few and peaceful has 
been 
due to the very hard and consistent work on the part of our 
structures. In many areas ANC office bearers have worked hard to 
diffuse potentially explosive situations. 
  The divisions in our country are very great, anger and 
distrust run very deep. Political campaigning in this country 
has always been robust. However we cannot afford to disrupt 
this fragile process towards democracy, by adopting campaigning 
strategies that increase polarisation. 
  The ANC will do our utmost to keep the campaign clean and to 
use it to overcome the bitterness of the past. We appeal to all 
other parties to work just as hard at achieving real political 
tolerance.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] says there is 
little likelihood that Parliament will be moved from Cape Town 
in the foreseeable future. The head of the department of 
information and publicity in the Western Cape, Mr. Bulelani 
Ngcuka, and parliamentary candidate Jay Naidoo told a news 
conference that building another parliament would be a waste of 
resources. They said the ANC's priorities were jobs, housing, 
electricity, and health services, not putting up new public 
buildings.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with COSATU General Secretary Sam </F>
Shilowa by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  End of Crude Apartheid </H5>
  Apartheid in its crude form will soon be a thing of the 
past. 
What will remain are institutions and structures at a political 
and socio-economic level. The key danger to the transition will 
be from the apartheid bureaucracy. The demise of apartheid may 
open up contradictions between organised labour and the 
unemployed who could be exploited by employers. An ANC [African 
National Congress] government will be under tremendous pressure 
from small and medium size enterprises whose approach to wages 
undermines labour standards and worker rights. 
<H5>  Loss of Leadership </H5>
  The nominations for the national and regional legislatures 
have taken away certain key leadership including officials. 
Loss of leadership is also positive (in that people with a 
working class background will be in decision-making places in 
our country). Our success will depend in part on our ability to 
consolidate the emerging leadership. 
<H5>  Contradictions Within the Alliance Different Emphasis </H5>
  As the major partner in the new GNU [Government of National 
Unity], key personnel from within the ANC will find themselves 
in senior executive, legislative and administrative positions in 
national, provincial and local government. 
  This reality will introduce new strategic challenges, social 
class/strata tendencies and tensions: 
<H5>  A New Social Stratum </H5>
  The new reality will not just present a new strategic 
challenge. In effect, the promotion of several thousand key 
ANC-linked personnel into senior governmental positions will 
constitute the formation of a new social stratum. Between the 
new ANC senior governmental stratum, especially those in 
management roles in the civil service, and the mass of workers 
in the public sector certain tensions and contradictions will 
occur. This new social stratum may well exhibit new class 
tendencies which have an anti-popular character. But we must be 
careful not to present or conceptualise these strains as a 
simple ANC vs COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] 
contradiction. The vast majority of public sector workers, and 
the majority of the popular masses are ANC activists, members or 
supporters. On the other hand, senior ANC personnel in 
government will also find themselves frustrated, undermined and 
blocked by the large bureaucracy they will inherit from 
apartheid. To some extent rank and file public sector workers 
(and workers more broadly in all sectors) will be natural allies 
of the new governmental strata. 
  Quite apart from their subjective strengths and weaknesses, 
the new stratum will face contradictory strategic and class 
pulls and inclinations. Which of the different tendencies 
sketched out above will emerge as the dominant tendencies will 
be a function of strategic clarity on our part, struggle and the 
relative balance of organised forces within the broader ANC-led 
alliance. 
  There are other contradictions that will face us. The ANC 
will be subjected to a lot of demands by all sorts of interest 
groups. Our membership will expect change in the conditions of 
work and living standards. Employers will expect the ANC to 
confront us on issues such as a productivity, minimum wage and 
to accept a wage restraint. The ANC as the government of the 
day will have to concern itself with catering for the needs of 
society as a whole, including our class enemies. The prospect 
of a new public sector union engaged in negotiations with an ANC 
government is both challenging and full of uncertainties. 
  Contradictions and differences may not only be confined to 
COSATU and the ANC, but may also come from within. Already 
different strategies exist between unions. We need to find ways 
and means of containing these while emphasising areas of 
agreement. Our key role is not only to prevent contradictions 
and differences, but to find a way to manage them in the 
interest of the working class. 
<H5>  Employers Strategies </H5>
  The opening up of the world to employers, the formation of a 
single employer organisation/federation will ensure greater 
coordination amongst them. They will attempt to copy the 
strategies of their counterparts in other parts of the world 
where attempts are being made to weaken and to split the labour 
movement. We must avoid being forced to articulate their 
position around the opening up of the economy. We need to 
increase our productive capacity to that of world standards. 
Such increase should be aimed at benefiting society as a whole. 
<H5>  2. Redefining Our Role </H5>
  The changing situation demands of us to redefine our role. 
New methods of dealing with problems, demands and expectations 
will have to be found. While workers in the past may have 
joined us because of our links with the Congress movement, in 
the future they will join us primarily because they expect us to 
safeguard their interests. Some will even put pressure on us to 
concentrate only on bread and butter issues and leave the rest 
to political parties and organisations. Our members are part of 
the community. Therefore we can never confine ourselves to 
bread and butter issues. They want houses, water, electricity, 
an end to violence, etc. Increasing the social wage of workers 
is our responsibility, we need to be engaged in struggle through 
the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Plan] and other avenues 
to win these issues. 
<H5>  Trade Union Independence </H5>
  The strength of COSATU will depend in part on our ability to 
maintain trade union independence. We need to differentiate 
between independence and non-alignment. We are in alliance with 
the ANC and SACP [South African Communist Party] based on a 
particular programme. This alliance must be maintained and 
strengthened so as to ensure ever deeper and broader democracy. 
Independence means that we are not a conveyor belt of our 
alliance partners. It will be a sad day for trade unionism if 
COSATU was to become a sweetheart federation. Our members will 
do to us what we have done with the old TUCSA [Trade Union 
Council of South Africa] unions. 
<H5>  Prioritising Our Involvement </H5>
  In the past year we have been involved in too many fora. In 
some of these we were represented in name only with either no 
person attending regularly or no report back and mandating 
structures in place. We need to prioritise issues around which 
we wish to negotiate in fora and participate to the best of our 
ability. Failure to prioritise will mean involvement in 
everything, but no capacity to deliver or time to develop 
policies. The weakness and vagueness of sections on Trade and 
Industry as well as labour market policies in the RDP is an 
indictment on COSATU. 
<H5>  Defining a 3-5 year Strategic Vision </H5>
  In defining our role in this ever changing situation, we 
must 
base it on a long term sustainable strategic vision. Such a 
strategy, while allowing for dynamic changes, must guide us 
between now, the post-Election conference in May and the Fifth 
National Congress in September. From September onwards, we must 
be planning to confront challenges that lie ahead. Not only do 
we need a 3 year programme, but our strategies must take into 
account that the Government of National Unity and Reconstruction 
will last for about 5 years. Our strategy will have be 
underpinned by among others the following broad objectives: 

  -  winning an election 
  -  RDP that provides for real transformation 
  -  ending violence and crime 
  -  attaining financial self-sufficiency 
  -  mass driven programmes and campaigns 
  -  sustaining membership and growth 
  -  provide real service to affiliates 
  -  solidarity. 

    We must also analyse and plan to deal with the strategies of 
employers at a regional level. No COSATU vision will succeed 
unless it is also based on the Southern African region. Issues 
such as regional economies, trade union solidarity and labour 
migration needs proper discussion. 
<H5>  3. Key Challenges </H5>
  As outlined at the beginning, many challenges will face us 
in 
the coming period. Key amongst these are: 
  3.1 Building organisation 
  The paper presented at the Special Congress contained a nine 
point plan to strengthen organisation: 
<H5>  Capacity building </H5>
  COSATU needs to build capacity (personnel and structures) 
that makes it possible for us to respond to defined priority 
areas timeously. 
<H5>  Servicing Membership </H5>

  In almost all our regions, workers are complaining about 
lack 
of service and involvement in decision making. The majority of 
our affiliates still use the same structures and methods of the 
early eighties to drive the organisation forward. Most cases 
either go unchallenged or are badly handled, resulting in 
disgruntlement and resignation. In most factories that hard 
fought for victory for holding general meetings during working 
hours is no longer utilised. 
<H5>  Building Structures and Layers of Leadership </H5>
  The cornerstone of our organisation is supposed to be 
locals. 
In most areas they either do not exist or are not being 
attended by shopstewards and officials. While it is true that 
violence plays a role in the declining attendance, our neglect 
of those structures is a contributing factor. 
  The other factor is the status of locals in COSATU. We need 
to revisit our debate on the role of locals and regions in the 
run up to the 5th National Congress. If we are going to be a 
real force against employers, we will have to once more rely on 
our members to defend us against them. 
<H5>  Realignment of Structures </H5>
  The two previous papers on demarcation has proven that there 
is a bigger debate looming in industrial demarcation. We have 
two routes: One is to implement piecemeal as we go along, the 
other is to wait until we have concluded the whole debate. The 
danger is that we are faced with an immediate task of putting 
together a service sector union and that waiting too long would 
just kill the initiative. The reality is that we need to 
redefine industry and build strong unions. 
<H5>  Interaction With Institutions </H5>
  We need to put structures for the implementation of the RDP 
in place. Their role before the elections will be to identify 
areas of concern to COSATU, institutions and organisations with 
whom we need to interact, build capacity for implementation. 
Beyond the elections they will have to relate to a number of 
fora, affiliates, employers and government structures. The ANC 
conference resolution places the coordination of the RDP at the 
President's office and Premiers. We must realign our structures 
to the same scenario. 
<H5>  Setting Up Proper Fora </H5>
  After the elections, we must identify a few forums for 
participation, develop policies and feed this publicly or 
through our interaction with mass bases formations. 
  We should concentrate on the following areas: 
  Trade and Industry and Industrial Strategy in particular, 
Workplace Democracy, Public Sector and Parastatals, Labour 
Market issues, Education and Training and Macro-Economic 
policies. 
  We must consider pushing for a merger of the NEF [National 
Economic Forum] and NMC [National Manpower Commission] 
structures to deal with labour market and macro-economic issues. 
We should also debate the possibility of setting up a committee 
that interacts with government on socio-economic issues. All 
interest groups of significance would be represented. 
<H5>  Policy Formulation </H5>
  Apart from principled positions, we have got no detailed 
policies on a number of crucial issues. Very often we reach 
consensus only to return to the same issue at the next meeting. 
We should put together a team/s to look at the following areas: 

  -  minimum wages 
  -  grading/skills/wages 
  -  investment strategy 
  -  new comprehensive LRA [Labor Relations Act] 
  -  labour based (construction) standards and wage rates on 
labour 
intensive construction and public works programme. 
  -  Affirmative action 
  -  Productivity. 

<H5>    The Struggle for Socialism </H5>
  The special Congress held in September reaffirmed our 
commitment to socialism. We need to ensure that conditions for 
such advancement are possible. The RDP, while itself not a 
socialist programme, lays the basis for such advancement. 
COSATU together with SACP and other organs of civil society 
need to plan beyond the end of the GNU around which the RDP is 
based. The conference on socialism must emerge with certain 
answers and a programme that can easily be implemented. we also 
need to find ways and means of strengthening the Left both 
inside and outside of parliament.

  [Text] Spoornet [rail network] has confirmed that an 
official investigation has been ordered into this morning's 
train accident at Marianhill, north of Durban, in which at least 
90 people were killed and 52 critically injured. The accident 
happened when a commuter train headed for Durban was derailed 
between Thornwood and Marianhill. Cranes are being used to free 
people trapped between coaches and the police, the air force, 
and the army are helping with the rescue operation. 
  Several survivors told reporters that they had been 
threatened by the train driver, who told them that he was a 
member of the right-wing group. The police asked witnesses to 
submit sworn statements and it has been reported that the driver 
has undergone a blood test. 
  Both the ANC [African National Congress] and King Goodwill 
Zwelithini of the Zulus have extended their condolences to the 
families of the victims and have asked that a disaster fund be 
established.

  [Text] Pretoria March 7 SAPA -- Military police are 
investigating the theft of a reportedly large cache of weapons 
from an Air Force depot near Pretoria at the weekend. Sources 
feared it might have been an inside job by rightwingers. The 
military and not police were carrying out initial investigations. 
  Though SAAF [South African Air Force] spokesmen were unable 
to quantify the extent of the haul from 10 Air Force Depot in 
Voortrekkerhoogte, sources said the raid entailed "more weapons 
than rightwinger Piet `Skiet' Rudolph's arms haul from SAAF 
headquarters". 
  Senior air force personnel will be briefed on the 
investigation on Tuesday before a media statement is released. 
SAAF spokesman Colonel Tommy Michell confirmed the military was 
investigating the crime.

<F P=106> [Report by Jan Taljaard] </F>
  [Text] The cabinet has been briefed about a comprehensive 
rightwing war plan that has been in existence since the end of 
last year. The cabinet was told -- in a document marked 
"secret" leaked to the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN [WM&amp;G] -- of 
rightwing 
plans to hijack the South African Defence Force's Rapid 
Deployment Force (RDF) at the outbreak of hostilities and use 
former SADF [South African Defense Force] Special Force members 
to neutralise key communication structures. 
  They also plan to "neutralise" SADF generals in the event of 
martial law. These allegations are made in an intelligence 
document drafted for the cabinet. Divergent sources contacted 
in connection with the document after it was faxed anonymously 
to the WM&amp;G, confirmed it was authentic. 
  According to the document, the Afrikaner Volksfront (AVF) 
[Afrikaner National Front] has information about a secret 
agreement between the government and the ANC providing that 
martial law will be declared in the case of the AVF seceding. 
All functions of government will then simultaneously be 
transferred to the Chief of the Defence Force. In the event of 
this happening, it is alleged that the AVF will react by 
"neutralising all hostile SAF generals" within 48 hours after 
the declaration of martial law. In this regard, the document 
reads, contingency planning is in place. 
  Rightwingers allege that virtually the whole of the command 
structure of RDF is loyal to the Freedom Alliance and AVF in 
particular. Through counter-intelligence networks inside the 
government's intelligence services, they also believe that they 
will be able to thwart any planned action by the government. 
  The next step will be the mobilisation of the total support 
of the Freedom Alliance for a conventional civil war. This 
support is estimated to be as much as 2.7 million people. These 
disclosures follow claims by both the rightwing and the 
government claiming the allegiance of the security forces, and 
the ongoing shambles around the National Peacekeeping Force. 
  Independent sources also confirm that while the rightwing 
may 
not truthfully claim the support of the entire defence force, 
those who are part of the all-white commando system, especially 
in many rural areas, seen to have strong rightwing sympathies. 
Some commando members have refused to obey to call-up orders 
while others are reported to have hoisting the Vierkleur [Old 
Republican Play] in front of their offices. The document also 
contains "unconfirmed" allegations concerning military 
co-operation between the different members of the Freedom 
Alliance. Among these allegations are that members are 
supplying, securing and caching arms. 
  According to the document, several people formerly linked to 
the SADF or South African Police are also involved in training 
Inkatha Freedom Party members in rural Zululand. Mention is 
also made of the possibility of heavy armaments, including 
aircraft and artillery, being available to the Freedom Alliance. 
These allegations were given substance this week when ANC 
[African National Congress] Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa 
said at a session of the Transitional Executive Council that 
people were being trained and armed in Natal with the apparent 
aim of "serving the stated goal of certain parties". 
  He added that between 500 and 1,000 people were being 
trained 
and armed in Northern Natal every fortnight. The document 
reasons that the AVF and its Freedom Alliance partners have the 
capacity to seriously destabilise the security situation in 
South Africa, but that this will depend on a "collective will" 
to actually embark on destabilising actions. 
  The authors of the document estimate the AVF's active 
paramilitary capacity at between 20,000 and 30,000 people. 
Factors favouring the AVF are seen as the concentration of 
supporters in the Transvaal and, [Orange] Free State and the 
high level of military and intelligence expertise of some of its 
leading members. 
  A "collective will" to go into action will be strengthened 
by 
a perception that the option of negotiation has failed and that 
resistance may be the only alternative to realise the right's 
political ideals. 
  Other factors bolstering the rightwing are "a government 
policy perceived to be unsympathetic" and "socio-economic 
realities such as unemployment". The document nevertheless 
concludes that the following factors, among others, may 
"inhibit" the potential of destabilising actions: 

  -  A moral tradition in conservative communities of 
reluctance to become involved in passive or violent resistance. 
  -  A fear, especially among whites, of loss of material 
possession 
and jobs if they participate in violence. 
  -  Dedicated security force action aimed at nipping rightwing 
resistance in the bud. 
  -  Uncertainty about the support of "black" Freedom Alliance 
members.

<F P=106> [By Chris Louw] </F>
  [Text] Rightwing burgerrade (civil councils) are poised to 
take over about 283 town councils in a bid to thwart the 
integration of local government. With the elections due next 
month, the battle has shifted from national level to city and 
town councils in a groundswell described as "extremely 
dangerous" by local government officials. 
  Transvaal Boerekommando [Boer Commando] members have started 
barricading municipal offices with razor-wire and sandbags. 
They have declared open war on the Local Government Transition 
Act, which allows for the replacement of all-white councils by 
appointed non-racial councils. 
  The Afrikaner Volksfront (AVF) [Afrikaner National Front] is 
ready to play its final trump card to thwart the transition 
constitution -- by hijacking town and city councils in all four 
provinces. The four provincial administrations are readying 
themselves to clamp down on far-right resistance to the new 
constitution. 
  A senior Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] official 
said: "The town councils issue is clearly just an excuse for 
whipping up emotions to mobilise their people. 
  "The ultimate aim is to force political concessions on the 
national level, and get the idea of a volkstaat [homeland] 
accepted. The broader aim makes their actions on the ground 
extremely dangerous." 
  Open confrontation seems inevitable. The AVF and other 
groups have been warned by the authorities that attempts to take 
over control of councils would be "unconstitutional and 
unlawful". Transvaal Local Government MEC [Member of Executive 
Committee] Burger Lategan has said the full force of the law 
will be used to counter these attempts. A TPA spokesman said 
yesterday that May 2 would be the cut-off date for the 
implementation of "local transitional councils", he said. 
  But the AVF has also made clear its intention to use its 
power at local government level to thwart agreements reached at 
the Local Government Negotiating Forum last year, allowing for 
non-racial city councils during the transition. A list of 283 
cities and towns declared as "volkstaat territory" was given to 
the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN by Conservative Party [CP] organising 
secretary Wouter Hoffman. The AVF is establishing burgerrade in 
these towns, poised to take over their administration when 
non-racial councils come into being. 
  Hoffman claimed the towns -- stretching from Richards Bay in 
Natal, through the Transvaal and [Orange] Free State to the Cape 
Province and as far north as Namaqualand -- had indicated their 
intention to become part of an Afrikaner volkstaat. 
  The CP determines majority support for a volkstaat by 
council 
decisions, opinion surveys and a clear "trend" among whites. A 
senior CP member in Natal said his party believed existing 
councils had no legitimacy after the postponement of the 1993 
municipal elections and the appointment of councillors by 
administrators. Elected councillors enjoy greater protection in 
terms of the law. If appointed, they become employees and may be 
fired. "We expect councillors to be fired any time from now. 
That is why we have instituted our own burgerrade, which will 
function when they lose their positions." 
  In parliament this week, President F W de Klerk slammed the 
idea of a volkstaat in Pretoria. The city's economy would be 
destroyed, said Pretoria Mayor Nico Stofberg. 
  In Akasia, National Party councillow Hannes van Schoor 
resigned in protest this week after a council decision to break 
ties with the Rosslyn Industrialists' Association and to donate 
R20,000 [rand] to Radio Pretoria. The decision could lead to a 
loss in income of R85-million a year. 
  A recent decision by the CP-controlled Transvaal Municipal 
Association not to participate in forums for a new local 
government dispensation sparked a government warning that local 
councils may be dissolved.

  [Text] Tzaneen March 7 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela on Monday [7 March] blamed 
township violence on the government's refusal to deploy troops 
in affected areas. Commenting on Sunday's massacre in Bhambayi, 
in which 11 people were killed, he said the ANC's recommendation 
that the police Internal Stability Division [ISD] be withdrawn 
was being "opposed at the highest level". "The government is 
moving very slowly on this issue. That is because it is still a 
white minority government which regards the lives of blacks as 
cheap -- like that of flies, " the ANC president said. 
  Mr Mandela, who is on a three-day electioneering visit to 
the 
Northern Transvaal, was speaking to reporters soon after 
arriving by helicopter at Sekororo in rural Lebowa. He said 
killings such as that at Bhambayi should be expected because of 
the government's failure to maintain law and order. "Until the 
government decides to carry out our recommendations, the 
violence will worsen. We are doing our best to address the 
violence but we are not the government." 
  Mr Mandela said the ISD was regarded by township communities 
as "carrying out war against the people." He said violence had 
subsided in East Rand townships after the deployment of the 
Army, but the conflict had now shifted to areas such as 
Bekkersdal and Bhambayi. 
  The ANC leader said his movement would "be able to use the 
capacity and resources of the state" to end violence and 
maintain law and order after the April elections. 
  Later, addressing a peoples' forum at the Sekororo 
showgrounds, about 50km south of Tzaneen, Mr Mandela vowed there 
would never be an Afrikaner "volkstaat" in South Africa as long 
as he lived. Mr Mandela heard several complaints from residents 
of the rural settlement about untarred roads, a shortage of 
classrooms, a lack of running water and unemployment. He said 
an ANC government would build houses, provide schools, tar roads 
and act decisively to end the exploitation of farm workers. 
  He accused the National Party of spreading lies by claiming 
an ANC government would seize pensions. "Any government that 
takes away pension benefits from old people is not fit to 
govern. The ANC can never commit such cruelty." 
  Mr Mandela is to address another peoples' forum in Sekhopo 
before flying on to Venda on Monday night.

<F P=106> [Report by Jimmy Seepe] </F>
  [Text] There was increasing concern in ANC [African 
National Congress] ranks this week following rumours that yet 
another of the organisation's leaders was being targeted by 
assassins. 
  Police this week dispatched a confidential communique to the 
ANC saying that they had been told by an unnamed source that 
former ANC Youth League [ANCYL] president Peter Mokaba would be 
assassinated by disaffected members of the league. 
  Police named one of the alleged assassins, saying their 
information suggested that he and 10 of his friends planned to 
assassinate Mokaba. 
  "The reason for the planned action, according to the 
anonymous caller, is that Peter Mokaba `sold out' members of the 
ANCYL to the police," the police communique says. 
  Information relating to threats against Mokaba's life comes 
just days after General Constand Viljoen is said to have 
volunteered information about a plot to assassinate ANC 
secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa. 
  Rapu Molekane, former deputy general secretary of the ANC 
PWV 
[Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] region and current 
candidate in the regional legislature, told SUNDAY NATION that 
the organisation had received information about the alleged 
planned assassination of Mokaba. 
  "Mokaba knows about his plan," said Molekane. "As in the 
past, we are treating the information very seriously". 
  However, Molekane said the ANCYL investigations had not been 
able to establish whether in fact there was a person such as the 
one named in the police warning to the ANC. 
  "No one in the youth league knows such a person," he said. 
  According to the police, the alleged assassin is said to be 
attached to the Boksburg East Branch of the youth league. 
  But SUNDAY NATION's enquiries revealed that the branch did 
not have anyone that answered to the name contained in the 
police warning. 
  "Anyone can be an anonymous caller," Molekane said. 
  "We do not know whether this is simply more disinformation 
from the police to try and cause confusion and panic in the 
movement," he said. "Although we welcome any information from 
the police, we cannot trust everything they say." He said 
Mokaba was not surprised by this information since there had 
been other assassination plots and attempts on his life since 
the death of the SACP [South African Communist Party] general 
secretary Chris Hani. 
  Two weeks prior Hani's murder, police issued a statement 
alleging that Hani had hired people to rob a bank and 
subsequently failed to give them their share and as a result, 
they were planning to kill him. 
  ANC legal chief Matthew Phosa said in Hani's case, the 
police 
statement was clearly aimed at creating a smoke-screen for the 
Rightwing to assassinate Hani. 
  He said this could be deduced from the fact that the 
gangsters allegedly waiting to kill Hani were nowhere at the 
scene of Hani's killing. 
  "The latest information smacks of a similar classical scheme 
to assassinate either Mokaba or any of the ANC leaders in order 
to derail the election process said Phosa. 
  Others in the ANC believe that the recent information about 
assassination plots may well be aimed at trying to sow confusion 
and panic in the ranks of the ANC leadership and that there 
might well be a plot to kill someone. 
  Confusion and panic would make the task of the assassin much 
easier, ANC leaders said. 
  They also point out that it is interesting that attempts 
were 
being made to revive rumours of Mokaba's alleged role as a 
police spy. These rumours first emerged in 1990, soon after the 
unbanning of the ANC. 
  But so far, no irrefutable proof has been brought forward to 
support the rumours.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 7 SAPA -- At least 245 people 
were killed and 302 people injured or wounded in political 
violence in South Africa in February in the seventh successive 
month of decline in such violence, the Human Rights Commission 
[HRC] said on Monday [7 March]. The HRC said in a report it 
recorded 361 incidents of politically-motivated violence in 
February as compared to 509 incidents in January. "The February 
death toll of 245 is significantly down from the January figure 
of 328 and reconfirms the strong downward trend in political 
violence. February recorded the seventh successive month of 
decline in political violence as measured by death toll," the 
report said. It said the average daily death toll dipped below 
nine this month and seemed headed back to the level of six per 
day which was prevalent at the same time last year. 
  The HRC said 70 of the dead in February were African 
National 
Congress [ANC] supporters and 31 supporters of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party. The victims included 12 African National 
Congress supporters massacred at Masunkazane in Richmond in 
Natal, and 15 ANC activists massacred at Mahlele in Creighton, 
also in Natal. 
  The HRC said 20 women, 25 children, nine commuters and six 
members of the security forces were among those killed in 
February. 
  It said Natal now firmly occupied the violence centre-stage 
with 66 per cent of the national toll in February. Nonetheless 
the provisional figure of 161 deaths in February in Natal was 
still a little lower than any figure during the past eight 
months. "Peace initiatives in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region are succeeding in returning violence levels 
to the manageable proportions of a year ago. The PWV region 
seems now to be well on its way to being stabilised, but sub 
regions which are still unsettled are West Rand, Alexandra, Vaal 
and of course the East Rand which accounted for 62 per cent of 
PWV deaths in February."

<H5>  Main Events and Trends in February </H5>
  Peace initiatives in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region are succeeding in returning violence levels 
to the manageable proportions of a year ago. 
  Natal is now strongly centre-stage in the political violence 
with 66 percent of countrywide deaths in February; this is 
clearly where maximum effort needs to be concentrated. 
  Two major massacres were recorded in the Midlands sub-region 
of Natal. 
  Women and children accounted for 18 percent of all deaths in 
February. 
  Amongst February victims were 9 commuters, 20 women, 25 
children and 6 security force members; reports identified 70 ANC 
[African National Congress] supporters and 31 IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] supporters amongst the dead. 
  Detention without trial continues unbridled with Sections 29 
and Section 50 of the ISA [Internal Security Act] in constant 
use.

and at the end of the month 14 such areas were in effect, all in 
the Eastern Cape. 
  By the end of February, legislation assented to last 
December 
which would repeal Section 29 of the ISA, had still not been 
brought into effect. 
Detention Without Trial 
  During February extensive use was made of detention powers 
under the ISA, using both Section 29 (on 54 persons) and Section 
50 (on 18 persons). 
  At month end, 30 persons were still being held in detention 
without trial. 
<H5>  Deaths in Police Custody </H5>
  During February, 3 deaths in police custody were reported. 
<H5>  Political Trials </H5>
  During February, another 13 political trials were completed, 
none resulting in jail sentences. 
  At month end, 55 trials were ongoing involving 548 accused, 
nearly half of them in Bophuthatswana 
<H5>  Death Row </H5>
  Four persons were given death sentences in February. Death 
row now has 330 occupants. 
<H5>  Repression of Gatherings and Political Activity </H5>
  Extensive interference in political activity related to the 
forthcoming elections was perpetrated by Bophuthatswana security 
forces. 
  An ANC march in Standerton was banned and broken up see HRC 
[Human Rights Commission] Election Watch No.2 for interference 
in freedom of political activity in February. 
<H6>  Political Violence </H6>
<H5>  General Comment </H5>
  February recorded the seventh successive month of decline in 
political violence as measured by deathtoll. Average daily 
death toll dipped below 9 this month and seems head back to the 
level of 6 per day which was prevalent this time last year, and 
a far cry from the level of 20 per day during last July. 
<H5>  Incidents of Violence </H5>
  During February, HRC recorded 361 incidents of political 
violence, appreciably down from the 509 of January and from the 
464 average of last year. 
<H5>  Deaths and Injuries </H5>

  The February deathtoll of 245 is significantly down from the 
January figure of 328 and reconfirms the strong downward trend 
in political violence. 
  There has been a 60 percent drop since the July peak. The 
injury count for February was 302, higher than January, but 
below last year's average. 
<H5>  Major Massacres </H5>
  Two major massacres (10 or more deaths) were recorded in 
February, both of them in the Midlands sub-region of Natal: 
  On the 6th February, 12 ANC supporters were killed at 
Masunkazane (Richmond) 
  On the 18th February, 15 ANC supporters were killed at 
Mahlele (Creighton) 
Regional Analysis 
  The PWV deathtoll recorded a dramatic drop to 69 in 
February, 
compared with 142 in January and vindicated the replacement of 
the Internal Stability Unit of the SAP [South African Police] by 
units of the SA Defence Force as the primary peacekeeping force 
in the area. The PWV region seems now to be well on its way to 
being stabilised, but sub regions which are still unsettled are 
West Rand, Alexandra, Vaal and of course the East Rand which 
accounted for 62 percent of PWV deaths in February. 
  Natal is now strongly centre-stage in the political violence 
with 66 percent of the countrywide deaths in February. The 
provisional figure of 161 deaths is nevertheless a little lower 
than any figure during the last eight months. 
  Other regions accounted for 15 deaths, or 6 percent of 
national total. 
<H5>  Some Components of the Violence </H5>
  Security force actions resulted in fewer deaths in February 
(7 against 11 in January) but in the high number of 105 injuries 
due to the use of rubber bullets and birdshot during incidents 
at Standerton and Primrose gold mine. 
  Attacks on security forces declined noticeably in February, 
result in 6 deaths and 16 injuries in the course of 30 incidents. 
  Right wing activity continues to mount and was responsible 
for 2 deaths and 17 injuries in 31 incidents. 
  Taxi conflict claimed 5 lives in February. 
  A number of incidents of industrial and education conflict 
occurred, but caused no loss of life.

  [Text] One-hundred-seventeen members of the National 
Peacekeeping Force receiving training at the General De Wet 
training center outside Bloemfontein have resigned since the 
start of the weekend. A spokesman for the force said that 
reasons for the resignations varied from domestic problems to 
dissatisfaction with conditions at the base. 
  About 70 members of the force resigned last week after a 
strike over salaries. However, the spokesman said that 
conditions at the base had returned to normal and that training 
had been resumed. He said a delegation from the Transitional 
Executive Council would visit the base this afternoon to help 
solve the problem.

  [Text] The Portuguese foreign minister, Dr. Jose Manuel 
Barroso, has warned that there is not much time left for an 
all-inclusive political settlement in South Africa and that 
there's potential for civil conflict if this fails. He was 
addressing a news conference in Johannesburg after meeting CP 
[Conservative Party] leader, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg. Dr. Barroso 
said that he had urged Dr. Hartzenberg to be flexible and to 
consider participation in the election. 
  Dr. Barroso, who is on a visit to South Africa, is to meet 
Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leader Constand 
Viljoen later today.

  [Text] South Africa and Russia have signed an agreement 
providing for closer cooperation in the areas of labor and 
social relations. Speaking at the ceremony in Pretoria, 
Manpower Minister Leon Wessels said that South Africa had 
survived a protracted period of isolationism, however, now that 
doors were opening to the country, it was becoming clear that it 
needed to make up lost time. The Russian-South African 
agreement, he said, would enable the two countries to exchange 
knowledge and expertise.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Bophuthatswana Rejection of Election Process Baffling -- 
"Who, for example, would ever have imagined General Tienie 
Groenewald coming out on the side of those advocating 
participation in the election?" asks a page-16 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 8 March. "The thinking 
behind the apparent shift in tactics of Groenewald, Afrikaner 
Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] leader General 
Constand Viljoen and a group of dissatisfied Conservative Party 
MPs is driven by pragmatism." In view of this, THE STAR is 
baffled by Bophuthatswana's decision not to participate in the 
election. "Perhaps the crowing from those threatening to bring 
the homeland to its knees played a part in the cabinet decision 
to stay out of the process. Reality is, however, staring the 
homeland leadership in the face. Its administration is 
tottering, its independence is clearly unsustainable without the 
support of its people, and the Freedom Alliance which lent it 
some muscle is in disarray." THE STAR believes Bophuthatswana's 
Lucas Mangope will be "persuaded to see reality" if a 
"face-saving formula can be found." 
  Zimbabwe Land Scandal -- A second editorial on the same page 
notes: "Reports from Harare say many State-owned farms, taken 
away from white tenants ostensibly to resettle black peasant 
families, have been leased to politicians, senior civil servants 
and military officers. Among them is Witness Mangwende, who as 
Agriculture Minister navigated the Land Acquisition Act through 
parliament. Anywhere else in the world this would be considered 
a scandal. But from President Robert Mugabe, not a word. In 
his last recorded speech on the land question late last year, he 
told his ZANU PF [Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic 
Front] party that the government would not surrender the 
people's right to land to `a greedy band of racist usurpers'. 
Are Zimbabweans to infer that a greedy group of a different hue 
is acceptable?" 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Concern of National Peacekeeping Force `Incidents' -- A 
page-8 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 8 March 
refers to the reports from Bloemfontein that members of the 
National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) "were involved in a brawl at 
the weekend with locals. Police had to use teargas to disperse 
a rowdy group after NPKF members were allegedly robbed." The 
latest in "a string of incidents" is that of "117 members 
quitting in disgust. To think, they haven't even started active 
duties yet. Heaven help us." 
<H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>
  Warning Against ANC Social Programs Promises -- "Among 
innumerable election offerings the ANC has pro6ised to build a 
million houses within five years of taking power," notes a 
page-14 editorial in Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 6 
March. The African National Congress (ANC) has also "promised 
to give preference to labour-intensive schemes that will provide 
jobs for millions of unemployed people in South Africa." While 
CITY PRESS doesn't "doubt the ANC's ability to embark on 
extensive social programmes, we have certain reservations. 
Raising hopes to such a fever pitch at this volatile stage may 
not be the right thing to do." CITY PRESS advises the ANC "to 
take a leaf from the experiences of many other African 
governments who swept to power on similar promises only to find 
themselves faced with an angry electorate and no means to 
placate them."

  [Text] In Benin, joint maneuvers between the national army 
and the French army lasting until 11 March are starting today. 
Similar maneuvers have just taken place in Cote d'Ivoire. The 
Nigerian authorities are very unhappy with these Franco-Beninese 
maneuvers, calling them a show of force. It must be stressed 
that Nigeria was quite annoyed by the recent arrival of French 
military reinforcements in Cameroon while relations between the 
two countries are extremely tense following their border 
dispute. However, France has often stressed that these joint 
maneuvers had been planned for a long time and had nothing to do 
with the situation in Nigeria. More details from Daniel 
Desesquelles: 
  [Desesquelles] The FAR, Force d'Action Rapide, [Rapid 
Reaction Force] staff has been planning these Franco-African 
maneuvers with the Ivorian and Beninese staffs for nearly a 
year. Therefore they are not linked in any way with the border 
dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria; besides, Lagos has sent 
observers for the whole duration of the maneuvers. These 
Franco-African maneuvers take place every three years with one 
or two African armies. While Ivorians are used to training with 
the French, it is the first time the Beninese Army has trained 
in an international environment. Some 1,000 French soldiers are 
taking part in this exercise; they belong to the 43th Marine 
Battalion based in Abidjan which was reinforced by a company of 
the 8th Marine Paratrooper Regiment. The navy dispatched three 
light naval craft. Air drops and amphibious operations are on 
the agenda, but the main new event is the presence of three 
Mirage F-1CT which will be used in the ground attack role. This 
is the first time this latest version of the Mirage F-1 has been 
deployed in Africa.

  [Text] Despite the arrival of ECOWAS [Economic Community of 
West African States] chairman, President Nicephore Soglo of 
Benin, and other high-level dignitaries in Monrovia, the 
Liberian National Transitional Government [LNTG] has still not 
been seated. This is due to delay tactics being orchestrated by 
the Monrovia Group and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia]. Reports say in Monrovia, they are trying 
to sort out the status of Mr. Thomas Ziah who was reportedly 
replaced by ULIMO but rejected by the ULIMO military high 
command. Other dignitaries in Monrovia to witness the occasion 
include ECOWAS executive secretary, Dr. Edouard Benjamin; the 
Ivorian foreign minister, Amara Essy; Nigeria's foreign 
minister, Babagana Kingibe; and General Arnold Quainoo, 
representing the Ghanaian Government. The representatives of 
various international and local organizations are also in 
Monrovia for the ceremony. 
  At the same time, news say the NPRA [National Patriotic 
Reconstruction Assembly] delegation to the Monrovia inauguration 
of Liberia's collective leadership, headed by Vice President 
Enoch Dogolee, has been blocked in Kakata from attending the 
seating of the transitional government. The NPRA Government's 
delegation was being escorted by the UN Observer Mission. This 
move by ULIMO in Kakata comes in the wake of assurances by 
UNOMIL [United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia] and ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] that all is set for the seating of the LNTG unhindered. 
  Earlier, ULIMO military commander, General Roosevelt 
Johnson, 
made a trip to Kakata at which time he gave an assurance that 
his men will strictly adhere to the free movement of people, but 
this has since been violated by his soldiers. Similar 
undisciplined behavior by ULIMO fighters occurred during the 
opening of the road when the US ambassador and several other 
dignitaries were stopped from traveling through Kakata. ULIMO 
has been openly defying the mandate of the UN and ECOMOG by 
seizing and looting UN relief convoys, bringing in supplies to 
Greater Liberia. 
  The NPRA Government is yet to react to the stopping of its 
delegation by ULIMO to attend the inaugural ceremony. The 
ECOMOG high command has also not intervened to get the NPRA 
Government's delegation through Kakata despite its assurances 
that all is set for the seating of the LNTG today.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] It has been a day of political confusion in Liberia 
today, where the Transitional Council was due to be sworn in 
this morning. Last week, the leadership of ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] which signed the 
Cotonou Peace Accord with the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia] and the interim government, was split by a challenge to 
Alhaji Koromah. Today's swearing-in ceremony was delayed after 
it was reported that the NPFL had made a last-minute change to 
its nominee on the council replacing Isaac Musa with Robert 
Brice. From Monrovia, Nianate Allison telexed this report. 
  Liberians today joyously sang national songs and shouted: 
The Lone Star forever, Lone Star forever, as the country moved 
closer to reunification with the induction into office of the 
five-man Transitional Council. The faces of many in the 
half-century-old Centennial Hall were brightened when Chief 
Justice James Bull administered the oath of office of the 
five-member council. The ceremony finally began after nearly 
five hours of delay. An official of the outgoing interim 
government said later the delay was to clear remaining hurdles. 
Council Chairman David Kpomakpor and Phillip Banks are nominees 
of the dissolved interim government of Amos Sawyer; while 
co-chairman, Isaac Musa, represents the NPFL. ULIMO is 
represented by Mohamed Sheriff and (Dexter Tayul). 
  ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] chairman, 
Benin's president Nicephore Soglo, who attended the ceremony, 
urged Liberians to unite and work rapidly to achieve the 
democratic institutions you have so long desired. He said: 
Everyone of you have much to forgive and to forget because that 
is the only way peace can come to Liberia.

  [Text] The chairman of the State Council of the Liberia 
National Transitional Government, Counselor David Kpomakpor, has 
called on Liberians to reunite and rebuild a peaceful and 
(?prosperous nation). Chairman Kpomakpor made the call 
yesterday in an inaugural address delivered shortly after his 
induction as the chairman of the council. He said the task of 
rebuilding Liberia is an enormous one but said that it could be 
done once all Liberians are willing and committed in rebuilding 
their country. He expressed his deep appreciation to the ECOWAS 
[Economic Community of West African States] and the entire 
international community for their assistance to Liberia in its 
hour of need and pledged the council's commitment to an upright, 
(?democratic) government.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Under the ECOWAS [Economic 
Community of West African States] peace agreement signed last 
July, the collective presidency comprising the NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia], the outgoing interim government, 
and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] 
is supposed to lead the country through democratic elections 
scheduled for 7 September this year. The inauguration of the new 
ruling body is also to coincide with the disarming of the 
various factions by the ECOWAS peace monitoring group, ECOMOG 
[ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. Reports say ECOMOG has 
set up six sites around Monrovia where weapons will be 
collected. The United Nations is supervising the disarmament 
process but reports say that Mr. Taylor's faction is still 
uncooperative. 
  [Begin Taylor recording] We will fight and continue to fight 
anyone wanting to subvert the sovereignty of this nation by 
trying to take this land. They will have to fight me and 
everyone else after me if they intend to stay here forever. [end 
recording] 
  While the ECOMOG troops man checkpoints and ensure general 
security of life and property arms are still carried freely by 
members of the warring factions. Interim President Amos Sawyer 
is wary of this development. 
  [Begin Sawyer recording] We see that in Somalia; we see that 
elsewhere. Why are we immune from that kind of business, and why 
do we need anybody to go out there and stir this up? [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] The ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] high command has warned the 
leadership of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia] not to allow their infighting in Tubmanburg to spill 
over into Monrovia. ECOMOG field commander, Major General John 
Inienger, gave the warning yesterday when he summoned the 
dismissed leader of ULIMO, Alhaji Koromah, for consultations. A 
serious split developed within the ranks of ULIMO between Krahn 
elements loyal to ULIMO military chief, Roosevelt Johnson, and 
Mandingo elements of Alhaji Koromah following the failure of Dr. 
Mohamed Sheriff to obtain a position on the State Council. Dr. 
Sheriff was being supported by Alhaji Koromah, but lost the vice 
chairmanship of the council to Mr. Thomas Ziah of the same 
organization. Ziah is being supported by General Roosvelt 
Johnson and other Krahn elements within ULIMO. 
  Following news of Mr. Ziah's election over Dr. Sheriff, 
ULIMO 
leader Koromah has announced the sacking of Ziah and replaced 
him (?by Dr. Sheriff). The dismissal of Mr. Ziah who challenged 
[words indistinct] the military wing of ULIMO subsequently 
announced the dismissal of Alhaji Koromah. Gen. Roosevelt 
Johnson announced that he had taken over the leadership of 
ULIMO, disbanded the political wing [words indistinct]. Reports 
say the infighting in ULIMO has led to serious gun battle among 
its soldiers at the Po River in Tubmanburg ULIMO headquarters. 
The fighting was sparked off after Alhaji Koromah ordered the 
disarming of Krahn elements of ULIMO loyal to Johnson. Johnson 
forces are reported to have resisted the order, which resulted 
in a serious gun battle. Alhaji Koromah is said to be confused 
as the situation is now reported to be beyond his control. Of 
late, Koromah has been attempting to commercialize ULIMO [word 
indistinct] $5 million as compensation to cooperate with the 
peace process.

  [Text] President Alpha Oumar Konare this morning received 
French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, who had already held 
a working session with Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and 
Finance Minister Soumaila Cisse. Discussions centered on 
France's cooperation to support the Malian Government's and 
people's efforts following the devaluation of the CFA franc. 
Here is Michel Roussin speaking to Mahamadou Kone. 
  [Begin Roussin recording] During this working session, we 
discussed how to organize our cooperation at this difficult time 
for us all -- for Malians and their brothers in other franc zone 
countries and also for us, the French. A number of pledges have 
been made and as Prime Minister Edouard Balladur stated and 
President Mitterrand reiterated in Yamoussoukro, France honors 
its commitments and France is here to support the substantial 
efforts made by the government and especially by the people, who 
understand that once this difficult period is over, it will be 
followed by economic growth and development will become a 
reality. For this reason, we must remain by the side of our 
African partners and this is what I have come to discuss in 
concrete terms with the prime minister and the finance minister. 
  My talks were less technical with the president than they 
were with the prime minister and the finance minister. The 
president gave a broad overview of the prevailing situation in 
the subregion. Of course, we also discussed how to manage the 
effects of the devaluation. I confirmed to the president 
France's friendly support for Mali during this delicate period, 
as my presence here today in Bamako with a large delegation 
attests. We also discussed the upcoming summit in Ouagadougou, 
where leaders of the members of the West African Economic and 
Monetary Union are scheduled to meet and together draw the first 
conclusions from the effects of the devaluation and get 
organized for the next phase of this courageous exercise which 
-- I am optimistic -- can enable everyone to experience an 
economic rebirth. [end recording] 
  Mahamadou Kone also informs us that the French cooperation 
minister will leave Bamako for Paris this afternoon.

  [Text] Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, the director of 
Nigeria's defense information, has reasserted Nigeria's claim to 
the Bakassi Peninsula. He said that the peninsula, including 
its eastern part of (?Zabari), had been part of Nigerian 
territory since 1914 and will remain so. 
  Speaking on a Voice of Nigeria interview, Brig. Gen. Chijuka 
said the territory which Cameroonians are also claiming, was 
handed over to Nigeria at independence by the British who 
themselves had controlled the area since their 1914 agreement 
with the French. He said that because of its brotherly attitude 
towards its neighbors, Nigeria has consistently refused to be 
provoked by the incessant crossborder harassments by Cameroon, 
some of which had resulted in the loss of Nigerian lives. The 
defense information director said Cameroon had not reciprocated 
Nigeria's good neighborliness and so Nigeria now had a prime 
objective to assert its presence in the peninsula and make all 
know that the area belongs to it.

  [Text] Atabong (Bakassi Peninsula), 8 March (PANA) -- 
Nigerian fishermen on the disputed Bakassi Peninsula say they 
are still being harassed by Cameroonian gendarmes. Local 
residents of Atabong West, with Nigerian troops, told the PAN 
AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY Tuesday [8 March] that the latest harassment 
was on Sunday when the Cameroonians seized six fishing canoe 
engines at sea. The engines were valued at 23,000 dollars 
(500,000 naira). The occupants, who were left adrift at sea, 
were rescued by other Nigerian fishermen, the residents said. 
The 1,000 square kilometre oil-rich peninsula is claimed by 
Nigeria and Cameroon. Tension in the area heightened after 
reported clashes between troops of both countries on 18 and 19 
February. Nigeria denied there were any clashes. The residents 
claim that Atabong is a village in Nigeria's south-eastern state 
of Akwa Ibom. The shanty settlement is inhabited mainly by 
fishermen and traders, most of them Effik-speaking Ibos, A 
Nigerian ethnic group. 
  Now, it is on the "frontline", where Nigerian troops on the 
western part of the village are only separated by the sea from 
the Cameroonian troops on the east. Both sides see each other's 
gun boats and monitor detailed movements with binoculars. 
According to military sources the proximity at one end of the 
frontline is "as close as 1,000 metres separating the opposing 
troops." 
  Edem Akamino, the chief of Atabong, claimed the Cameroonian 
gendarmes had collected "illegal levies and taxes, beaten up 
fishermen, raped women, maimed and killed Nigerians since the 
end of the Nigerian civil war in 1970." The fishermen say they 
are now encouraged to fish in the zone because of the presence 
of Nigerian troops. "We know it is risky but is our only means 
of livelihood," one of them told PANA. 
  Atabong is one of the string of about 30 shanty villages 
comprising mainly thatched houses dotting the disputed peninsula. 
  Akamino, who said he has lived there since 1960, said he has 
always known the place to be Nigerian. 
  Cameroon, which bases its claim to the island on a 1913 
agreement between Germany and Britain, has taken the dispute to 
the UN Security Council and informed the International Court of 
Justice at The Hague and the OAU. 
  France has also deployed paratroopers in Cameroon under 
their 
defense pact. 
  A summit meeting between the two countries is planned for 
Nigeria, while Togolese president Gnassingbe Eyadema has began 
diplomatic moves to settle the dispute.

  [Text] Nairobi, 8 March (AFP) -- A Saudi Arabian Airlines 
plane was hijacked early Tuesday [8 March] on a flight between 
Addis Ababa and Jiddah and made an emergency landing here, the 
Saudi Airlines office in the Kenyan capital said. All 159 
passengers were allowed to leave the plane, an Airbus, after it 
landed around 4:30 A.M. (0130 GMT) and only two crew members 
remained on board, the captain and his co-pilot, the spokesman 
said. The passengers, almost of whom were Ethiopian, were safe, 
he said. 
  There were thought to be three or four hijackers, according 
to the spokesman. He said airport officials were negotiating 
with the hijackers, but gave no official details on their 
demands. But an unofficial source at Jomo Kenyatta Airport said 
the hijackers were demanding to fly to Italy and told airport 
officials to re-fuel the plan. The Saudi ambassador to Nairobi 
had rushed to the scene, the Saudi Embassy here said, but gave 
no other information.

  [Excerpts] President Yoweri Museveni and President Juvenal 
Habyarimana of Rwanda have agreed to set up a joint technical 
commission to study the problem of Rwandan refugees in Uganda 
and to recommend a permanent solution to the problem and work 
out modalities for their orderly return home. The two leaders 
also recommended the holding of a regional summit of east and 
central African states and governments to discuss the issue of 
refugees in the region. This was disclosed by President 
Museveni at the opening of bilateral official talks between the 
delegations of the two countries at the Lake Victoria Hotel in 
Entebbe this afternoon. 
  The two leaders have just concluded their fruitful 
tete-a-tete at which they reviewed the general situation 
relating to Rwandan refugees. President Yoweri Museveni 
welcomed President Habyarimana, who was making his third visit 
to Uganda in three years. He said the two countries, like 
others in the region, shared a lot in common among their 
peoples, especially their common languages and historic 
linkages, which, he noted, were ready infrastructures that could 
be used by leaders in the region to unite the people and work 
towards giving them good life and better living standards other 
than trying to divide them. The president assured his guest 
that Uganda is ready to do everything possible to assist in the 
process of establishing lasting peace in Rwanda. 
  On his part, President Habyarimana said he recognizes 
Uganda's contribution towards the implementation of the Arusha 
peace accord which put in place institutions of transition to 
lasting peace in his country. He was optimistic that these 
institutions will be firmly established in Rwanda to solve the 
problem of refugees and to allow the people of his country to 
fully enjoy peace and stability. 
  He said that the meeting being organized by church leaders 
and by the special representative of the United Nations in his 
country make him optimistic about the process of establishing 
these institutions. The Rwandan leader further explained that 
the contacts he is always making with President Museveni are 
always aimed at restoring peace and stability in the region and 
to see how their people can resume living together in peace as 
before. He also said that the two neighboring countries should 
look towards the future with confidence and optimism. 
  In a joint communique signed by the two leaders at the end 
of 
President Habyarimana's working visit, President Yoweri Museveni 
commended President Habyarimana and through him the entire 
people of Rwanda for the efforts made so far in implementing the 
peace agreement signed between the Government of Rwanda and the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front on 4 August 1993 in Arusha, Tanzania. 
He expressed the hope that the deadlock which has delayed the 
installation of the transitional government would be overcome 
soon so that the long- awaited era of peace, national 
reconciliation, and development of the people of Rwanda and 
stability in the subregion could begin. 
  The two heads of state, the communique adds, expressed 
appreciation to the United Nations for its role in overseeing 
the implementation of the peace accord. They renewed their call 
to the international community to render both moral and material 
assistance to facilitate the implementation of the peace 
agreement. The two leaders reviewed the relationship between 
their two countries and renewed their commitment to enhancing 
cooperation. In this regard, they noted that traffic within the 
northern corridor is still badly affected by the situation in 
Rwanda and that it has adversely affected the economies of the 
countries in the subregion. They called for the reopening of 
the transit route as soon as possible. The two presidents 
discussed the Rwandan refugee problem and confirmed their 
commitment to resolve the matter once and for all. 
  With regard to the Kagera Basin Organization, KBO, the two 
leaders reviewed the progress made in the implementation of its 
projects and programs and reaffirmed their commitment to the 
objectives of the organization. 
  Answering questions from the press shortly before departure, 
President Juvenal Habyarimana said he was committed to full 
implementation of the Arusha peace accord and called on the 
parties concerned to do the same. He accused some factions of 
two political parties in the opposition in Rwanda of placing 
obstacles to peace and of lack of seriousness in observing the 
recommendations of the peace agreement. 
  On the allegation of ambushes by government troops against 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front, particularly at (Gasaka) in 
northern Rwanda, President Habyarimana said he had asked the 
commander of the UN force in the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda 
to investigate and report back. He said he is still waiting for 
their findings. 
  Asked about the hurried return of Rwandan refugees from 
Uganda now under way, President Museveni assured the 
international community that there is no pressure on them to 
return home. He, however, observed that Ugandan political 
opportunists resented their presence and used them as a 
scapegoat to problems in the country. In this connection, the 
refugees themselves felt the indignity of their status in a 
foreign country and were naturally anxious to return home. 
[passage omitted] 
  President Habyarimana was later seen off at Entebbe Airport 
by President Museveni, cabinet ministers, ambassadors, and 
senior government officials.

overnight after another day of tension, with no signs of an 
alleged coup. Feelings ran high yesterday following a 
Bophuthatswana cabinet decision not to participate in the April 
election. The announcement came amid an already volatile 
situation as civil servants demanding reincorporation into South 
Africa continued their strike. At the Mmabatho Sun Hotel, which 
was occupied by disgruntled workers yesterday, it was business 
as usual, and by midnight last night all communication links had 
been restored.

  [Excerpt] Bujumbura, 9 March (AFP) -- Tribal killings have 
spread to a previously unaffected part of Burundi, a provincial 
governor reported as ethnic tensions remain high more than four 
months after the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye. 
About 50 minority Tutsi were slain on Monday [7 March] night by 
majority Hutu using machetes and clubs at Tangara in the north, 
Ngozi Province Governor Joseph Ntakirutimana told state radio. 
He said the Hutu then fled with their families to neighbouring 
Kiremba. The radio said there had been other killings in the 
past few days in Musenyi in the north-western province of 
Bubanza, but gave no casualty figures. [passage omitted]

  [Text] I have come to give myself up to the law. That, in 
essence, was what former President Andre Kolingba said after 
holding discussions with President Ange Felix Patasse at the 
Palais de la Renaissance in the presence of Ngoupande, secretary 
general of the Central African Democratic Rally [RDC], whose 
founding chairman is Kolingba. Also present at the audience 
granted by President Patasse were Prime Minister Jean-Louis 
Mandaba, Defense Minister Jean Mete-Yapende, Interior Minister 
Jean-Claude Dobanga, Justice Minister Jacques Mbosso, and some 
advisers at the Presidency of the Republic. 
  The discussions centered on the insecurity that prevailed 
before and after the time the Central African people chose to 
live in peace (?and to enjoy) the democracy for which many 
compatriots lost their lives. In this regard, the former head 
of state gave the following explanations: 
  [Begin Kolingba recording] I came to meet President Patasse 
and to give myself up to the law. That is what I told him. But 
then, why did I say that? I said that because people are seeing 
or feeling threats of coups d'etat because [words indistinct] 
indiscriminate distribution of war weapons. In fact that is 
understandable but since only the RDC and its supporters are 
harassed, I believe that I am the one targeted, and this is why 
I came to see the head of state to give myself up. However, 
President Patasse (?fraternally) and politely rejected this idea. 
  I believe I did the impossible and I withstood the 
impossible 
[word indistinct] to establish the multiparty system in this 
country [word indistinct] without bloodshed but today, we note 
-- and this is my opinion -- some flagrant abuses that are 
dangerous for our young democracy. This is happening without 
any reaction at all from those very people who claim to be 
advocates of human rights [words indistinct] and today we are 
hiding behind the most striking mutism. I would like to take 
the people to witness and say that if there are bloody 
disturbances in the country I, as of today, reject every 
responsibility for them. [Words indistinct] I did it for 12 
years to bring peace to the country. 
  That in brief, is what we discussed. We also reviewed many 
other domestic issues. We understood each other perfectly, and 
I think that President Patasse will find solutions and responses 
to the problems within a relatively short time. [Words 
indistinct] I thank you. [end recording] 
  Shortly after the discussions with his predecessor, 
President 
Patasse accompanied by Prime Minister Mandaba and his cabinet 
members inspected a war arsenal seized from groups of 
unidentified armed men carrying out military operations in the 
eastern part of our country. President Patasse called on the 
Africa No. 1 radio delegation currently visiting Bangui to also 
inspect the arsenal and to inform the international opinion 
about his good faith. 
  President Patasse stated, quote, I have learned that 
President Patasse harbors troops opposed to governments of some 
sister countries on his national territory. Here is proof that 
the allegations are false and that President Patasse can never 
allow armed groups (?to operate) on Central African Republic 
territory, unquote. At the end of the inspection, Colonel 
Wanfiou, chief of Army staff spoke to our reporter, Fidinguere 
Yedi: 
  [Begin recording] [Wanfiou] On 22 February everybody learned 
on the radio about an incursion of foreign troops into our 
country, mainly in the east. I immediately dispatched troops 
from Bangui to the region, while our detachment which was at 
[name indistinct] was [words indistinct]. After 48 hours of 
fighting, we succeeded in driving the adversaries away. In 
fact, they were [word indistinct] Sudanese rebels who 
infiltrated our national territory. We halted [words indistinct] 
and we seized a sizable consignment of weapons and ammunition. 
Now, calm has returned to the area [words indistinct] and I 
have already brought back the (?elements). If you have more 
questions, I am ready to answer them. 
  [Yedi] Col. Wanfiou, are you still at the scene of the 
fighting? 
  [Wanfiou] Yes, actually we are still at the scene. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Bangui, 8 Mar (AFP) -- Two members of the Central 
African Democratic Rally [RDC], the former sole ruling party of 
former President General Andre Kolingba, were called for 
interrogation in the middle of last week and detained in Bangui, 
it was learned from various sources today. 
  Augustin Ngbanda, President Kolingba's former secretary of 
state for public security, and Joseph Kanda "reportedly 
masterminded acts of social and political agitation, as well as 
creating pockets of social tension in some districts of Bangui," 
Claude Dobanga, minister of interior and national security, 
asserted. 
  The RDC did not react to these accusations today. 
  On 6 March, Dobanga denounced "the detention of weapons of 
war and the organization of pockets of tension in some districts 
of the capital by certain dignitaries of the former regime." 
According to the minister, this situation resulted in the 
carrying out of "attacks against foreigners, with technical 
assistants as the innocent targets." 
  Early February, two other RDC members, Lamido Daouda Ibrahim 
and Mahamat Salle, were arrested and detained at the 
gendarmerie, according to informed sources. 
  The two men, the president and secretary general of the 
Central African Republic's National Association of Livestock 
Breeders, were accused of distributing weapons to the 
Zaraguinas, a local nickname given to "armed robbers." 
  In the middle of January, the government had announced 
"coercive measures" against the Zaraguinas who were stealing, 
looting, and kidnapping travelers and livestock breeders on the 
roadside.

  [Text] Libreville, 9 Mar (AFP)--Gabon's main opposition 
leader Father Paul Mba Abessole, who is accused by the 
government of fomenting the violent clashes in Libreville from 
21 to 24 February that left nine dead, left the Gabonese capital 
yesterday evening for Paris, an opposition spokesman disclosed. 
Father Mba Abessole is going to France "to take some rest, and 
he will maintain contacts with his friends," the same source 
said without stating the duration of his trip. The National 
Lumberjacks Rally leader, who was accompanied by an opposition 
delegation and seen off by several dozen supporters at 
Libreville Airport, was able to "board the aircraft without any 
difficulty," the spokesman added. 
  Since security forces besieged his residence on 23 February, 
Father Abessole has not made any public appearance. The 
government has specifically accused him of provoking the 
four-day disturbances which rocked several areas in Libreville 
at the beginning of the general strike called by a 
pro-opposition trade union to demand postdevaluation salary 
increases. Several opposition leaders belonging to the High 
Resistance Council chaired by Father Mba Abessole are currently 
in Paris.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 4 Mar (AFP) -- Kinshasa newspapers close 
to both the opposition and the presidential group are reporting 
that money has been paid to members of the High Council of the 
Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT). 
  According to opposition newspapers, the money was 
distributed 
by supporters of the presidential group to "buy the consciences" 
of parliamentarians so as to disrupt deliberations at the HCR-PT 
and prolong the political impasse in Zaire. On the other hand, 
the SALONGO daily, close to the former single party, the Popular 
Movement of the Revolution [MPR], charges that the opposition is 
distributing $300 per head to "buy votes for Tshisekedi" 
  The HCR-PT has been meeting since 23 January to decide on 
the 
accords concluded between the presidential group and the radical 
opposition to extricate the country from its political and 
institutional crisis. Deliberations continued in commissions, 
and then resumed in plenary session on 28 February. Since then 
the meetings have remained blocked over a disagreement between 
the presidential group and the radical opposition on the future 
prime minister. The radical opposition supports Etienne 
Tshisekedi, elected prime minister by the Sovereign National 
Conference, but his appointment was later revoked by Marshal 
Mobutu. The Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC), which is 
the driving force of the presidential group, wants the new prime 
minister to be chosen henceforth by the HCR-PT. 
  According to the opposition press, the FPC has been 
distributing money to encourage an "impasse" in the 
deliberations of the HCR-TP in order to bring about a new 
political crisis. Such a situation, according to the 
opposition, could allow Marshal Mobutu to arbitrarily choose a 
new prime minister from his camp. 
  This theory is contradicted by circles close to the FPC, 
which recall that the head of state himself had expressed a wish 
to see the future prime minister "come from the opposition" and 
that he has described the Birindwa government as "only a 
caretaker government." These circles also claim that radical 
opposition parties "are trying to rally their scattered troops 
with money to avoid a rout for Tshisekedi."

  [Text] Nairobi, March 8 (AFP) -- The hijacking of a Saudi 
airliner forced to land here while flying from Ethiopia to Saudi 
Arabia ended late Tuesday [8 March], the Saudi embassy said. 
  No details were immediately available about how the siege of 
the plane ended, but unconfirmed reports said security forces 
stormed the plane. 
  The hijackers seized the Airbus 300 earlier in the day and 
forced it to land here, where they freed all 159 passengers, 
leaving captive only the captain and co-pilot of the jet. 
  The airline, called Saudia, said the plane was flying from 
Addis Ababa to Jeddah when it was hijacked. But an official at 
the control tower of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta airport said it was 
flying from Jeddah to Addis Ababa. 
  Airport sources said earlier that the plane was hijacked by 
three men who were demanding to go to Italy but the airline and 
the police would not confirm the report. 
  A Saudi embassy official had said one of the three hijackers 
was a woman and that the trio were demanding the plane be 
refuelled to fly to London.

  [Text] Another 200 Italian soldiers have left Somalia. As 
the conclusion of the UN mandate approaches, all the 
international contingents are reducing their presence. Some 
1,000 Italian troops remain in Mogadishu. The demobilization of 
the UNOSOM [United Nations Operation in Somalia] troops is 
taking place in a climate of intense fighting between warring 
factions that are still a long way from reaching any peace 
settlement.

  [Text] Kampala, March 8 (AFP) -- Two opposition leaders 
arrested over the weekend and charged with sedition have been 
freed on bail, officials said here Tuesday [8 March]. Haji 
Badru Wegulo, chairman of the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) of 
exiled former President Milton Obote, and another official, 
Patrick Rubaihayo, were freed conditionally after appearing in 
court Monday, they said. They have been charged in connection 
with a document released by the party setting out its 
controversial manifesto for forthcoming elections to the 
constituent assembly. 
  The polls, scheduled for March 28 have been opposed for a 
number of issues. The UPC has in particular alleged that 
President Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) was 
dominated by foreigners, mainly of Rwandan origin. Museveni has 
strongly denied the allegations, saying they were intended to 
insult him and to question his integrity.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 8 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana on Tuesday 
[8 March] saw scenes of violence all around the capital Mmabatho 
with tear gas being used indiscriminately by the homeland 
authorities for most of the day. By late afernoon live rounds 
were being used in attempts to defuse a swell of action that 
started at the weekend when workers at the Bophuthatswana 
Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] joined the homeland civil servant 
strike. 
  On Tuesday the workers took over the BBC offices and held 
hostage Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Zebulon 
Masilo and BBC Chairman Eddie Mangope, son of the Bophuthatswana 
President Lucas Mangope. 
  Attempts to defuse the situation at the BBC led to a meeting 
between South African ambassador to the homeland, Prof Tjaart 
van der Walt, and President Mangope and his cabinet, who asked 
him to refrain from interfering. The Bophuthatswana government 
also accused SA [South Africa] Foreign Minister Pik Botha of 
meddling and inciting violence. 
  The offices of the BBC were occupied early on Tuesday and 
Prof van der Walt arrived shortly after 9am to try and negotiate 
to defuse the situation. 
  He was allowed to enter the sealed building and met Mr 
Mangope who said he would try and sort out the situation 
himself. Prof van der Walt told SAPA on Tuesday evening he had 
suggested to the Bophuthatswana government that it try and 
mediate with the host of disgruntled civil servants and try to 
reach am amicable solution. 
  The siege at the the BBC ended shortly after noon when 
homeland police entered the building and fired tear gas into 
areas where alproximately 300 staff members were holding a 
meeting. Beween 10 and 20 members of a workers' committee were 
arrested. Both radio and television broadcasts were blacked out 
for the whole day. 
  Teachers at most schools in the homeland joined the strike 
and pupils who gathered at schools were tear gassed. 
  Health services also suffered labour setbacks in most of 
Bophuthatswana on Tuesday and more work stoppages in the public 
sector are expected on Wednesday. 
  A rally at Rooigrond outside the town did not get underway 
and people returning from the area entered Mafikeng in cars, 
taxis, trucks and buses singing, shouting and whistling. This 
led to Bophutatswana police and the demonstrators running up and 
down one of the town's main thoroughfares, Station Street, for 
most of the afternoon. 
  By late Tuesday station street resembled a war zone with 
garbage littering the streets as large, cylindical cement dirt 
bins were rolled into streets, upended and used as barricades. 
At least one scratchcard kiosk was used for the same purpose. 
  The area around the station, in the vicinity of the ANC 
[African National Congress] offices, was also the scene of a 
number of fires -- mainly of garbage and tyres. According to ANC 
organiser Nathaniel Ngakantsi the police were asked to stop 
"provoking violence" downtown. "The police provoked people by 
chasing them up and down the street. 
  "We asked the police to leave them alone but they kept on 
coming back," he said. 
  At one stage in the late afternoon reporters and ANC workers 
saw police firing a volley of live ammunition outside the ANC 
offices. 
  Police also fired live ammunition on the University of 
Bophuthatswana campus when they went there to stop a student 
protest in which the national flag was burnt. Bophuthatswana 
government spokesman Alwyn Viljoen denied that police used live 
ammuniion or that the flag was burnt, despite a large number of 
witnesses confirming the events. 
  The situation in Mafikeng and Mmabatho was tense on Tuesday 
evening wih a pall of black smoke hanging over Mafikeng. Burning 
barricades of rubbish were placed across the road in streets in 
Monstshiwa township where groups of youths, armed with rocks, 
stood on street corners. 
  There is fear of a rightwing backlash against the protesters 
and some reporters were mistaken for white rightwingers. 
  A source close to the Bophuthatswana government told SAPA 
that members of the Freedom Alliance had already offered "to 
help out" in Bophuthatswana. This could not be independently 
confirmed. 
  A number of journalists were manhandled by police and at 
least two camera teams had their film confiscated. The 
government spokesman would also not confirm these incidents nor 
would he confirm the high incidence of tear gassing that took 
place throughout the day.

Government said on Tuesday [8 March] it was concerned at 
mounting unrest in Bophuthatswana where the embattled homeland 
government is confronted with escalating wildcat strikes and 
protests by civil servants over protection of their pensions. 
The decision on Monday by the homeland cabinet not to take part 
in the April election appeared to add fuel to the stoppages. 
  "The government is deeply concerned over the current unrest 
and its possible impact on South African citizens and interests 
and on the peaceful implementation of the election process," 
said a South African Government statement issued in Pretoria. It 
said South Africa was keeping a close watch on the situation in 
the homeland. 
  "The government has once again addressed an urgent appeal to 
the Bophuthatswana government to become a full participant in 
the constitutional process, including the proposed election," 
the statement said. 
  South African Defence Force members, meanwhile, conducted 
military excercises near Bophuthatswana borders, but defence 
spokesman Maj Merle Meyer said they were not to prevent the 
unrest spilling across the border. 
  The homeland government accused South African Foreign 
Minister Pik Botha of fanning unrest in Bophuthatswana and 
attempts by Ambassador Prof Tjaart van der Walt to mediate in a 
labour crisis at the homeland's Broadcasting Corporation were 
rebuffed. 
  After a day of police action against strikers in the 
homeland, the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] recommended 
financial strangulation of the government of President Lucas 
Mangope, cancellation of Bophuthatswana's diplomatic ties with 
Pretoria and other measures if the homeland flouted TEC 
directives. The announcement came hours after African National 
Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela urged Pretoria to withdraw 
its seconded officials to force Mr Mangope to step down. 
  "I think we have now given him enough time. I have tried to 
reason with him (Mr Mangope) but it is clear he has no vision. 
Further pressures will be used and I have no doubt he will not 
be able to withstand them," Mr Mandela told students at the 
University of Venda. 
  In another development in a day of drama in Bophuthatswana, 
the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said an IEC 
delegation including chairman, Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, would 
travel to Bophuthatswana on Wednesday for talks with the 
homeland government. 
  As stoppages spread on Tuesday, strikers at the 
Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] held hostage BBC 
Chairman Eddie Mangope and Broadcasting Minister Zebulon Masilo 
at the corporation's offices. Eddie Mangope is President 
Mangope's son. 
  The hostage drama ended when homeland police stormed the 
building anf fired tear gas at hundreds of workers who had taken 
virutal control of the corporation. The strike over pay cut 
radio and television broadcasts on Tuesday. Mr Eddie Mangope, 
who earlier had told South Africa's ambassador he would resolve 
the crisis on his own and did not need the intervention of the 
diplomat, was found in the offices unharmed. 
  Between 10 and 20 strike leaders at the BBC were reported 
arrested. 
  Later, Mr Eddie Mangope said in a statement the crisis had 
been resolved following talks with the strikers and the BBC 
would resume broadcasts on Wednesday morning. Confirmation of 
this claim could not be immediately obtained. [passage omitted] 
  Striking civil servants are demanding participation in the 
election process to ensure their pensions are protected under a 
new government. Mr Mandela said on Tuesday an ANC government 
would not seize the pensions. 
  On Tuesday scenes of violence were witnessed around the 
capital Mmabatho with teargas being used indiscriminately by the 
homeland authorities for most of the day. 
  The situation in Mafikeng and Mmabatho was tense on Tuesday 
evening wih a pall of black smoke hanging over Mafikeng. 
  Burning barricades of rubbish were placed across the road in 
streets in Monstshiwa township where groups of youths, armed 
with rocks, stood on street corners. 
  There is fear of a rightwing backlash against the protesters 
and some reporters were mistaken for white rightwingers. A 
source close to the Bophuthatswana government told SAPA that 
members of the Freedom Alliance had already offered "to help 
out" in Bophuthatswana. This could not be independently 
confirmed. 
  A number of journalists were manhandled by police and at 
least two camera teams had their film confiscated. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The Bophuthatswana government has refused to accede 
to a request by the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to 
set up voting stations for South Africans in Bophuthatswana. It 
has also refused to allow electioneering in the state, and to 
allow monitoring of the election process. The Bophuthatswana 
government refused to cooperate with the IEC at a meeting 
between the two parties at Mmabatho this morning. 
Bophuthatswana said that the IEC request would amount to 
acceptance of South Africa's nonrecognition of its sovereignty. 
  Meanwhile the streets of Mmabatho were the scene of further 
unrest this morning as clashes between Bophuthatswana police and 
striking public servants continued. Our reporter in Mmabatho 
said the town had been calm until midmorning when a long 
motorcade of protesters moved through the streets. Protesters 
were joined by students when they passed the university. Police 
in armored vehicles then moved in and fired tear gas. 
  In another incident South African Police stationed at the 
embassy in the capital had to intervene when an explosive 
situation developed between Bophuthatswana police and striking 
teachers outside the embassy building. The Bophuthatswana 
broadcasting center has been closed as a result of the strike by 
broadcasting workers.

Bophuthatswana capital Mmabatho, on Wednesday [9 March] 
afternoon. Streets near the station erupted as Bophuthatswana 
police in Hippo armoured vehicles started firing teargas and 
live rounds. Reports that one pedestrian had been shot in a leg

  [Text] President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana has 
dismissed all striking Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation 
staff. Addressing striking workers this afternoon in Mmabatho, 
President Mangope informed the staff he had deccided to close 
down the corporation. He told the staff he would make 
arrangements for the collection of employees' pensions and 
salaries. 
  Meanwhile, the situation in Mmabatho is volatile, following 
sporadic incidents of violence at the University of 
Bophuthatswana. Students stoned cars, mostly government cars, 
and the police used tear gas and rubber bullets. 
  Earlier the Bophuthatswana government refused a request by 
the Independent Electoral Commission to set up voting stations 
for South Africans in Bophuthatswana. It has also refused to 
allow electioneering in the state and to allow monitoring of the 
election process. 
  The National Party [NP] says that President Mangope has 
betrayed most of the values in which he believes. The NP said 
the state had become the victim of an increasingly oppressive 
system. The party said that Bophuthatswana was a tragic example 
of what could happen when leaders made the wrong decisions.

  [Text] Freedom Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje and Afrikaner 
Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leader Constand Viljoen 
say the current strike action by civil servants in 
Bophuthatswana is being fueled by forces outside the country for 
their own political purposes. They were speaking after holding 
talks in Mmabatho this evening. 
  Mr. Cronje quashed rumors that the Bophuthatswana government 
is on the verge of collapse. He claimed that the situation in 
the country was not as serious as it was portrayed in the media. 
Earlier today chaos erupted in the capital as the strike reached 
crisis levels. Estelle Pienaar reports on events outside the 
capital: 
  [Pienaar] With the tension reaching fever pitch in Mmabatho, 
the South African Defense Force [SADF] is on standby in nearby 
Lichtenburg. A shopkeeper in the town told us that a contingent 
of SADF trooops had arrived in the town during the day. We went 
to investigate and found several Puma helicopters and a Dakota 
aircraft at the aerodrome. Curious town folk had gathered in 
the mealie fields surrounding the aerodrome to witness the 
event. With the Bophuthatswana police and miitary still 
staunchly supporting the Mangope government, and doing 
everything in their power to put down the riotous crowds, the 
SADF presence in the area might be a stern warning of what could 
lie ahead for Bophuthatswana if peace and stability are not 
restored soon.

  [Text] The defense force and police force of Bophuthatswana 
have cordoned off residential areas in the capital, Mmabatho, 
and have prevented people from attending a gathering in the 
city. Meanwhile, public servants have gathered for an 
antigovernment rally at Lichtenburg on the South African side of 
the border. Traffic ground to a halt in Mafikeng after a 
meeting in (?Rooigrond). Teachers and health workers have also 
embarked on a strike and public servants have begun a consumer 
boycott against businesses owned by the government. 
  In a separate development, ANC [African National Congress] 
leader Nelson Mandela has asked the South African government to 
recall officials seconded to Bophuthatswana and to maintain a 
defense force presence on the border to monitor the situation. 
However, the defense force had denied that it has been deployed 
to prevent the unrest in Bophuthatswana from spilling over into 
South Africa.

  [Text] ANC [African National Congress] leader Mr. Nelson 
Mandela says his party will put pressure on Bophuthatswana in 
order to get the country to join the new South Africa. Mr. 
Mandela said, during the last leg of his election tour of 
northern Transvaal, that pressure must also be brought to bear 
on the government to force Bophuthatswana to change its views. 
  [Begin recording] [SABC correspondent Estelle Pienaar] Mr. 
Mandela said he is concerned over the situation in 
Bophuthatswana. He said he would prefer to resolve differences 
with Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope through dialogue, 
but it now appeared as though further talks would yield nothing. 
  [Mandela, in English] A great deal of pressure is going to 
be 
put on Mangope. I would have preferred Mangope to have agreed 
on a solution before he is forced to capitulate by pressures, 
but it appears now that that (?force) is inevitable. 
  [Pienaar] Mr. Mandela has now ended his election tour of 
Venda. It is still an independent state, but will soon become 
part of the new South Africa. This afternoon Mr. Mandela's tour 
of the northern Transvaal also came to an end. Tomorrow 
President F. W. de Klerk will follow Mr. Mandela's footsteps and 
visit the same province. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria March 9 SAPA -- Most of those involved in 
the unrest in the Bophuthatswana capital of Mmabatho had been 
bused in by the African National Congress [ANC], Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front, AVF] leader Constand Viljoen claimed 
on Wednesday [9 March]. 
  In a statement, Gen Viljoen accused the ANC/South African 
Communist Party alliance of deliberately destabilising the 
homeland with the full knowledge of the South African 
Government. "There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the 
majority of the people involved in the unrest in Mmabatho are 
bused in by the ANC." 
  The "sudden" military activity near the border by the South 
African Defence Force could also be seen as intimidation, the 
general added.

  [Text] Pretoria March 8 SAPA -- The destabilisation of 
Bophuthatswana was a communist textbook case and blame for the 
unrest should be laid at the door of the African National 
Congress [ANC], the National Party [NP] and the South African 
Communist Party, Conservative Party [CP] MP Tom Langley said on 
Tuesday [8 March]. In a statement he accused minister of Foreign 
Affairs Pik Botha and South Africa's ambassador to 
Bophuthatswana, Tjaart van der Walt, of flagrant interference in 
the homeland's internal affairs. 
  Mr van der Walt, "State President F W de Klerk's personal 
destabilising agent", should be recalled, Mr Langley said. 
  In an apparent reference to the Bophuthatswana cabinet 
decision to boycott the April elections, Mr Langley said: "Any 
action to promote unrest in Bophuthatswana is blackmail from the 
textbook of Messrs de Klerk, Botha and his boss, ANC President 
Nelson Mandela." 
  Problems in Bophuthatswana were deliberately being 
exaggerated by SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
television news and the media in an attempt to stimulate 
pressure from outside, Mr Langley claimed. Mr Botha's 
"gossiping" about the state on television and in the media was 
an attempt to "give body" to the destabilisation, he said. 
  "Mr Botha and the NP government have made a total mess of 
South Africa. He is now helping South Africa to become 
Azania...and yearns to do the same with Bophuthatswana."
