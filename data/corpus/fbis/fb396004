  [Text] Pretoria March 9 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has 
offered Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope armed troops to 
ward off agression from "inside or outside" the homeland, AWB 
leader Eugene Terreblanche said on Wednesday [9 March]. In a 
statement, Mr Terreblanche said: "The AWB has undertaken to 
provide President Mangope with any support he may need 
including, if necessary, physical force to prevent the communist 
rabble from turning Bophuthatswana into another African National 
Congress [ANC]-type Transkei tin pot state." 
  He expressed the AWB's concern at what he called attempts by 
the ANC/South African Communist Party/(Foreign Minister) Pik 
Botha alliance to undermine and destroy the government of 
Bophuthatswana. 
  "Mr Botha was the same man who, four years ago, actually 
sped 
to the assistance of President Mangope when the communist rabble 
tried to overthrow the legal government of Bophuthatswana. 
  "It is a sad reflection on the National Party that they are 
prepared to stab their former loyal friends in the back in this 
despicable manner."

  [Text] Johannesburg March 9 SAPA -- The right-wing Freedom 
Front is set to contest the April elections. 
  Representatives of the front arrived at the Independent 
Electoral Commission's offices in Johannesburg shortly before 
4.30pm on Wednesday [9 March] to submit its candidate list. 
  The front was registered by its leader Gen Constand Viljoen 
as a strategic option for the Afrikaner Volkfront [AVF, 
Afrikaner National Front] to obtain its "volkstaat" [homeland]. 
  The front's representatives included Conservative Party MP 
Joseph Chiole. 
  The Freedom Front's decision took its Afrikaner Volksfront 
allies by surpise. AVF spokesman Steven Maninger said the 
decision would have an effect on the volksfront, but there was 
no difference between participants and non-participants in the 
elections on the viability of a volkstaat. 
  "They (the Freedom Front) also have the interests of the 
Afrikaner at heart," Mr Maninger said.

  [Text] Talks are to be held soon on the possible extension 
of tomorrow's midnight deadline for the submission of election 
candidate lists. This follows a meeting between the ANC 
[African National Congress] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
in Johannesburg today and a proposal made to the Transitional 
Executive Council in Pretoria this afternoon. 
  At the closed-door meeting between the ANC and the IFP, the 
two parties agreed to meet the chairman of the Independent 
Electoral Commission, Mr. Justice Johan Kriegler, tonight to 
discuss postponing the deadline tomorrow. 
  The ANC and the IFP held the meeting to discuss proposals 
that international mediation be used to break the constitutional 
impasse. IFP National Chairman Dr. Frank Mdlalose said the IFP 
had not yet compiled its list of candidates. Dr. Mdlalose added 
that progress had been made in today's talks and that the party 
delegates to the meeting will report back to their leaders 
before meeting again on Saturday [12 March]. 
  Meanwhile Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi has urged 
President F.W. de Klerk to endorse his proposals for 
international mediation. Dr. Buthelezi said it appeared that Mr. 
de Klerk was not happy with the idea of mediation.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 8 SAPA -- Negotiations on a 
proposed election pact between the African National Congress 
[ANC] and the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] have collapsed, PAC 
Secretary General Benny Alexander said in Johannesburg on 
Tuesday [8 March]. Mr Alexandra said talks floundered after a 
media statement attributed to ANC President Nelson Mandela 
demanded a declaration of assets ahead of the election pact. 
"The PAC will contest the election on its own, in its own 
name," he said. Mr Alexander said the ANC was pursuing the 
election pact as a merger between two companies, which indicated 
a lack of commitment on the part of the organisation.

  [Text] Nzhelele, Venda March 8 SAPA -- Three South African 
Air Force Mirage fighters made a fly-past as African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela arrived on Tuesday [8 
March] at Rabali Stadium at Nzhelele in Venda for a rally to 
mark International Women's Day. 
  About 100,000 ANC supporters from all over Venda attended 
the 
rally. Mr Mandela answered their numerous questions on ANC 
policy. He was asked what would become of uneducated Venda 
government office cleaners -- who earn R140 [rand] a month -- if 
the ANC came to power. "All temporary government workers, 
unregistered labourers and low wages will come to a halt," Mr 
Mandela replied. Males and females with the same qualifications 
would get equal pay, he added. 
  On education, Mr Mandela said there would be free and 
compulsory education for all children for the next 10 years. 
Parents denying children their right to education would be 
prosecuted. 
  On the Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] issue, Mr Mandela said 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader Gen Constand 
Viljoen and Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg would 
never see it. 
  "As long as I live there will never be a volkstaat and I 
assure you that the National Party [NP] will be buried after 
April 27. Vote for the ANC as the NP and F. W. de Klerk have 
been rejected by white voters, because when he calls a rally 
only 30 people attend."

  [Text] Pretoria March 9 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela's repeated statements that there 
will never be a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] only reinforce 
Afrikaners' determination to obtain a homeland, Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front, AVF] spokesman Stephan Maninger said 
on Wednesday [9 March]. 
  In a statement, Mr Maninger said it appeared from Mr 
Mandela's utterances he had not considered the alternative. "We 
are convinced there will be a volkstaat, particularly once the 
ANC realises it is cheaper to accommodate the aspirations of the 
Afrikaner than to try to suppress us indefinitely," he said. 
  The only positive things about his statements were that he 
had increased Afrikaners' determination to obtain a volkstaat 
and mobilised them, he added.

  [Text] Messina March 9 SAPA -- Police on Wednesday fired 
rubber shot at a group of African National Congress [ANC] 
supporters protesting outside a stadium where National Party 
[NP] leader F.W. de Klerk addressed his followers. The 
protesters, who claimed they were invited by local NP supporters 
to attend the meeting, had earlier toyi-toyied [protest danced] 
and chanted slogans as Mr de Klerk's motorcade entered and left 
the stadium. 
  A small group of Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] activists 
chanted the slogan "kill the Boer, kill the farmer" shortly 
before the police opened fire. It could not be established 
whether anyone was injured in the shooting. 
  Earlier, Mr de Klerk told about 300 supporters, most of them 
black, the NP was a party of peace and would ensure the rights 
of every South African. He accused the ANC of intimidating and 
threatening people in townships. "The NP will ensure that the 
policies of a new government of national unity will help build a 
better life for all South Africans," Mr de Klerk said.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 8 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] on Tuesday [8 March] approved a measure aimed at 
curtailing government's independence of action in the seven 
remaining weeks before the election. In a resolution after 
National Housing and Public Works Minister Louis Shill had 
appeared before a full sitting of the TEC, the TEC said it 
called on: "All government ministers and senior officials to 
earnestly comply with the provisions of the TEC Act and not to 
initiate substantial policy changes or actions which impact on 
the elections in any way". 
  The resolution directed Mr Shill "to suspend any actions" he 
had intended in terms of the housing scheme he announced on 
February 28. 
  Government delegate to the TEC, Constitutional Development 
Roelf Meyer, opposed the measure. 
  The TEC said that the government and National Party were 
"guilty of flouting sections of the TEC Act" and resolved "to 
direct the np government to stop forthwith abusing its position 
in order to gain advantage in the electoral process". 
  Mr Meyer said the TEC should be aware that there were other 
governments represented in the TEC besides the South African 
Government. Their actions would also have to bear scrutiny. 
  The TEC's move to curtail government's freedom of action 
provided the first seriously divisive issue to come between 
government and the African National Congress since the TEC's 
inception in december. ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa 
spearheaded the TEC move. 
  He produced a document that appeared to be the draft of an 
NP 
election pemphlet. The draft had "surfaced" in the office of 
Housing Department Deputy Director General Neville Karsen, he 
said. The draft contained details of how the NP housing plan -- 
Mr Schill's scheme -- would provide housing. Mr Karsen denied 
that any party political pamphlet had been produced in his 
office. 
  Mr Shill, insisting during his at times tense hour and a 
half 
hearing that the TEC was not the government, said afterwards he 
would implement his policy as planned. He had argued that the 
TEC had no jurisdiction over his actions. 
  In a bitter clash, Mr Ramaphosa again called Mr Shill "an 
arrogant minister". He said the NP had to be stopped from 
abusing taxpayers' money to its own electoral advantage. "They 
are riding on taxpayers' money to win an election that they are 
going to lose," he said.

  [Text] Pretoria March 8 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] moved on Tuesday to compel the holding of free and 
fair elections in Bophuthatswana. South African Communist Party 
Chairman Joe Slovo said the government of President Lucas 
Mangope had clearly indicated that it would not join the 
electoral process. 
  However, people in the homeland had indicated that they 
wanted to take part in the election, he said. 
  The TEC called on Mr Mangope not to resist the progress 
towards a new dispensation and to commence co-operation with the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. 
  The TEC recommended that if Mr Mangope did not comply with 
its directives, measures should be implemented including 
terminating diplomatic representation, terminating special 
financial arrangements that benefitted the government of 
Bophuthatswana, controlling the movement of Bophuthatswana 
government personnel in South Africa and securing the IEC in the 
execution of its duties. 
  The TEC said it would initiate direct contact with civil 
servants and security force members to plan for their 
integration and the implementation of the new constitution if 
its directives were ignored.

Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] order for him not to do 
so. The TEC ordered Mr. Shill to stop the scheme yesterday, 
accusing the government of abusing its position for electoral 
gain. However, Mr. Shill said the sole objective of his 
department was to enable people to obtain adequate housing. Mr. 
Shill is not required to comply with the order as it has no 
force or effect on the government. 
  Mr. Shill said the principles and details of the scheme had 
been negotiated with a wide variety of organizations over a 
protracted period. The scheme has being implemented within the 
current budget, and no new money had been allocated.

  [Text] Business confidence is down, and political 
uncertainty is to blame. The South African Chamber of Business 
[SACOB] today released the latest confidence index, which 
reflects the mood of businessmen around the country. Jennifer 
Wilson reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Wilson] It's headlines such as these that 
are reflected in the February drop in business confidence. 
SACOB's business confidence index is over 1 point down, quite a 
significant drop, following on from last month's five-year high. 
  [SACOB Director General Raymond Parsons] The drop in the 
business confidence index was not entirely unexpected, if you 
take into account the political uncertainty in the past few 
weeks having had a negative impact on the business mood. But 
the more we can make the politcal process inclusive, the more we 
hold out the promise of political stability, so the chances that 
the South African economy could grow at 2.5 to even 3 percent 
this year improve, with the prospect of an even higher growth 
rate next year, if we get the politics right. 
  [Wilson] Another important economic indicator: the new car 
sales figures were released today. Car sales figures for 
February were 2 percent down on last year at the same time. It 
seems that the whole of the South African economy is adopting a 
wait-and-see attitude. But motor industry sources said today 
that they did continue to expect a modest increase in new car 
sales figures for the rest of the year. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Possible Clinton Whitwatergate Cover-Up? -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 9 March in a page-14 editorial says "the 
virtues of Bill Clinton were being sung not long ago," but, "as 
so often in the past, America's heroes are shown up to have feet 
of clay." "There can be no doubt that what is called 
Whitewatergate is becoming unsavoury, but whether it's another 
Watergate -- the cover-up that brought down President Nixon in 
1973 -- only time will tell." President Clinton has assured 
Americans that his wife's "'moral compass is as strong as 
anybody's in the country'" but "clouding matters is a series of 
secret meetings on Whitewatergate between Treasury and White 
House staffers. Clinton had better hope that he will not be 
caught out on his 'no cover-up' promise." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Bophuthatswana `Fiefdom is Crumbling' -- "Only last month, 
the Bophuthatswana president was offered an opportunity by 
Nelson Mandela to surrender with dignity the sham independence 
his territory has enjoyed since 1977," notes a page-10 editorial 
in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 March. Now 
President Mangope's "fiefdom is crumbling." "The only question 
is whether he will allow it to do so without bloodshed." 
"Mangope will probably not even listen to his old friend and 
ally [Foreign Minister] Pik Botha, who put on his usual 
performance of sweet reasonableness when he urged Mangope to 
face reality. Botha is now at pains to `forget' that it was he 
who ensured that troops were sent in four years ago to prop up 
Mangope when he was last threatened by internal resistance. 
With only 50 days left in office, Botha has neither the will 
nor the resources to repeat his mistake." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  `Dilly-Dallying' Over Election Participation -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 9 March in a page-8 editorial says 
"rightwing groups are still dilly-dallying" about participation 
in the election, in Bophuthatswana "things are rapidly falling 
apart," while the National Party and the government "are 
lukewarm about international mediation to break the negotiations 
logjam." It is now time to "recognise the force represented by 
the vast majority of South Africa's people, who want to proceed 
with the poll from 26-28 April. Parties, groups and has-been 
bantustan politicians deliberately clouding the issues and 
placing stumbling blocks are toying with this force at their own 
peril."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with UNITA President Jonas Savimbi by </F>
unidentified Paris LE FIGARO correspondent in Huambo "recently"] 
  [Text] Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] president, recently granted 
an important interview to France's prestigious LE FIGARO 
newspaper. He gave that interview in the city of Huambo, on the 
Angolan Central Plateau. Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi noted that 
a peace accord should be secured as a matter of urgency because, 
in his words, 30 years of war is far too much and there is a 
need to avoid further bloodshed. 
  The president of UNITA also expressed the belief that Angola 
will enjoy peace in the future. In this regard, Dr. Jonas 
Malheiro Savimbi said that UNITA has made many concessions at 
the Lusaka peace talks. 
  At another point in his interview with the French newspaper, 
the president of UNITA noted that it was absurd to continue 
making war while peace talks are continuing. He said, quote, I 
am well aware that it makes no sense to make war while talking 
peace, unquote. 
  Looking back to the September 1992 elections, Dr. Jonas 
Savimbi said that responsibility for the failure of those 
elections must be laid at the door of all Angolan political 
forces, the West -- which did not help -- and the United 
Nations, which did not have the necessary ability to operate in 
a country as vast as Angola which, to add to the problem, had 
just come out of a 16-year war.

  [Text] The Angolan authorities say they have lost contact 
with a ship apprehended by UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] forces in northern Angola, near the 
border with Zaire. Officials say the ship was transporting an 
unknown number of civilians, who had been prevented from 
disembarking. It is now docked at the (Cuanda) oil 
installations, near the city of Soyo, which is under UNITA's 
control.

  [Text] The war currently under way in Angola can only be 
blamed on the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, of Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The 
next few days do not seem to indicate calm for northern Angola 
in general and the oil-rich district of Soyo in particular. 
This is because the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FALA] Military Command for the Northern Front has captured a 
package of top-secret documents that provide all the details 
concerning an offensive on Soyo planned by the coalition of 
People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] and 
South African mercenary forces. Felix Miranda, the Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel, Vorgan, correspondent in 
northern Angola, reports: 
  [Begin Miranda recording] One of the pages of the aforesaid 
document says that the (?FAPLA) General Staff has recommended 
that General Caribu move, along with South African mercenaries, 
from Cabo Ledo, where a regiment of special forces has settled. 
Those forces have been involved in landing exercises, from the 
air and sea. Within this context, the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces defending Soyo 
District have had the benefit of the visit by the supreme 
commander of the FALA forces for the Northern Front. He went to 
Soyo to place those forces on maximum alert. Given the 
involvement of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, 
UDPS, a Zairian party, on the side of the MPLA-PT, the UNITA 
forces have had to redouble their vigilance along the common 
border with Zaire. [end recording] 
  The leadership in Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace is 
preparing a major offensive against the strategic and oil-rich 
district of Soyo. The FALA Military Command for the Northern 
Front has top secret MPLA-PT documents which prove this. 
  Meanwhile, in Soyo today the Northern Front Military Command 
informed the Angolan and international communities that, for the 
first time in UNITA's history, the FALA forces have captured a 
large ship. This happened on 2 March. Felix Miranda, the 
Vorgan correspondent in the area, reports that the ship was 
sailing along the channels of Zaire River, in the vicinity of 
Soyo. 
  [Begin Miranda recording] The ship is called (Mitenupe). It 
has all the characteristics of a National Tugboat Company 
commercial vessel and it belongs to Mr. Jose Manuel Martins 
Caetano, who resides in Luanda. In accordance with the 
navigation authorization and the cargo lists, the ship left 
Luanda for Cabinda and was carrying assorted merchandise. 
Captain David Jose de Carvalho and Quartermaster Antonio Catraio 
said that when she arrived in Cabinda, she was diverted by the 
FAPLA Military Command for Cabinda and was given the mission to 
ferry fuel, uniforms, and other logistical equipment for the 
FAPLA forces. That equipment was supposed to have been 
offloaded at (Chissanda) island, after the ship had docked at 
Zaire's Matadi Harbor. 
  Meanwhile, one of the FALA units defending the Zaire River 
territorial waters used six combat boats to intercept the ship. 
After showing some reluctance to follow the orders being given 
by the captain of those forces, and after an exchange of shots, 
the 350-ton and 40 meter long ship was successfully captured by 
the FALA forces. The ship and its occupants are now in FALA's 
hands in a safe area. 
  The FALA forces will defend Soyo to the best of their 
ability. To that end, they have been working to improve their 
combat preparedness, in defensive as well as offensive terms, 
involving air, land, or sea forces. The capture of the ship 
(Mitenupe) on 2 March is further evidence of the degree of 
effectiveness of our forces. [end recording] 
  This news from the northern region is of the greatest 
importance, not just because it is marvelous but, above all, 
because it refutes international media reports that suggested 
that the FALA forces had captured a ship carrying only civilians.

  [Text] While the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] is negotiating peace for Angolans in Lusaka, 
its soldiers here are still engaged in warmongering actions. In 
Moxico Province, for instance, the government forces killed more 
than 30 Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola elements when 
they tried to take over the city of Luena. Our correspondent 
Joao Calongue reports from the area: 
  [Begin Calongue recording] A total of 33 UNITA soldiers were 
killed by the government forces in Moxico Province yesterday 
following the destruction of some bases of that organization 
that served as a point of departure for provocations against 
government-held positions. This was revealed by a reliable 
source from the Moxico Independent Military Region, who added 
that in the mopping up operations yesterday, the government 
forces also destroyed a UNITA logistical base along the source 
of the (Lala) River, 185 km south of the city of Luena, 
andcaptured 11 AKM weapons, 27 clips of assorted ammunition, a 
RPG-7 rocket launcher, four boxes of cartridges, nine RPG-7 
rounds, two sets of second lieutenant stripes, and one set of 
officer cadet stripes. The government forces' response comes at 
a time when UNITA is assembling means to take over the city of 
Luena at any time. [end recording]

  [Text] The government's 1994 Economic and Social Program is 
being debated in parliament. A plenary session began this 
morning to deal with the program and the State General Budget. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Honorable 
deputy, do you agree with the 1994 program? 
  [Norberto de Castro, deputy for the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] I would like to say that it is 
evident that the government has made an effort to draw itself 
closer to a reality from which it had distanced itself. 
Nevertheless, it is an effort that leaves something to be 
desired. We believe that the program and the State General 
Budget have many weaknesses. Let us see if the majority comes 
to its senses during this plenary session and heeds the call of 
the minority and rectifies what we think is wrong. 
  [Correspondent] Are you confident the program will be 
adopted? 
  [Paixao Junior, vice governor of National Bank of Angola] 
Absolutely. I believe the program contains everything to 
warrant its approval. 
  [Miguel N'zau Puna, deputy for the Angolan Democratic Forum] 
As I see it, there are good prospects for the program to be 
adopted because we are in a minority. So, I think the budget 
will be approved. [end recording] 
  The plenary session only began at 1100 because yesterday's 
rain disrupted the communications system. Before the debates 
could take place, the opposition members of parliament wanted 
the government to present a report on the country's economic 
situation in 1993. 
  [Begin Castro recording] Mr. President, if you allow me, I 
would like to show you a resolution that effectively says there 
should be a report giving an account of the performance of the 
State General Budget for the third quarter of 1993, as well as 
the government's program of action for 1994. 
  Mr. President, regardless of whatever explanations that one 
can give, we have an illegality on our hands. Either the 
majority complies with what has been agreed or we will act in 
disregard of the assembly regulations. I have the document 
right here and if you so wish you can have it. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Marcolino Moco was then forced to brief the 
opposition members of parliament. His explanations fell short 
of the deputies' expectations. Other deputies addressed the 
session, but the opposition appeared to be aloof when the agenda 
came up for voting. The opposition members of parliament did 
not take part in the voting. As the situation began to look 
complicated, Marcolino Moco delivered his speech in which he 
characterized 1993 as a catastrophic year for Angola's economic, 
social, and political life. He said the war was the main cause 
of the situation. 
  [Begin Moco recording] It has not been easy to monitor the 
ongoing political transition, not only because it is no easy 
task, but also because the war has created even more dramatic 
situations that should be taken into account when we decide on 
what course of action to follow. The ongoing political 
transition has affected the social behavior of our fellow 
countrymen who have grown tired, and in many instances 
despondent. 
  The government is committed to a prosperous nation, and a 
democratic and fair society. That, however, should also be the 
duty and goal of every citizen. To move decisively toward that 
goal, citizens ought to regain self-confidence, and to trust 
their own country. Unless we believe in the future and move 
together in building this new country, it will not be possible 
to fully overcome the current situation, and be sure that we 
will strengthen our position. 
  Mr. President and honorable deputies, there is an unanimous 
belief that inflation is the main cause of the prevailing 
economic crisis. Under the circumstances, the honorable 
deputies should rest assured that we will prevent hyperinflation 
from taking root in the country, even if we have to introduce 
the most drastic measures. The most cruel consequences of 
hyperinflation are felt by the most impoverished and 
hard-pressed layers of society. We are committed to that goal 
because we believe the fight against inflation is more than an 
economic goal, but rather an imperative and a social 
responsibility that ensures stability in our country. 
  Your excellencies, it has never been possible anywhere in 
the 
world to overcome a situation like ours without the sacrifices 
of all. [end recording] 
  The plenary session has adjourned until 1500.

  [Text] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo of the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] has reiterated that if a number of 
difficulties -- particularly shortages of funds -- persist, the 
program for the formation of the new single Mozambican army will 
be seriously delayed, jeopardizing the multiparty elections 
scheduled for October. Ngonhamo has accused the government of 
not making available necessary funds for the formation of the 
various components of the new army, which will consist of 
government and Renamo soldiers. 
  [Begin Ngonhamo recording] We should not forget this program 
is facing serious financial problems. I am concerned by the 
government's slowness in dealing with our financial 
difficulties. We are tired of this slowness. It leads us to 
believe that there are people who do not want the new army to 
operate before elections are held in the country. If this 
situation persists, it will seriously affect the formation 
process, hindering the deployment of the army units in strategic 
areas. If the difficulties persist, it will not be possible to 
form the new army before the elections. It seems that the 
government has been alleging shortages of funds to deal with 
these issues, but the truth is that in this way it will not be 
possible to form the new army before the elections, as 
stipulated in the accord. We have two armies in Mozambique, and 
all their expenses would be included in the budget to be 
allocated to the Mozambique Armed Forces. We are facing serious 
financial problems, which include the instructors in Dondo 
District. How will it be when we have 2,500 infantry troops and 
other groups, such as the ones training in Nacala and Catembe in 
Maputo? What will happen? This situation will create a problem 
that only the government will be blamed for later on. 
  We held a three-hour meeting in Dondo recently to find the 
solution to these issues, but the government seems to be 
allergic when it concerns money. No one wants to assume the 
responsibility. Everyone is pointing fingers at the others, and 
important and urgent decisions are not being made. Since the 
country is structured and has a government, we appeal to his 
excellency, President Joaquim Alberto Chissano, Mozambican head 
of state, to intervene so that the funds for the training 
program are released. We also appeal to all leaders of 
political parties to assist us, not financially, but in 
discussions with the government. If the agreement is not 
fulfilled, elections in the country will be seriously affected.

<F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Text] In Mozambique, a dispute is under way between 
opposition parties and the government. A team representing 15 
civilian opposition parties yesterday complained to President 
Joaquim Chissano that they have been largely left out of the 
process that will lead to general elections in the country in 
October of this year. In a memorandum delivered personally to 
the Mozambican head of state, the team accused the government of 
monopolizing the state budget. That document also said that the 
unarmed opposition faces such financial difficulties that it has 
not even been able to select its representatives in the 
electoral, provincial, and district commissions. That document 
also accuses the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] of 
continuing to divide the country into two separate territories. 
This afternoon, we interviewed Inacio Chire of the National 
Convention Party, PCN. We began by asking him what difficulties 
the Mozambican civilian opposition is faced with at this stage. 
  [Begin recording] [Chire] In practice, everything remained 
as 
it was during the days of the one-party system. There have been 
no major changes in terms of posture, leadership, or governance 
by the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] government. Thus, 
it continues to be very difficult to be in the opposition in 
this country. This has been a very difficult task for 
Mozambicans willing to bring about changes in the country. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What difficulties in 
particular? 
  [Chire] For instance, only five parties have installations 
in 
Maputo. No party has installations in the provinces. 
  [Correspondent] Which parties are you referring to? 
  [Chire] The PCN, the Mozambican Nationalist 
Movement-Mozambique Social Democratic Party, the Mozambique 
United Front-Democratic Convergence Party, the Mozambique 
Peopre's Progress Party, and the Mozambican National Union. 
Although registered, the other parties have no installations. 
The parties I have just listed have no installations in almost 
every province of the country. So, you can imagine the 
situation, particularly at a time when elections are due to be 
held in seven months' time. 
  There is also the question of funds. No party is entitled to 
draw funds from the State General Budget. The international 
community has made promises to give us funds, but there is 
nothing concrete. Only the Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] has been receiving funds from the international 
community. Of course, the government has been using the State 
General Budget. 
  Other difficulties have to do with the structures of a 
democratic state. There are no division of powers. There is no 
clear-cut separation between the state and the ruling party. 
So, you can imagine what the consequences are. We have always 
stood for the separation between the pacification process -- 
which includes the demobilization, confinement of troops, and 
selection of troops from the two sides for the new armed forces 
-- and the training of a so- called nonpartisan army. There can 
be no nonpartisan or even a national army when its forces are 
drawn from two parties. It is an army that can be easily 
dismembered at any time. That is what the experiences in other 
countries tell us. So, we believe that that process should only 
be dealt with by Frelimo, Renamo, and the United Nations because 
they are more directly involved in the process. There is, 
however, the process of democratization and of transition to 
democracy. We believe civil society as a whole should be 
involved in that process, not only political parties, but also 
every grouping. Unfortunately, in Mozambique the Frelimo 
government still wants to conduct the process on its own. [end

  [Text] OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim concluded 
his four-day visit to our country this morning. Shortly before 
leaving the Mozambican capital, that OAU official said he was 
hopeful that peace would become a reality in this country. 
Salim Ahmed Salim rejected the possibility that Mozambique 
might become a second Angola and noted that conditions in the 
two countries are rather different. 
  The OAU secretary general was seen off by Mozambican Foreign 
Affairs Minister Pascoal Mocumbi. At a meeting with 
representatives of donor countries in Maputo yesterday, Salim 
Ahmed Salim called on them to follow the Mozambican peace 
process with greater patience and understanding. He said, 
however, that he understood why the international community is 
applying pressure on the two sides for greater flexibility in 
the implementation of the General Peace Accord. The OAU 
secretary general noted that it would be important for 
Mozambique to continue receiving aid even after elections have 
been held. Salim Ahmed Salim assured the representatives of the 
international community in Maputo that his organization will 
continue to be involved in the Mozambican peace process.

<F P=106> [Report by Joe Latakgomo] </F>
  [Text] On March 5 last year, the Zambian nation woke up to 
the shock news that President Frederick Chiluba had declared a 
state of emergency and ordered the arrest of several opposition 
politicians, including the sons of former President Kenneth 
Kaunda, over plans to overthrow the government. 
  For many observers, the action was seen as a smokescreen for 
the serious economic problems that the country faced as Zambia 
battled to extricate itself from the clutches of 27 years of a 
socialist economic and political regime. The fragility of newly 
democratic regimes was demonstrated once more with Zambia's 
example. Intervention by the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund have not softened the impact of new economic and 
fiscal policies on the average Zambian, who had looked up to 
Chiluba and the Movement for a Multiparty Democracy (MMD) for 
economic salvation following their 1991 election victory. 
  For many, however, Chiluba has turned out to be a lameduck 
president. His opponents accused him of being unable, or 
unwilling, to deal with allegations of corruption and 
drug-dealing in government circles. And even his threat at the 
beginning of last year that 1993 would be the year of discipline 
within the party and government has done little to gain the 
confidence of Zambians. 
  Chiluba had warned that "inside the velvet glove was a fist 
of steel", when responding to a growing demand for clean and 
accountable government, but the only show of steel was against 
opposition members. Now into his third year of power following 
victory on the wave of pro-democracy sentiment that raced across 
Africa since 1991, time is running out if the MMD hopes to be 
returned to power in 1996. 
  So far, there has been very little tangible improvement in 
the lives of the people of Zambia. Indeed, for many, the 
situation has deteriorated. The price of consumer goods -- 
including staple foods -- has shot up, sometimes by as much as 
200 percent. Inflation is racing away above 150 percent. 
Unemployment is rampant, and the privatisation programme that 
was seen as a cure-all, seems to have ground to a halt. 
  Nobody in government seems to have fully grasped the 
vastness 
of the financial resources required to make the programme work. 
Health services, education and roads have deteriorated 
dramatically, and resistance to government expenditure on the 
"non-productive sector" has ensured the deterioration continues 
unabated. 
  Real per capita incomes are still low, and cuts in the 
bloated civil service have resulted in thousands of disgruntled 
civil servants, used to the patronage that derives from 
autocratic rule. This was the unkindest cut of all -- and the 
opposition was quick to exploit this and other job losses and to 
extol the virtues of previous systems which at least guaranteed 
jobs and kept food prices artificially low. 
  Chiluba assured concerned donor nations that the state of 
emergency would not be kept in force "a day longer than is 
absolutely necessary." Late last year, these donors at the 
Paris Club made it clear they would not deal with Zambia unless 
the government fired those involved in drugs and other corrupt 
actions. A variety of Ministers were axed or resigned. 
  The backing by the unions helped Chiluba -- and the MMD -- 
into power, but now even the support of labour is doubtful. 
Some unionists are now opposed to continued association with 
the government, and one leader has even called on the unions to 
"stop prostituting themselves to both workers, capital and 
political leaders." 
  Was liberalisation pushed too fast for such a fragile 
economy? It seems so, and the dangers of unfulfilled 
expectations are quite obvious for those -- including South 
Africa -- now going the path of democratisation.

<F P=106> [Report by Zanele Vutela] </F>
  [Text] The notorious CCB [Civil Cooperation 
Bureau]--allegedly disbanded two years ago--is very much alive 
and has established a criminal empire in Zimbabwe, it was 
reported this week. The weekly FINANCIAL GAZETTE, an 
independent newspaper in Harare, reports that the Zimbabwean 
business community has been extensively infiltrated by about 600 
criminals linked to the CCB. 
  The paper said that a crime syndicate, also linked to the 
Blue-Light Gang, was responsible for the exportation from SA 
[South Africa] to Zimbabwe of more than 600 stolen vehicles. 
The proceeds of the sales of the cars are believed to have been 
used to buy drugs which were then sold to finance the SADF's 
[South African Defense Force] covert military intelligence 
operations. 
  SA military intelligence was responsible for setting up the 
CCB. According to the paper the SA criminal syndicate was 
uncovered by the Zimbabwean security in early 1992. In June 
1993 Kaarman Noortman, whose aliases include Malcolm Anthony 
Cheney and Jack Cheney and who was allegedly wanted at the time 
by the SAP [South African Police], was arrested. It quotes SA 
records revealing that Noortman was a member of the stolen 
vehicle division at John Vorster square until 1985, and that in 
1993 he was wanted by the division for car theft and fraud. In 
July of the same year Noortman was handed over to SA immigration 
officials at Beit Bridge but according to the GAZETTE was 
"inexplicably let loose". 
  Intelligence sources also link Noortman to Frederick Alex 
Harding, regarded as the Blue Light Gang's Godfather and the 
CCB's operational chief in Zimbabwe until he was arrested and 
deported two years ago. It said that Harding, 50, was 
interviewed by the ANC [African National Congress] last year 
shortly after he had allegedly admitted that he had been 
recruited by a SA government agency to carry out dirty tricks in 
neighbouring countries. 
  Harding is also alleged to have admitted that he had headed 
a 
car and drug-trafficking ring in the 1980s whose task was to 
procure funds for military intelligence-linked operations. 
  SAP Media Liaison officer Colonel B.S.I. Van Rooyen 
confirmed 
to CITY PRESS that Noortman was an SAP member, and was 
re-arrested shortly after being freed at Beit Bridge. 
  Although Zimbabwean sources suspect Noortman of being in 
Harare, Major Van Rooyen told CITY PRESS that Noortman was 
currently awaiting trial at the Pretoria Central Prison.

  [Text] We start this newscast with Benin where all 
government offices have been paralyzed since this morning -- the 
first day of a renewable 72-hour general strike. The action was 
launched by 10 of the country's labor union federations which 
are demanding a minimum salary increase of 30 percent to 
compensate for the loss of purchasing power following the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. The strike is said to be 75 
percent effective, and is taking place in an atmosphere of 
absolute calm. From Cotonou, Ange-Hermann Gname reports. 
  [Begin Gname recording] Government offices, schools, customs 
offices, the main post office, and some parastatal offices have 
complied with the 72-hour strike order issued by the Federation 
of Beninese Workers' Unions, and have done so in absolute calm. 
This morning, the few workers who turned up at their workplaces 
either went to provide minimum services or to see for themselves 
the absence of their colleagues from work. Since this morning, 
the national radio has only been broadcasting a very light 
program which has not exceeded two and a half hours of air time. 
Policemen have been guarding the deserted government offices 
against any possible acts of vandalism. The Agency for Air 
Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar has also joined the 
strike and there was no movement of planes this morning at the 
Cotonou International Aiport. Only a minimum service permitted 
the flight by a Nigerian military aircraft of President 
Nicephore Soglo -- chairman of the Economic Community of West 
African States -- to Liberia, where he is supposed to chair the 
inauguration ceremony of the new democratic institutions in 
Monrovia today. 
  As we can see, the strike order has been well followed by 
the 
workers at a time when the Cotonou government is having a lot of 
difficulty in easing the social tension which has worsened since 
the devaluation of the CFA franc. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The head of state, President Henri Konan Bedie, 
received Dr. Jean-Pierre Okias, the personal representative of 
President Elhadj Omar Bongo, this morning. He was accompanied 
at the audience by Lambert Kouassi Konan, the Ivorian minister 
of agriculture. Dr. Okias came to discuss the active 
integration of our two economies. Here are more details from 
Dr. Okias: 
  [Begin Okias recording] We had the honor to be received by 
President Konan Bedie and we held lengthy discussions. I 
delivered a message from his brother and friend Alhadj Omar 
Bongo of Gabon. I am not allowed to disclose the exact contents 
of this message, but at least one part of the message can be 
retained, pertaining to the economic and trade issues contained 
in the message. [passage omitted] 
  Cote d'Ivoire is one of those African countries which has 
achieved self-sufficiency in food production. Gabon needs to 
have closer ties with Cote d'Ivoire to discover in what sectors 
we can develop relations, so that the Gabonese housewife's 
shopping bag remains full. [passage omitted] 
  It is up to us to take advantage of what food already exists 
in quality and quantity. Later, we will base our policy on the 
Ivorian experience to help us develop our agricultural sector. 
As you know, Gabon -- due to its specific climate, its 
semi-tropical geography -- has always based its economy on its 
industry, land and minerals. With the Ivorian experience, and 
the parallels in trade in existing products, we will benefit 
from your experience and learn how to sow our own seeds both in 
quantity and quality. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Our special envoy, Joachin Yao Ouattara, reports 
on the French-Ivorian military maneuvers taking place in our 
country. 
  [Begin recording] [Ouattara] The only way to make an Army 
combat-ready is to test it regularly on the field. For this 
reason, Ivorian troops and units of the French Army have been 
carrying out military maneuvers. The operation, codenamed Nzi 
94, has a number of objectives: It is one of many 
implementations of the defense accord linking Cote d'Ivoire to 
France since the dawn of our independence; it is also to train 
the general staffs in the joint preparation and conduct of 
operations; and finally, it gives the troops a chance to operate 
together and to organize the implementation of a unified 
French-Ivorian command for operations in time of need. 
  For these military exercises of national importance, after a 
10-year hiatus, the chief of defense staff of the Armed Forces 
of Cote d'Ivoire [FANCI], General Robert Guei, has set very 
precise goals for his men: to train the general staff to 
function within a tactical framework; to test the aptitude of 
military units to rural life and parachuting operations; and to 
utilize the know-how of signal officers to integrate them in the 
inter-allies command structure and maneuver network. 
  On the first day, we witnessed the parachute operation 
undertaken together by Ivorian and French parachutists. This 
operation took place under very good conditions. 
  [Guei] I am happy that everything went smoothly. Our French 
brothers-in-arms have just had a 10-hour flight and joined in 
the thick of the operations. You have witnessed the 
demonstrations. They were very well equipped; the French command 
was keen to put them in extremely difficult conditions. In the 
battlefield, nothing is left to chance, and when you leave 
things to chance the enemy will not spare you. This is why they 
have come fully prepared. I wish you all the best. 
  [Unidentified French commander] The parachute operation we 
have watched, undertaken by French and Ivorian parachutists, was 
carried out under very good operational conditions; and I am 
talking as a former commander of the 11th Parachute Division. 
These were difficult conditions because the terrain is not easy 
and it is hot, but this enables us to test our joint capacity 
for a common engagement. And I think that is what is important. 
For me, the operation has been positive. [passage omitted] 
  [Ouattara] The crossing of the Zambaco bridge enabled the 
battalion of the Bouake Engineers Regiment to test its light 
crossing equipment. Their performance no longer requires any 
further demonstration. 
  The naval exercise took place on the Rhin, a French TSM 
mobile support vessel, originally intended to maintain the 
different units of the French fleet in operational condition. 
The Rhin was built on 24 April 1961, launched on 17 March 1962, 
and has been in service since 1 March 1964. It has a crew of 11 
officers and 67 naval officers. During the exercise, three 
French Mirage F-16 planes, shot at a floating object which was 
pulling along behind the Rhin. Between an Ivorian patrol boat, 
the Elephant of the Ivorian Navy, and the Rhin, shooting 
exercises and mail transfer took place. 
  During air support and tactical exercises, which Defense 
Minister Leon Konan Koffi witnessed, troops engaged in mock 
confrotations and war games. [passage omitted] 
  [Koffi] We are here to witness the confrontation between 
enemy troops and our soldiers and we have seen that despite a 
few technical radio problems the operation was carried out under 
very good conditions. Our forces succeeded in dislodging the 
enemy forces. I am happy to have witnessed this operation. 
  [Ouattara] There was a big surprise at the end of this 
maneuver. On behalf of the Higher Council of the FANCI, General 
Robert Guei, the chief of staff, conferred on Minister of 
Defense Leon Konan Koffi the rank of honorary sub-lieutenant for 
his services to the nation. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Another military officer has been killed and two 
others wounded when an armed group fired at their vehicle at 
Bunjanya near Salaga last Thursday [3 March]. This brings to 
four the number of soldiers killed in the ethnic conflict which 
has been raging for the past six weeks in the Northern Region. 
Lieutenant Colonel Richard Debrah, task force deputy commander 
in charge of operations, said the military vehicle with seven 
soldiers on board was returning to Tamale from Salaga with some 
arms seized in the conflict when it was ambushed and fired on, 
resulting in the death of the officer. When the soldiers 
returned fire the attackers ran into the bush. Lt. Col. Debrah 
said the attack on the vehicle was intended at getting the 
military hardware it was carrying. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Monrovia, March 8 (AFP) -- The number of Liberian 
faction fighters needing to be disarmed under the peace plan 
ending four years of civil war has been halved, UN observer 
mission chief Daniel Opande disclosed here on Tuesday [8 March]. 
  The original estimate had been 60,000, comprising men under 
arms with the National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] of 
Charles Taylor, its main rival the United Liberation Movement 
for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO], and soldiers of the armed 
forces serving the interim government. But latest figures 
supplied by the three factions gave the NPFL and ULIMO l0,000 
guerrillas each and the army slightly fewer, General Opande said. 
  The new figure of some 30,000 was more realistic, since a 
ceasefire had been in force since last July and units had 
disbanded to return to civilian life, Opande said. 
  Opande, a Kenyan officer, is head of a 300-strong UN 
observer 
mission supervising the disarmament, which is being carried out 
by 20,000 troops from eight African countries comprising a 
monitoring group, Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group [ECOMOG], stationed in Liberia by 
the Economic Community of West African States. ECOMOG, then 
4,000-strong, was first deployed here in mid-1990. 
  According to UN estimates, 150,000 people were killed in the 
years of fighting, and a further 700,000 fled the country. UN 
special representative Trevor Gordon-Somers, speaking to the 
press after Opande, said he expected 60 percent of the refugees 
to return home "spontaneously" in the coming two to three 
months. He has a budget of five million dollars for resettling 
the combatants and restoring ruined villages. 
  After months of wrangling among the factions, aggravated by 
internal feuding, a five-member collective presidency, the state 
council, was sworn in on Monday to prepare for a general 
election next September.

  [Text] Disarmament in Liberia has begun. Many people will 
say that the real peace process is finally under way. Yesterday 
we heard the commander of the UN Observer Mission in Liberia, 
General Opande, saying he had been on a tour and had seen former 
fighters handing over their weapons. However, in this report 
from Monrovia, the BBC's West Africa correspondent, Ofeibea 
Quist-Arcton, shows that not all the fighters are disarming. 
  [Begin recording] [Quist-Arcton] Two truckloads move in the 
Schieffelin Camp, outside Monrovia, packed full of soldiers from 
the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL], the nominally national army 
which in the minds of many Liberians will always remain 
associated with the horror and killings of the civil war. But 
at Schieffelin they seemed ready and even eager to give up their 
weapons to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and shake off that damning legacy. 
  Under the watchful eye of the ECOMOG chief of staff, 
Brigadier Samuel Victor Malu and UN military observers, the 
Nigerian camp commandant at Schieffelin gave orders to the 
Liberian soldiers as disarmament began. 
  [Unidentified camp commandant] Attention! Do you understand 
me? I want you to face me, this way. That's how I want it. 
  [Quist-Arcton] In turn, the Liberian colonel told his men 
what to do -- a slight confusion between Nigerian English and 
Liberian English. Guns were neutralized and bullets discharged 
from magazines before the AFL chief lined up a large stock for 
registration and cleaning. They were a ragtag collection of 
men, many young; some in proper military uniform, others 
inadequately dressed in threadbare clothes and rubber slippers 
after years at war. How does it make you feel? 
  [Unidentified soldier] I feel happy. 
  [Quist-Arcton] Why? 
  [Soldier] Because we have been fighting since 1991 and the 
war is coming to an end, and that is why I am happy when they 
say we are disarming. 
  [Quist-Arcton] Do you think that peace will be lasting in 
Liberia? 
  [Soldier] Yes, peace will be lasting in Liberia 
  [Quist-Arcton] Nobody in Liberia had any illusion that 
disarmament would be (?smooth) or easy, and they were right, and 
camping and disarming the Armed Forces of Liberia is just the 
first step and probably the simplest. ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and Charles Taylor's National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] are still officially under 
arms. 
  [Unidentified military officer] About-turn! About-turn! Turn 
about, turn about! 
  [Quist-Arcton] Visiting the NPFL encampment site of Kolela 
near Kolela yesterday, about 50 miles north of Monrovia on the 
road to Taylor's Gbarnga headquarters, we got the impression at 
the Tanzanian ECOMOG troops in charge that everything was set to 
receive Taylor's fighters and their weapons. The mainly young 
troops milling around the camp seemed ready too waiting for the 
word from their boss but I am told that Charles Taylor is not 
taking any chances, indicative of the continuing mistrust among 
Liberians. Taylor is waiting before he gives the order for his 
boys to disarm. Of course, he is waiting for ULIMO, or so I am 
told. The very public split and the power struggle in the ULIMO 
leadership is causing the latest delay in the Liberia peace 
process. 
  Nigerian ECOMOG military commander, General Henry Odopu, is 
responsible for the areas that include Toby, one of the 
encampment sites allocated to ULIMO. 
  [Odopu] Now there is a problem with leadership. Everything 
has been put into place. The camp has been set up and the 
ECOMOG soldiers have taken their positions, and we have.... 
[pauses] The boys, in fact are ready to move in there. There 
are some minor problem within ULIMO, and it is that minor 
problem that ECOMOG headquarters is trying to resolve, and the 
moment it is resolved, they will move in. I can be very sure of 
that. 
  [Quist-Arcton] Gen. Odopu added that he wanted to be sure 
that ULIMO troops with different loyalties would not clash in 
camp once they have been disarmed, and he said he wanted that 
matter sorted out before hand. [end recording]

  [Text] President Nicephore Soglo of Benin has expressed 
gratitude to persons who have facilitated the Liberian peace 
process by enormous sacrifices in both human and material, as 
well as (?active) solidarity and brotherhood. President Soglo, 
who is also current chairman of ECOWAS [Economic Community of 
West African States], commended the United States in particular 
for its financial contribution and political support which have 
helped overcome the menace of (?various) difficulties on the 
road for peace. 
  President Soglo was speaking yesterday at the Centennial 
Memorial Pavilion in Monrovia during the installation of the 
five-man Council of State. He thanked the international 
nongovernmental organizations for providing humanitarian aid to 
the Liberian people victimized by the civil conflict. The 
Beninois leader paid tribute to the memory of the ECOMOG [ECOWAS 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] peacekeepers who bravely fallen on 
the field of honor as well as those Liberians who lost their 
lives during the senseless fratricidal war. He urged Liberians 
not to allow this to happen again. In his words, it is up to 
you Liberians to ensure [words indistinct] never again become 
the enemy of love but a friend, and that anybody [passage 
indistinct]. 
  Also speaking at the ceremony, the special representative of 
the UN secretary general, Mr. Joseph Mills, said the United 
Nations secretary general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, attached 
great importance to the occasion. The UN secretary general 
observed that after years of civil strife, the establishment of 
the National Transitional Government was a significant step 
toward the return of peace to Liberia. The assumption of the 
office of the Liberia National Transitional Government, he 
added, should bring an end to the division of Liberia in 
separate administrations. 
  The UN boss paid special tribute to ECOWAS for its 
longstanding and (?conclusive) efforts towards bringing peace to 
Liberia. He also [words indistinct] contributive efforts of 
ECOMOG for their perseverance in their mission. According to 
the UN secretary general, disarmament will be carried out by the 
ECOMOG in keeping with the Cotonou accord. He said it is up to 
Liberians themselves to pursue the peace process and ensure that 
order and stability returned to the country.

  [Text] Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri was 
received by President Alpha Oumar Konare and Prime Minister 
Ibrahim Boubacar Keita yesterday. Mohamed Salah Dembri 
delivered a message from Algerian President Liamine Zeroual to 
President Konare. His discussions with the Malian leaders 
centered on the internal situation in Mali and Algeria and on 
major subregional issues. 
  [Paris AFP in French at 0802 GMT on 9 March, in a 
Bamako-datelined item, adds: "Malian President Alpha Oumar 
Konare held talks yesterday with Algerian Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri on the Tuareg issue. Their talks focused 
mainly on obstacles to the implementation of the national peace 
pact signed in April 1992 between the Malian Government and the 
Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad, MFUA, whose guarantor is 
Algeria. MFUA has called for Algerian participation in a 
meeting in Bamako on the integration of former rebels into the 
regular Malian Army. This appeal comes at a time when divisions 
within the Tuareg movements who signed the peace pact have led 
to the death of four Tuaregs including Colonel Bilal Saloum, one 
of the main architects of the peace pact."]

  [Text] There is insecurity in the First Region. According 
to a statement from the Ministry of Territorial Administration 
and Security, the peaceful people of Samba Dramane hamlet 
yesterday between 0630 and 0700 GMT were waken up by gunshots by 
17 Peul aggressors coming from Senegalese territory. This 
attack, the statement said, left four victims including two 
inhabitants from the Segui village -- one hawker and one 
inhabitant from Samba Dramani hamlet. The Samba Dramane 
self-defense brigade pursued the assailants who left obvious 
footprints in their retreat. These footprints led to Jagi hamlet 
situated on Senegalese territory where all the inhabitants are 
of the Peul tribe. The Senegalese security forces went to the 
area and arrested members of the Samba Dramane self-defense 
brigade. 
  The regional and local administrative authorities are now on 
the spot and are actively preparing the meeting which our 
minister of territorial administration and security and his 
Senegalese counterpart will hold on Wednesday 9 March. These 
two officials met on 13 January at Bakool. According to latest 
reports, following the meeting of the governors of the two 
border regions in Kidira and upon instructions by the Senegalese 
authorities, these Malian citizens will be handed over to the 
Kayes governor this evening.

  [Text] The political parties signatory to the open letter 
sent to the president of the Republic on 21 February held a news 
conference at the Amdalaye Islamic Center yesterday. The 
discussions centered on the current education crisis, violence, 
and freedom of the press. Siaka Konate has the details: 
  [Siaka] The education crisis and the violence it engendered 
were at the center of this news conference. (Ameyi Dicko) of 
the Union for Democracy and Development gave a lot of 
information on the causes of the crisis and the opposition's 
contacts with the government aimed at ending it. 
  For his part, Ousmane Edmond Traore of the National 
Committee 
for Democratic Initiative [CNID] made suggestions aimed at 
ending the violence. 
  [Begin Traore recording] It is necessary and compulsory to 
release the students who were arrested, namely the Association 
of Malian Students and Pupils [AEEM] activists who were recently 
arrested. We condemn their acts of vandalism and violence but 
we call for their release since peace in this country is 
priceless. Also, we call on the AEEM and even demand the AEEM to 
stop its acts of vandalism because vandalism has never solved 
any problems. 
  We appeal to the government for multilateral dialogue as the 
AEEM no longer trusts the government. Since the association no 
longer trusts in negotiations, it is forced to obtain some 
guarantees and such guarantees are the other social forces. 
There is a need for multilateral dialogue to put an end to 
confrontation and misunderstanding due to mistrust. [end 
recording] 
  The CNID official also condemned what he described as verbal 
threats uttered by some top state officials, the excesses of the 
security forces, and the behavior of private militias. 
Concluding, he denied that the AEEM was manipulated by the 
opposition, adding that the AEEM is manipulated by its own 
problems. 
  For his part, the PSP [Progressive Sudanese Party] 
representative called for a national debate to be attended by 
all the social partners to help end the crisis. According to 
Ousmane Dicko, this debate which will aim at restoring social 
peace as well as security of goods and people will tackle all 
the nation's major problems, namely the education crisis, fraud, 
insecurity, structural adjustment, and so on. 
  Another issue discussed at this news conference was press 
freedom. The related paper was read by Ibrahim Diakite of the 
National Front. After stressing the media's role in the advent 
of democracy in Mali, the official said government is stifling 
press freedom. In this regard, he denounced the closing down of 
Radio Kaira, the censorship in force at the radio and television 
broadcasting corporation, and the lack of statutes for 
independent radios. He therefore made some suggestions to 
safeguard press freedom. 
  [Begin Diakite recording] We suggest, first, the presence of 
media practitioners elected by their colleagues, representatives 
of the Malian Association for the Defense of Human Rights and of 
the Malian Bar Association within the national committee on 
equal access to state media. Second, we suggest the extension 
of the committee's responsibilities beyond the period of 
electoral campaigns. The opposition wants the Higher 
Communication Council to include media practitioners elected by 
their colleagues. It calls for the division of the Malian Press 
Agency into three different directorates: First, a directorate 
of publications for ESSOR, PODIUM, and so on; a directorate of 
the news agency in charge of gathering news; and a directorate 
of advertisement. Finally, the opposition calls for the review 
of the provisions of the law on the media and related offenses.

  [Text] Niamey, 4 Mar (AFP) -- As an implicit reaction to 
the demands to self-determination by Tuareg rebels, the Niger 
Government today expressed its "determination to safeguard 
national unity, territorial integrity and the unitary form of 
the state." 
  In submitting its report to the cabinet meeting, Government 
Spokesman Moctar Diallo reiterated the government's 
"willingness" to maintain dialogue and called on his fellow 
citizens to continue to "examine with serenity" the demands made 
by the Coordination of the Armed Resistence [CRA], the leading 
organ of the Tuareg rebellion. 
  Regarding the prospect of the negotiations that are to 
resume 
at the end of March in Paris, the CRA demanded last month the 
right to manage, as autonomous territories, those parts of the 
country it is claiming in the north on behalf of the Tuareg 
community (10 percent of the population). The CRA also demanded 
quotas that would guarantee the representation of Tuaregs within 
the government, the National Assembly, and the National Armed 
Forces. 
  This reaction, the first from the government since the 
publishing of the demands by the CRA, follows that of the 
opposition, which rejected on 2 March "all maneuvers aimed at 
dividing the country." 
  Several associations and trade unions also made their stand 
clear against the CRA demands.

  [Excerpt] Congolese President Pascal Lissouba made a 
technical stopover at the Niamey Airport. He is on his way to 
Paris to where will pay a working visit. He was met by 
President Mahamane Ousmane. Responding to questions put to him 
by the press, President Mahamane Ousmane spoke about the demands 
of the armed rebellion. According to him, Niger is one and 
indivisible and its partition is unacceptable. He, however, 
asserted his readiness to pursue the dialogue to find a solution 
to the armed rebellion. Here is the head of state's position. 
  [Begin Ousmane recording] As the president, guarantor of 
national unity, guarantor of the integrity of the national 
territory, and guarantor of the Constitution, naturally, my 
position is that this is unacceptable. Niger is one and 
indivisible. Once and for all this must be made clear to all 
the sons of this country. The various demands made have now been 
transmitted to the various institutions of the state and to the 
various active forces of the nation to inform the public about 
their contents and also make their contributions in the form of 
proposals and suggestions for the holding of future 
negotiations. Naturally, the demands submitted by the 
Coordination of the Armed Resistance is a maximal position. It 
is just a negotiating position. This does not mean that they 
will stick to this. We know this very well, but it must be 
clearly understood that Niger is one and indivisible. It is one 
country. In fact, in the organization and management of the 
affairs of the state, there are forms and modalities which call 
on all the citizens of this country to be in charge of the 
administration of their own affairs at the various levels -- at 
the local, subregional, regional, and national levels. [passage

  [Excerpts] The National Assembly resumed sitting this 
morning to continue examining the demands of the rebels, which 
they began discussing on 4 February. The various parliamentary 
groups, which used the weekend to examine the document, 
disclosed the results of their discussions at the plenary 
session. Moussa Amagni has the details. 
  [Begin Amagni recording] The various parliamentary groups -- 
the opposition as well as the majority group -- after reading 
and analyzing the rebels' demands in serious and deep tones 
commensurate with the nature of this type of debate, rejected 
all the rebels' demands outright for several reasons. For some 
of them, the document is based on [word indistinct] and 
unfounded, while for others the document is aimed at 
partitioning Niger and is based on hegemony. It is neither 
formal nor constitutional. It is, antinationalistic, 
unpatriotic, and antirepublican. [passage omitted] 
  Much as the parliamentary groups condemned the contents of 
the document of the armed rebellion, they all called upon the 
government to lay a concrete basis for future negotiations. 
Essentially, they all urged the government to do everything 
possible to restore peace, calm, security, and harmony in Niger. 
The various groups made several suggestions to this end. In 
the meantime, the maturity of our people and their traditional 
vigilance must (?guide) us to nullify all attempts to plunge our 
country into the abyss of division, racial, and ethnic hatred.

  [Text] France is coming under severe criticism in Niamey, 
where political circles suspect it of encouraging separatism. 
The right claimed by the Tuareg rebellion to autonomous 
administration of the country's northern regions strongly 
opposed by opposition parties and black Tuaregs, who see Paris' 
hands in the separatist resolve of the Tuaregs. Jean de Dieu 
Ndong Ovono reports: 
  [Begin Ovono recording] Public opinion in Niger is 
traditionally hostile to the Tuareg community, which represents 
only 10 percent of the country's population, and the Niamey 
press, of course, echoes this. The paper to cast the first 
stone was SAHEL DIMANCHE, the government daily, which accused 
France of wanting to relaunch its colonial dreams to create a 
common organization of Saharan regions. This was an old dream 
for Paris, which wanted to make the Sahara a single entity so as 
to gain control over a region it saw as part of its sphere of 
influence. The Saharan part of Niger has enormous mineral 
resources, especially uranium, the country's main source of 
revenue. 
  Needless to say, what is being described in Niamey as the 
French plot is simply unacceptable. This is why the weekly 
DEMOCRATE urgently called on the Niger Government to seek a 
clear and unambiguous clarification from France on this affair. 
To crown it all, the weekly REPUBLICAIN, which is close to the 
Tuareg community, this week published an interview with Mano 
Dayak, president of the Coordination of the Armed Resistance, a 
coalition of four organizations of the Tuareg rebellion. This 
interview gave support to France's critics. Some Tuaregs even 
joined in the criticism. Thus a group of intellectuals, claiming 
to represent the black Tuareg community, issued a press release 
denouncing France's efforts to keep them in ignorance and 
servitude. France, they claim, is largely responsible for the 
trampling of our rights and liberties by deciding to put our 
community under the trusteeship of the white Tuareg minority. 
  Representatives of the Niger Government and the rebellion 
are 
to resume their negotiations at the end of this month in Paris. 
France, Algeria, and Burkina Faso have been chosen as mediators 
by the two sides. The Tuareg rebellion has already claimed over 
100 lives since it was launched at the end of 1991. It seeks 
the right to autonomous administration of certain northern 
regions and is also demanding quotas which guarantee its 
community's representation within the government, the National 
Assembly, and the Niger Army. [end recording]

  [Text] Paris, 8 Mar (AFP)--France on 8 March denied any 
French military presence in the Bakassi Peninsula, the disputed 
border territory between Nigeria and Cameroon, contrary to 
claims by the Nigerian Armed Forces spokesman. 
  French Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said 
Paris "denies the information claiming that French soldiers have 
been deployed in Bakassi Peninsula and Isengele. There is no 
French soldier in the area," he said. 
  Nigeria's Colonel Edet Okon stated on the morning of 8 March 
that "French troops have been physically deployed on the ground 
in East Atabong and Isengele" located in the disputed area. 
  According to Mr. Duque, "France has about 50 military 
advisers in Cameroon on a permanent basis in line with defense 
agreements between the two countries." 
  About 15 of the number recently arrived in Cameroon at the 
request of the Cameroonian Government," the spokesman recalled. 
He also expressed the hope that "diplomatic efforts being made 
by all sides for a peaceful settlement will yield positive 
effects soon."

  [Text] In Zaire, the debates of the High Council of the 
Republic, the new transitional parliament [HCR-PT], are going 
slowly but surely. Important articles, about which the 
opposition and the parliament had disagreed before, were finally 
adopted in Kinshasa yesterday. Herve de Guelinck reports: 
  [Guelinck] An agreement was reached yesterday on the 
autonomy 
of the Central Bank -- and this is no mean feat -- on the way 
regional governors are to be appointed, and on the government's 
responsibility. The transition rules are gradually getting 
clearer. 
  Another eight articles remain to be debated, including the 
famous 76, which makes provisions for the way the prime minister 
should be appointed. 
  That just shows how both sides are preparing for the final 
showdown, for which it will be necessary to know who is on which 
side, since good accounts make good friends. Each side is 
accusing the other of attempted corruption. The Sacred Union of 
the Radical Opposition and its allies say they possess a damning 
file indicating that the presidency has 120 million new zaires 
to convince some opposition counsellors to vote in favor of the 
ideas of the Political Forces of the Conclave. On the other 
hand, some newspapers have said that France and Belgium would 
pay those voting for Tshisekedi. Information or indoctrination? 
  Monsengwo, the HCR-PT chairman, has forbidden counsellors to 
attend the debates with more than 5,000 new zaires in their 
pocket; that is, about 300 French francs. One is never too 
careful.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 8 SAPA -- Civil servants in 
Bophuthatswana were on Tuesday [8 March] said to be massing for 
an anti-government rally at Lichtenburg, outside the homeland, 
later in the day. 
  Bophuthatswana defence force soldiers and police cordoned 
off 
townships around the capital Mmabatho on Tuesday in an attempt 
to prevent disgruntled government workers from attending a rally 
at the Mangope Stadium in Mmabatho. 
  Police were also moving into the nearby Rooigrond area, also 
believed to be beset by unrest. 
  Teachers in the independent homeland were out on strike on 
Tuesday and there was a sit-in by workers at the Health 
Department in Mmabatho. 
  The sit-in and occupation of the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting 
Corporation [BBC] offices was continuing to a lesser extent 
early on Tuesday afternoon after police had entered the building 
at about 11.30AM under a heavy screen of teargas. 
  A number of the workers committee members were arrested and 
led outside. 
  BBC Chairman Eddie Mangope, said to have been held hostage 
by 
the strikers, was in the boardroom at the BBC insisting it was 
business as usual and denying the hostage taking. 
  A work stoppage at the Mmabatho Sun Hotel has been planned 
for Tuesday afternoon, workers said.

<F P=106> [Report by A Thomson] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 8 SAPA -- Postponing the 
elections would be a disaster, the Congress of South African 
Trade Unions' [COSATU] Central Executive committee said in a 
statement on Tuesday [8 March]. "The COSATU Executive Committee 
is totally opposed to any change in the election date, for 
whatever reason," the statement said. 
  "This date has now become carved in stone and it would be a 
disaster for our country if we allowed those opposed to progress 
to hold the elections hostage," it added. 
  The committee pledged the full support of COSATU and its 
affiliates to striking workers in Bophuthatswana. "We fully 
support the demands of people in that region for 
re-incorporation and free political activity, as well as the 
securing of their pension monies, which are not safe while in 
the grip of the corrupt (President Lucas) Mangope regime". 
  The committee said Mr Mangope's refusal to submit to the 
democratic process had left people in that region with no option 
but to bring him to his knees. 
  The committee also rejected the replacement of the South 
African Police by a private security firm at major airports. 
"At this crucial time it is highly irresponsible to allow such 
sensitive public institutions to become vulnerable to attack by 
forces opposing the democratic process. COSATU demands the 
immediate reversal of this decision," the statement said.

province, Joseph Ntakirutimana, informed us about the events and 
told us that 32 people had died. They have organized urgent 
meetings to find ways to return the peace as soon as possible. 
Mr Ntakirutimana tells us what they have achieved so far. 
  [Begin recording] [Ntakirutimana] [passage omitted] We have 
noted the names of the suspects and found that the names of the 
killers were included. We brought 39 children to the Ngozi 
provincial headquarters. What I can add is that we are able to 
tell you the number of those killed -- only 32 deaths. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What is the security situation 
following the arrests in Musenyi? 
  [Ntakirutimana] The security is good as security personnel 
in 
the communes are keeping things calm. I would like to ask 
everyone in Ngozi Province to carry out their duties as normal 
and keep away from the people who are misleading them. [passage

  [Excerpts] After the events in Bujumbura, in Kamenge and 
what happened in Tangara, Ngozi Province where a serious breach 
of security took place resulting in many deaths, the prime 
minister, Anatole Kanyenkiko last night met security officials 
from all over the country. During the meeting many steps were 
taken to ensure a return to peace. 
  [Begin Kanyenkiko recording] Following the meeting chaired 
by 
the minister of defense on 5 March and the meeting chaired by 
the head of state on 6 March and 8 March, I chaired a meeting of 
security officials from Bujumbura and from up-country to discuss 
the ever-deteriorating security situation in Bujumbura and the 
events that took place in Musenyi, Tangara Commune, and Ngozi 
Province on 7 March. [passage omitted] 
  Before countrywide discussions on security and defense 
policy 
can lead to any concrete results, it is necessary to take the 
following immediate measures: 
  1. Security forces should work in cooperation with 
administration officials. They will operate from zone 
headquarters and other areas agreed upon with administrative 
authorities such as governors and communal heads. 
  2. If security agents need to rescue citizens in danger, 
they must inform the administrative authorities as soon as 
possible. 
  3. Security agents must rescue attacked citizens within the 
rule of law. Whoever does not respect the rule of law will be 
punished severely. 
  4. Wherever shots are heard, security personnel will have to 
identify quickly the location so that those who used the arms 
without permission can be arrested immediately so that people 
can see justice in action. 
  5. Roadblocks will be set up at night to prevent the 
movement of potential attackers. 
  6. The office of the state prosecutor has been called to 
investigate the recent killings in Kamenge, Musenyi, and Tangara 
as soon as possible so that the culprits can be identified and 
punished. 
  7. Administrative authorities are called to set up as soon 
possible security committees composed of men and women known for 
their impartiality who will work with the security officials in 
the suburbs and up-country areas. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Major Pierre Buyoya, former president of </F>
Burundi, by correspondent Monique Mas in Paris on 9 
March--recorded] 
  [Text] [Buyoya] In this country, the people speak the same 
language and share the same culture. There are no ethnic 
territories, but the ethnic factor has been used in the 
struggle for power. (?In this framework), ethnic feelings have 
been created and have become a reality. Democratization has 
fallen into the trap of ethnicity--first during the elections 
and then afterwards. I think the use of force on 21 October was 
the manifestation of the ethnic radicalism--of the ethnic 
extremism--of certain elements who, using the Army as a base, 
committed (?a crime). So what followed after that--the massacre 
of people inside the country--is the manifestation of ethnic 
radicalism. On the one hand, there is Tutsi radicalism, and 
then there is Hutu radicalism. When the extremists met, that 
created the tragedy we have seen. 
  [Mas] Nevertheless, the government and parliament--in other 
words, the institutions--have been set up in spite of 
everything. However, there is one institution, the Army, which 
seems to have great problems with regard to one part of the 
nation. A majority of the Burundian nation appears to feel 
great mistrust for the Army. 
  [Buyoya] The Burundian Army is, first, a consequence of the 
history of Burundi. Indeed, there is today an ethnic 
component--the Tutsis--who are the majority in the Army. So the 
problem we face is that, because of propaganda and politics, the 
Hutus have been led to mistrust the Army. 
  The question is: What can we do to change the situation? I 
think that reforms had been started to make all segments of the 
population of Burundi (?feel at home) in this Army. The Army 
has probably also been manipulated and used by politicians. I 
did not think it was an Army initiative to protect this or that 
individual, or to adopt this or that political position. The 
fact is, however, that the Army was used for political ends by 
other people--people who think that to be against the Army is 
politically advantageous, and others who think that to get the 
Army to take part in shows of force like that of 21 October is 
advantageous. Moreover, the Army had even agreed that reforms 
could be carried out. Those who need to make the reforms-- in 
other words, the political authorities, the politicians--must 
know then that the troops must be reeducated to learn what their 
place and their role is today. 
  [Mas] So the Army has to be reformed. Meanwhile, how is 
security to be ensured in the country? 
  [Buyoya] For me, to create security does not mean increasing 
the number of policemen, the number of troops or anything. It 
means, first and foremost, clear and precise orientation toward 
peace by the authorities. 
  We sometimes find equivocal attitudes and speeches, which 
means that organized groups in this or that category even 
believe they have support when they create chaos. First, we 
need to drop this tendency that we have had for so long of 
walking a tightrope ethnically and politically when dealing with 
certain questions-- especially the question of security. There 
must be a consensus for peace. 
  To take the actual case of the Army: It is true that the 
tragedy started off from the Army. Today, however, I think the 
Burundian Army--or at least its staff, its organized 
structures--has declared its loyalty to the government. Now the 
government, the political authorities, must be able to use the 
Army like the other structures of the state to make peace. So, 
if tomorrow the Army rejects this, if there are elements in the 
Army working in the opposite direction of this loyalty, this is 
a problem that has to be solved. The political authorities have 
to solve it. 
  I think what we need today is this determination to be able 
to reverse the tendency. This is essential: If we do not 
manage to do this, Burundi will be on the way to civil war.

  [Text] Yaounde, 9 Mar (AFP) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister 
Alhaji Babagana Kingibe arrived today in Yaounde where he is 
likely to be received tomorrow by President Paul Biya concerning 
the border dispute between the two countries, it is learned from 
a source close to the Cameroonian Government. 
  Cameroonian Government sources have refused to make any 
comment on the purpose of the Nigerian foreign minister's visit 
which has not been officially announced. 
  Since the Bakassi Peninsula border dispute broke out between 
the two countries at the end of December 1993, both Cameroon and 
Nigeria have sent out several diplomatic missions to their 
neighbors in a bid to try to settle the dispute. In connection 
with such diplomatic missions, Kingibe first went to Yaounde in 
early January.

<F P=106> [Report by FDS: "RPF Also Has Belgian Weapons"] </F>
  [Text] "The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has come to the 
conclusion that it will not succeed in taking power in Rwanda 
through political maneuverings, and is therefore once again 
preparing for war." For Paulin Murayi, the Brussels-based 
representative of President Habyarimana's MNRD [National 
Revolutionary Movement for Development], things are clear: The 
RPF, and only the RPF, is responsible for blocking the Arusha 
peace process. 
  Having said that, President Habyarimana is certainly no 
angel, and he has done everything to ensure that the Arusha 
negotiations with the RPF will be stymied as much as possible 
since the agreement that was finally reached and that is now 
seven months old reduces his powers in favor of power sharing 
with the RPF, which unleashed a war in Rwanda in October 1990. 
  In the meantime, Habyarimana took an oath on 5 January as 
"transitional president." In doing so, he is, in actual fact, 
the only existing institution resulting from the implementation 
of the Arusha agreements. Neither the enlarged government, 
which will include five RPF ministers, nor the transitional 
parliament, in which the five coalition parties will have a 
seat, has been set up because within the MDR [Republican 
Democratic Movement], the PL [Liberal Party], and the PSD 
[Democratic Socialist Party], three opposition parties that 
already have a seat in the government, old scores between 
supporters and opponents of the RPF are sometimes settled in 
deadly ways. 
  Quite a few observers believe that Habyarimana has stirred 
up 
this opposition, faultlines which run along ethnic, i.e. Hutu 
versus Tutsi, dividing lines, within the political parties in 
order to block the RPF's path to the government because, after 
the power sharing arrangement, there must follow a fusion of the 
government's existing army and the RPF forces after which 
Habyarimana will no longer enjoy a power base. Paulin Murayi 
(MNRD-Brussels) turns this analysis around: The dissent within 
the MDR, PL, and PSD will make it impossible for the RPF to 
manipulate the Arusha government, and therefore the RPF no 
longer sees any point in the peace agreements. He quickly 
glossed over the fact that according to UN observer Jacques 
Roger Booh-Booh the regime is widely distributing arms among 
Hutu farmers in order to concentrate primarily on the arms race 
which the RPF has,it says, begun. Independent sources also 
confirm that the RPF is buying arms in Eastern Europe and in 
Belgium, according to Murayi. 
<H5>  FN-Herstal </H5>
  In this regard, he pointed to an unexplained matter at 
FN-Herstal: After the coup d'etat in Burundi in late October 
1993, Burundi officers of the Tutsi ethnic group have presented 
themselves at the Liege-based arms factory with a major arms 
order. The Burundian Embassy in Brussels denied that this is an 
official order and the Belgian Government has denied that an 
export license has been issued. It was assumed that the 
officers in question were sent by the Tutsi putschists in 
Burundi. Paulin Murayi, however, maintains that the RPF high 
commander, Paul Kagame, was part of the group that knocked on 
the door of FN-Herstal. There are said to be reliable witnesses 
to this. Hence, the failed arms order was actually intended for 
the RPF. It is an open secret that the RPF, which recruits 
primarily among Tutsi exiles in neighboring countries, can count 
on much sympathy in the Burundian Army, which is still comprised 
almost exclusively of Tutsis. 
<H5>  Land Mines </H5>
  According to Murayi, the several thousand land mines that 
the 
RPF used to seal off the front line in northern Rwanda were made 
in Belgium. He does not know how the RPF got hold of these 
mines: It was initially thought that perennial troublemaker 
Libya had delivered them, but because of the fact that these 
mines were smuggled via Cairo and Mobutu is no friend of 
al-Qadhdhafi, the suspicion does not appear to be well-founded. 
In addition to British-Ugandan weapons, the RPF also has access 
to American arms, the supplier of which is unknown. 
  Murayi says that the fact that the RPF recruits many young 
Tutsis in the neighboring countries of Zaire (especially in 
North Kivu), Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania, something that has 
been confirmed by other sources, is clear proof that the RPF has 
moved away from the Arusha peace process toward an offensive 
military strategy. "They do not want to share power. No, they 
want to monopolize power. They still believe in the myth that 
they were born to rule, and that makes it impossible to live 
with them."

  [Text] Compromises were made during the People's Palace 
proceedings on 8 March. Differences on five out of the 12 
points were settled by the Constitutional Act Commission. The 
plenary session later added the finishing touches and accepted 
the decisions. Oscar Kambamba Kasungu has details on the 
proceedings. 
  [Begin recording] [Kasungu] [Words indistinct] 
constitutional 
draft texts are being debated upon one by one in line with the 
wish expressed by the commission on 7 March. Thus, the High 
Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] settled 
five out of the outstanding 12 points at the 8 March plenary 
session. They include Article 107 on the Bank of Zaire, which 
stipulates that the Bank of Zaire is the country's Central Bank. 
It is the issuing bank and monetary body, the state's cash 
controller, and the government's economic, financial, and 
monetary adviser. 
  Another issue discussed was Article 113b on the revision of 
the Constitutional Act, which must be approved by more than half 
the members of the HCR-PT and the government. With regard to 
the appointment of regional governors and deputy governors, 
Article 46, which has been amended, stipulates that they will be 
appointed and dismissed by the head of state through a system of 
balanced power sharing. Article 47, which stipulated that 
governors and deputy governors were appointed by decree has 
therefore been scrapped. The gendarmerie, the civilian guard, 
and the security services come directly under the government's 
jurisdiction. 
  The government is also in charge of state management but is 
accountable to the High Council of the Republic on that. There 
will be cooperation with the head of state on national defense 
and the diplomatic sector. Appeals and contentions should be 
regulated by decree as stipulated in Article 83. Some 
councillors were displeased with the postponement of the 7 March 
session, so the HCR- PT chairman gave reasons for the 
postponement. 
  [Monsengwo] We are making an effort to proceed by consensus 
if possible. There are certain issues which can be solved 
through majority or minority votes, but there are, indeed, 
others which cannot be solved that way. This is why I would 
like to appeal to councillors to let us try and understand one 
another as much as possible, avoid frustrating each other, and 
avoid blunders which could jeopardize not only the serenity of 
our debates, but also the progress of the HCR-PT. Above all, 
let us avoid those things in the interest of the nation. [end

<F P=106> [News conference by President Isayas Afewerki with </F>
unidentified correspondents at the National Assembly on 4 March 
-- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Unidentified corrspondent] The People's Front 
for Democracy and Justice issued a decision on relieving 
combatants from their duties. Can you brief us on the decision? 
  [Isayas] The first phase of relieving combatants of their 
duties began last year. About 26,000 combatants have been 
relieved of their duties since it started. The government 
borrowed 1 billion birr from the National Bank to be able to 
implement the project. The second phase is under way, conducted 
by the Ministry of Defense. The project will lend money to the 
combatants to enable them to establish small-scale 
(?industries). Some of the combatants will be employed in 
government institutions. Those who stay in the Army started 
receiving their salaries as of 1 January 1994. A study is under 
way currently to establish the ceiling of their salaries. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] The fourth session of the National Assembly 
passed a resolution on the press laws of the country. What will 
be the basis for the press law? Will a press law be passed in 
this transitional period? What will be the role of the press 
law regarding the drafting of the constitution? 
  [Isayas] First of all, the press law will be based on 
freedom 
of expression. This is not something new. Freedom of 
expression existed before and after independence. So, it does 
not mean there was no freedom of expression. But it is 
essential to establish laws and democratic institutions. The 
press law to be passed is not something new, but just official 
confirmation. This press law will be in line with the country's 
course and charter. [passage omitted] 
  The passing of the press law has a role in the country's 
political affairs. Without it is impossible to have an open 
political [word indistinct]. The drafting of the constitution 
will have no meaning without a press law. Citizens benefiting 
from the press law can express their views freely in the 
drafting of the constitution in this transitional period. One 
of the most important issues which has to be given priority is 
the passing of the press law. Because of this, the fourth 
National Congress decided to give it priority.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 8 March (AFP) [dateline as received] -- 
Kenyan police Wednesday [9 March] said that two Ethiopians who 
hijacked a Saudi airliner to Nairobi faced trial in Kenya, but 
would not confirm reports that they were illegal immigrants 
expelled from Saudi Arabia. One of the hijackers, a man who was 
injured when police captured the pair on Tuesday, had been armed 
with an imitation pistol, a police spokesman said. An unarmed 
woman with him was seized unhurt. 
  The Saudia airline company stated that some 140 Ethiopian 
passengers who had been freed before police ended the hijack bid 
were flown Wednesday to Addis Ababa on a special flight. Press 
reports Wednesday said that the hijackers were illegal 
immigrants and added that they had a third accomplice who 
managed to merge with other passengers, but a police spokesman 
said this was "speculation." [passage omitted] 
  Most of the passengers were Ethiopian Muslims who had been 
on 
pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city of Mecca and whose Saudi 
visas had expired, diplomatic sources said. A number of them 
had tried illegally to remain in Saudi Arabia but had been 
expelled, the sources added. Ethiopian Ambassador to Kenya 
Ofato Alew told AFP that embassy staff had played no part in the 
negotiations and were not officially informed of the affair.

Italian embassy in Mogadishu. It was lowered at 0718 this 
morning. Five members of the "Colonel Moschin" battalion lowered 
the flag -- the same five men who had raised the tricolor on 15 
December 1992. 
  There are no more Italian troops in Mogadishu. Some 
divisions remain in Jowhar, where this morning General Carmine 
Fiore, the commander of the Italian contingent, will hand over 
the "Italia" hospital in the town to the non-governmental 
organization, InterSos. The hospital will be run by Italian and

<F P=106> [Report by Sayyid Ahmad Khalifah: "Ali Mahdi: Aidid Is a </F>
Figure One Should Have Dealings With"] 
  [Text] Jeddah -- Interim Somali President Ali Mahdi Mohamed 
has stated that Somali National Alliance [SNA] Leader General 
Mohamed Farah Aidid is one of the figures in Somalia and that 
duty dictates that he should be involved in the efforts to solve 
the country's problems. He accused Aidid of trying to impose 
his leadership on others and of rejecting consensus. In an 
interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he said, however, that Aidid's 
insistence on his current obstructive position did not mean that 
we would stop at this point. In Mogadishu yesterday there was a 
heavy exchange of fire near the airport where the Egyptian 
contingent of the UN forces is deployed. The last U.S. unit 
scheduled to leave Somalia boarded a ship yesterday on its way 
back to the United States. 
  In a telephone interview from Cairo, Ali Mahdi, who is also 
the leader of 12 Somali factions, said in reply to a question: 
We do not know the reasons for Gen. Aidid's absence. What we 
have heard is not convincing. The Cairo meeting's achievement 
was that it confirmed the importance of setting up the country's 
constitutional insitutions and it confirmed the unity of the 12 
allied factions and enabled us to explain our views to the 
Egyptian Government and leadership and to the Arab League. 
  [Khalifah] What is the next step regarding Gen. Aidid and 
contacting him? Should we give up hope of dialogue with him? 
  [Mahdi] We have decided to send two delegations, one of them 
to northern Somalia to meet with our brothers there and to talk 
to them about a comprehensive national solution to Somalia's 
problem and about rejection of obstructionist methods, division, 
and secession, and the second to Mogadishu to meet and hold a 
dialogue with Gen. Aidid on ways of implementing the resolutions 
of the Addis Ababa conferences and the current Cairo conference. 
We regard Gen. Aidid as one of the figures in Somalia and it is 
our duty to have dealings with him to solve the country's 
problems but that does not mean that his insistence on his 
current obstructive position would stop us at the point we are 
now. 
  [Khalifah] What has been decided regarding authority in the 
country? 
  [Mahdi] We have decided to form a government and have a 
parliament and a leadership within two months from now in 
accordance with the Addis Ababa resolutions. We also decided to 
hold general elections in March next year and we would, of 
course, be happy if Gen. Aidid and his colleagues participated 
in these constitutional developments which are the only option 
open to the Somalis. 
  [Khalifah] What role will the United Nations play in these 
future constitutional developments? 
  [Mahdi] We believe that the United Nations should stay to 
supervise all these processes and we will submit an official 
request for that to the secretary general and the big powers. 
  [Khalifah] Is there any interest or any positive point in 
shuffling the cards and mixing the problem of the secessionist 
north with the problem of the infighting south? 
  [Mahdi] Somalia is one country and it was the consequences 
of the war which led to what happened in the north. We believe 
that the solution is the same for both and we must hold 
consultations with the northerners to resolve Somali issues and 
move on to the stage of rebuilding the state's various 
institutions which have all collapsed because of the fighting 
here and there.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 9 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana police have 
denied reports of South African Police involvement in a march by 
striking teachers on the South African Embassy in Mmabatho on 
Wednesday [9 March]. In a statement, Bophuthatswana police 
rejected the report which said South African Police were called 
in to assist when the teachers clashed with Bophuthatswana 
policemen. 
  "This is untrue. Although a Bophuthatswana police contingent 
was present, these men kept their distance as they had been 
requested to do," the statement said.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- More than 200 
Bophuthatswana police, some armed and in uniform, gathered 
outside the South African Embassy in Mmabatho on Thursday [10 
March] afternoon to demand the homeland's re-incorporation into 
South Africa. The police no longer wanted "to act against or 
kill our brothers". 
  "We are being used as weapons in a political game that we no 
longer want to play," said one of the disgruntled policemen who 
declined to be named for fear of recriminations. 
  Their demands include that all citizens of Bophuthatswana be 
allowed to engage in free political activity; that they be able 
to participate in the forthcoming elections; that they be 
awarded a 50 per cent pay increment; that their pension fund 
contributions be paid out; and that Bophuthatswana be 
re-incorporated into South Africa. 
  Other demands include the re-opening of the Bophuthatswana 
Broadcasting Corporation, the re-instatement of broadcasting 
staff fired on Wednesday and total press freedom in the homeland. 
  Police spokesman and [words indistinct] told SAPA: "We can 
no 
longer be the enemies of our people." He said police were being 
used for political gain and the present wave of unrest had led 
to policemen in lower echelons coming under fire for actions 
taken over the past two days. 
  "We are suffering, our families are suffering, our houses 
are 
being burnt and valuable property is being destroyed," he said. 
  The handing over of the memorandum was watched by agroup of 
six senior police officers, none below the rank of major. This 
could well signal the collapse of control of Bophuthatswana by 
the police. 
  The police have acted against strikers in the civil service, 
the parastatal Bophuthatswana broadcasting corporation, students 
at the university of the Bophuthatswana and militant youths. 
  In an interview with SAPA on Wednesday, South African 
Ambassador Tjaart van der Walt said: "The feelings being 
witnessed on the streets are just the tip of the iceberg and the 
need for re-incorporation runs much deeper than is obvious to 
the casual observer". 
  Mr van der Walt confirmed to SAPA on Thursday the memorandum 
had been handed over and would be addressed. He said he would 
inform Pretoria of the development.

  [Excerpts] Unrest in Bophuthatswana has claimed the life of 
a policeman. The policeman was on duty in Mabopane when he was 
shot by members of the public. In other incidents yesterday 13 
people were wounded in Mafikeng, and a policeman's house was 
burned down in Mmabatho. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana has said 
he is prepared to resist incorporation into South Africa even if 
he is left with only 50 soldiers. Addressing senior officers of 
the Bophuthatswana Defense Force in Mmabatho, Mr. Mangope said 
he had been promised military assistance from outside the state 
which he had turned down. 
  According to a senior officer who attended the meeting, 
members of the defense force defied the president by refusing to 
sing the national anthem.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- A stayaway in 
Bophuthatswana on Thursday [10 March] turned Mafikeng and a 
giant shopping centre in Mmabatho into virtual ghost towns. 
Central Mafikeng was quiet with few people on the pavements and 
most stores closed. 
  Mmabatho's shopping complex Mega City had a few people 
strolling in the malls but all the shops were shut. Nearby 
government offices also appeared to be deserted with little sign 
of activity. 
  The Universiy of Bophuhatswana [Unibo], where students and 
police clashed on Wednesday, was also almost deserted with a few 
students continuing to man the gates that were barricaded on 
Wednesday. The barricades across the street at the entrance to 
Unibo had been removed, and only a garbage skip, a number of 
road signs and other debris remaining. 
  Youths had erected barricades at the entrance of Soweting 
township between Mafikeng and Mmabatho and were not allowing 
anyone into the area where, on Wednesday night, running battles 
between youths and police were reported on Wednesday night. A 
spotter plane circled the area on Thursday.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- A REUTERS television crew, 
which has covered wars around the world, was severely beaten by 
Bophuthatswana police on Thursday [10 March] and said it was 
pulling out of the area immediately. 
  Mark Chisholm, Paul Arubicek and Frank Kgolane were stopped 
by Bophuthatswana police near Mafikeng, hauled out of their car 
and beaten with batons, sjamboks [whips] and fists. "They 
pulled us out of our car, tore off our bullet-proof vests, beat 
us up, chucked our equipment about and told us to leave," Mr 
Arubicek told SAPA minutes after the incident on Thursday 
morning. 
  The police had blamed them for littering the streets with 
stones, and their kevlar vests were no protection against the 
savage beating. On their return to the Mmabatho Sun Hotel 
television crews filmed the weals on their backs from the 
sjamboks and batons. 
  Mr Arubicek's T-shirt had been ripped to shreds and Mr 
Kgolane's T-shirt was full of the blood which sprayed from his 
nose during the beating. 
  The international television news team has covered hot spots 
as intense as the Gulf, Sarajevo and Beirut. "When the police 
start turning against the press reporting the crisis there is no 
point in hanging around. We are pulling out immediately," Mr 
Chisholm said. 
  Another television crew, from the international agency WTN 
[World Television News], was also beaten by police in Mafikeng. 
  Journalists on the streets to report on the almost total 
stayaway by workers in Bophuthatswana are leaving hotel grounds 
with kevlar protection, many with luminous flashes identifying 
them as press or with the name of the agency they are working 
for. 
  The information service of Bophuthatswana claimed it had no 
knowledge of either incident. 
  An SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] staff 
member working in Bophuthatswana, Phineas Diphopo, was severely 
beaten on Thursday and warned he would be shot if the 
Bophuthatswana police saw him on the roads again. He was 
stopped by police on the Mmabatho airport road which had been 
blocked by youths using stones and burning tyres. The police 
had their own roadblock on the Mmabatho side of the barricade. 
  "The police pulled me out of the car, assaulted me with 
their 
fists and their feet. They also hit me with a sjambok," he 
said. The car was searched during and after the assault. "When 
I left, they threatened to shoot me if they saw me on the roads 
again." 
  Mr Diphopo told SAPA that at the scene of the burning of the 
house of security policeman David Morobi, police were heard to 
say they would "start taking an eye for an eye". 
  Mr Diphopo was was beaten on Wednesday night on the same 
road, but by the youths who had erected the barricade.

  [Text] The state president, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, says the 
Transitional Executive Council, TEC, must take far-reaching 
decisions and use its powers to bring stability to 
Bophuthatswana. He said it is clear that general calls to the 
Bophuthatswana government have not helped and that if necessary 
discipline must be enforced by the security forces in an 
impartial manner. 
  At a news conference on the last day of his northern 
Transvaal election campaign road show, President de Klerk said 
he had discussed the issue with ANC [African National Congress] 
leader Nelson Mandela. Mr. Mandela had raised the question of 
state intervention in Bophuthatswana with him. 
  President de Klerk said he had told Mr. Mandela that his 
security and other advisers were keeping him fully briefed on 
the situation in the homeland and that any intervention would 
depend on whether the lives and property of South Africans were 
in danger. He said he would possibly make a statement on the 
matter by tomorrow.

  [Text] Levubu March 9 SAPA -- The South African Government 
would take steps to safeguard South African citizens, assets and 
interests in Bophuthatswana, President F W de Klerk said on 
Wednesday [9 March]. Addressing journalists during a stopover 
on his northern Transvaal election tour, he said the 
government's attitude was that Bophuthatswana had to be 
re-incorporated into South Africa. However, any South African 
measures would only focus on safeguarding South African 
interests in the troubled homeland. 
  Mr de Klerk said the best way for President Lucas Mangope's 
ruling party to test its support in Bophutshwana was to 
participate in the elections. "Our political analysis is that Mr 
Mangope's party does not have widespread support and that he 
will not do well in the election." 
  Mr de Klerk said the elections could not be delayed 
indefinitely to accommodate parties still outside the process. 
He said Parliament would amend the electoral act to allow for 
the late submission of candidates' lists by political parties 
participating in the election. 
  He said this was his initiative and he was pleased that both 
the Transitional Executive Council and the the Independent 
Electoral Commission had supported the proposal. "It creates 
logistical space for parties that have registered late to draw 
up and submit their candidate list for the elections." 
  Mr de Klerk said he was also pleased to hear from media 
reports that Gen Constand Viljoen, Afrikaner Freedom Front, was 
preparing to lodge its candidate list. 
  Referring to international mediation demanded by the Inkatha 
Freedom Party, he said he had not received any detailed proposal 
and remained sceptical that mediation would be successful. Mr de 
Klerk said the election date could not be altered in any way to 
accommodate any mediation attempt. 
  Earlier, Mr de Klerk encountered an African National 
Congress 
demonstration for the second time on Wednesday when he visited 
the homestead of Venda's youthful king, Dimbanyika Mpephu, the 
son of former President Patrick Mpephu. About 100 ANC protesters 
chanted slogans and toyi-toyied in the grounds of the royal 
homestead while Mr de Klerk met the king indoors. 
  The demonstrators carried posters stating: "Try and recruit 
on your white farms" and "De Klerk is a criminal". 
  The demonstrators dispersed after Mr de Klerk's motorcade 
left for Levubu.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 10 SAPA--African National 
Congress [ANC] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday [10 
March] called for immediate South African Government 
intervention in Bophuthatswana to protect lives. Mr Ramaphosa 
would not be drawn on the form of intervention. 
  ANC President Nelson Mandela would speak to State President 
F.W. de Klerk on Thursday about the crisis in Bophuthatswana and 
impress on him the urgency of taking decisive steps against the 
homeland, Mr Ramaphosa added. He said the crisis in 
Bophuthatswana was such that it could not wait for a 
Transitional Executive Council meeting on Monday. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said an emergency session of the executive 
council might be called, but the South African Government was 
fully entitled to give protection to its citizens in 
Bophuthtastwana -- in consultation with the ANC. "We are 
concerned that unless action is taken immediately, we might be 
facing a situation which could be worse than Bisho," he said, 
alluding to a massacre in Ciskei in 1992. 
  "All indications are now that it is quite possible that the 
security forces in Bophuthatswana will start panicking and open 
fire at randonm at people who are protesting legitimately for 
their human rights." 
  Mr Ramaphosa said: "It is quite clear to us that (President) 
Lucas Mangope has put himself on a collision course with the 
people of South Africa as whole." 
  The executive council had been approached by the Civil 
Servants Association of Bophuthatswana for talks on 
rationalisation, job prospects, salaries and pensions. Mr 
Ramaphosa said Bophuthatswana would cease to exist after April 
27 and it was important that administration and government 
services in that area should continue.

Bophuthatswana while South African interests and nationals are 
not threatened. Mr. Botha was responding to a statement during

government's responsibility to deal with the present unrest 
situation in the state.

  [Text] The newly founded Freedom Front of General Constand 
Viljoen and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] of Dr. Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi are apparently not going to take part in the April 
election. Freedom Front representatives were present at the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] in Johannesburg this 
afternoon, but did not submit the party's list of election 
candidates when they saw that the IFP was not there. 
  Earlier there was confusion over whether General Viljoen had 
submitted a candidates' list because he went into the IEC 
offices. A Conservative Party MP [Member of Parliament], Dr. 
Pieter Mulder, told the SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] that the Freedom Front did not hand a candidates' 
list to the IEC today. 
  Twenty-three of the 28 parties which registered for the 
election handed in candidates' lists this afternoon, with many 
of them arriving minutes before the deadline. The result was 
that the 4.30 deadline was extended to give the latecomers time 
to hand in their lists. 
  The ANC [African National Congress] and the PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] were among the parties which arrived 
late.

the election submitted lists of candidates to the Independent

  [Text] Johannesburg March 9 SAPA -- The rightist Freedom 
Front was considering taking part in the April elections -- but 
had not yet submitted candidate lists, Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] Chairman Justice Johan Kriegler said on 
Wednesday [9 March] night. 
  Three unidentified representatives of the front were holed 
up 
in a meeting with electoral officials for three hours on 
Wednesday afternoon and evening after the close of the 4.30pm 
deadline for parties to submit a candidates' list. 
  The judge -- who also brushed aside concern about deadlines 
-- met the Freedom Front offcials, but would not comment on his 
discussions. 
  Justice Kriegler said he had also been in touch with the 
Inkatha Freedom Party which he said had "not yet" submitted its 
lists. The judge brushed aside concern about all deadlines 
imposed by the Electoral Act."The deadline is a journalistic 
concern and we are in [words indistinct] determine whether 
somebody has exceeded the speed limit. We are trying to organise 
an election of national reconciliation." 
  The judge added the law could be amended retrospectively if 
all the political parties agreed. 
  The Freedom Front officials arrived shortly before [words 
indistinct]. 
  Earlier in the day 25 parties, including the National Party, 
African National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress, [words 
indistinct] party, minority groups as well as regional and 
special interest parties, submitted candidate lists.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 9 SAPA -- President F W de 
Klerk's refusal to allow a plebiscite among whites was plunging 
South Africa into a dangerous situation, Afrikaner Volksfront 
[AVF,Afrikaner National Front] General Constand Viljoen said on 
Wednesday. He said the country was headed for a head-on 
collision, and that a "volkstemming" [plebiscite] before April 
27, to prove support for a volkstaat [homeland], was 
non-negotiable. 
  At the same time, the April 27 election should be postponed 
for at least two months to allow the Freedom Alliance enough 
time to prepare for participation. But, interviewed on the 
television programme Agenda, Gen Viljoen did not state whether 
the Freedom Front he registered would be submitting a candidate 
list. 
  Gen Viljoen said he met Mr de Klerk on Tuesday, but Mr de 
Klerk again refused to allow a poll among whites. 
  The Afrikaner should be given a chance to enter the new 
South 
Africa peacefully and not violently, Gen Viljoen said. It was 
very unwise of Mr de Klerk to have rejected the request for a 
white plebiscite, and the country was being put at risk. 
  "Now we have the situation that in April we won't have a 
volkstaat and there will be great dissatisfaction. 
  "The Afrikaner will be angry and if there is war people 
should not blame me," Gen Viljoen said. He maintained that 
securing a volkstaat peacefully was better than fighting, in 
which many people would be killed. 
  In South Africa, however, pieces of paper did not mean much, 
and in such an unsafe situation the Afrikaner should maintain 
his military capabilities. 
  Gen Viljoen said the Freedom Front waited for the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] delegation at the IEC's [Independent 
Electoral Commission] offices on Wednesday in the interests of 
maintaining solidarity within the Freedom Alliance. 
  He had not gone to the IEC's offices because he had been 
engaged in other meetings. 
  He told Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg on 
Wednesday they should meet to manage the conflict. Gen Viljoen 
said they got along famously on the principle of Boer consensus. 
  The ANC [African National Congress] should realize that 
while 
he was trying to accommodate the Afrikaner constitutionally and 
peacefully, he was experiencing strong opposition from rightwing 
quarters who wanted a volkstaat. He had tried to get his AVF 
colleagues to go along with his initiatives but failed. 
  If the Freedom Alliance's constitutional demands were met, 
however, they would participate in the election, which would 
have to be postponed to allow the alliance time for prepapations. 
  Gen Viljoen said the fact that the police had warned him 
about far rightwing plots against himself showed how serious the 
situation was. There were 85 far right organisations while the 
AVF was an umbrella body for only 17. 
  But Gen Viljoen said he had to accept this situation. He was 
a soldier who had been in many battles.

  [Text] Durban March 9 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party's 
[IFP] Central Committee resolved in Ulundi on Wednesday [9 
March] night not to submit an election candidate list until 
pre-conditions relating to outstanding constitutional 
differences were met. 
  Central Committee spokesman T C Memela said the 
pre-conditions were those outlined by the IFP last Friday, which 
included: international mediation in the constitutional 
deadlock; amending the interim constitution; and, mediation to 
allow Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to secure the interests of 
his nation. 
  The Central Coomittee also wanted a rationalisation of the 
electoral process and timetables to translate constitutional 
agreements into a fair and free election in which all parties 
could compete on an equal footing. 
  Mr Memela also said the ball was now in State President F W 
de Klerk's court to extend the deadlines for registration of 
parties and submission of candidate lists because he was 
empowered to do so in terms of the electoral act. 
  He said the Central Committee wanted international 
mediation to take place to assist in the resolution of 
constitutional differences and the process of amending the 
interim constitution. Mediation should also focus on whatever 
steps King Zwelithini decided to take to secure the interests of 
the Zulu kingdom. 
  Mr Memela said mediation was necessary on the question of 
conflict resolution and investigation into criminal violence. 
The Central Committee, he said, reconfirmed its commitment to 
pursue the international mediation process with "resolution and 
urgency". 
  Wednesday night's decision by the IFP is a reaffirmation of 
its stance adopted ast week after a summit between the party's 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela in Durban. 
  There the IFP said it would provisionally register for the 
April elections, and participation in the poll would be subject 
to the success of talks in meeting its pre-conditions.

  [Text] Pretoria March 10 SAPA -- Failure by right-wing 
parties to submit candidate lists by Friday [11 March] afternoon 
would result in their names being removed from the ballot, 
Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer said on 
Thursday. Addressing a press conference in Pretoria, Mr Meyer 
said the government was prepared to negotiate with the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] and the Transitional 
Executive Council to extend the time for submitting candidate 
lists. 
  This was, however, subject to a "clear indication" from the 
Inkatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front within the next 24 
hours that they intended to do so. This was stretching the 
technical requirements because Wednesday's deadline had passed 
without these parties submitting candidates lists to complete 
their "provisional" registration. 
  Logistically, Mr Meyer said: "We have until tomorrow 
(Friday) 
afternoon". 
  Mr Meyer rejected Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National 
Front] leader Constand Viljoen's suggestion that the election be 
postponed for two months as "not making sense". Gen Viljoen had 
proposed that one month should be used for mediation and the 
next to prepare for the elections. 
  Also, there was no need for a seperate referendum or 
plebiscite to determine support for a "volkstaat" [homeland] 
because through the elections' two-ballot system they could 
determine their support and where it was located, Mr Meyer said. 
  The right-wing had no grounds to take "undemocratic steps" 
to 
realise their ideal and the government would see that the 
necessary steps would be taken to protect the process and the 
elections, Mr Meyer warned. Mr Meyer urged the Freedom 
Alliance's parties to participate in the elections, saying their 
objections had been dealt with in the amendments to the interim 
constitution. Gen Viljoen had acknowledged this, he claimed. 
  Referring to Gen Viljoen's proposal to postpone the 
elections 
for at least two months, Mr Meyer said: "It cannot work. With 
six to seven weeks before the polls there are already complaints 
from Freedom Alliance parties about time contraints to prepare 
for the elections, it would be even more so with only one month." 
  He added that the government was not in principle against 
international mediation, but it was not clear over what issues 
further mediation was needed.

  [Text] Pretoria March 10 SAPA--Eggs were thrown at the 
stage from where Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf 
Meyer addressed an occasionally chaotic meeting at the 
University of Pretoria on Thursday [10 March]. 
  Mr Meyer's announcement that the government was prepared to 
negotiate with the Independent Electoral Commission and the 
Transitional Executive Council to allow further time for the 
Inkatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front to submit their 
candidates lists was almost drowned out by right-wingers' chants 
and singing of the national anthem. 
  Mr Meyer said, however, the two parties should give a clear 
indication within the next 24 hours on whether they wanted to 
submit candidates lists. 
  Campus security personnel handcuffed and arrested a number 
of 
students after scuffles broke out in the hall. Right-wing 
students surged forward, yelling "Constand, Constand (Constand 
Viljoen, chairman of the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front])" 
and heckled Mr Meyer. Mr Meyer said he would not be threatened, 
and that the university authorities should act against the 
errant students.

<F P=106> [Report by Ben Maclennan] </F>
  [Text] East London March 10 SAPA -- Transkei leader Maj-Gen 
Bantu Holomisa was blackmailing the National Party [NP] over its 
attempts to open an election office in the territory, Minister 
of Law and Order Hernus Kriel said on Thursday [10 March]. Mr 
Kriel was speaking to National Party workers in East London at 
the start of a three-day tour of the border. He said he 
telephoned Gen Holomisa who is also an African National Congress 
[ANC] candidate last week and said the NP wanted to open an 
office in Transkei. 
  "He said I must put it in writing, which I did." In return 
he received a message in which Gen Holomisa listed "all 
thoughts" [as received] of preconditions. "He said we must give 
more vehicles for their police force and sought out all thoughts 
[as received] of other issues. That is not levelling the 
playing fields. That is not democracy. That is pure blackmail." 
  Mr Kriel said he was still considering how to deal with the 
situation. The most likely route would be through the 
Independent Electoral Commission, but he would discuss this with 
his National Party colleagues first. He said he had written to 
Gen Holomisa in his capacity as vice-chairman of the National 
Party in the Western Cape. 
  "When it suits (Gen) Holomisa he's an independent state and 
he can do exactly what he wants. But as soon as he needs 
something, then we are responsible." If Gen Holomisa had 
organised his country better he could have bought the vehicles 
he needed. Mr Kriel said negotiations with Transkei on a joint 
investigation into the Heidelberg tavern killings were 
continuing but "I don't think progress has been all that great". 
  He still believed Transkei was a haven for the Azanian 
Peoples Liberation Army [APLA]. Even though the Pan-Africanist 
Congress [PAC] had said it was suspending the armed struggle 
there were still "loose cannons" running around over which the 
PAC and APLA had very little control. "I believe they are still 
using Transkei as a safe haven." 
  He rejected the Transkei demand that the territory's police 
should be allowed to interview those responsible for the South 
African Defence Force [SADF] raid on an alleged APLA base in 
return for allowing South African Police into the territory to 
investigate the Heidelberg killings. The Umtata raid was a 
"legitimate military operation" to capture criminals and the two 
could not be compared. 
  Referring to the people killed in the SADF raid, he said: 
"It's also a debatable point as to whether they were so-called 
children. I've seen children of 14 or 15 years running around 
with AK-47s. So a child can be dangerous." 
  Mr Kriel had brief talks on Thursday morning with a 
delegation from the Border Chamber of Business on security in 
the region. He is to meet later on Thursday with the King 
William's Town town council and Berlin farmers to discuss the 
same issue. On Friday he travels to the North-East Cape.

<F P=106> [By Dirk van Zyl] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town Mar 10 SAPA -- Political analyst Dr 
Frederik van zyl Slabbert says he finds disquieting vagueness 
surrounding interim constitutional powers and competence of 
different governmental levels, such as regional and central. 
  In his column "Barskyk" [Close Up] in the latest edition of 
the Afrikaans independent intellectual journal DIE 
SUID-AFRIKAAN, he writes: "My interpretation is that the central 
government is ultimately going to have over-arching power." 
  Further aspects that Dr Slabbert, a former leader of the 
opposition in the South African Parliament and now policy 
director of the Institute for Democracy in South Africa, finds 
disquieting are: 

  -  The lack of proper entrenchment of the Bill of Rights. 
"For me Clause 33 is unclear and simply sinister when it says 
that entrenched rights may be limited by legislation. On both 
the points communist Party Chairman) Joe Slovo and his comrades 
have won hands-down."; and 
  -  The electoral system on which the constitution is based. "The 
particular form of proportional representation tends itself to 
party-rigidity, domination and rivalry. It hampers 
alliance-forming and the promotion of electorat tolerance." 

    Dr Slabbert says when this is further blurred by "populists 
who use democretic rhetoric like `everything can be rewritten by 
the democratically-elected representatives of the people'," in 
which the people have virtually no choice about for what and for 
whom voting takes place, "there is trouble." 
  Taking everything into account, the conclusion can hardly be 
avoided that if the interim constitution remains as is, and 
becomes the final one, "the politics of the country will be 
reduced to a simple rivalry of power monopolies between parties". 
  On the constitutional process, Dr Slabbert writes that the 
question is: Can the problems of government be divorced from the 
problems of constitution-writing? 
  "Particularly if it is the same bunch of people grappling 
with the same problems. How long is the good faith going to 
continue?"

  [Text] The South African Agricultural Union says the ANC's 
[African National Congress] reconstruction plan for land is 
unrealistic. This follows discussions between the union and ANC 
leader Nelson Mandela this morning. 
  According to the ANC's plan, black farmers should own 30 
percent of agricultural land within 5 years. The agricultural 
union says this means that about 25 million hectares will be 
handed over, leading to the large-scale disruption of 
agricultural production.

  [Text] Reports that members of the AWB [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] have been asked to gather at Ventersdorp 
with their weapons and in uniform have been refuted by the 
organization. An AWB spokesman in Ventersdorp said he was not 
aware of such a call having being made, and that it probably had 
been a misunderstanding.

on the Natal north coast for a march organized by the Inkatha 
Youth Brigade. A march will be held in support of Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini's demand for a sovereign kingdom in 
Natal-kwaZulu. Motorists have been advised to use the new toll 
road between Umtunzini and Empangeni, as the old N2 will be

  [Text] Port Shepstone March 9 SAPA -- Organisers of a Zulu 
march in Port Shepstone on Wednesday refused to allow a group of 
uniformed Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- 
AWB] members to join their procession. 
  Several far right-wingers in camouflage AWB uniforms said 
earlier they had come to support the march, which was a display 
of solidarity of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's demands for a 
Zulu kingdom and the Freedom Alliance's constitutional demands. 
But the march was held up on Wednesday afternoon as organisers 
sorted out the potentially embarrassing situation. 
  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] Youth Brigade National Organiser 
Otto Kunene told SAPA he had confirmed with his leadership that 
there had been no agreement for the AWB to join their march. 
"Fortunately we have resolved this situation diplomatically," he 
said. 
  The march, after a lengthy delay, began soon after 1.00 PM 
and comprised at least 1,000 stick- and shield-wielding Zulus, 
and several firearms were seen among the crowd. There was a 
strong police contingent to ensure there was no confrontation in 
the politically-charged south coast town.

  [Text] Three people were shot dead while on their way to an 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] march at Port Shepstone on the Natal 
lower South Coast. Informed sources say the attack took place 
near Gamalakhe Township. 
  Earlier the IFP refused to allow members of the AWB 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement] to join the march. The AWB 
members said they had gone to Port Shepstone to support Zulu 
King Zwelithini's demand for a sovereign kingdom and the Freedom 
Alliance's constitutional demands. Thousands of Zulus continued 
the march without the AWB members. 
  The group of protesters handed over a memorandum to the 
South 
African Police at Port Shepstone, supporting King Zwelithini's 
intercession in the negotiating process. Chief Khawula handed 
in the memorandum on behalf of the South Coast Zulu leaders. He 
said Zulus would never accept a flawed constitution. He said 
that not only did they reject the constitution, but they would 
actively resist it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  Main incidents: </H5>
  The PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] death toll of 
11 shows encouraging signs of decreasing levels of violence in 
this sub-region. The past two weeks recorded 16 and 13 deaths 
respectively. 
  Natal's death toll includes another massacre of 11 ANC 
[African National Congress] supporters. This is the third 
massacre, within a month, in which all the victims have been ANC 
supporters. 
  Bophuthatswana entered the spotlight of repressive activity 
during a week of harsh security force action in response to mass 
protests. 
  The HRC [Human Rights Commission] welcomes the Transitional 
Executive Council's [TEC] decision to abolish Section 29 in 
accordance with the Abolition of Restrictions on Free Political 
Activity Act. 
See attached report for details 
<H3>  A. Formal repression 
Formal repression of persons 
Detention without trial </H3>
  According to the SAP [South African Police], there are 
currently 4 people being held under Section 29 of the Internal 
Security Act (ISA). One person was detained and 9 were released 
under this legislation during the week. On 8 February 1994, the 
Transitional Executive Council took the decision to abolish 
Section 29 in accordance with the Abolition of Restrictions on 
Free Political Activity Act. 
  There are 18 Congress of South African Students (Cosas) and 
Pan Africanist Student Organisation (PASO) members presently 
held under Section 50 (ISA). Among them are the president and 
secretary of Cosas kwaThema branch. 
<H3>  B. Political violence 
General incidents </H3>
  PWV: 9 deaths and 18 injuries - lower than last week's 13 
deaths and 27 injuries. For the third successive week, the death 
toll has decreased from the previous week. Of concern this week 
is Duduza which accounted for 3 deaths and 11 injuries in 13 
incidents. Violence in the township was related to conflict 
between ANC and IFP supporting hostel dwellers from Duduza 
hostel. The hostel is unique in that it houses hostel dwellers 
supporting both the IFP and the ANC and is not divided on ethnic 
lines. Tension in the hostel however was reported to have 
started on 17 February, when IFP supporters from the hostel 
threatened ANC supporters putting up ANC posters in the vicinity 
of the hostel. The violence was allegedly sparked off by an 
attack on 2 Xhosa-speaking hostel dwellers. Following the 
clashes, the township residents came to the assistance of the 
ANC supporters, resulting in an attempt to burn down the hostel. 
Other reports received included IFP supporters forcing residents 
to join the IFP and intimidated residents living in the first 
line of houses opposite the Duduza hostel, to evacuate their 
homes. Allegations of security force collusion were also 
received, isu police allegedly not taking action against IFP 
supporters. 
  In other sub-regions, a female ANC recruitment officer, was 
allegedly harassed by IFP who came to her apartment in 
Johannesburg; 5 youths, including 2 Cosas members, were 
allegedly abducted and assaulted by members of the public, for 
allegedly murdering a taxi owner in Soweto; in Sharpeville, a 
man was killed and a schoolgirl were assaulted allegedly by 
members of the German gang. 
  The township of Bekkersdal recorded 2 deaths as compared to 
last week's toll of 3 deaths and 21 injuries, residents however 
report that the township is tense. 
  Natal: 39 deaths and 32 injuries. Twenty five deaths and 21 
injuries were recorded in the Durban sub-region. Inanda (14 
deaths and 17 injuries) emerged as a focal point of violence in 
the sub-region. This included the massacre of 11 ANC supporters 
in Bhambayi. The massacre toll included the deaths of 3 women, 7 
injuries and 20 homes torched when the ANC-supporting Congo and 
Angola settlements were attacked by a group of alleged IFP 
supporters in a 5 hour attack. The ANC's Natal region alleged 
that a white man was seen by witnesses at the scene of the 
attack, and alleged that ISU [Internal Security Unit] vehicles 
blocked the four entrances to Bhambayi during the attack. In 
Ndwedwe, 5 people, including 4 women, were killed and 2 were 
injured in an attack on a store in the ANC-supporting Sonkombo 
area. Other sub-regions affected were N Natal (6 deaths), N 
Coast (4 deaths, 11 injuries), Midlands (2 deaths) and S Coast 
(2 deaths). In the incidents where the victims could be 
ascertained, 1 death was of an IFP member and 17 deaths and 18 
injuries of ANC members. 
  W Cape: no injuries, 3 incidents. In one incident the 
Milnerton municipal offices were petrol bombed. 
  Ciskei: four teachers, including 3 whites, and a child (13) 
who was walking by the college, were injured when gunmen 
ambushed a minibus entering vunindela teachers' training college. 
[words indistinct] 
  PWV: 7 injuries and 14 arrests all in the East Rand. In 
Duduza, a young girl was allegedly shot and injured by members 
of the ISU. Two reports were received of security forces 
arresting and later releasing people - 8 people attending a 
funeral were arrested and later released by members of the ISU 
in kwaThema; 6 youths were arrested and assaulted by members of 
the SADF [South African Defense Force] in Thokoza. 
  Natal: 1 death of an ANC member allegedly shot dead by the 
SAP in Ntuzuma. 
  Bophuthatswana: at least 1 injury, 25 arrests in numerous 
actions by the homeland security forces attempting to curb the 
widespread strike by civil servants and workers, demanding wage 
increases, pension payouts, free political and trade union 
activity in the homeland. Monitors in the area report that at 
the moment action by the security forces is so abundant and 
continuous that not all incidents and casualties are being 
recorded. Incidents reported include: - police using teargas, 
rubber bullets and sjamboks against protesting teachers in 
Ditsobotla - 3 ANC Mafikeng officials arrested after a police 
raid on their homes - police using teargas to disperse workers 
outside the Mafikeng offices of Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR) - 
at least 10 journalists detained at different times, some being 
escorted out the homeland, other journalists were teargassed - 
police using teargas against scholars. 
  OFS [Orange Free State]: 30 arrests at AECI [African 
Explosives and Chemical Industries] explosives' factory in 
Hennenman during a wage dispute. 
Attacks against security forces 
  PWV: 1 death and 3 injuries in 7 attacks. All but one of the 
attacks occurred in the townships of the East Rand. The only 
other attack occurred in Mapetla, Soweto, where a off-duty 
special constable was shot dead. 
  Natal: 1 death and 1 injury (of an alleged attacker) in 2 
attacks in Inanda and Ezakheni. 
  W Cape: no casualties in 2 attacks on police in Khayelitsha 
and Nyanga. 
  Bophuthatswana: no casualties. A police vehicle was set 
alight and others stoned in Mafikeng. 
Right wing actions 
  Bophuthatswana: the ANC Mafikeng offices were petrol bombed. 
<H3>  C. Other incidents 
[words indistinct] </H3>
  PWV: 1 death and 1 injury in Hillbrow, when a gunman opened 
fire on commuters waiting at a taxi rank. The conflict is 
reportedly between the Venda and Pietersburg taxi associations.

  [Text] Pretoria March 9 SAPA -- A South African Air Force 
[SAAF] flight sergeant, detained in connection with the weekend 
arms theft from an air force depot at Voortrekkerhoogte, 
Pretoria, has been released, the SAAF said on Wednesday [9 
March]. The SAAF member was detained on Tuesday in terms of the 
military discipline code. He was giving his "full co-operation" 
in the investigation, a statement said. 
  An SAAF spokesman would not be drawn on suggestions that at 
least three SAAF members could soon be detained after the theft 
of what the SAAF called "about 50 light weapons". 
  Police spokesman Evan Johnson said on Wednesday a "large 
amount" of weapons seemed at this stage to be missing. The exact 
figure was still being determined through stock checks. 
  All possible motives were being investigated and it was not 
clear if the thest had a political connotation, Capt Johnson 
said. A reward of up to R100,000 [rand] had been posted for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of those 
responsible. 
  The African National Congress has expressed concern at the 
regularity of raids on SADF [South African Defense Force] arms 
depositories, especially in the light of the fact that South 
African Communist Party General Secretary Chris Hani was 
assassinated with a weapon stolen from the SADF.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  No Majority Support for Bophuthatswana's Mangope -- "The 
teargas billowing in the streets of Mmabatho and Mafikeng gives 
the lie to President Lucas Mangope's claim of majority support 
in Bophuthatswana," notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 10 March. "His suggestion that the 
homeland is financially self-sufficient is also absurd." 
Mangope should do as the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) 
requires and "allow free political activity in the homeland and 
change his government's attitude from resistance to 
co-operation. The final outcome is now inevitable, but the 
Mangope government must ensure that it is reached without more 
tears." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Housing Minister-TEC Confrontation -- Referring to the 
confrontation between Housing Minister Louis Shill and the TEC 
over Shill's "jumping the gun on the announcement of the R90 
billion [rand] housing scheme," Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English on 10 March in a page-14 editorial says Shill has "shown 
poor judgment in taking on the TEC, and he is compounding his 
mistake by continuing to defy the council, whose legal position 
may be stronger than Shill believes." "There is little doubt 
that in announcing the housing programme, Shill was seeking to 
win credit for the National Party. The TEC was thus quite within 
its rights to rule his announcement an unfair electioneering 
tactic." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Conservative Party Looking Vulnerable -- Johannesburg BEELD 
in Afrikaans of 4 March says in a page-8 editorial: "It is 
becoming clearer that the ripples which followed the remarkable 
Mandela-Buthelezi summit are only now beginning to make 
themselves felt. Ironically, what happened between two black 
leaders has thus far had its greatest impact on the lily-white 
Conservative Party [CP]. There could hardly be a better example 
of the irrelevance of the CP's whites-only politics. The fact 
that Mr. Mandela was able to persuade Mr. Buthelezi to consider 
registering provisionally for the election threw the Freedom 
Alliance, and in particular the CP, off balance. Without the 
IFP and Mr. Buthelezi who supported them in what they wanted to 
achieve, the CP suddenly looks uncertain and vulnerable." 
"Right-wingers are clearly beginning to realize in increasing 
numbers that participation in elections is the essence of 
politics. If it also means that the homeland ideal will be 
striven for in an orderly, constitutional manner, then the 
option becomes that much more attractive." 
  Viljoen Should Press Ahead Democratically -- "After three 
painful humiliations, General Constand Viljoen ought to realize 
that the radical elements in the right wing, who unfortunately 
form the majority, want nothing to do with being reasonable," 
notes an editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans 
on 7 March. "They seek confrontation, and as a result they are 
becoming an increasing danger to South Africa." "In the process 
the hero of yesterday and the day before -- the Moses who was to 
lead his people to freedom -- has become the 'traitor.' That is 
how cruelly the right wing treats those who offer choices 
different from the extremism of Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and Mr. 
Eugene Terreblanche." "Gen. Viljoen must know that his entrance 
into politics, which held so much expectation, has now been 
virtually stripped of all credibility. He tried to use shuttle 
diplomacy between the radicals and the moderates in the 
Afrikaner National Front (AVF) as well as with the government 
and the African National Congress (ANC), but he is being 
increasingly rejected by his people." "Last Friday Gen. Viljoen 
registered the Freedom Front political party with the aim of 
participating in the election. There are indications that the 
decision was thoroughly planned, and must have been the result 
of strategic consideration, not a sudden impulse. We only hope 
that Gen. Viljoen and his spiritual allies do not allow 
themselves to be trampled by the AVF. We urge them to press on 
with their plans to fight for their homeland in an orderly, 
democratic manner."

  [Text] Delegations from the government and the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continue to 
discuss national reconciliation. Joao Ligio reports. 
  [Ligio] This is the fourth week of discussions on national 
reconciliation and the impasse now being registered is the lack 
of property [word indistinct] for the return of property. The 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [words 
indistinct]. The final version is expected to be presented 
tomorrow. 
  On the reimposition of state administration, the government 
delegation's leadership today met at the Mulungushi conference 
center where it presented the list of districts where the state 
power must be extended to. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA is studying the government proposal on its 
participation in local and national administration. 
  At a news conference given only to foreign press today, 
UNITA's Jorge Valentim stressed the importance of the proposal 
and spoke of the need to introduce amendments. Jorge Valentim 
surprised everyone when he said that his delegation is tired 
because of the speedy pace of the peace talks and thus it would 
propose the slowing down of the talks.

  [Text] Jose Eduardo dos Santos' army is moving large 
quantities of troops and war materiel in the diamond-rich area 
of Canfunfo in Lunda Norte Province. According to our 
correspondent in the area, the movement has been ordered by 
disillusioned Generals Sukissa and Luis Passeira. Preparations 
for a military offensive against diamond-producing UNITA areas 
have been going on for some time. The Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] has warned government troops not to 
accept such adventures because they will receive shameful and 
sad lessons since FALA will not tolerate any kind of aggression.

  [Text] The National Assembly has approved the government's 
Social and Economic Program for this year. It also approved a 
resolution that was read by Idalina Valente, Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola deputy to the National Assembly. 
  [Begin Valente recording] In its fourth meeting of the 
second 
legislature, the National Assembly discussed the government's 
Social and Economic Program for 1994. The implementation of 
this program is limited by the, war which continues to beset 
large sections of Angolan territory. In those areas, the 
effects of this program are likely to be felt only indirectly. 
For this reason, whatever progress is made over the course of 
this year to bring peace to Angolan territory must perforce 
facilitate the implementation of measures and policies mentioned 
in the government's program. 
  The National Assembly believes that the strategy contained 
in 
the Social and Economic Program will, for its successful 
implementation, require a high degree of discipline and 
perseverance concerning the implementation of planned measures. 
It will also be necessary to adjust structure, organization, 
and the government's team to the program's principles and 
practices. 
  The National Assembly believes that the program which was 
presented here is made up of a coherent set of macroeconomic 
measures whose rigorous and disciplined implementation should 
result in a significant short-term reduction in the inflation 
rate experienced in 1993 and a slowing down in the pace and 
level of national impoverishment, which has caused the citizens 
to face a serious increase in the cost of living. Nonetheless, 
only the continued implementation of that program and the 
correct integration into the macroeconomic program of the Public 
Investment Plan, as well as of sectorial programs can lead to 
medium term growth in production levels, which in turn should 
allow the economy to stabilize, help improve consumption levels, 
and ensure greater well-being for the people. 
  In those terms and under the terms of Paragraph B of Article 
88 and of Paragraph 6 of Article 92 of the Constitutional Law, 
the National Assembly hereby issues the following resolution: 
  Point: The Social and Economic Program for 1994 is hereby 
approved. It was presented by the government, and it carried 
the following recommendations: 
  A. By 10 May, the government must have presented to the 
National Assembly the Public Investment Program and sectorial 
plans to function as management tools for the 1994 program; 
  B. As its basis for drawing up the Public Investment Plan, 
the government must seek a constant percentage sharing in 
accordance with the program that has been approved. The 
government must, however, make every effort to increase the 
forecast amount of 2.5 trillion new kwanzas by reducing expenses 
arising from diplomatic representation, scholarships abroad, and 
work trips, among other things; 
  C. With regard to sectorial plans, they must reflect the 
Social and Economic Program's economic and administrative 
decentralization policies; they must reflect a correct 
adjustment of sectorial goals to the resources planned by 
General State Budget for 1994 and present a timetable for their 
implementation; 
  D. The continuation of the process for restructuring the 
state entrepreneurial sector will be linked to the National 
Assembly approving the Law on Privatization. [end recording] 
  This resolution approved with 102 votes in favor, none 
against, and 10 abstentions.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] president, said yesterday that if unfounded accusations 
against his party continue, he will be forced to reveal 
undisclosed incidents between his movement and the Mozambican 
Government prior to the signing of the General Peace Accord. "I 
can could get angry and disclose some things," he said. 
  The Renamo leader said this at his residence shortly after 
introducing to the public the 30 Renamo advisers chosen to work 
with the provincial governors as of next week. 
  Afonso Dhlakama is particularly concerned about continuing 
accusations by the government that Renamo's bases are harboring 
a Malawi Young Pioneers battalion. 
  "I have already said that that they are welcome to 
investigate the matter on the ground or to fetch at least one of 
those men so he can be shown to the public," the Renamo leader 
said. 
  "UN Special Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello has helicopters 
and trucks that he can use. There are UN observers here, and 
they can go to the bases to see if it is true," he added. 
  He thinks the government and the press are acting in bad 
faith and making serious accusations when they say Renamo 
received support from Malawi and its leaders traveled in 
Malawian aircraft and were seen in the company of Malawian 
policemen or Malawian religious figures. 
  "Today, it appears to be a novelty to the government that we 
used Malawi as a stopover, a place where meetings took place to 
get the peace process moving," he said, adding that "President 
Chissano and I agreed to use Malawian territory for secret 
meetings among our men." He also noted that "many people do not 
know that Chissano sent Minister Pascoal Mocumbi to Malawi to 
meet Jose de Castro before the signing of the General Peace 
Accord. President Chissano and I authorized that meeting. Many 
people are not aware that I flew on several occasions to Malawi 
during the war to meet [Italian peace broker] Mario Rafaelli, 
Herman Cohen, and with religious leaders. I met Zimbabwean 
President Robert Mugabe in Malawi. The government knows that we 
used aircraft and cars to go there and that we were accompanied 
by Malawian policemen. How can they now come forward disclosing 
things which they are well aware of?" 
  Dhlakama insisted on the need for the government and the 
press to show good faith. He says that there is no journalist, 
researcher, or historian trying to get the truth from Renamo. 
About Kenya, for instance, he says that he only got to know 
Nairobi after Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi had come to 
Maputo and had been asked by Chissano to become involved in the 
Mozambican peace process. 
  "I had gone to Nairobi to meet the bishops when Chissano 
convinced Moi to allow his territory to be used for such 
encounters. It was there that I received the first message 
saying `let us talk about an end to the war.' Then, Kenya and 
Malawi became stopovers on our way to Rome from Gorongosa or 
Maringue," the Renamo leader explained. 
  Afonso Dhlakama noted that his party "has many 
responsibilities in this country," adding that that is why "we 
avoid responsing to such accusations with facts and disclosures 
which could compromise the government." 
  Dhlakama says he has disclosures to make in good time or not 
at all. "We are only too well aware that the government might 
become seriously unsettled over certain disclosures about things 
we used to do together in those times." The Renamo leader added 
that "we should not be taking part in dishonest politics." 
  However, Afonso Dhlakama sees two findings as rather 
reassuring: "Chissano is a serious man who wants peace" and the 
government resorts to "petty behavior" in relation to Renamo 
because it knows full well that "it is a strong party, a great 
opponent." And he added, ironically: "If we were a small party, 
they would have given us five vehicles, some houses here and 
there, and that would have been enough. We might even have been 
friends."

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], said in Maputo yesterday that his 
organization will use its trust fund [preceding two words in 
English] to pay a portion of the demobilization allowances to 
its soldiers should the government insist on allocating 35,000 
meticals for each of them. Speaking at a news conference, 
Afonso Dhlakama said 82,000 meticals had been initially 
earmarked for the soldiers. He said 35,000 meticals for each 
demobilized soldier is a contemptible amount. Dhlakama added: 
I regret that Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] soldiers to 
be demobilized could be at a disadvantage, but that is due to a 
lack of morals by the government for which they fought. 
  Dhlakama said Renamo soldiers could begin to be demobilized 
at Inhambane Province's Neves assembly point as of 16 March.

  [Excerpts] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo], said in Maputo yesterday that he 
does not accept that demobilized government and Renamo soldiers 
should only be paid 35,000 meticals per month. [passage 
omitted] Do the state coffers have the funds to pay 82,000 
meticals to each demobilized soldier? According to Afonso 
Dhlakama, they do. 
  [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I think so. For God's sake, I 
think funds are available. We are not demanding that each 
Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] soldier or every Renamo 
combatant should be paid 1 million meticals per month. That is 
not the case. We are not going to demand what the government 
cannot pay. The Mozambican Government at least has 82,000 
meticals. If it does not pay it is because [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] If the government insists on its position 
you 
said you would be willing to raise money from the trust fund. 
[preceding two words in English] Is that decision final? 
  [Dhlakama] That is my position. Tomorrow, I will speak on 
the phone to members of the Renamo National Council in the 
provinces because I am very shocked. I know that the trust fund 
does not have enough money. Although the trust fund is designed 
to pay for Renamo's transformation from a political movement 
into a political party, Renamo must also remember the most 
trying moments. After all, all those (?youngsters) will return 
home, their bodies covered in tree leaves and sacks, and with 
(?a few meticals). I cannot do that. I am not doing it as mere 
political propaganda. The soldiers ought to have some 
conditions. I will do my best because the trust fund is not 
enough. I am not favoring Renamo guerrillas. Soldiers from 
both sides will be demobilized. They are Mozambicans and my 
brothers. [end recording] 
  Reacting to Dhlakama's position, Labor Minister Teodato 
Hunguana, the government's number two in the Supervision and 
Control Commission, said the figures mentioned by the Renamo 
president are false. Cited by NOTICIAS, Hunguana said: Those 
figures are only designed to create subversion or even revolt 
among government soldiers. What Renamo should do right now is 
to organize itself at once in order to ensure that soldiers of 
the two sides are demobilized at the same time. 
  NOTICIAS also contacted Government Major Eduardo Lauchande 
who categorically denied that the government would pay 82,000 
meticals to each private, as alleged by Dhlakama. Lauchande 
said all troops will received their demobilization allowances in 
line with the ranking system in force in the government's army. 
At present, the government pays 32,000 meticals to privates per 
month, while third and second noncommissioned officers receive 
82,500 and 106,500 meticals, respectively. First 
noncommissioned officers receive 139,000 meticals per month. In 
addition to a six-month allowance to be paid by the government, 
demobilized soldiers will receive an additional allowance paid 
by the international community, amounting to between 75,000 and 
600,000 meticals.

<F P=106> [Interview with Manica Province Governor Artur Canana by </F>
correspondent Antonio Elias in Manica; date not given] 
  [Text] [Elias] How many people from Manica Province are 
believed to be living as refugees in neighboring countries? 
  [Canana] We do not have updated information on that matter, 
but it is possible that some 100,000 people continue to stay in 
Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia. 
  [Elias] We have learned in Catandica that people who return 
via United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
[UNHCR]-organized repatriation continue to receive aid for 18 
months. However, those who return by their own means -- and we 
believe that is the majority -- do not benefit from such aid. 
It is rather senseless discrimination.... 
  [Canana] I do not know. Any person who arrives, be it 
officially or informally, receives the same treatment once 
inside this country. What may well happen is that one family 
arrives and it does not register immediately. When that 
happens, the authorities have no idea who or where those people 
are. This is why we have registry personnel in every district 
and administrative area. They are there principally to deal 
with unofficial arrivals. They go from village to village 
registering the arrivals of families. Then, they take that 
information to the district which, in turn, provides aid. They 
receive exactly the same aid that is given to those who arrive 
officially. Where the difference lies is that the people who 
return officially do receive some items at departure points, 
notably household goods. Those who arrive unofficially do not 
receive those things. That is a difference, but they all get 
aid for the same 18-month period. 
<H5>  We still reach Mossurize through Zimbabwe </H5>
  [Elias] What is the government's concrete role in the aid 
given to those refugees, over and above the support granted by 
the nongovernmental organizations [NGO's]? 
  [Canana] Even the aid by the NGO's is already an action on 
the part of the government. The NGO's do not discover what 
needs to be done. They go about their work after preliminary 
contacts with us. 
  We have some infrastructure that needs rehabilitating, so we 
negotiate with those organizations and each one of them does 
what it can in accordance with its capabilities. 
  We share and we define priorities, notably in the water, 
roads, health, and education sectors. Each NGO does what it can 
within that framework and whatever is outstanding is financed by 
the State Budget. 
  [Elias] Do you think that all of Manica Province's secondary 
and tertiary roads will be open to use before elections are due 
to be held? 
  [Canana] I do not think so. Our capabilities do not match 
the great requirements or the volume of work at hand. We only 
have one specialized enterprise and that is ECMEP [expansion 
unknown]. In addition to that enterprise's technical 
weaknesses, there is also the problem of financial incapacity. 
On the basis of the work that has been done in this province, 
it is our belief that we will only be able to complete the 
rehabilitation of all access routes by 1996 and that only if 
there are no other obstacles. Last year's road rehabilitation 
plan was fulfilled and we have already started implementing the 
plan for this year. 
  [Elias] Is road rehabilitation work being done without any 
problems in Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]-controlled 
areas? 
  [Canana] We have had problems in those areas and we continue 
to have them. Immediately after the cease-fire accord was 
signed, we decided that priority should be given to the 
rehabilitation of roads leading to areas which had been 
inaccessible during the war. One example is Mossurize District. 
However, even now we must still go through Zimbabwean territory 
to get to Mossurize. We have not found common ground with 
Renamo concerning reopening the national road to that district. 
Rather, I should say that we were forbidden to do so. We had 
also given priority to the road to Dombe, but they also stopped 
us from rehabilitating it. We have found another road to Dombe, 
along National Route One, but it is a much longer route, 
something like 100 km more. We are working in other areas where 
there are no restrictions. 
<H5>  The parties must prove they are serious </H5>
  [Elias] Many people view the country's central region as the 
region where Renamo enjoys most influence. If that is true, do 
you think that it will be possible for the Mozambique Liberation 
Front [Frelimo] Party to win in Manica Province in the upcoming 
October elections? 
  [Canana] Well, that is one reading of the situation. Each 
person reads it in his or her own way. Like all the other 
parties, Renamo and Frelimo must prove to the people that they 
are serious. I do not want to think like the population. 
[sentence as published] They know whether Renamo has done good 
or bad. The Frelimo Party also knows, and I think it has done 
well. It is not the accused that goes on the stand to declare 
that it has won. You must wait for the judge. The people are 
the ones who must say whether Renamo is dominant in the central 
region. We are going to wait for our opportunity. The people 
know what Renamo is, and they know what Frelimo is. It knows 
the people, it works with them. 
  Renamo has done a lot of work here. It has worked very hard, 
but only the people can tell whether it was good or bad work. 
The Frelimo Party is present throughout the country. Only the 
people know whether we are doing well or poorly and only they 
will be able to answer that question. Let us wait and see. Ask 
me that question again in November, once elections are behind us. 
  [Elias] What space have the other "unarmed" parties been 
gaining in Manica Province? 
  [Canana] I do not believe they can do more than they have so 
far. Those parties that are represented here are making an 
effort to get through to the masses. I would not expect more 
than that. Their penetration hinges on their conditions, their 
skills, their work, their publicity, and their knowledge about 
the population. That is not something that you can acquire from 
one day to the next. That is something that takes time. I 
believe that the formerly emergent parties now should have 
another name because they have taken cognizance of that reality. 
They are not managing the sort of penetration we have had. 
That is impossible. We have the years that we have behind us. 
It would be like expecting you to have as much grey hair as 
your father. Your father gets grey hair as a result of many 
years of life. We have the penetration we have thanks to our 
years. When those parties become more mature, then, sure, they 
will also be sufficiently well known. We have our years and we 
are proud of them. 
  [Elias] Those "unarmed" parties are virtually unknown out 
here.... 
  [Canana] They are not particularly well known, but they are 
known. 
  [Elias] In October of last year, MEDIAFAX published an 
opinion poll by Gestinform which suggested that your work in 
this province is viewed unfavorably.... 
  [Canana] I am not commenting. They talked with the people. 
I think that it is only natural that this person or that should 
not like my work. They want me to do my work in some other way. 
Nonetheless, I am calm, I know my duties as a governor, and I 
know I am fulfilling them in accordance with the means and the 
capabilities the state has been making available to me. That 
opinion poll is just an opinion poll. It may, or may not, be 
right. Whether it is right or not, it is just an opinion poll. 
The fact is that I do not feel that citizens lack trust in me. 
  [Elias] Does it perhaps not have to do with the fact that 
you 
were not born in Manica Province? 
  [Canana] I can tell you that I have been a public servant 
for 
close on 25 years, of which I only worked five in the province 
where I was born. I always worked away from it as an assistant 
and then in more senior capacities. I have never felt any 
rejection on account of the fact that I was not born in the 
place where I was working and the same thing happens here in 
Manica Province. I have never felt that this or that citizen 
disliked me because I am not from here. I am not here to 
represent the interests of some ethnic group. I am here to 
ensure that laws are complied with and that citizens are 
afforded protection. I do what I possibly can to fulfill those 
goals. 
  [Elias] Perhaps you have concluded that the opinion poll 
was not done correctly. 
  [Canana] Correctly or otherwise, I do not know. I do not 
know why we should arrive at such a conclusion. Perhaps it was 
conducted in a correct manner. I would not like to assess it 
myself. I am also not going to comment on an assessment that is 
somewhat secretive. If something should happen, the citizens 
already have that information. The citizens talk, and we always 
talk with the people. When the people have a problem, they 
approach the official and say that his work is not to their 
benefit. If they continue to be displeased about the work done 
by that official, the people have the chance to complain about 
him to a more senior official when the latter comes around. I 
think that people have something to say, whether in a secretive 
or in an open system. 
<H5>  Has the electoral campaign not begun? </H5>
  [Elias] What will be your role in the electoral campaign as 
a 
member of the Frelimo Party? 
  [Canana] As a provincial governor, I do not have a specific 
role within Frelimo. As a member of the Frelimo Party Central 
Committee, I might be given certain tasks by my party. 
  [Elias] Have you not started playing that role yet, seeing 
that you are a Frelimo Party Central Committee member? 
  [Canana] As you are aware, the electoral campaign has not 
begun yet. 
  [Elias] But it is difficult to see that there will be a day 
when it will be declared that the electoral campaign begins 
today.... 
  [Canana] Whether directly or indirectly, we in the Frelimo 
Party are generally contributing toward the successful 
implementation of the peace process in all its spheres and that 
necessarily includes creating the conditions needed for general 
elections. As a governor, it is my duty to select cadres for 
the provincial commission. Infrastructure must be created for 
the provincial commission and the technical secretariat to 
function. Technical cadres must also be chosen for the electoral 
census. By law, that must be done by the governor. That work 
is specifically intended for the elections and not for the 
electoral campaign. 
  As a member of the Frelimo Party Central Committee I might, 
however, be awarded a different task in terms of the electoral 
campaign. I expect I will be given such tasks quite soon. 
  The Electoral Law does not forbid me, as a government 
official, from participating in my party's electoral campaign. 
  [Elias] We have learned that Mr. Coelho, the owner of the 
Garuzo tourist resort, has been ordered by the Interior Ministry 
to leave the country in 24 hours. He appealed to the provincial 
government, which reconsidered the measure.... 
  [Canana] That is not true. Coelho has been a resident in 
this country for many years, and, as far as I know, he does not 
have any problems. Those who have problems are his daughter and 
his son-in-law, and those are problems they did not get into in 
this province. I do not know exactly where they got into those 
problems, but it seems that it was up in Nampula Province. It 
was for that reason that their residence permits were not 
extended.

  [Text] Windhoek March 10 SAPA -- A Russian cargo aircraft 
has been grounded at Rundu in northern Namibia following 
Namibian and Angolan claims that the medical supplies on board 
are bound for UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] rebels in Angola. 
  Police have also confiscated radio equipment from the 
aircraft, saying there are no valid transportation permits for 
the equipment. The grounding was authorised by the district 
commissioner of Namibia's north-eastern region, Mr Ben Haingura, 
after a request from Angolan authorities. 
  The Antonov-26's pilot, Mr Oleg Pantiuhia, denied the claims 
of supplying UNITA and said his employer, Ecomex, supplied 
medical equipment to "Angolan civilians".

  [Text] The Supreme Court yesterday gave reasons for its 
ruling against the celebration of 31 December as a public 
holiday and funding the celebrations from public funds. It 
would be recalled that on 29 December 1993, the court gave a 
five-four majority decision in favor of a writ filed by the New 
Patriotic Party [NPP]. In the writ, the NPP sought from the 
Supreme Court a declaration making it unconstitutional for the 
government to declare 31 December as a public holiday. 
  Five justices of the Supreme Court ruled that the 
celebration 
was unconstitutional. They are Justices N.Y.B. Adade, G.R.M. 
Francois, K.E. Amoah-Sakyi, G.E.K. Aikins, and C.F. 
Hayfron-Benjamin. Those who dissented are the Chief Justice, 
Mr. Justice Philip Archer, and Justices Abban, A.K.B. Appiah, 
and Mrs. Justice Bamford Addo. It took the nine judges eight 
and half hours to give reasons for their judgment. 
  The chief justice, Mr. Justice Archer, said in his opinion 
he 
did not see the celebration as unconstitutional. He said under 
the public holiday's ordnance, it is only the executive and the 
legislature that have the right to declare public holidays. He 
said the court should not be made to extend its hands to areas 
which are unconstitutional and illegal to tread. Mr. Justice 
Archer said if people feel the need that the day should not be 
celebrated they should submit to parliament to change the 
schedule of PNDC [Provisional National Defense Council] Law 220, 
the public holidays law. He also said since parliament 
judiciously voted money for the celebration, in his opinion, it 
is constitutional that public funds could be used to finance the 
celebration. 
  Mr. Justice Abban said the indemnity clause in the 
Constitution makes the suit null and void. He said the behavior 
of Ghanaians toward the coups of 1966, 1972, 1979, and 31 
December 1981, as well as the indemnity clauses in the 1969, 
1979, and 1992 Constitutions made the coups historically vain. 
Mr. Justice Abban said the argument that the celebration of 31 
December was discriminatory was not sound. He said if such a 
submission was upheld then the declaration of 25 December, the 
birth of Christ, Good Friday, and such days could as well be 
challenged by other non-Christian religious groups. He said it 
must be clear that the declaration of public holidays is a 
political issue and that it is the people through their elected 
representatives who should set aside such days. 
  Mrs. Justice Bamford Addo said it is not for the judiciary 
to 
formulate public policies. She said the suit is caught by 
Article 34 of the Constitution and that should it be even 
accepted that the celebration is unconstitutional, that clause 
will still override findings. 
  Mr. Justice N.Y.B. Adade, one of the five judges who agreed 
that the declaration of 31 December as a public holiday is 
unconstitutional, submitted that the celebration of the day has 
the tendency of playing up the idea of military coups, which 
contravenes the spirit and letter of the Constitution. He said 
the indemnity clause in the Constitution accepts the illegality 
of the event of 31 December 1981. He said that if it is 
accepted that the celebration is constitutional, the flood gates 
are being opened for other coup d'etat days to be celebrated. 
  Mr. Justice Francois said the day could be celebrated 
provided it is not funded from public funds. He said the 1992 
Constitution buried the immediate past and imposed an embargo on 
future coups. He said the indemnity clause exempts coup makers 
from penalties for their actions. 
  In his judgment Mr. Justice Amoah-Sakyi said 24 February, 13 
January, June 4, and 31 December -- the days coups were staged 
in Ghana -- ceased to be public holidays immediately democracy 
was restored. He said the court is to make all agencies of 
government to act within the parameters of the law. Mr. Justice 
Amoah-Sakyi concluded: We have had enough of coup d'etats, we 
want it no more. 
  Mr. Justice G.E.K. Aikins held the view that the celebration 
and financing of the day are unconstitutional and an affront to 
democracy. He said but for the indemnity clauses, all those who 
stage coups would be tried after a constitutional government is 
restored. This, he said, implies the unconstitutionality of 
celebrating such days as public holidays. He said any law that 
is inconsistent with the Constitution is declared null and void. 
It is the view of Mr. Justice Aikins that PNDC Law 220, the 
public holiday law, has some inconsistencies when tested with 
the spirit and letter of the 1992 Constitution. He said those 
inconsistencies had made the law void. Consequently, it will be 
unconstitutional to celebrate the day.

<F P=106> [By Christophe Parayre] </F>
  [Excerpt] Monrovia, 9 March (AFP) -- The disarming of 
Liberia's three rival factions has got off to a difficult start, 
with one of the civil war foes failing to cooperate because f an 
apparent leadership crisis. Troops of the African peacekeeping 
force ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], which has set up eight assembly 
points and disarmament centres, had by late Tuesday [8 March] 
been able only to collect weapons from 150 soldiers of the Armed 
Forces of Liberia (AFL). But at Todee, 40 kilometres (25 miles) 
north of here, ECOMOG troops waited in vain for their first 
"clients" from the United Liberation Movement [for Democracy in 
Liberia] (ULIMO). 
  General Kunle Togun, the commanding officer at the centre, 
said that the delay stemmed from a rift in the ULIMO leadership, 
where the head of the faction's military wing, General Roosevelt 
Johnson, has been claiming since the end of February to have 
replaced ULIMO chief Alhaji Kromah. 
  At Konole, 70 kilometres (43 miles) north of the capital, 
several dozen soldiers of ULIMO's main rival, Charles Taylor's 
National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), turned up but said 
they were still waiting for orders to hand over their weapons. 
  The members of the AFL, the army of late president Samuel 
Doe, who was assassinated in September 1990 in the second year 
of a brutal civil war, arrived aboard three lorries Tuesday at 
the Schiefflin camp, 2O kilometres (13 miles) from here. In the 
presence of UN special envoy to Liberia Trevor Gordon-Somers and 
a group of journalists, they formed ranks and turned in their 
weapons on the orders of their commander, Colonel Erasmus Flahn, 
who had taken off his uniform to don a white T-shirt and light 
trousers. About half of the AFL soldiers were also dressed in 
civilian clothes. Three at a time, some 100 of them handed in 
AK-47 assault rifles or Italian-made Berettas to the 
white-helmeted troops of the Nigerian-led force. The others 
said they had lost, sold or been robbed of their guns. Once the 
exercise was over, the AFL troops were taken in hand by UN 
personnel who gave them food and medicines, but no money, as 
Gordon-Somers stressed. 
  The demobilised men all told journalists that they wanted to 
see a lasting peace after almost four years of a war that 
claimed 150,000 lives, according to UN estimates, before a peace 
pact was signed in July last year under the aegis of the United 
Nations and the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS), which first sent peacekeepers to Liberia in August 
1990. 
  Neither ECOMOG nor UN personnel expressed undue concern 
about 
the slow start to the disarmament process, which follows the 
formation Monday of a five-member collegial State Council, 
including members of the NPFL, ULIMO and the interim national 
government in Monrovia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] With the Liberian Transitional Council finally 
installed on Monday [7 March] after much last-minute bickering 
and wrangling, the disarmament process of AFL [Armed Forces of 
Liberia], ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia], and NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces 
should have begun today under the supervision of the expanded 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] force. There are reports that the AFL has 
started the process, but there has been immense distrust between 
NPFL leader Charles Taylor and ULIMO chairman Alhaji Koromah. 
In Monrovia, Ofeibea Quist-Arcton asked Alhaji Koromah if he 
had begun disarming his men. 
  [Begin recording] [Koromah] I will give my commander the 
order as of today so that the arms can be given in. Already, I 
have given orders that the arms in Kakata and Bong Mine should 
be given in. 
  [Quist-Arcton] Charles Taylor seems to be very worried, not 
disarming, until he sees evidence that ULIMO is disarming. 
Clearly there is lingering mistrust between the two groups. 
  [Koromah] Whatever that may be, we are going by the 
schedule. 
We are going by stages as agreed to by the joint peace 
disarmament committee, as agreed to by the implementation 
committee of ECOMOG and when we agree to a schedule, ULIMO will 
go by that. We don't necessarily trust Taylor. We know his 
background; we know his record. 
  [Quist-Arcton] You are just saying that you don't trust 
Taylor? 
  [Koromah] Of course not. Why should I trust him? Is that 
surprising to you? [end recording] 
  So, ULIMO is beginning to disarm, but what about the NPFL? A 
wild card there is the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] which has 
been fighting Charles Taylor's forces in the Rivercess Region, 
south of Buchanan and which is not a signatory of the Cotonou 
Peace Accord and it seems that Charles Taylor is in some 
difficulties. On the line Robin White asked him if had issued 
an order to his troops to disarm. 
  [Taylor] Well, we are trying to still find out what is going 
on here. As you know, the Council of State was sworn in and the 
government is still not seated because the cabinet ministers 
have still not assumed their offices. Our people informed me 
this morning that they have been prevented from entering 
ministries and agencies of government and so, we are not sure if 
the government is fully seated. We are trying to see how these 
things play in before we get into actual business. 
  [White] So you haven't actually ordered your men to hand in 
their arms yet? 
  [Taylor] We have not given any such order. We are waiting 
still for the government to take a seat. My ministers are at 
risk. Right now in Monrovia, they have been stopped from 
entering the building. You know, even in Britain, John Major 
does not have a government unless he has ministers, is this not 
correct? 
  [White] Some people might say that you are stalling, Mr. 
Taylor. 
  [Taylor] We are not stalling. The ECOMOG people are in the 
camp. You know, we are under attack right now. We are fighting 
the LPC. In fact, the expanded ECOMOG that should be moving 
into parts of Buchanan and the southeastern region have not 
entered because of the heavy fighting. So, you know, it is like 
a guy shooting at you and you are having a gun on one side and 
the bullet on another side. So, all of these things are going to 
come into shape. I do not think that there is any major 
disruption and, I mean, these things take a little bit of time. 
  [White] You said there is fighting going on with the 
Liberian 
Peace Council in the Buchanan area. How extensive is that 
fighting? 
  [Taylor] Very extensive. It is into and out of Buchanan, 
into Rivercess and parts of Sinoe. There is very serious 
fighting going on. No expanded ECOMOG has been able enter that 
zone yet. There is very heavy fighting. And if you were to 
call Monrovia, the Ugandans will tell you that they have not 
been able to help them because bullets are flying and bombs are 
going and there is heavy fighting there. So, that is the 
problem on that side. On this other side, we are prepared to 
begin disarmament. We are waiting for word from Monrovia 
because our ministers have not taken seat, but we can still be 
going forward because I think we have made a giant step forward 
and we do not want to reverse the progress. [end recording]

  [Text] A Nigerian ministerial delegation led by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Anthony Ani is expected in the Bakassi 
peninsula, the border area in dispute between Nigeria and 
Cameroon. The purpose of the mission is to verify the 
Cameroonian assertion that the inhabitants of this 1,000 square 
km peninsula, rich in fish and oil, have freely expressed their 
desire in 1961 to be Cameroonians. According to the Nigerian 
Government, over 90 percent of the inhabitants of this area are 
Nigerians of the Efik and Idibo ethnic groups in Cross River and 
Akwa-Ibom states. The traditional chiefs of these two states, 
contingous to the disputed area, are expected to be part of the 
delegation. This visit comes a few days after the visit paid by 
the head of the Nigerian Army, General Chris Alli. Cameroonian 
Communication Minister Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni spole to us 
on the phone. 
  [Begin recording] [Announcer] Mr. Minister, we have already 
spoken to you this morning. Nigeria accuses Cameroon of 
receiving French military support on the ground. What is your 
response to this accusation? 
  [Kouomegni] There has always been a permanent Cameroonian 
Army presence on the Bakassi Peninsula. This has always been 
the situation. There is a Cameroon Navy base at Idabato, not far 
from where the first contingent of Nigerian troops landed. At 
any rate it cannot be said that Cameroonian troops have 
intervened in the peninsula, they have always been there. In 
the wake of the arrival of the Nigerian troops, we simply 
reinforced the Cameroonian military presence on the Cameroonian 
territory of the Bakassi Peninsula. That is clear. There are 
not only Cameroonian troops there, but there is also a 
Cameroonian administration because the area is part of the Ndian 
Division, which has seven subdivisions headed by subprefects. 
Three of these subdivisions cover the Bakassi Peninsula. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Minister, nonetheless, it would appear that 
the French military presence has a dissuasive function. 
  [Kouomegni] That is totally false. So far, the Cameroonian 
troops have not needed French help in the Cameroonian peninsula. 
Nonetheless, I wish to state that we have a military alliance 
with France and we have the right -- and it is our full right-- 
to call on the French when the need arises. This has, however, 
not been the case and I do not understand why there is talk of 
French presence in the peninsula. If the French wanted to get 
there, it takes only 30 minutes from Yaounde. I think this 
discussion on the French presence shows a lack of military 
knowlegde about defense of that area. 
  [Announcer] Some indiscretions reveal that despite official 
declarations, Cameroon has the intention of preparing for war 
with its neighbor. What is your definite position on this 
affair? 
  [Kouomegni] Our position is a dissuasive one, but it is also 
a preparation for any possible action if that becomes necessary 
since the French are our defense ally. However, I repeat, and I 
am keen to point out, that on the ground so far there are only 
Cameroonian forces. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Lagos, March 9 (AFP) -- Cameroonian gendarmes 
have sacked a school built by the Nigerian government in Abana, 
a village in the Bakassi peninsula border area disputed with 
Cameroon, the official NAN news agency reported Wednesday [9 
March]. 
  The Abana primary school, officially inaugurated last June, 
was built by the Akpabuyo local government in Nigeria's 
south-eastern Cross River state. It has now been abandoned by 
teachers and pupils due to the incessant harassment of the 
inhabitants of the village by the Cameroonian gendarmes, a NAN 
correspondent currently in the territory reported. 
  Teachers posted to the five-classroom school fled the 
establishment after experiencing a series of attacks by the 
Cameroonian paramilitary police late last year, villagers told 
the agency. The teachers refused to come back after they were 
"brutally beaten" by the gendarmes during one of the raids last 
year, it concluded. 
  Trouble flared anew in the Bakassi peninsula, a territory 
rich in oil and fish which is administered by Cameroon and 
peopled largely by Nigerian fishing communities, in December, 
when villagers accused Cameroonian security forces of assaulting 
them. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Lagos, 9 March (AFP) -- A war between Nigerian 
and Cameroon over ownership of the Bakassi peninsula would not 
be only a diversion but also "a misdirected and ill-advised 
aggression", a Lagos-based human rights group said here 
Wednesday [9 March]. 
  The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) said in 
a statement that leaders of the two neighbouring nations "can 
and should seek" an amicable solution to the conflict in order 
to avoid imminent "war that now stares both countries in the 
face" "We cannot at this time afford to go on a war whose 
disastrous end no one can predict", the statement said. At a 
time when Nigerians and Cameroonians were "wallowing in abject 
poverty" and yearning for democracy, it was unfortunate that 
leaders of the two nations are "warming up for war", it 
continued. [passage omitted] 
  Wole Soyinka, the 1986 Nobel literature laureate, warned 
earlier in the week that it would be senseless for the two West 
African countries to go to war over a border dispute. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Kidira (Senegal), 9 Mar (APS-SEN/PANA) -- Djibo Ka, 
Senegal's minister of state for interior today in Kidira (east 
Senegal) expressed profound regret at the incidents that 
occurred last weekend along the Senegal-Mali border which left 
seven dead and several wounded. 
  Mr. Ka, who made this statement at a meeting with his Malian 
counterpart Sada Samake, considered these incidents as an alert 
signal that should prompt the two countries to take effective 
measures to dissuade those who attempt to breed insecurity along 
their common border, hence disturbing the peace and tranquility 
of the border populations. After recalling the instructions 
given in this regard by President Abdou Diouf during yesterday's 
cabinet meeting, Djibo Ka reasserted the Senegalese Government's 
determination to spare no effort in combating banditry and 
insecurity along the common border. 
  For his part, Sada Samake, Malian territorial administration 
and security minister stressed the urgent need to implement 
security measures and to provide the necessary framework for 
fighting the criminals. "Rigorous measures must be taken to 
counter acts of vandalism by bandits who are beginning to cause 
heavy losses in human lives and property," he said in particular. 
  Talks between the two ministers should lead to the adoption 
of a new strategy to counter vandalism along the common border 
of the two countries. A final communique will be issued at the 
end of the talks scheduled for today. The Kidira meeting is the 
second to be held by the two ministers after the one in Bakel 
(east Senegal) on 13 January.

  [Text] Internal squabbles have appeared within the Front 
for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy [FRUD], an Afar 
guerrilla movement in which a new executive council intended to 
replace the present leadership, has been created by one of the 
movement's military officials. In a handwritten communique 
circulating in Djibouti since yesterday, this official, Ahmed 
Ougoureh Kifle, announced the dissolution of the political 
bureau led by Ahmed Dini Ahmed and the formation of a 13-member 
new "executive council" in which he is the leader and commander 
in chief of the resistance. 
  The text of the communique accuses the former leadership of 
making "unforgivable mistakes that resulted in cases of 
disappointment and in a situation unbearable for all." It 
blames the former political bureau for "its negative policy and 
inability to bring the various situations under control." This, 
according to Kifle, has caused "a state of anarchy and 
no-progress, which has paralyzed the FRUD for two years now." 
  The new executive council, which mostly comprises "famous 
commanders" of the early hours of their struggle and which 
apparently wants to get rid of the front's hardliners, "pledges 
to end the no-peace no-war situation." It contemplates to 
evolve new struggling strategies, while being open to a possible 
dialogue with the government in power," the text adds. 
  Kifle does not also rule out moves likely to lead to direct 
contacts between the fighting sides with the view of ending the 
crisis that Djibouti is going through. The main FRUD officials 
did not react to this communique today.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 9 SAPA -- A policeman was killed and 
at least 37 people were wounded in escalating unrest in 
Bophuthatswana on Wednesday [9 March] as the embattled homeland 
government thwarted a bid by election officials to impose their 
authority there. 
  On the third day of anti-govermnent protests, riot police 
fought running battles with protesters, firing buckshot and 
teargas to put down the unprecedented unrest in the homeland. 
  To add to political woes besetting President Lucas Mangope's 
government, the African National Congress [ANC] called for a 
mass stayaway from work in Bophuthatswana on Thursday and the 
launching of a consumer boycott. 
  Pule Sekwana, speaking for civil servants who have embarked 
on a widespread strike that has triggered much of the unrest in 
the homeland, said on Wednesday: "The strike will continue and 
we will bring down the government down." 
  In the first death in the unrest, the homeland's information 
service said the policeman was shot dead "by members of the 
public" in the Bophuthatswana township of Mabopane, north-west 
of Pretoria. The policeman was at a police post when gunfire cut 
him down. 
  A doctor at a Mafikeng surgery told SAPA he had treated 35 
people for gunshot wounds on Wednesday afternoon and another 
victim for other injuries. Those treated were apparently victims 
of police shooting protesters late on Wednesday afternoon around 
the capital Mmabatho and in neighbouring Mafikeng. Another man 
was treated for gunshot wounds at Mafikeng's Victoria Hospital. 
  "Most of the people we treated were shot in the torso and 
upper body, and we removed buckshot from many of the wounds. We 
also treated a number of grazes which could have been caused by 
sharp ammunition," said Dr Anwel Hoosenmia, who treated the 35 
victims at his surgery. 
  Earlier, riot police clashed with students at the University 
of Bophuthatswana, firing volleys of teargas shells as the 
students erected barricades with rocks and tree branches and 
hurled stones at the police. No injuries were reported. The 
street outside the university campus resembled a battle field 
with streets signs and huge garbage skips blocking the road and 
access to the campus still being controlled by heavily armed 
police. 
  The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], meanwhile, 
failed 
on Wednesday in its bid to impose its authority in the homeland, 
after two-hour talks with President Mangope and his cabinet. 
"The government of Bophuthatswana stated it is unable to 
accede to the iec requests as this would be tantamount to 
acceptance of the non-recognition of Bophuthatswana's 
sovereignity," said a joint statement released after the 
meeting. The IEC delegation was headed by its chairman, Mr 
Justice Johann Kriegler. 
  The IEC requested the homeland government to permit 
electioneering and voter education campaigns and to allow voting 
facilities for South African citizens. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler said the meeting had clearly failed to 
achieve its objectives and delegates would have to continue 
trying to negotiate an agreement. he told reporters after the 
meeting that the Transitional Executive Council and the South 
African Government might take "such action as they see fit" 
following Bophuthatswana's rejection of its demands. 
  The TEC said on Tuesday it would cut diplomatic ties with 
the 
homeland, cut financial assistance and restrict the movement of 
the homeland's officials in South Africa if Bophuthatswana 
failed to allow free political activity within a week. 
  Bophuthatswana's Economic Affairs Minister Ephraim Keikelame 
accused South Africa on Wednesday of "aggression and 
intimidation" and "denying the rights of Bophuthatswana citizens 
of self-determination". He said south african citizens living 
in Bophuthatswana had "the right to vote freely if they want to 
campaign on the soil of South Africa but not in Bophuthatswana". 
  But the homeland's striking civil servants, demanding 
protection for their pensions in the face of political 
developments in South Africa, said they were now also pressing 
for the immeditae reincorporation of Bophuthatswana into South 
Africa. The homeland is to be reincorporated into South Africa 
after the April 26-28 elections. 
  The strike has triggered the worst unrest seen in 
Bophuthatswana in its 17 years of "independence". Schools have 
been closed and health services and general government 
administration severely disrupted. 
  And a day after striking employees of the homeland's 
broadcasting corporation took President Mangope's son hostage, 
the president on Wednesday fired all workers and announced the 
closure of radio and television broadcasts. The striking 
Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation workers are demanding a 
50 per cent pay increases. 
  "The Bophuthatswana cabinet today decided to close Bop 
Broadcasting Corporation's [BBC] two television stations, Bop-TV 
and Mmabatho TV, and the three radio stations, Radio Bop, Radio 
Mmabatho and Radio Sunshine, until further notice," BBC Chairman 
Eddie Mangope announced in a statement. 
  President Mangope, who survived a military takeover in 1988 
after South Africa sent in troops to put down the rebellion, has 
accused Foreign Minister Pik Botha of stoking unrest in 
Bophuthatswana to justify his ouster and military intervention. 
  Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] 
leader Euguene Terreblanche, joining the fray, on Wednesday 
offered to send his militants to the homeland to help Mr Mangope 
withstand what Mr Terreblanche called an African National 
Congress/SA Communist Party/Pik Botha plot. On Tuesday the 
Conservative Party charged the chaotic events in the homeland 
were a "communist textbook case". 
  In another development striking teachers marched to the 
South 
African Embassy in Mmabatho on Wednesday to demand South 
Africa's military intervention in the homeland. 
  Following the late afternoon clashes around Mmabatho, Dr 
Hoosenmia said he and his wife, Dr Sumedha Munim, spent most of 
the afternoon treating victims at their Mafikeng surgery. A 
police armoured personnel carrier Hippo was parked outside. Dr 
Hoosenmia said patients in the surgery were prevented from 
leaving the premises by the police. Two of those treated in the 
surgery were sent to hospitals in South Africa as their wounds, 
both in the stomach, were too serious to be treated in the 
surgery. 
  The centre of Mafikeng on Wednesday night still showed signs 
of the running battles with dirtbins thrown on streets and 
garbage littering most of station street in the city centre. 
Many store windows shattered in the unrest had been been 
replaced while glazers were working in the dark to repair other 
damaged shopfronts. 
  Staff at PG Glass in Mafikeng went on strike at 4pm, leaving 
only one company, Motorglow, to repair the many broken plate 
glass windows. Motorglow also replaced more than 100 car 
windows and windscreens on Wednesday afternoon.

peace talks. The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] and the government continue to discuss national 
reconciliation. A plenary meeting was held today and there is 
even talk of progress, but the information blackout imposed by 
mediator Alioune Blondin Beye continues to be respected. It is 
known, however, that the parties discussed aspects of specific 
principles of national reconciliation.

  [Text] Yaounde, 11 Mar (CAMNEWS/PANA) -- Cameroonian 
External Relations Minister Ferdinand Oyono has said that a 
summit meeting between Presidents Biya of Cameroon and Sani 
Abacha of Nigeria will only be possible if Nigerians pull out 
all their troops from the Bakassi Peninsula. The Cameroonian 
foreign minister made that statement after a meeting here 
yesterday with his Nigerian counterpart, Babagana Kingibe, who 
arrived in the Cameroonian capital on 9 March at the head of a 
military and civilian delegation. 
  Kingibe has said that he will go back for consultations with 
the Nigerian authorities on the conditions set by Cameroon which 
also wants the summit meeting to be held in a neutral country. 
The Nigerian minister told Cameroon Radio that talks between 
the two delegations were on course. The joint communique on the 
bilateral talks has not yet been signed although the Nigerian 
delegation is scheduled to leave the Cameroonian capital today. 
  Fambare Ouattara Natchaba, Togolese minister of foreign 
affairs and cooperation, attended the meeting which examined the 
territorial dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula said to be rich 
in oil and natural gas. Last week, Togolese Head of State 
Gnassingbe Eyadema undertook to mediate between the two 
countries. In this regard, he visited Yaounde and Lagos [as 
received] to examine with Biya and Abacha ways and means of 
finding a peaceful solution to the dispute.

<F P=106> [All figures as heard] </F>
  [Text] President Idriss Deby this morning chaired an 
extraordinary cabinet meeting devoted to the examination of the 
draft bill on the 1994 budget. The general state budget for 
1994 was fixed at 203,329,800,000 CFA francs. Here is the 
report on the extraordinary cabinet meeting presented by the 
government spokesman, Communication Minister Ouardougou Bolou: 
  [Begin Bolou recording] The cabinet examined the only item 
on 
its agenda, namely the examination of the draft 1994 general 
budget bill. The general state budget for the 1994 fiscal year, 
which comprises recurrent expenditure for institutions and 
public investment expenditure and is worth 203,329,800,000 CFA 
francs, was adopted after extensive debate. This amount is 
broken down as follows: recurrent expenditure, 70,839,800,000 
francs; public investment budget, 132,783,000,000 francs. 
  The budget falls within an extremely difficult context for 
our country which is characterized by economic recession and the 
new financial situation brought about by the devaluation of the 
CFA franc. However, the government wants to rigorously take 
national imperatives into account, particularly the 
implementation of the transition guidelines and the honoring of 
its foreign commitments in line with measures to redress the 
serious macroeconomic imbalances of the country. [end recording]

  [Text] Our guest this morning is Pascal Lissouba, the 
president of Congo, who is having a number of high-level 
meetings in Paris at the moment. He has been able to meet 
President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Balladur, and the ministers 
of cooperation and of foreign affairs. This has enabled both 
sides to take stock of relations between France and Congo. 
Pascal Lissouba spoke to Monique Mas: 
  [Begin recording] [Lissouba] We have had with France--I 
can't 
say a conflict, I can't say say a problem--I would prefer to say 
a misunderstanding. And I have come here not to try to make 
myself loved but to try to make myself understood. 
  We had to sign a contract with Occidental Oil, and this was 
misunderstood. I misunderstood other people. And today I have 
understood what they wanted to say, and I have give a positive 
response to our French partners, Elf, since I have taken a bill 
that I have submitted to the National Assembly to strengthen 
Elf's place in my country. 
  [Mas] (?There) were also aspects to this quarrel that could 
more or less be described as political. Some rather harsh 
things were said about you, for example, by the French minister 
of cooperation. 
  [Lissouba] Who said in substance, to you, to the media, that 
strictness is a mark of love. Why should I think the opposite? 
In my country there is a proverb that says: You throw 
[indistinct word] where it bears fruit. 
  [Mas] Is France always going to be a factor for Congo? 
  [Lissouba] [sentence indistinct] Congo had the honor of 
being, in a small part of its history, the capital of 
[indistinct word]. The ties binding us are not simply material 
ties. (?The day) we stop being connected with France, we 
(?shall) stop speaking French. Seventy percent of our debt is 
with France. If we want to get out of this, we have to come to 
an agreement with France. 
  [Mas] In the past few months political life in Congo has 
been 
very chaotic, with bloody clashes. What do you think the nature 
of this situation is? 
  [Lissouba] Let us say [words indistinct] it is a lack of 
democratic culture. Imagine that for 25 years power (?was 
achieved) at the barrel of a gun. Then suddenly, as if by 
magic, you tell them: No, power isn't at the barrel of a gun, it 
is in talking. 
  [Mas] The question of security is fundamental in Congo? 
  [Lissouba] Decisive. 
  [Mas] [words indistinct] Israeli mercenaries. Why? 
  [Lissouba] Why do you call them mercenaries? Say it. No, 
they aren't mercenaries. They are gentlemen who have a skill, 
and we simply found ourselves in a position to buy this skill -- 
that is the word -- to help our young people to protect our 
people tomorrow against the oppression I have just described as 
ridiculous. 
  [Mas] And the Congolese Army? After all, your prime minister 
is still General Yhombi-Opango, who, incidentally, is a former 
head of state. 
  [Lissouba] Of course, a former head of state. So today it is 
not his position as a general that counts. Since he has been 
head of state, it is his political sense. And he is a 
politician whom I took for reasons connected with our history. 
  [Mas] You announced a government of national unity. 
  [Lissouba] No. When I came to power, I spoke of a government 
of national unity. I didn't ask for a government based on 
parties. That wasn't what I wanted. They wanted to impose on me 
a government based on parties. When we held this experiment for 
three or four months, it was a disaster. I called the 
opposition prime minister, and before coming to see me, he first 
went to consult the head of his party. I don't want this sort 
of exercise, this sort of government. 
  And what I call a government of national unity today has 
nothing to do with that. I want to take specialists, experts, 
from all sides, on condition that they agree to work for their 
country. If we have a program, and we want to implement it, and 
the people seem to agree, let's work together. On that basis. 
  [Mas] So no sharing of power, but perhaps personalities from 
the opposition invited to support your political program? 
  [Lissouba] First, no, not to support my political program. 
To support a program that will help the Congolese people to get 
out of their difficulties. 
  (?Now) sharing power. But power isn't simply being a 
minister. We are going to decentralize our country. At the head 
of each region there will be people elected by the people. It 
could be someone from the opposition. And he will administer 
the region with the means that the government puts at his 
disposal, all the more in that the essence of this 
decentralization is to try to distribute in the least unequal 
possible way the resources and the products of the nations. We 
want to give them to each region so that they can develop. That 
is what power is. 
  So what kind of sharing do we need? That I should divide our 
country (?in two)? [end recording]

  [Text] Yesterday, there was anger and exasperation among 
the members of the High Council of the Republic-Transitional 
Parliament [HCR-PT]. This was caused by Article 55 of the Draft 
Constitutional Act on the composition and appointment of the 
HCR-PCT Executive Committee. The councillors had very divergent 
views on this point, for which the stakes seem to be very high. 
Oscar Kambamba has a report on this session: 
  [Begin Kambamba recording] Yesterday's plenary session was 
interspersed with moments of exasperation among the members of 
the two political forces at the People's Palace during the 
marathon session, which lasted from 1700 [1800 GMT] to 2300. 
The Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC] and the USORAS 
[expansion unknown] were completely at odds concerning Article 
55 of the Draft Constitutional Act, which concerns the 
appointment and composition of the Executive Committee. 
Although the two parties agreed on the composition of the 
committee -- a chairman, two first vice chairmen, two second 
vice chairmen, two first secretaries-rapporteurs, and two second 
secretaries-rapporteurs -- the same cannot be said for who would 
fill the posts. What really divided the two sides was deciding 
on the procedure for appointing the HCR-PT chairman. 
  The FPC feels that the HCR-PT already has a legitimate, 
[word 
indistinct] chairman. As Mr. Mutumbo said, to think otherwise 
would imply blackmail and, as parliamentary practice demands, 
only a vote could settle the differences. Mr. Kamanda, the 
co-chairman from USORAS, was apparently exasperated by a 
violation of the protocol agreement, in view of the fact that 
the HCR-PT chairman is appointed from this institution, and if 
this aspect is not taken into account, it could lead to a 
bothersome precedent and create unstable conditions for 
continuing the talks. In other words, the USORAS members, who 
rejected a vote on the issue, were calling for a consensus. 
  Speeches upon speeches were made, but none of the proposals 
put forward were adopted. Thus, around 2300, the two opposing 
sides, without reaching an agreement, adjourned the session to 
sleep on the issue until today. Prior to this, it took two 
hours of discussion to amend and adopt Article 90 on the 
inviolability of the head of state's person, who shall not be 
penally responsible for acts undertaken in the exercise of his 
duties, except in case of high treason. The same article also 
provides for the responsibilities of the prime minister and the 
other members of government. In all, there are only three 
articles left for deliberation. Apart from Article 55, there is 
Article 76 -- which provides for the election of the prime 
minister by the CNS [expansion unknown] for USORAS and by the 
HCR-PT for the FPC -- and, finally Article 116, which covers the 
transitional and final provisions. Agreement on these three 
articles could divide the participants and possibly jeopardize 
everything if they do not relax their stands. [end recording]

  [Text] The political and military situation is once again 
shaky in the besieged city of Cuito. The National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] rebels continue to 
prepare a large-scale attack on the city of Cuito. The local 
press learned this from Captain Jorge Regresso, spokesman of the 
Angolan Armed Forces command, in the region. 
  According to the source, over the past few weeks, Savimbi's 
men have been carrying out constant movements of troops and war 
materiel from Andulo District and Huambo Province. They have 
also been planting mines, and kidnapping and assaulting 
civilians. 
  Jorge Regresso also said that more than 16 night flights, 
carrying large quantities of war materiel to Andulo, were 
registered from January to March.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Leonel Matias in Maputo on the </F>
"London Last Minute" program] 
  [Text] President Joaquim Chissano has admitted publicly for 
the first time that the Mozambican Government could make use of 
force against neighboring Malawi in connection with the alleged 
illegal entry into Mozambican territory of armed Malawi Young 
Pioneers [MYP] men, who belong to Malawi's ruling Congress 
Party, MCP. This is the first such statement to have been made 
by the Mozambican head of state since those Malawian youths 
allegedly came into Mozambique at the end of last year and since 
the two governments had met in January and agreed to cooperate 
to settle the problem. Speaking to Mozambican Television, 
President Joaquim Chissano had this to say: 
  [Begin Chissano recording] With regard to the use of force 
by 
us, everything depends on the outcome of those efforts to settle 
the problem. If the outcome dictates the need to use force, 
then it will be the country's duty to defend its territorial 
integrity. I think, though, that it will not be necessary to go 
that far. [end recording] 
  There are contradictory reports concerning the alleged entry 
of armed MYP men into Mozambican territory. Some government 
sources have already accused the Mozambique National Resistance, 
Renamo, of giving shelter to those youths. Renamo has, however, 
challenged the government to tell the United Nations where those 
men are. Other reports say that those MYP men were placed in 
Mozambique to be used at a later stage to destabilize Malawi, 
should the ruling MCP lose. This is the first major incident 
between the two countries ever since Mozambique threatened to 
place missiles along the border. The Mozambican Government had 
said at the time that Malawi was involved in a major Renamo 
military offensive aimed at creating the so-called Republic of 
Rombezia. 
  However, the Mozambican Government is also having a bad time 
of relations with neighboring Zimbabwe. Maputo is annoyed about 
the fact that the Zimbabwean Government led by Robert Mugabe, 
who fought his war of independence with the support of the 
Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, and later helped the 
Frelimo government in its war against Renamo, should now be 
giving greater attention to relations with Renamo.

  [Excerpts] The government has made available enough money 
to meet the basic requirements, especially food, for the 
displaced persons in the ethnic conflict in the Northern Region. 
The chairman of the Task Force Relief Committee, Group Captain 
George Ayitey, who was briefing newsmen in Tamale today, did not 
disclose the amount. He, however, explained that the task force 
cannot do much with the donations from the nongovernmental 
source, hence, the government's intervention. The task force 
has, so far, registered 132,000 displaced persons in the region, 
the bulk of them, over 60,000 in Bimbila. These figures do not 
include Konkombas, because the task force has not been able to 
reach them in the bush. Group Captain Ayitey said the security 
agencies had been concentrating on the restoration of public 
confidence which has not been easy, especially because of two 
shooting incidents on the Tamale-Salaga road last week. 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, reports reaching Tamale indicate that fighting is 
raging at Sakpe in the Yendi District and that the village has 
been burned down. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Monrovia, March 10 (AFP) -- Conflict within the 
ranks of Liberia's armed United Liberation Movement (ULIMO) has 
claimed 200 lives since the beginning of this month, ULIMO 
official Varfley Dolley said here Thursday [10 March]. 
  Dolley, a ULIMO member of Liberia's newly instituted 
transitional national assembly, said the fighting was a 
political and tribal struggle between Krahns and Mandingos in 
the organisation. 
  The most violent fighting took place in the Bong mining 
region 75 kilometres (about 45 miles) north of Monrovia and at 
Tubmanburg, the headquarters of the movement 60 kilometres (37 
miles) to the north. 
  The situation remained "chaotic" at Tumbmanburg, he said, 
though it had calmed down at Bong. 
  The crisis began on February 28 when Thomas Ziah, a Krahn 
and 
one of two ULIMO representatives in the State Council, refused 
to support his fellow ULIMO member of the collegiate presidency, 
the Mandingo Mohamed Sheriff as candidate to head the 
institution. 
  In reprisal, ULIMO president Alhaji Kromah, a Mandingo, 
sacked Ziah on March 3 and ordered that all Krahn fighters in 
the movement be disarmed. 
  ULIMO's military leader, General Roosevelt Johnson, a Krahn, 
then declared on March 6 that he had replaced Kromah at the 
movement's head. 
  The row also prevented the investiture of the State Council 
on Monday under a peace plan underwritten by the United Nations 
and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) last 
year to end Liberia's three-year civil war. 
  The two sides finally compromised by replacing Ziah by 
another Krahn, Dexter Tahyor. 
  Dolley called on ULIMO's political and military leaders to 
"settle their differences in a peaceful and orderly manner." 
  ECOMOG, a multinational African peacekeeping force 
despatched 
to Liberia by ECOWAS in 1990, has this week made a start in the 
disarming of the country's rival factions.

  [Text] Niamey, 11 March (PANA) -- Niamey University 
students demanding the payment of three months arrears of their 
grants clashed with riot police Thursday [10 March] near their 
campus. The students demanded to be paid before the end Sunday 
of the holy Muslim fast month of Ramadan. They burned tyres and 
tree branches blocking access to the only bridge linking the 
banks of the Niger River which divides the capital, Niamey. 
  Police cleared several barricades making traffic possible at 
parts of the city. Three demonstrators were wounded, the 
executive secretary of the Union of Niger Students at Niamey 
University, an affiliate of the Niger Students Union [USN], 
Ousmane Abdrahmane, said. Soon after 7 P.M. (1800 GMT) police 
restricted students to their campus. 
  Violent clashes between students and police which took place 
over two days on 6 January led to the closing of the university. 
In that incident the government put the number of people 
wounded at 39. The demonstrators were also protesting against 
the non-payment of their grant. 
  [Dakar PANA in French at 1032 GMT on 11 March, in a 
Niamey-datelined item, adds: "A Niamey University student died 
early this morning from wounds received yesterday during clashes 
between antiriot police and activists of the radical USN."]

  [Text] The Ministry of Defense says Nigeria's choice for 
peaceful resolution to the border dispute with Cameroon is not a 
sign of weakness but in pursuant of its belief that African 
problems should be solved by Africans. The director of defense 
information, Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, stated this today 
while speaking with newsmen in Lagos. 
  Brig. Gen. Chijuka said Nigeria had always been an advocate 
of peace in any conflict involving several African states. The 
director explained that the Nigerian Army was a tested Army, 
while the Cameroonian Army was not and could not even quell a 
common unrest in their country. 
  On the claim by Cameroonians that they had sank two Nigerian 
ships, Brig. Gen. Chijuka said the claim was the figment of the 
Cameroonian imagination. The director said the presence of 
Nigerian troops on the peninsula had stopped the activities of 
Cameroonian gendarmes on Nigerians living there. He explained 
that Nigeria has remained level-headed despite the age-long 
provocation by the Cameroonian gendarmes. 
  Brig. Gen. Chijuka recalled that five Nigerian soldiers were 
killed by the gendarmes while several others were wounded in 
1991. Nigeria, he said, did not retaliate all along because of 
its responsibility to the continent. He said the Nigerian 
ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula is based on historical 
factors and that over 90 percent of the inhabitants of the 
peninsula were Efik-speaking Nigerians. Brig. Gen. Chijuka said 
Nigeria's door was still opened for negotiations but cautioned 
that the Nigerian Army would be there to protect the Nigerian 
border, and when they come under any attack they would have no 
choice but to defend themselves. 
  Meanwhile the OAU secretary general, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, 
has said that the Nigeria-Cameroon border problem would be 
discussed later this week at the OAU ambassadorial level. He 
was answering questions from newsmen in Maputo, Mozambique.

  [Text] Reports from the nominally independent South African 
homeland of Bophuthatswana say that thousands of people have 
looted a shopping center in the capital, Mmabatho, in the latest 
antigovernment demonstrations. The police appear not to have 
intervened. Mr. Mangope's helicopter is reported to have left 
the capital, Mmabatho. Some reports say Mr. Mangope was aboard 
but this hasn't been confirmed. 
  There have been several days of antigovernment protests in 
Bophuthatswana and earlier today, about 200 policemen said they 
supported calls for the homeland to be incorporated into South 
Africa. Mr. Mangope has been resisting demands that 
Bophuthatswana should take part in South Africa's first 
nonracial elections next month. The African National Congress 
[ANC] had called for the South African security forces to 
intervene to stop the unrest.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana's President 
Lucas Mangope reportedly fled the capital Mmabatho on Thursday 
[10 March] evening amid signs a popular uprising was underway in 
the embattled homeland where thousands of people took to the 
streets, looting and burning shops. 
  South Africa's Ambassador Tjaart van der Walt told SAPA he 
had spoken at about 6.30pm to President Mangope, who said he was 
going to his country residence at Motsepi. "I have not contacted 
him there yet," the Dr van der Walt. [sentence as received] 
  In another development, the Freedom Alliance said on 
Thursday 
it was suspending negotiations with the South African Government 
and the African National Congress [ANC] to protest against the 
ANC's involvement in upheavals in Bophuthatswana. "The leaders 
of the Freedom Alliance have therefore decided that all 
negotiations, mediation, submission of (election) candidate 
lists and efforts by the Freedom Alliance to rejoin the process 
will be stopped forthwith until the ANC has stopped the action 
in Bophuthatswana," Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National 
Front] leader General Constand Viljoen said in a statement. 
  Waving ANC and SA Communist Party placards, thousands of 
people took to the streets of Mmabatho on Thursday, apparently 
spurred by a march by about 300 policemen to the SA Embassy to 
demand reincorporation of Bophuthatswna into South Africa. Later 
in the afternoon there were reports homeland police had gone on 
strike. 
  Homeland soldiers fired teargas at thousands of protesters 
who stormed and looted the Megacity shopping complex in 
Mmabatho. The soldiers later surrounded the complex to keep the 
looters at bay. 
  Also on Thursday evening protesters set fire to a general 
store in Mmabatho belonging to the homeland's police chief, 
General PJ Seleke. The store is near the University of 
Bophuthatswana where students have clashed with police in the 
past few days. 
  "They opened the gas taps and threw a match into the store 
and it just went up," one of the people outside blazing building 
told SAPA.

  [Text] From late this afternoon there have been reports of 
absolute chaos in Mmabatho, the Bophuthatswana capital. There 
have also been reports that President Lucas Mangope has left 
Mmabatho and that security forces and the police have laid down 
their arms. Our reporter, Nan Roux, is on the line from the 
Mmabatho Sun Hotel. Nan, what's the latest? 
  [Roux] Well, as we were driving into Mmabatho this 
afternoon, 
some journalists, the city, the town was covered in smoke. 
Then, as we came into the hotel, we were stopped by security 
guards wanting to know whether we were residents. Then we knew 
something was wrong. As we came in, the entry hall was milling 
with reporters. Apparently there is a section in Mmabatho called 
Megacity, and this is apprently burning. 
  Shooting and looting is going on, security forces are 
apparently having great problems controlling the people. There 
have also been rumors that President Lucas Mangope has left. 
Apparently at 6.30 [1630 GMT] this afternoon, and they saw him 
leave in a helicopter and they believe he might have gone to 
Lehurutshe, there are also rumors that he might have gone to Sun 
City. There were also rumors that the security forces have laid 
down their arms. 
  In Megacity, there is a policeman's store which was gassed 
and then set alight. The problem with the police is apparently 
they are trying to -- there are too many entrances to Megacity. 
They cannot control all these entrances, so they are having 
problems controlling the people. It seems as if the majority of 
the security forces are anti-President Mangope, however, there 
are still some loyalists. One reporter told me that apparently 
he was chased by two men in a bakkie [pickup truck] -- he said 
they might be AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]. There have 
been reports of AWB in the town. 
  A huge crowd then, just earlier this afternoon, walked to 
the 
South African Embassy and handed over -- a huge crowd of 
Bophuthatswana Police -- and handed over their memorandum 
demanding the reincorporation into South Africa, and also the 
resignation of the commissioner of police. The police also went 
to the university where they laid down their arms and they have 
given in their vehicles. They've just physically sort of given 
in. Some of our reporters that went down now said they have 
just come back from Megacity, and apparently it is completely 
out of control. The crowd is breaking in. Apparently they've 
seen them stealing jewelry, clothing, alcohol. 
  Police are apprently half-heartedly trying to control--they 
are shooting tear gas, but the crowds, huge crowds keep on going 
in. Also, at some stage, the reporter says she saw the police 
just standing helplessly, not knowing what to do. Then at some 
stage they also told the people to give back the stuff that they 
had looted and sort of piled it up on one side, not knowing what 
they were going to do with it. At Bop University the latest is 
that there is a Nyala burning in the entrance, and apparently 
the one reporter followed three ambulances in and was followed 
out by two more ambulances. She says people are lying in the 
street, and he cannot say how many, and he cannot say whether 
they are alive or dead, but there are definitely ambulances 
going into the area. He also saw white soldiers in camouflage 
uniform. He cannot say from which defense force they are. So 
there is generally chaos. 
  [Announcer Adrian Steed] Nan, we hear that the behavior of 
the Bophuthatswana police has left a lot to be desired. What did 
you see? 
  [Roux] Well, yesterday I saw police arive at a house which 
was burning. Curious bystander and residents of the area were 
just looking to see what was happening. The police fired almost 
five tear gas canisters for no reason. This morning I saw them 
assault three international newsmen. We were stopped and 
interrogated and they were very rude and very aggressive, but 
they let us stay. But then in front of us they cordoned off the 
car, they beat up the journalists. One was kicked, they were 
hitting with the butts of their guns. They seemed to be out 
of control. Nobody seems to be controlling them. They are 
shooting at random. They seem to be the people that are, well, 
they are causing some of the trouble. 
  [Steed] Nan, a news service has just reported that the South 
African Defense Force has moved into Megapark. They are firing 
into the air and they are telling poeople to go home. Any news 
on that for us? 
  [Roux] I cannot confirm that at all. I have not seen, I have 
not heard reports of a South African Defense Force presence. 
All I have heard about before is that there are some -- 
somebody did see white soldiers in camouflage uniform but they 
cannot say from which defense force they are. No, that rumor 
cannot be confirmed yet. 
  [Steed] Nan, thank you very much, and take care. 
  [Roux] Thank you.

<F P=106> [From the "Agenda" program--live] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer Tim Modise] We are still checking a very 
fluid situation in Mmabatho, and right now we connect to Nan 
Roux, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV News 
journalist, who has been covering events from there. Nan, 
welcome again. What's the latest? 
  [Roux] Well, the latest is that the situation in Mmabatho, 
in 
Megacity, is definitely still very volatile. I can hear the 
shooting now as I sit here in my hotel room. We heard an 
interesting report that a prison, Mogwase Prison near Sun City, 
apparently all the prisoners were let free earlier this evening, 
and there was a lot of shooting between prison warders and the 
security forces. What you are seeing there now is the road 
going into Mmabatho, that was still earlier this afternoon. 
That is from our reporter Estelle Pienaar, who followed the 
people. And this is when the situation started getting really 
bad, when the shooting started in Megacity. People are very 
confused. The police are shooting at random, there does not 
seem to be any control over what is going on. There is a lot of 
looting going on, aparently that is still the case in Megacity. 
  There were reportrs that bodies have been seen lying next to 
the road; one of the SABC reporters saw bodies lying there. He 
could not confirm whethter they were dead or alive. But he has 
seen bodies. We have had no official report of casualties or 
any deaths. Ambulances were also seen going into the area. As 
you can see, people are running for cover. The shooting is just 
at random. Looting, people are stealing. The police were seen 
trying to stop the people, apparently it was a very half-hearted 
attempt to stop them earlier this evening. After a while the 
police apparently just gave up and stood watching the people. 
They tried to get some of the stuff back, but it's very 
chaotic, very disorganized. 
  [Modise] Nan, has there been any activity coming from South 
Africa into Mmabatho at this stage? I mean, security forces or 
anything of that sort? 
  [Roux] Well, going out of Mmabatho into South Africa, we 
went 
this afternoon, there are Defense Force vehicles there. Danie 
Hefers, our other reporter, saw them yesterday as well, but we 
haven't seen anything in Mmabatho. Reports of that cannot be 
confirmed. 
  [Modise] The South African Embassy? Is there any word from 
them as to.... 
  [Roux] Danie Hefers apparently tried to speak to the 
ambassador this afternoon, but did not manage to get hold of 
him. The police apparently did go to the embassy this 
afternoon, and handed over a memorandum demanding incorporation 
into South Africa and the resignation of the Commisioner of 
Police. But word from the ambassador, we have not heard 
anything. 
  [Modise] And the military barracks, in Mmabatho -- have you 
seen any activity from that side, the army or the Bophuthatswana 
Defense Force? 
  [Roux] It's been mostly security forces, very little defense 
force. We have seen helicopters. There seems to be a lot of 
shooting and awful scenes. This is in Megacity, where most of 
the shooting took place this afternoon. Estelle Pienaar was in 
Megacity this evening, and she said it was absolutely chaotic. 
As you can see, people are just running, people are looting, 
huge crowds are coming into the area. 
  [Modise] Who is shooting who? 
  [Roux] The security police are doing the shooting. They are 
shooting live ammunition, they are shooting with rubber bullets 
and with tear gas. 
  [Modise] Is there any truth in other reports that indicate 
that there could be AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] members 
who have come into Mmabatho? 
  [Roux] Well, there were reports this afternoon. I met up 
with 
policemen at Rooigrond, 15 km outside Mmabatho, this afternoon. 
They were apparently waiting for the AWB who were massing, but 
we haven't seen any reports of them. As you see, people here 
are also stealing clothing. Estelle Pienaar made reference to 
that. Alcohol is being stolen, jewelry is being stolen, and the 
police are just standing by helplessly watching. They are not 
doing much to interfere. But AWB, no, I haven't seen any. 
  [Modise] And government members, the cabinet members, it is 
not known there they are at this moment? 
  [Roux] No. We have had reports that Lucas Mangope, President 
Mangope, fled the country this afternoon, people saw him, but we 
haven't heard from any other cabinet ministers, no. 
  [Modise] And so far the situation is, as you say, very 
chaotic? 
  [Roux] What you are seeing at the moment is what's going on 
at the moment as well. It is a bit late and I can hear sirens, 
I can hear gunshots. It's chaos, it is too dangerous for us to 
go in there at the moment, so we haven't got the latest, because 
we cannot go in there, but it is very, very, very chaotic. 
  [Modise] Nan, okay, we stil have you on the line. You say 
you 
haven't been able to hear any word from the South African 
Government as to what action they are going to take? 
  [Roux] No. We haven't heard any word from them. One 
reporter did see white people in camouflage uniforms at 
Megacity. They are not sure from which defense force they are, 
whether they are Bophuthatswana Defense Force or South African 
Defense Force. So any South African interference, we haven't 
heard any word from that. The visuals you are seeing now is 
Estelle Pienaar, who went in earlier this evening, and she just 
reports that it is crazy. They really risked their lives to go 
in there to get these visuals, because most of the press have 
pulled out. 
  [Modise] We see this happening at the shopping center, but 
the government offices, are they still intact, nothing has 
happened with them, within the buildings? 
  [Roux] No, nothing. We have no knowledge or rumors of 
anything having happened there. The university, there have been 
problems there, the soldiers went there earlier this 
afternoon.... 
  [Modise] Okay, well, we're losing Nan there, and we're 
losing 
the pictures, but Nan, thanks again for coming through with that 
report, and good night to you, and we hope that you'll still be 
giving us more reports.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 10 SAPA -- The South African 
Defence Force [SADF] has not been deployed in Bophuthatswana, 
South African Defence Ministry Communications Manager Dr DAS 
Herbst said in Johannesburg on Thursday night. 
  He said the SADF was not on a basis of alertness 
specifically 
with regard to Bophuthatswana. Dr Herbst was speaking against 
the background of ongoing speculation that the SADF had moved 
into the riotous homeland. 
  "Any decision about Bophuthatswana will be made by the South 
African Government and in which the Transitional Executive 
Council will be involved," Dr Herbst said. 
  He pointed out however that the SADF had, on an ongoing 
basis, contingency plans for all events.

  [Text] [Announcer Adrian Steed] Back to Bophuthatswana. Our 
reporter on the scene, Nan Roux, has been in the thick of things 
in Mmabatho today and witnessed a great deal of what you saw 
earlier. She is on the line to us from the Mmabatho Sun Hotel. 
Nan, give us an update on the situation at the moment, please. 
  [Roux] Well, the situation in the town Megacity, where most 
of the action took place earlier this evening, is quiet, There 
is a Bophuthatswana Defense Force presence, but apparently the 
looting has stopped and the people have left the area. 
  However a news team came in from the Zeerust road and 
noticed 
approximately 30 cars. They said they looked like right-wing 
cars, farmers' vehicles, bakkies [pickup trucks]. Apparently 30 
of these cars turned off onto the Jagersfontein road. The two 
reporters trailed them for about 10 km. They spotted men on the 
back of one of the bakkies. They thought they had balaclavas 
on. The cars turned round and the men returned. So there is a 
massing of some kind outside town. We've just not had 
confirmation of who exactly it is. Then we've also had reports 
of problems in several prisons. A prison warden from a prison 
just outside Mmabatho phoned to say that apparently they have 
seven casualties. They have been attacked by Bophuthatswana 
police and Bophuthatswana Defense Force. This hasn't been 
confirmed yet, but there are problems in prisons across the 
country. But in Mmabatho it's quiet, and yes, we'll keep you 
updated. 
  [Steed] Nan, thank you very much. Good night, and take great 
care. 
  [Roux] I will. Thank you.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- White people in army 
camouflage uniform have entered the fray in riotous 
Bophuthatswana. The white men kept protesters away from the 
looted Megacity shopping complex and the University of 
Bophuthatswana in Mmabatho on Thursday [10 March] night. 
  It was not known who the white men were. The South African 
Defence Force earlier on Thursday night denied that its had sent 
soldiers to the homeland. 
  Gunshots were heard in the vicinity of the university, where 
there was a group of about 100 white men in camouflage. 
  Meanwhile, members of the rightwing Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] have 
arrived in Mmabatho and are believed to be converging at the 
city's prison. 
  An SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] television 
crew was stopped by a large group of AWB members. The keys for 
their vehicle were taken and thrown away, their film confiscated 
and destroyed and the crew left stranded on the road between 
Mmabatho and Zeerust. 
  Acccording to SABC-TV producer Nan Roux the team had been 
harassed and she was mobilising people from the Mmbatho Sun 
Hotel to rescue the stranded crew. 
  ITN [Independent Television News] reporter James Brittan 
said 
he had seen a group of about 30 white farmers in bakkies about 
10km outside Mmabatho. "They were all driving farm vehicles and 
we asssume they were AWB members. They then turned off the main 
road and we followed them for a short way before returning to 
Mmabatho," he said. 
  SA Police said on Thursday night they are aware that of a 
group of at least 200 rightwingers had moved from Zeerust to a 
place close to Bophuthatswana. 
  Western Transvaal police spokesman Capt Koos Degenaar told 
SAPA police were aware of the rightwing movements. 
  The SAP [South African Police] was not able to ascertain 
exactly where the group was gathering and therefore could not 
act. 
  He said police in the Western Transvaal had "sharpened our 
patrols along the Bophuthatswana borders because of all the 
unrest" in the homeland. 
  He said the SAP could not act outside of South Africa but 
were making an extra effort to patrol the borders.

  [Text] Rooigrond, Bophuthatswana March 10 SAPA -- A convoy 
of 20 vehicles carrying heavily armed khaki-clad rightwingers 
heading for Bophuthatswana's capital Mmabatho was diverted at a 
roadblock at Rooigrond, near the SA [South Africa] border, at 
about 11.30 PM on Thursday [10 March]. The convoy of cars and 
bakkies [pickup trucks] were each occupied by at least four or 
five khaki-clad men. 
  According to SA Police manning the roadblock at Rooigrond, 
about 20km from Mmabatho, the convoy was re-routed to Buhrmons 
Drift. 
  According to police, the road through Buhmorns Drift did 
offer access to Mmbatho. As no law had been broken, the convoy 
was allowed to proceed. 
  [Johannesburg SAPA in English on 11 March at 0745 GMT 
reports 
that "the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging [Resistance Movement -- 
AWB] has between 4,000 and 5,000 men in Mmabatho, AWB Gen Steven 
Meninger told journalists on Friday morning. The men had made 
the Bophuthatswana Air Force base their headquarters and they 
were deployed all over town, he said. AWB leader Eugene 
Terreblanche is also said to be in Mmabatho to take charge of 
his men."]

  [Text] Johannesburg March 11 SAPA -- A contingent of SA 
[South African] Defence Force [SADF] troops has moved in to 
Mmabatho to take up position in the grounds of the South African 
Embassy, Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha said in a statement 
early Friday [11 March] morning. 
  Mr Botha said the intention was that the force would be 
prepared to maintain law and order and to protect SA citizens 
and their interests. He said the SA ambassador in the 
Bophuthatswana capital had not been able to make contact with 
Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope or any of his ministers. 
With the outbreak of attacks and looting on Thursday, South 
African interests were being seriously threatened. 
  Information that right wing elements were on their way to 
Mmabatho had also reached the SA government. "Against this 
background the president, after consultation with relevant 
minsiters and security forces, decided that a component of the 
SA army should take up a position in the grounds of the SA 
embassy in Mmabatho during (Thursday) night. 
  "The objective of this deployement is first to ensure that 
the SA representattvies and their families be protected against 
possible attack of any kind. Secondly it is the intention that 
the component should be on hand to maintain law and order and to 
protect SA citizens and their interests should the situation 
deteriorate." 
  Mr Botha said the government would not hesitate to take 
similar steps in any other of the republic's nominally 
independent states. 
  The Transitional Executive Council was being kept informed 
of 
developments, he said.

  [Text] For a report on developments in Bophuthatswana last 
night, a warm good morning to Commandant Willem Ratte, commander 
of the Pretoria Boer Commando group: 
  [Begin Ratte recording] Good morning, Anita. Good morning, 
listeners. Last night, as has been widely broadcast, certain 
developments took place in Bophuthatswana. There is a security 
firm which has several Boer Commando members in service, and 
which asked if we could come and assist them with the protection 
of certain industries and personnel. A commando group was then 
put together under the command of the Akasia Commando leader, 
and they moved in and took positions around the properties 
guarded by this security firm. This was late last night. They 
remained there as long as they were needed. There were no 
incidents there, but then certain other shopping complexes, 
about 2 km away, were being looted by a mass of people. This 
was typical of the looting in Bisho and also in several parts of 
South Africa, where unrest has been instigated by the ANC 
[African National Congress] and the Communist Party and has 
always ended with such plundering. [end recording]

  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- There might be a change in 
the pattern of shooting in Mmabatho on Friday [11 March] if 
rightwingers clashed with the reported 30 or 40 Umkhonto we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] members who had been 
despatched to the area, Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] 
General Constand Viljoen warned on Friday. 
  Speaking on SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
television, he said: "We had a specific request not to deploy 
the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) in the area." Troops 
from the farming community were therefore sent into Mmabatho. 
  Gen Viljoen said he was aware the AWB had arrived in 
Bophuthatswana but after discussions with the Bophuthatswana 
government he had, at 4.45 AM Friday, asked the AWB to withdraw. 
  He was aware that a political, and not military, solution 
was 
needed in Bophuthatswana but the territory needed stability for 
that to take place. 
  The Bophuthatswana government should be allowed to make a 
decision about the territory's continued independence without 
being intimidated, he said.

  [Text] Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] coleader, 
General Constand Viljoen, said he had information that members 
of the ANC's [African National Congress] military wing, Umkhonto 
we Sizwe [MK -- Spear of the Nation], were infiltrating into 
Bophuthatswana. He said it was high time for the Transitional 
Executive Council to intervene, and urged the ANC to stop its 
activities and to allow Bophuthatswana's cabinet to decide on 
reincorporation on Tuesday. 
  Meanwhile, ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus has denied in the 
strongest terms that MK soldiers were busy moving into 
Bophuthatswana.

  [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA--Bophuthatswana areas 
north-west of Pretoria such as Winterveld, Mabopane and 
Garankuwa were torn by violence, looting and shooting on 
Thursday [10 March] night and Friday morning, according to 
witnesses. Reports said 20 people had been admitted to 
Garankuwa hospital, five with gunshot wounds. 
  The SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] reported 
that one victim died and that there was rioting at Hlabane near 
Rustenburg. 
  Residents in Winterveld in central Bophuthatswana reported 
shooting through the night, and that shopping complexes had been 
looted and torched. Bophuthatswana police shot at people in the 
streets, they said. Witnesses in Winterveld claimed that 
homeland police participated in the looting. 
  No comment on any of these events could be obtained from the 
Bophuthatswanan police headquarters in Mmabatho. 
  Earlier, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] news 
reported that a section of a multi-million rand shopping complex 
in Mabopane in Bophuthatswana was set alight on Friday morning. 
  This brought to three the number of buildings torched since 
Thursday night, the first two being government administration 
buildings.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA--The Bophuthatswana Defence 
Force [BDF] is running a large group of armed right-wingers out 
of Mmabatho, STAR photographer Ken Oosterbroek said on Friday 
[11 March]. 
  ITN [International Television Network] Reporter James 
Brittan 
told SAPA there was a "wall-to-wall" Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] presence in 
downtown Mafikeng and continuous gunfire from the central 
business district. "It is a running firefight," he said. 
  According to CNN news, the AWB has refused to pull out of 
Bophuthatswana as "this is our land and we are staying". 
  There was fighting in dowtown Mafikeng on Friday between the 
AWB and the BDF, with one AWB member killed and two civilians 
caught in crossfire. 
  SUNDAY TIMES Reporter Ray Hartley described the scene "war". 
There was sustained, continuous gunfire for more than four 
minutes. "There have been casualties. One AWB guy has been 
killed and two civilians. There are plenty of people wounded," 
Mr Hartley told SAPA. 
  Surrounding townships and Mafikeng were battlefields, 
journalists told SAPA after returning from trips to Mmabatho and 
Mafikeng. 
  "The AWB have moved beyond Mafikeng," Mr Hartley said, 
adding 
that hundreds of right-wingers had left town. A continuous 
stream of vehicles filled with the right-wingers left the 
Mmabatho area soon after noon, heading towards Mafikeng and 
Lichtenberg in the Western Transvaal.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- Three Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement; AWB] members were 
executed by a member of the Bophuthatswana security forces after 
the thousands-strong right-wing contingent was run out of town 
by the Bophuthatswana Defence Force on Friday [11 March]. 
  Journalists were shot at, beaten and kicked and had their 
equipment stolen by the retreating right-wingers, witnesses 
said. This followed the five- to six- minute firefight in 
downtown Mafikeng in which at least one AWB member and two 
civilians were killed. 
  The incident occurred near the Mafikeng police station where 
three AWB members were shot, NEW YORK TIMES Correspondent Bill 
Keller told SAPA. "We came across two guys next to three AWB 
members who had been shot. One was already dead and the the 
other two were wounded. One of the people wearing green 
uniforms calmly went up to them and shot five or six rounds into 
the two guys," Mr Keller said, calling the killings an execution. 
  Two senior journalists were severely beaten and kicked by 
the 
retreating right wingers outside Mafikeng as the last of them 
left the town. Both John Battersby of the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 
MONITOR and Paul Taylor were set upon by the men who hit and 
kicked them in the head and body. The two men were beaten when 
they went to the aid of a SATV [South African TV] crew of which 
journalist Nan Roux was a part, after the retreating men had 
fired shots at the crew. 
  The SATV crew was filming the tail end of the AWB's retreat 
from Mafikeng from a garage at the edge of town. "We thought 
they had all gone when three more bakkies [pickup trucks] came 
by. They stopped and they shot at us. We hit the ground and 
they shot again, hitting a car in which a bullet wedged itself 
into the metal of a door. Then these two journalists (Mr 
Battersby and Mr Taylor) came up and the AWB men got off the 
bakkie and laid into them. They were very badly hurt," Ms Roux 
said. 
  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
journalist Eugene Yssel was earlier beaten and kicked at the 
AWB's so-called campaign headquarters, the Bophuthatswana 
Defence Force airfield.

  [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] was 
shocked by the execution of wounded AWB members by a 
Bophuthatswana soldier on Friday [11 March], a spokesman at AWB 
headquarters said. AWB spokesman Fred Rundle said AWB leader 
Eugene Terreblanche was not immediately available for comment. 
  Observers feared the incident could lead to acts of 
retribution and increasing violence. 
  REUTER photographer Kevin Carter said he saw the AWB men 
plead for their lives, crying "please God help us" before a 
Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] soldier, ignoring his 
comrades protests, took aim and shot them dead. He also pumped 
bullets into the dead body of a third AWB member lying next to 
them. 
  The three AWB men had been ambushed in the centre of 
Mmabatho 
in their green Mercedes car. 
  Mr Rundle said he had received reports that five other AWB 
men had been injured in other incidents. 
  South African security sources said the incident showed the 
AWB should have employed better military tactics when they 
entered Mmabatho, moving around in larger groups and using 
better communications. They also said the AWB men probably did 
not expect the BDF to turn on them, if this is what happened.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- The routing of the 
Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement] from Bophuthatswana left the homeland's defence force 
in control of the territory on Friday [11 March]. By Friday 
afternoon, however, it was not clear if the Bophuthatswana 
Defence Force [BDF] was in control on behalf of besieged 
President Lucas Mangope, or whether it was siding with the rest 
of the civil service which has rejected Mr Mangope's policy of 
continued independence. 
  Civil servants and people working for parastatal 
organisations have been on strike for the past week demanding 
the homeland's re-incorporation into South Africa and 
participation in the April elections. On friday afternoon, Mr 
Mangope announced his intention to participate in the elections. 
  The country was left in a state of chaos on Thursday when 
police decided to join the rest of the public sector and refused 
to work. Within minutes of their decision people took to the 
streets singing and dancing and shouting that they had 
overthrown the Mangope government. 
  However, the AWB, with the knowledge of the BDF, began 
entering Bophuthatswana in convoys of cars, minibuses and 
bakkies [pickup trucks] filled with the khaki-clad and heavily 
armed men. Estimates of their strength ranged between 1,500 and 
5,000. 
  By early Friday morning the AWB was deployed around 
strategic 
buildings in Mmabatho, including government offices and the 
looted Mega City shopping centre. 
  By noon the BDF had chased the AWB contingent out of 
Mmabatho 
and a bloody skirmish occurred in the Mafikeng central business 
distrcit between the BDF and the AWB militants. They eventually 
left the area, but South African Police [SAP] at Rooigrond, a 
part of South Africa about 20km outside Mafikeng, said only 
about 20 cars and bakkies had passed through a roadblock set up 
by the SAP. 
  It was not known whether the AWB chose another route out of 
the homeland or whether they were still in the area.

<F P=106> [Statement by Rowan Cronje, Bophuthatswana minister of </F>
state; Major-General Jack Turner, commanding officer of the 
Bophuthatswana Defence Force; and Major-General P.J. Seleke, 
commissioner of the Bophuthatswana police force; issued by the 
Information Service of Bophuthatswana on the SAPA PR Wire 
Service] 
  [Text] The Bophuthatswana government this morning announced 
that the situation in Mmabatho/Mafikeng had been brought under 
control during the course of the night, and that actions were 
being implemented to restore full stability. 
  Mr Cronje stressed however, that an offer of assistance from 
the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement] (AWB), 
had been declined. As a result, any AWB presence in the 
Mmabatho/Mafikeng area is without the knowledge or consent of 
the Bophuthatswana authorities. Minister Cronje said: "The 
presence of AWB contingents in Bophuthatswana would not be 
acceptable in terms of the morale of our security forces and in 
view of the political sensitivity of the current situation. 
This was firmly explained to AWB leader, Mr Eugene Terreblanche. 
  Major-General Turner disclosed that during the course of 
last 
night's defensive action by the Bophuthatswana security forces - 
which took the form of a joint operation between the 
Bophuthatswana Defence Force and the Bophuthatswana police -- 
one person had died and 36 had been wounded -- 12 seriously -- 
in clashes between security forces and unruly elements. 
  General Turner said the injured had been transported to 
Mafikeng's Victoria Hospital by military personnel where medical 
attention had been provided throughout the night. 
  In the course of the security force action, a limited number 
of rounds of live ammunition had unavoidably been fired, in 
addition to birdshot and rubber bullets. Injuries sustained had 
been almost entirely in the stomach and leg region. 
  General Turner added: "This was a tragedy which is deeply 
regretted. The security forces acted purely in terms of 
restoring law and order and operated with great restraint, in 
the face of intense provocation from hostile elements, many of 
whom were armed with automatic weapons and petrol bombs." 
  Mr Cronje said the outbreak of unrest had clearly been 
aggravated by inflammatory statements from senior ANC [African 
National Congress] officials, including Mr Popo Molefe and other 
senior officials from the ANC's Western Transvaal region, who 
had been actively lobbying and organising inside Bophuthatswana 
in the days leading up to the outbreak of violence. "These 
facts are beyond dispute. The results of their actions are now 
plain to see. We ourselves had been at great pains to avoid any 
provocative action or statement that might inflame a sensitive 
situation. This blatant interference by the ANC has had, as its 
direct consequence, the tragic and regrettable loss of life and 
injuries that have ensued. 
  "The events of the past few days are indicative of the 
turmoil and instability facing southern Africa unless leaders of 
all political persuasions re-double their efforts to find an 
inclusive political settlement. We ourselves remain committed 
to that quest."

  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana President 
Lucas Mangope announced on Friday [11 March] he would recommend 
to a special sitting of the Bophuthatswana Parliament on Tuesday 
next week that the homeland participate in the April elections. 
In the statement issued by the President's Office he said he had 
disclosed this in advance because of the urgency and gravity of 
the current political situation, "and in the hope that this 
would make a positive contribution to resolving tension and 
uncertainty in the region". 
  He said the North-Western Christian Democratic Party had 
been 
registered with the Independent Electoral Committee which he 
intended to "vigorously lead in the elections to demonstrate 
where the sympathies of the people of the North-West Province 
lie". 
  Mr Mangope said this announcement should "de-legitimise" all 
reason for strikes and other actions because it addressed the 
major concerns that have been raised. He voiced his support for 
continuing mediation on outstanding constitutional issues and 
would participate in negotiations to that end.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] is not mincing 
words about the situation in Bophuthatswana. Secretary General 
Cyril Ramaphosa says it is time for action. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Jessica Pitchford] A moment 
of silence for BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] 
correspondent John Harrison. 
  [Ramaphosa] He died during the course of duty, but as a 
result of the situation that is unfolding in Bophuthatswana. 
  [Pitchford] That situation, Cyril Ramaphosa told 
journalists, 
is getting out of hand. 
  [Ramaphosa] We now have a deep concern that unless action is 
taken with immediate effect we might be facing a situation which 
could even be worse than Bosho. 
  [Pitchford] Possible intervention in Bophuthatswana is high 
on the agenda of the Transitional Executive Council. 
  [Ramaphosa] The intervention could take various forms. It 
could include the South African Defense Force being deployed in 
that area, and ensuring -- not in an aggressive way, we would 
say -- ensuring that South African citizens are protected. 
  [Pitchford] In the eyes of the ANC, Bophuthatswana President 
Lucas Mangope is clearly public enemy number one. 
  [Ramaphosa] It is a selfish stubbornness which he is 
displaying, hanging on to power which he knows he is going to 
lose. 
  [Pitchford] ANC President Nelson Mandela seems to agree. 
  [Mandela] I have done everything in my power to get Chief 
Mangope to cooperate with us in addressing the problems within 
his bantustan. I do not think that I am in a position to do 
anything more. 
  [Pitchford] Not surprisingly, there was no comment from the 
Bophuthatswana consulate here in Johannesburg, but a spokesman 
for the embassy in Pretoria told me he was panicking. Another 
spokesman said there was not much hope of calming the situation 
in Bophuthatswana, with ANC leaders making what he termed 
derogatory statements. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- State President F.W. de 
Klerk discussed events in Bophuthatswana with African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela on Thursday [10 March] 
night and Friday morning. Asked whether more defence force 
units would be sent into the homeland to add to those already 
guarding the South African Embassy in Mmabatho, Mr de Klerk's 
spokesman Richard Carter said events in Bophuthatswana would be 
monitored through the day. Decisions would be made if and when 
necessary. 
  Mr Mandela, who on Friday morning was at the Pretoria 
showgrounds to address a workers' meeting, confirmed to 
reporters he was in touch with Mr de Klerk and Minister of 
Defence Kobie Coetsee.

  [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The South African 
Government and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] will 
jointly take over the administration of Bophuthatswana, African 
National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela said on Friday 
[11 March]. 
  Addressing about 2,000 South African and Bophuthatswana 
workers at a public forum in Pretoria, Mr Mandela said he was in 
touch with State President F. W. de Klerk and Minister of 
Defence Mr Kobie Coetsee. He said they agreed on Friday morning 
on the deployment of South African Defence Force [SADF] 
personnel in the territory. A unit of the SADF had been 
deployed at the South African Embassy in Bophuthatswana, he 
added. "This operation should not be seen as a military 
operation only but as an operation to bring about law and order 
in the place. This is not to restore (Bophuthatswana President 
Lucas) Mangope or anyone else just as discredited. It is for 
the people of Bophuthatswana to be able to administer their own 
country," Mr Mandela said. 
  Now that the SADF was deployed in the homeland it was 
important the government and the executive council ensured that 
workers go back to their jobs and that their pensions were 
secured. 
  Mr Mandela urged workers to leave the matter in the hands of 
the government and the council. He warned people against 
looting and destroying property, calling on them to respect 
other peoples' property.

  [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] should take partial responsibility for the damage 
and unrest in Bophuthatswana, President F W de Klerk told a news 
conference in Pretoria on Friday [11 March]. He added that 
within a few hours there would be definite arrangements between 
the South African Government and Bophuthatswana for the South 
African Defence Force [SADF] to move into bophuthatswana and 
help stabilise it. 
  The news conference heard SADF forces had been deployed in 
Mmabatho and more were on standby. 
  Mr de Klerk welcomed Bophuthatswana President Lucas 
Mangope's 
decision to register for the elections and said he hoped this 
would have an immediate stabilising effect on the territory. He 
rejected the perception that the unrest had brought about Mr 
Mangope's decision to register, and attributed this to the 
continued negotiations between the Bophuhatswana government, the 
South African Government and other interested parties. 
  SADF Chief Gen Georg Meiring and South African Police 
Commissioner Johan van der Merwe left after lunch to appraise 
the situation in Bophuthatswana and would also hold talks with 
Bophuthatswanan's chiefs of police and Bophuthatswana Defence 
Force. 
  On the violence and looting that erupted in the areas along 
the border of South Africa and Bophuthatswana north of Pretoria, 
Mr de Klerk said security forces had been deployed where 
warranted. 
  Mr de Klerk said he had been in contact with African 
National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela, speaking to him twice on 
Friday. Mr de Klerk said there had been good co-operation 
between his government and the African National Congress [ANC]. 
  The leadership of the ANC had acted responsibly and "we 
worked well together". The same could not be said, however, of 
the ANC supporters and their surrogate organisations. 
  Information at hand pointed to their involvement in creating 
the situation and in fostering a volatile spirit. 
  Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee said one facet of the 
unrest was the presence of elements of private armies.

  [Text] Berlin March 10 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel said on Thursday [10 March] afternoon there was 
talk that a coup had begun in Bisho, Ciskei. 
  Speaking in Eastern Cape town of Berlin, he apologised for 
cutting his electioneering meeting short. "There are problems in 
the Ciskei at the moment in Bisho. There's talk of a coup." 
  He said he was was going to see what was going on. "Let's 
hold thumbs it doesn't lead to bloodshed." 
  However, spot telephone inquiries to people working in 
Bisho late on Thursday afternoon did not reveal anything unusual 
in the Ciskei capital. 
  A lawyer in Bisho told SAPA "nothing extraordinary" was 
happening. He said he had a bird's eye view of the town's main 
etreet from a hill in neighbouring King William's Town. 
  A businesswoman said she had heard "talk of toyi-toying 
[protest dancing] by NEHAWU (the National Education, Health and 
Allied Workers Union". 
  Soldiers had been coming and going throughout the day, but 
there was nothing unusual in that, she added. 
  A local bottle store was "as busy as heck" shortly before 
5pm, and civil servants were among the customers.

<F P=106> [From the "PM News Wrap" program, presented by Dennis </F>
O'Donnell] 
  [Text] [O'Donnell] News just in is that there may be a coup 
or a mutiny in Ciskei. On the line is Andrew Trench in 
Grahamstown. Andrew, can you confirm this? 
  [Trench] Yes. What I've heard is that in fact it is not a 
coup that has taken place, but that there has been a mutiny at 
one Ciskei Battalion in Bisho. What people are saying is that 
450 soldiers there went on strike this morning, demanding that 
they be paid their pensions. I've also been told that senior 
officers that went to negotiate with them were taken hostage and 
that the officers and the soldiers there are demanding that 
[Ciskei leader] Brigadier Gqozo come to the base and negotiate 
with them. 
  [O'Donnell] So, how have the authorities been handling this? 
  [Trench] It seems as though they have tried the negotiation 
route. The second in command of the CDF [Ciskei Defense Force], 
Commandant (Matjila), went to negotiate with the soldiers 
earlier, and it seems from military people that I've spoken to 
that he was taken hostage when he did that. The line from the 
Ciskei government at the moment is that they are going to 
attempt to carry on negotiating whth them, although I've also 
been told that they will, if necessary, go to the supreme court 
for an interdict against the strikers. 
  [O'Donnell] Have there been any incidents? 
  [Trench] That we do not know yet. All I've been told at the 
moment is, the only incident to report is that senior officers 
have been taken hostage and that the soldiers have armed 
themselves. 
  [O'Donnell] And you'll be keeping an eye on what's going on 
there and you'll let us know during the program? 
  [Trench] That's right. Some information that we've just got 
in now is that Brigadier Gqozo is at the base now and he is 
negotiating with them, we understand. 
  [O'Donnell] Right. That's Andrew Trench.

  [Excerpt] Bisho March 10 SAPA -- Ciskei military ruler 
Brigadier Oupa Gqozo was locked in talks with troops of his 
first battalion at a military base outside Bisho on Thursday [10 
March] after a South African cabinet minister expressed concern 
earlier in the day about the possibility of a coup in the 
independent territory. 
  Ciskei police who were monitoring the base from a dirt road 
nearby said the brigadier entered the base about 3pm. He was 
still there at 5.30pm. A guard at the base gate said there were 
"problems being experienced by us as soldiers" and that the 
brigadier was addressing them. 
  Earlier in the day SAPA reported that South Africa Law and 
Order Minister Hernus Kriel, speaking in Berlin on an Eastern 
Cape election tour, apologised for cutting short his address and 
told his audience: 
  "I'm talking about the Ciskei, various problems in the 
Ciskei, in Bisho. There's talk of a coup. I'm not involved in 
the coup but ii am involved in the security side." 
  The National Party politician then left for Bisho, Ciskei's 
capital, to monitor the situation. 
  Mr Kriel's spokesman, Craig Kotze, said the minister's 
remarks had to be seen "against the background of increasing 
tension in the homeland". He added: 
  "Obviously we will be monitoring the situation to see the 
lives, property and interests of South African citizens (in 
Ciskei) are not directly threatened." 
  Ciskei TEC [Transitional Executive Council] member Mickey 
Webb said any rumour of a coup in the independent territory was 
"devoid of all truth". 
  Quoting South Africa's ambassador to Ciskei, Pieter Goosen, 
Mr Webb claimed he had been told Mr Kriel had denied making any 
reference to a possible coup in Ciskei. [passage omitted]

  [Text] It is reported from Ciskei that all units of the 
homeland's defense force have been recalled to barracks, pending 
action the military plans to take to secure pensions under a new 
dispensation. It is believed that the military ruler of Ciskei, 
Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, is holding a cabinet meeting behind closed 
doors. All attempts to contact the Council of State have been 
unsuccessful. 
  Our East London news staff confirmed that military guards 
had 
been withdrawn from all government buildings and installations. 
The Ciskeian police have taken up positions around key points. 
Brig. Gqozo has been apparently in conference with his advisers 
throughout the day. The situation in the state is reported to 
be calm.

President Lucas Mangope to make the decisions to give up or 
maintain the sovereignity of the territory without being 
intimidated", Gen Viljoen said in a statement in Pretoria

  [Text] The leaders of the Freedom Alliance have decided 
that all negotiations, mediation, and submission of candidate 
lists for the elections by the alliance should stop immediately. 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] General Constand Viljoen 
said the alliance will resume negotiations once the ANC [African 
National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance 
recognizes the sovereignty of Bophuthatswana. Johan Classen 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Classen] General Viljoen held discussions 
with President Mangope in Mbabatho earlier today, before the 
decision was taken by the Freedom Alliance. He said the 
situation in Bophuthatswana was totally unacceptable. He called 
the violence total terrorism. 
  [Viljoen] Well, to start off, we don't rejoin the process. 
And I think if that is the case, we must seriously in this 
country start talking and considering partition of the country, 
because if there is no way of finding a solution by 
negotiations, to jointly stay and share this country, then we 
must really start thinking about partition of the country. 
  [Classen] Gen. Viljoen predicted that the same situation 
might develop in KwaZulu, and at a later stage in the Republic. 
He also explained why military intervention, be it by the South 
African Defense Force or the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement], was the wrong option. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 11 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Friday [11 March] said he would 
reverse his opposition to the interim constitution if mediation 
proved his stance wrong. 
  Addressing the annual kwaZulu government prayer breakfast in 
Durban, he said his opposition was principled and based on 
honourable and democratic objectives. He warned there could not 
be reconciliation unless the constitution was amended. 
  "If I am wrong in my constitutional analysis, or if I am 
wrong that the 1993 constitution does not provide a framework 
for the emergence of an open democracy, then I will feel greatly 
honoured to change my views to help me help South Africa to 
achieve a real democracy." 
  He warned: "I am prepared to go into the wilderness for 
principles' sake, and I know that there are hundreds upon 
hundreds of thousands of IFP grassroot members and supporters 
who are prepared to die for the sake of the principled stand we 
are taking." 
  He predicted unprecedented resistance ehould the 
constitution 
not be amended. The constitution, far from uniting South 
Africa, "dramatically underlines the conflict between the IFP 
and African National Congress [ANC]". 
  He added: "I challenge the election that might yet be held 
under it. I say no to a constitution which is going to spawn 
more violence than any constitution this country has ever had." 
  Ever more people were being killed in the constitutional 
dispute and violence would continue to spiral as long as the 
interim constitution was upheld. Mr Buthelezi said the final 
constitution would "just be another constitutional instrument 
for ANC party political power". 
  The IFP and kwaZulu government opposed the interim 
constitution because it concentrated power in the hands of a 
ruling political party and did not provide for the dynamic 
interaction of the country's population and cultural groups in 
an open working democracy. 
  "It does not recognise the dominance of pluralism in this 
country, nor does it conform to any of the standards of 
successful working constitutions in plural societies. Its 
essential theme is centralism hidden behind cloaks of 
regionalism or provincialism which just cannot bear proper 
analytical scrutiny." 
  Mr Buthelezi said mediation in the constitutional crisis was 
essential to clarify to confused South Africans the validity of 
arguments for and against it. 
  The IFP's proposed constitutional amendments, which had to 
be 
met before it contested elections, were limited to what the 
party regarded as essential for salvaging the interim 
constitution from the "partisan hands" which shaped it. These 
amendments were not aimed at political gain for the IFP, but at 
reconciliation.

  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the ANC [African 
National Congress] have said after a third round of talks in 
Johannesburg that agreement could be reached soon on 
international mediation to end the constitutional deadlock. 
Delegates of the two parties will now report back to their 
principals. 
  The talks have taken place despite a statement by 
[Afrikaner] 
Volksfront [National Front] co-leader Constand Viljoen that the 
Freedom Alliance is suspending negotiations. IFP National 
Chairman Frank Mdlalose said his party was holding talks with 
the ANC apart from the rest of the Freedom Alliance. 
  IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said earlier in Durban that 
he would end his opposition to the interim constitution if 
mediation proved his stance wrong.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 11 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] has set a Friday [11 March] midnight 
deadline for political parties registered to participate in the 
elections to submit their candidates lists. "The name of any 
party which has applied for registration but has not lodged a 
candidates list by that time (midnight) will simply have to be 
deleted from the ballot paper," an IEC statement said. 
  The IEC ultimatum will affect the Inkatha Freedom Party and 
Gen Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front which registered 
provisionally but have yet to submit candidates lists. The two 
parties said their participation in the elections depended on 
the outcome of proposed international mediation to resolve 
constitutional problems, as agreed by African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela and IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. 
  Gen Viljoen said on Thursday all negotiations should be 
terminated until the crisis in Bophuthatswana had been resolved.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 10 SAPA -- A 12-year-old boy was 
killed and his mother and brother were critically injured when 
gunmen blasted their vehicle with AK-47 rifle fire on the East 
Rand on Thursday [10 March] night. Police said the mother had 
taken her sons to visit their father where he was being treated 
at a local hospital, and was returning home. The attack occured 
as she stopped the car at a traffic light in Alberton. 
  "As the car stopped...an unknown gunman or gunmen opened 
fire 
from behind the vehicle they were travelling in. The woman and 
her two sons were hit several times," police said. 
  A R150,000 [rand] reward has been offered for information 
leading to the arrest of the attacker or attackers. SAP [South 
African Police] ground patrols and a police helicopter combed 
the area until late Thursday in an attempt to track down the 
killers but were unsuccessful. 
  The names and addresses of the victims have not yet been 
released because their families have not yet been notified. The 
SAP statement said police believed other motorcars in the 
vicinity at the time of the attack might also have been hit by 
flying bullets. These motorists were asked to contact the East 
Rand Murder and Robbery Unit at 8452820.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  TEC ANC Vehicle for Action Against `Enemies' -- Johannesburg 
THE CITIZEN in English on 10 March in its page-6 editorial says 
it expected the "African National Congress (ANC)-dominated 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] to take over functions of 
the government, which it is doing," but "never expected it to 
show such arrogance and treat the government with such 
disrespect." The paper refers to the TEC's attempt to "stop 
Housing Minister Louis Shill from going ahead with his R90 
billion [rand] housing scheme for the low-income sector." The 
TEC is "setting itself up as a vehicle for ANC action against 
its enemies, including Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] leader, and President Lucas Mangope of 
Bophuthatswana. This does not augur well for reconciliation and 
national unity, but suggests a dictatorial, aggressive attitude 
which can only exacerbate matters." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Warning Against Postponing Election -- Johannesburg THE STAR 
in English on 11 March in a page-12 editorial notes that General 
Constand Viljoen of the Freedom Front, Lucas Mangope of 
Bophuthatswana, and the Inkatha Freedom Party's Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi want international mediation. "While such 
intervention implies neutral adjudication, it will not guarantee 
a satisfactory outcome, and will almost certainly (because of 
the time factor) require a postponement of the election. The 
country simply cannot afford that. If only out of 
considerations of security and reducing uncertainties, the poll 
must go ahead on April 27." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  SANCO Appoints Itself `Inquisitor' for ANC -- "Spotting an 
opportunity for power and influence, SANCO [South African 
National Civic Organization] has appointed itself the 
extra-parliamentary enforcer of the ANC's reconstruction and 
development programme," declares a page 6 editorial in 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 March. "It is now 
setting about stamping its undemocratic authority on a programme 
for which it is not accountable." "Last November, SANCO said it 
would investigate the operations of development agencies such as 
the Independent Development Trust and the SA Development Bank. 
Both of these operate with public funds and their activities 
can legitimately be questioned and directed by a new government; 
SANCO has appointed itself their inquisitor. In addition, it is 
now targeting private development agencies, the non-government 
organisations which raise and disburse money here, or which are 
channels of donations from abroad. SANCO is now determined to 
see that these funds, too, go where SANCO directs." BUSINESS DAY 
advises these agencies to "ignore these questions." "SANCO has 
no right to this information and replies may well lead to 
'suggestions' about changes in priorities or procedures." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  Call for Military Solution in Bophuthatswana -- Johannesburg 
WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 11-17 March says in a 
page-16 editorial it "does not, as a rule, favour military 
solutions to political problems" like the unrest in 
Bophuthatswana. "But there is a very real prospect that more 
lives may be lost, and the crisis in the homeland may spiral out 
of control, if De Klerk continues to stay his hand. What, after 
all, are the `South African interests' De Klerk says must be 
jeopardised before he will intervene? Are they not the two 
million people South Africa cut adrift when it granted 
Bophuthatswana independence, and who have the inalienable right 
to cast their votes in the country's first non-racial elections?" 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  Zimbabwe Government Abuse of Seized Land -- "The disclosure 
in our news columns that the first of 70 private farms seized by 
the Zimbabwe government ostensibly for peasant resettlement has 
in fact been allocated to a cabinet minister is yet another 
reminder of how government interference in the marketplace can 
be abused," warns a page-6 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in 
English on 9 March.

  [Text] Cotonou, 10 March (ABP-BEN/PANA) -- Troops from 
France and Benin mounted air and naval operations on Wednesday 
[9 March], the second day of the joint military exercise being 
organised by the two countries. 
  The BENIN PRESS AGENCY (ABP-BEN) said on Thursday that the 
operation, which took place in the high seas, about 20 km off 
the Cotonou port, was followed by the landing of troops on the 
beaches of the town. Three warships, two French--the "Rhin" and 
the "Grandiene"--and one from Benin, the "Patriote", as well as 
three French Mirage-F1 jet fighters, took part in the operation, 
the agency said. 
  The planes were moved from the French military base in 
Abidjan while the troops were brought in from garrisons in the 
Paris area. No incident was recorded during the operation, in 
which the French jets destroyed a "target" which was about to 
attack the warships. The landing of troops on the Cotonou 
beaches to push back an "enemy" attack ended the second day of 
the operations. 
  Observers from Niger, Togo, and Nigerian Armed Forces are 
observing the exercise which started Monday. It will end on 
Friday.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 8 March (AFP) -- Kenyan police have 
arrested one man and three women, all Ethiopians, charged with 
hijacking a Saudi Arabian airliner to Nairobi on Tuesday [8 
March], a police spokesman said Thursday. On Wednesday, the 
police had said that two Ethiopians, a man and a woman, faced 
trial in Kenya. 
  One of the hijackers, a man who was injured when police 
captured the pair on Tuesday, had been armed with an imitation 
pistol, a police spokesman said. An unarmed woman with him was 
seized unhurt. One of the other women was arrested just 
afterwards, while security forces detained a third who had 
managed to merge with some 140 Ethiopian passengers freed before 
police ended the hijack bid, police disclosed Thursday. 
  The man's alleged accomplices named him only as Fuad and 
said 
that he was a former Air Force officer who had been expelled 
from Saudi Arabia to Ethiopia, but did not want to return, 
police said. The women were named by police as Sofia Kadir 
Mohamed, Fatma Daya and Muna Abdir Kadir. Press reports have 
said that the hijackers were illegal immigrants to Saudi Arabia.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Allam] </F>
  [Text] Cairo -- AL-HAYAH has obtained the full text of the 
Cairo agreement signed by leaders of the 12 Somali factions; the 
preamble says that "it does not conflict with the Addis Ababa 
agreement" signed on 27 March 1993. It stresses the principles 
of "competence and justice in the formation of a provisional 
government" and "consultation over the appointment of a prime 
minister, who will be entrusted with forming a government." 
  The agreement calls for a meeting in Mogadishu at the end of 
the month among leaders of the Somali movements, including the 
Somali National Movement of the north and the Somali National 
Alliance, to discuss implementation of the agreement's clauses. 
  The agreement also states that a Transitional National 
Assembly [TNA] (to operate for two years) will conduct a census 
in order to prepare for a national constitution and hold free 
and fair elections based on a multiparty democratic system. 
  Following are the key clauses in the agreement: 
  Basic Principles: 
  "The leaders of the 12 factions agree that the basic 
principles governing implementation of this program should be 
based on the following guidelines: 
  "1. Any decision or initiative aimed at advancing the 
national accord process should be based on the Addis Ababa 
agreement and the provisional constitution referred to later in 
this document, which is to be approved by the TNA. 
  "2. Respecting, protecting, and not harming the unity and 
sovereignty of the Somali Republic's territory. 
  "3. Applying the principles of dialogue, mutual 
understanding, and compromise as a basis for a solution to the 
Somali crisis. 
  "4. Renouncing violence as a means of resolving political 
disputes in Somalia. 
  "5. Respecting the principles of justice, equality, and free 
and fair elections to establish a multiparty democratic 
system...." 
  The Transitional National Salvation Council: 
  "A National Salvation Council is still in the stage of 
formation. And taking account of the need to set up state 
structures to restore national sovereignty and rescue Somalia 
from the dilemma facing it, inspired by the Somali peoples' 
nationalist wishes, we have pledged to agree on the following: 
  "1. To form a Transitional National Salvation Council [TNSC] 
comprised of 17 members in the following manner: 
  "A. Leaders of the 15 Somali political factions signatories 
to the Addis Ababa agreement, including His Excellency General 
Mohamed Farah Aidid, leader of the United Somali Congress, which 
is a member of the Somali National Alliance. 
  "B. The leader of the Somali National Movement, which 
participated in the national reconciliation conference in 1992 
as observer. 
  "C. His Excellency 'Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who is deemed to be a 
member in conformity with the Addis Ababa agreement. 
  "2. The TNSC's basic duties are: 
  "A. To represent and express the Somali Republic's 
sovereignty. 
  "B. To legislate, to form and supervise the provisional 
government, to complete the formation of the TNA, and to set up 
public institutions. 
  "3. TNSC members shall not be members of the provisional 
government, whose members will be chosen from among distinctive 
national capabilities. 
  "4. As stipulated in the Addis Ababa agreement, TNSC members 
shall become part of the TNA once at least two thirds of TNA 
have been chosen. After two thirds of TNA members have been 
chosen, the TNSC's duties shall be assigned to the TNA, which 
will operate in accordance with the transitional national 
charter after its approval during the transitional phase, which 
is two years, in accordance with the Addis Ababa agreement. The 
TNA shall be formed within three months to begin as of the date 
of this program's implementation. The TNSC shall elect from 
among its members a chairman and two deputies on the basis of 
three-month rotation until the TNA is formed. The leader of the 
Somali National Movement and General Mohamed Farah Aidid, leader 
of the Somali National Alliance, shall assume chairmanship of 
the TNSC by turns. The chairman shall be elected every three 
months on the basis of a small majority...." 
  Formation of Government: 
  "A balanced government shall be formed on the basis of 
competence and justice. The TNSC chairman shall consult with 
the others members of the council to appoint a prime minister, 
who will form a government...."

  [Text] The leader of the Somali National Alliance, SNA, 
and chairman of the United Somali Congress, USC, Mohamed Farah 
Aidid has delivered a very important speech to the Somali 
people. In it he discussed the current situation in the country 
and the SNA's political role. Aidid, who delivered the speech 
in Nairobi, Kenya, sent warm greetings in which he expressed his 
confidence and great love for the Somali people. He 
congratulated them on the advent of the holy month of Ramadan, 
wished them a successful completion of Ramadan, and further 
wished them a blessed and prosperous [word indistinct]. 
  Explaining his long absence from the country, Chairman Aidid 
said that this was due to the difficult situation facing the 
country. Giving a detailed explanation of the outcome of his 
talks in Nairobi, the chairman said his efforts were being 
directed towards: a) bringing the Somalis closer together so as 
to reach a lasting peace; b) forming a government of national 
unity, and; c) giving precise information to the world at large 
on the true situation prevailing in Somalia and on the SNA's 
program on ways of addressing the issues facing Somalia. 
  On the SNA's contacts with various factions and their 
supporters, the chairman said: We have established a temporary 
base in Nairobi, Kenya because members of many Somali 
organizations are residing in Kenya. This will help us dispel 
the doubts and skepticism bred in Somalis by the civil war. The 
chairman added that, because during the past few years Somali 
communities had had no direct contacts, it was imperative that 
they engaged in consultations, talks, meetings, exchanges of 
ideas and detailed discussions, face to face. 
  On the outcome of those steps, Chairman Aidid said: Somalis 
and organizations we met understood the need for brotherhood and 
understanding, and declared their readiness to strive to bring 
lasting peace to the country and to participate in the 
reconstruction of the Somali nation. He went on to say that the 
benefits derived from the meetings and understanding reached 
included consensus on the need to establish peace in every part 
of the country where hostilities prevail between the Somali 
communities. He added: We have agreed to ensure that 
confrontation and fighting in Kismaayo, Lower Jubba and its 
environs will cease in line with the peace that has been 
established in the central and northern regions of Somalia. 
  Referring to the overall political scene, the SNA leader and 
chairman of the USC said that the SNA shared identical views 
with many individuals and political organizations on issues 
affecting the Somali people's interests. He said: This paves 
the way for the formation of a government of national unity. 
Mr. Aidid said he was delighted that during his stay in Nairobi 
with his delegation, a fifth peace-loving Somali faction, the 
Somali peace-loving union, SPLU [preceding word in English] had 
joined the SNA. He added that other factions had also applied 
to join the SNA. 
  On the SNA's foreign policy, Chairman Aidid said that he and 
his delegation got the opportunity to visit several countries in 
eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, where they held fruitful 
meetings and exchanged views with their presidents. Mr. Aidid 
added: We also held talks with high level delegations from 
other countries, such as America, Russia, Italy, Eritrea, 
Ethiopia, Uganda and Sudan. We also met delegations from donor 
countries and the OAU deputy secretary general, ambassadors and 
many diplomats, all of whom were interested in Somali affairs. 
He said: During our meeting with these delegations, we 
realized that the world now understands us and supports our 
stance that Somalia be left alone to decide its destiny. 
  Mr. Aidid said that the world had realized that the 
aggression launched by the United States and UN Operation 
Somalia [UNOSOM] on the Somali people resulting in many being 
killed and a lot of public and private property destroyed was 
ill-advised. The chairman of the SNA and USC stated: The whole 
world has now agreed that the incorrect policy of UNOSOM must be 
completely changed. This had been stated in two resolutions 
passed by the UN Security Council on Somalia, 855 and 879. It 
had also been confirmed that the new organizations assigned to 
Somalia's reconstruction and rehabilitation would be completely 
independent of UNOSOM. The change could also be seen in the 
complete change and removal of those leaders of UNOSOM who were 
involved in the crisis that took place. The chairman of the SNA 
and USC said: In response to the UN's new policies, we recently 
held talks with the new UNOSOM leadership and agreed that 
Somalia is to be left alone to decide its own destiny, and for 
UNOSOM to help in this respect, with the UNOSOM forces being 
confined to safeguarding the humanitarian program and the safety 
of those working in relief activities. 
  On the need to gain maximal benefits from the international 
relief program, the chairman said: It is imperative that we 
devote our total attention and join hands to ensure peace and 
the reconstruction of our country as we are now free to direct 
our affairs. He further added: We have a great responsibility 
in safeguarding the foreigners who have come from distant places 
-- for no other purpose other than to help us through the 
difficult situation facing our country. He added: It is worth 
noting that the international relief program has a time limit 
and limited resources. That is why it is imperative for the 
Somali people to facilitate the relief program, so that they can 
derive maximal benefits whether they are inside or outside the 
country. 
  Aidid also said: We must ensure that the UNOSOM forces 
leaving our country are allowed to do so in total peace, and are 
left to leave our country honorably. 
  In conclusion, the chairman of the SNA and USC greatly 
lauded 
the UNSC, the donor nations, the governments of the Horn of 
Africa and all those who gave a helping hand to change the 
policies of UNOSOM in Somalia and restore respect for UN on the 
part of the member states. The chairman also thanked the U.S. 
Administration and people, who courageously rectified their 
mistakes after fully realizing the true situation in Somalia. 
Chairman Aidid similarly thanked the Ethiopian Government, 
which made great efforts to bring about a change in the policy 
of UNOSOM on Somalia, as well as playing an important part in 
reconciling the SNA and the new leadership of UNOSOM. 
Concluding his speech, Chairman Aidid called for peace, 
justice, unity and progress.

  [Text] Kampala, 10 March (AFP) -- New fighting between 
Ugandan Government forces and rebels had broken out in northern 
Uganda, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes, the 
official NEW VISION newspaper reported on Thursday [10 March]. 
Fierce fighting between the National Resistance Army (NRA) and 
Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), broke out on Monday 
when the NRA suddenly stormed the rebels' camp at Minakulu in 
Apach district, NEW VISION said. Apach is the home district of 
deposed President Milton Obote, who now lives in exile in Zambia. 
  The paper said that five people, who had been kidnapped by 
the rebels from Moyo district on the Uganda-Sudan border and 
held hostage, managed to escape during the battle that forced 
the rebels to retreat to the Murchison Falls National Park at 
the River Nile bank, where they are said to have other bases. 
NEW VISION quoted some of the freed hostages as saying that it 
was difficult for them to ascertain the outcome of the fighting 
as they had been more concerned with how to escape. 
  The rebels have mainly targetted civilians since they 
resumed 
their activities in northern Uganda, which has not seen peace 
since the rebellion against President Yoweri Museveni's 
government started in 1987, shortly after he come to power in 
1986. A number of civilians, including priests and 
schoolchildren, have been kidnapped by the rebels who 
purportedly use them as human shields in the event of an attack 
by pursuing government forces. 
  As fighting continued to spread, thousands of villagers are 
said to be fleeing their homes in region, severely devastated by 
five years of civil war many more homeless. [sentence as 
received] The new wave of fighting at Minakulu Trading Centre 
brings back memories still fresh in people's minds when hundreds 
of civilians were killed there in August 1988 in crossfire 
between the NRA and the rebels. 
  The new fighting comes at a critical time when the East 
African nation, which has had a turbulent history since 
independence from British colonial rule in 1962, is trying to 
lay the foundations for democratic rule. Political analysts say 
the fighting in the region is likely to disrupt the March 28 
elections for a constituent assembly that is going to debate, 
enact and promulgate the country's new constitution.

  [Excerpt] Kampala, 11 March (AFP) -- Ugandan Government 
forces killed a rebel commander in a shootout that could signal 
the end of a residual insurgency in the north-east, Radio Uganda 
reported Friday [11 March]. The commander of the rebel Uganda 
People's Army (UPA), known simply as Abwongoto, was killed at a 
school in Kumi District on Wednesday where a handful of his 
fighters were reportedly trying to use children as human 
shields. His comrades, believed to number about a dozen, 
surrendered. 
  The UPA's fighters had dwindled to a few score in recent 
years, and it had degenerated into a bandit group, Western 
diplomats said. It was no longer considered a serious threat to 
the government of President Yoweri Museveni, which has largely 
succeeded in stamping out rebel activity. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After over 60 days of intensive debate, delegates of 
the Angolan peace talks between the MPLA [Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola] government and UNITA [National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels in the Zambian 
capital, Lusaka, are apparently reaching the end of their 
tether. There has hardly been a break in the delicate 
negotiations, except over the Christmas holiday period, and 
UNITA's foreign affairs spokesman Jorge Valentim has told 
reporters in Lusaka that they are almost exhausted, as Joy 
Mwinga reports in this telex from Lusaka. 
  Jorge Valentim said the pace of discussion at the 
UN-brokered 
talks was so fast that there was a danger that the two sides 
would end up with what he called another bad agreement that was 
incapable of resolving Angola's future crisis. He complained 
that the two delegations were not being given time to consult 
their leaders at home about the issues and he warned that UNITA 
would not hasten the pace of talks just to accommodate the 
agenda of the UN security Council. Mr. Valentim said that no 
one had the right to force the two sides to work faster. The 
Security Council is scheduled to meet next Tuesday to discuss 
the Angolan crisis. 
  Considerable ground has been covered in the talks, with the 
two sides last December agreeing in principle to a cease-fire. 
This morning, they had resolved all but five, out of the 17 
issues considered crucial if national reconciliation is to be 
achieved, including the decentralization of government and 
UNITA's participation in the economy. They have yet to agree on 
UNITA's participation in government however, the most critical 
item on the agenda. Last week, UNITA dismissed government 
proposals on this front as a smooth joke.

  [Text] It seems as if the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] is now presenting new demands at 
the peace talks in Lusaka, which the government views as 
improper. Our correspondent Joao Ligio has further details. 
  According to observers here in Lusaka, the course of the 
peace talks has reached such a stage that only a greater 
international intervention can give it a favorable image. The 
two parties view any concessions at this period as capitulation. 
  On the remaining points on national reconciliation, a few 
days ago UNITA received the government proposal on its peaceful 
integration in the nation's political life. UNITA has not yet 
given its final reply. 
  On the news media, UNITA does not say yes or no to the 
integration of its radio, the Voice of Resistance of the Black 
Cockerel, according to the existing legislation. It says 
however that it intends to maintain its editorial line. 
  On the return of property, it says that it is waiting for 
new 
guidelines from its leadership, because it does not agree with 
the way it would be processed. 
  On the reimposition of the state administration, UNITA wants 
eight provinces and 50 districts in central and southern Angola, 
with the exception of Lunda Norte and Uige, to fall under its 
administration. The government does not want to be diverted 
from the legal framework. 
  Before concluding discussions on national reconciliation, 
the 
parties are also expected to discuss UNITA's role in national 
and local administration and Jonas Savimbi's status.

  [Text] Alberto Antonio Neto, president of the Angolan 
Democratic Party, has sent a letter to U.S. State Secretary 
Warren Christopher proposing the transfer of the Lusaka peace 
talks to Washington, the U.S. capital. This afternoon, we asked 
Alberto Neto if a greater U.S. intervention would change things. 
  [Begin recording] [Neto] This will change things, because 
the 
two warring parties cannot even produce a pin. They do not 
produce rounds of ammunition to be able to continue with the war 
without foreign assistance. The United States has the means to 
dictate to the parties a series of solutions to end the 
conflict. I think the U.S. Government, which maintains 
equidistant political relations with the two parties, now 
understands that presently the only solution is not to continue 
with the war, but to tell the two warring parties that enough is 
enough [preceding three words in English] and you have to carry 
out the following conditions: First, you should respect human 
rights in Angola. Second, you should end the conflict and apply 
a peace plan, which could be the outcome of different peace 
plans which presently exist. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Alberto Neto, what exactly did 
you ask the United States to do in your letter to Warren 
Christopher? 
  [Neto] First, after the assessment [preceding word in 
English], it is carrying out in political, military, economic, 
and humanitarian fields, the United States should very clearly 
tell the two warring parties that there is no need to continue 
with this war and that it is even necessary to transfer the 
ongoing Lusaka peace talks to Washington. Second, there is a 
need for the presence of the unarmed parties at the negotiating 
table. Third, there is a need to send a firm ultimatum to Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Malheiro Savimbi to go to 
Washington to sign the agreements which they say are almost 
concluded. [end recording]

  [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- Thousands of singing 
Bophuthatswana residents took to the streets of the capital 
Mmabatho on Thursday afternoon waving ANC [African National 
Congress] and SA Communist Party placards in what appeared to be 
the final signal that the homeland government had been toppled 
following almost a week of unrest. 
  Apart from the thousands of people running and toyi-toying 
[protest dancing] down the Lucas Mangope Highway, people in 
cars, minibuses and others piled on trucks were blaring horns 
and displaying the clenched fist black power salute. Police 
presence was at an absolute minimum with only three police cars 
seen hurrying towards [words indistinct] Bophuthatswana's 
reincorporation into South Africa. 
  Two Bop police Hippos outside the university in Mmabatho 
were 
all that remained of evidence of the intense confrontation 
between students and police in the past three days. The only 
policemen at the scene was standing on the armoured police 
personnel carrier and using the vehicle's public address system 
to repeat over and over: "We want peace". 
  Thousands of people headng towards an African National 
Congress [words indisticnt] were shouting: "We have done it. We 
have brought the government to its knees."

  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- Right-wingers have been 
acting against media covering their arrival in Mmabatho to back 
the Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] in a bid to prop up the 
government of President Lucas Mangope. They moved into 
Bophuthatswana under cover of darkness on Friday morning, with 
the apparent knowledge of the BDF. 
  An SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] aerial 
camera crew were surrounded by heavily-armed khaki-clad men when 
they landed at an airfield near the capital to refuel. 
  A camera crew from the British-based ITN news network had 
their four bulletproof vests taken from them, as well as all 
video cassettes. ITN crew member Nick Mhlahlehle said a large 
crowd of Mangope loyalists surrounded their car outside the 
University of Bophuthatswana at 9.30 AM and pulled them out. 
  STAR photographer Ken Oosterbroek was assaulted and his film 
confiscated, as was Cape Town freelance photographer Fanie 
Jacobs. 
  An AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE [AFP] news team went to an air base 
near Mmabatho where the right-wingers have set up headquarters, 
but their car was surrounded by a group of men and they were 
told to leave the area. "There were about 100 of them and as 
soon as they said that we got out of there," said AFP 
photographer Walter Dhladhla. 
  An informal meeting of journalists was held in the lobby of 
the Mmabatho Sun Hotel to devise a way of getting photographic 
coverage of the sealing off of the town by the BDF and the 5,000 
loyalists now patrolling both the capital and the nearby 
historical town of Mafikeng. During the meeting, a 
representative of the International Red Cross arrived at the 
hotel to co-ordinate activities with members of the Red Cross 
already in Mmabatho.

  [Text] The Nigerian foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, has 
left Cameroon after failing to secure a meeting with President 
Paul Biya to try to resolve the border dispute of the oil rich 
Bakassi Peninsula. In the last two days, Mr. Kingibe held talks 
in Yaounde with the Cameroonian foreign and defense ministers. 
  Before departing for Abuja, Mr. Kingibe said the two sides 
would have to sit down at some point to sort out whose territory 
Bakassi is. Cameroon's state radio later reported that 
President Biya would not be meeting the Nigeria leader, General 
Sani Abacha, until Nigerian troops had withdrawn from Bakassi.

  [Text] The Cameroonian head of state will not visit Nigeria 
as long as Nigerian troops remain on the Bakassi Peninsula, 
which is the source of the dispute between the two countries. 
This position, adopted by the Cameroonian Government, was 
clearly made known to the Nigerian delegation which visited 
Yaounde. As Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono put it, Cameroon 
expects Nigeria to make a goodwill gesture. His Nigerian 
counterpart, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, replied that there are 
various other goodwill gestures apart from troop withdrawal. 
President Paul Biya, clearly irritated by Nigeria's attitude, 
refused to meet Alhaji Kingibe during his visit to Yaounde. It 
is difficult, under these circumstances, to speak of any meeting 
whatsoever between the two heads of state. The conditions laid 
down by President Paul Biya for such a meeting is the complete 
and unconditional withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the Bakassi 
Peninsula. This is what Augustin Kouomegni, the Cameroonian 
minister in charge of communication told Raphael Mbadinga. 
  [Begin recording] [Kouomegni] The Cameroonian head of state 
has said that he is prepared to meet the Nigerian head of state 
in Maiduguri, Nigeria, if Nigeria makes a goodwill gesture by 
withdrawing its troops from the Bakassi Peninsula. If the 
Nigerians do not comply with this prerequisite, he is still 
prepared to meet the Nigerian leader in a neutral country. The 
head of state and the Cameroonian diplomacy think Cameroonians 
would find it hard to understand that the president would visit 
Nigeria as if it were canossa [a place of submission] when 
Nigerian troops have occupied Cameroon. 
  [Mbadinga] If Nigerians withdrew from Cameroonian territory 
now, what point would there be for President Biya and General 
Sani Abacha to hold a meeting? 
  [Kouomegni] The meeting would enable them to tackle all the 
border problems between Nigeria and Cameroon because we share 
borders of about 1,600 km. There are problems and disagreements 
here and there. The two heads of state could, therefore, use 
the opportunity to find lasting solutions to these border 
problems, which run from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Chad. [end

  [Text] Yaounde, 13 Mar (AFP) -- After the visit of the 
Nigerian delegation to Yaounde on 9 and 10 March, the 
Cameroonian Government today insisted on the "necessary 
withdrawal of Nigerian troops from Bakassi" before any attempt 
at solving the border conflict between it and its neighbor, it 
was learned today from official sources in Yaounde. In a 
communique broadcast on the national radio, Ferdinand Leopold 
Oyono, Cameroonian minister of foreign affairs, states that such 
a withdrawal would be "a goodwill gesture." According to the 
communique, Babagana Kingibe, his Nigerian counterpart "pointed 
out that there was a variety of goodwill gestures that could be 
envisaged." 
  Contrary to what was announced, the Nigerian foreign 
minister 
was not received by President Paul Biya during his visit to 
Cameroon. Furthermore, the proposed summit between the two heads 
of state is not mentioned because, according to informed 
sources, President Biya conditions such a meeting on the total 
and unconditional withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the Bakassi 
Peninsula. 
  According to the communique, the two delegations stressed 
"the importance assumed by the exchange of visits at heads of 
state level at this phase of dialogue, as well as the need for 
detailed preparations to enable such exchange of visits attain 
the expected fruitful results." The communique stresses "the 
need for urgent measures likely to create or increase the 
confidence between the two countries and allow for the active 
search of dialogue to this dispute.

  [Text] Brazzaville, March 11 (AFP) -- The Congolese 
government has decided to lay off 8,050 civil servants, all of 
whom are in an "irregular situation," Civil Service Minister 
Jean-Prosper Koyo has said. Koyo said on state radio late 
Thursday that more than 3,000 of those affected "held false 
qualifications", while the others were in fact "fictitious" 
employees created to enable people to obtain "five to ten 
salaries" each month. 
  Most of those dismissed were recruited under the former 
ruling party, the Congolese Labour Party, under pressure from 
the trade unions, which responded to Koyo's announcement with a 
strike threat. 
  The head of the main CSTC labour confederation, Louis 
Gondou, 
said "all this is illegal because we concluded an agreement with 
the government for the payment of January and February salaries 
to these 8,050 employeers who worked normally." "The workers 
will meet Friday to decide whether to strike against this 
measure," he added. 
  Koyo also announced that the government planned to lay off 
934 civil servants aged over 55, who should have been retired a 
year ago but were not because of "bureaucratic difficulties." 
  The planned lay-offs will enable the government to cut the 
annual pay allocation for some 80,000 civil servants from 134 
billion CFA francs (229 million dollars) to about 122 billion 
CFA francs (208 million dollars), informed sources said.

  [Text] Libreville, 11 Mar (AFP) -- Gabonese Prime Minister 
Casimir Oye-Mba today submitted his government's resignation to 
President Omar Bongo. 
  In a brief televised statement, Mr. Oye-Mba described the 
government's resignation as "natural" because "we are entering a 
new political era," referring to the results of the 5 December 
presidential elections which saw the victory of the head of 
state. 
  Under the Constitution, the government must resign after the 
swearing-in of the head of state.

  [Text] Libreville, 11 Mar (AFP) -- Gabonese Prime Minister 
Casimir Oye-Mba today submitted his government's resignation to 
President Omar Bongo. 
  Meanwhile, the National Assembly adopted a constitutional 
reform measure creating a Senate and canceling the law 
preventing a candidate who lost an election from entering the 
government for a period of 18 months after the election, it was 
learned from a parliamentary source. 
  In a brief televised statement, Mr. Oye-Mba described the 
government's resignation as "natural" because "we are entering a 
new political era," referring to the results of the 5 December 
presidential elections which saw the victory of the head of 
state. 
  Under the Constitution, the government must resign after the 
swearing-in of the head of state. 
  Also today, President Bongo made known "his intention to 
form 
a new government very quickly and to call on all qualified 
people without any political considerations." 
  In an appeal to both the majority party and the opposition, 
read by his spokesman, Jean Ovono-Essano, the head of state 
urged political leaders to come together and draw up a one-year 
"priority action program." 
  At the same time, the National Assembly, which has been 
meeting in extraordinary session for one month now, passed a 
constitutional reform bill presented by the government "to 
reflect the evolution in the political situation.' 
  Out of 120 deputies, 117 took part in the voting, with 80 
voting in favor, 36 against, and one abstaining. According to 
an opposition parliamentarian, seven opposition deputies voted 
in favor of the bill despite their parties' opposition to this 
reform. 
  In addition to creating the Senate, the reform cancels the 
measure disqualifying candidates defeated in an election from 
entering government for 18 months after the election. This 
measure particularly applied to opposition candidates in the 
December presidential elections, which resulted in the 
reelection of President Bongo and were contested by the 
opposition.

  [Text] In Gabon, Casimir Oye-Mba has been reappointed prime 
minister for the fourth time by President Omar Bongo. The 
suspense prevailing in the country lasted only about 48 hours 
after Mr. Oye-Mba recently presented his resignation and that of 
his cabinet to the head of state. His reappointment was 
expected since Mr. Oye-Mba was the chairman of the 
electioneering campaign commission of Omar Bongo, candidate for 
the December 1993 presidential elections. Thus, Mr. Oye-Mba is 
again head of the Gabonese Government. Let us listen to the 
prime minister after his reappointment: 
  [Begin Oye-Mba recording] My first impression is that of 
responsibility. I am extremely honored by President Bongo who 
has renewed his confidence in me the fourth time. This means a 
heavy responsibility on my shoulders; I have to deserve this 
confidence and serve Gabon which is in a difficult situation, 
especially concerning its development in economic sector and 
other sectors. [end recording] 
  After giving his impressions, Mr. Oye-Mba explained how he 
intends to form his new cabinet: 
  [Begin Oye-Mba recording] The head of state said he wanted 
the new cabinet to be formed as soon as possible. So, we will 
try not to waste time, but a government is not made up of only 
one person. A government is formed with other citizens and the 
political forces on the ground. This means that I will begin 
now to try to get in touch with the representatives of all the 
Gabonese political forces to put in place a cabinet capable of 
facing our country's situation and resolving the problems 
confronting Gabon. [end recording] 
  The meeting between the Gabonese prime minister and 
representatives of political parties is in response to President 
Bongo's appeal for a one-year priority program of action. The 
agenda for this meeting is expected to center on the devaluation 
of the CFA franc and its consequences on the economy and on 
Gabonese's revenues, health, employment, and training. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The Congolese National Army, which claims to be the 
military wing of the radical opposition, has threatened to 
launch an armed struggle to, as it says, reinstitute the rule of 
law and democratization in Zaire -- in fact, the former Zaire, 
which it plans to call the Democratic Republic of Congo. These 
plans were contained in a communique signed by General (Molanda 
Jean), who says that the Zairian opposition has armed men who 
are ready to militarily defend the institutional order of the 
Sovereign National Conference. 
  It will be recalled that recently Jacques Matanda, an 
Executive Committee member of the Sacred Union of the Radical 
Opposition, announced his party's intention to lead an armed 
struggle in Zaire to overthrow President Mobutu. He said at the 
time that he had fighters based in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and 
Angola.

  [Excerpts] The leader of the National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia, Mr. Charles Taylor, has laid down his arms and is 
preparing to contest in the Liberian general elections scheduled 
for 1 September. Mr. Taylor pledged to turn a new leaf as the 
peace process moved forward at a meeting held in Gbarnga with 
the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] field commander, Major General John Mark 
Inienger, and the commander of the UN Observer Mission in 
Liberia [UNOMIL], Major General Daniel Opande. He said he is 
prepared to take risks at the election and is anxious to know 
fellow contestants for Liberia's presidency. He urged other 
fighters to open a new chapter in the effort to end the Liberian 
crisis. The meeting with Mr. Charles Taylor preceded the 
induction ceremony in Monrovia of the transitional coalition 
government made up of representatives of all the warring 
factions. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Gen. Inienger has begun an inspection tour of the 
encampment where the fighters are being disarmed and demobilized.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Every step of the Liberian peace process seems to be 
a struggle. The transitional government was officially seated 
on Monday [7 March], but the inauguration of cabinet ministers 
was delayed. The deployment of the African peacekeeping forces 
to disarm the fighting factions has also run into difficulties. 
A major split in ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia] is causing serious headaches, so is 
renewed fighting in Rivercess regions, south of Buchanan, 
between the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] and Charles Taylor's 
NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces. 
  From Monrovia, (Niaty Allison) telexed this report: 
  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] is still being prevented from entering ULIMO 
and NPFL territory, five days after the seating of the 
transitional government. The chief of staff of the African 
force, General Femi Williams, said our deployment there will 
depend on how soon the problem in ULIMO is resolved and the 
buffer zones are vacated. ULIMO fighters, loyal to renegade 
General Roosevelt Johnson, are said to have cordoned off the 
Bong Mine region and are in combat readiness against ULIMO 
leader Alhaji Koromah's supporters, who are occupying areas west 
of the (Simpe) River. 
  However, in the Todee area, about 35 miles northwest of the 
capital, Monrovia, the peacekeeping force has deployed and is 
being given cooperation even though actual disarmament has not 
begun. 
  The African peacekeeping force and UN officials have been 
carrying out shuttle diplomacy aimed at bringing the two 
opposing sides in ULIMO together. The disarming of the soldiers 
of the Armed Forces of Liberia, [AFL], continues today, with 300 
soldiers handing in their guns. 
  On the political front, the Transitional Council announced 
today that they would install cabinet ministers on Monday, 14 
March. The list of appointees has not been released, and 
according to an official at State House, the list is being held 
up so as not to cause further confusion. 
  Meanwhile, thousands of people continue to stream into the 
port city of Buchanan, fleeing the war between Charles Taylor's 
NPFL and the George Bolley's Liberia Peace Council. LPC leader 
George Bolley, a former minister in the government of Samuel 
Doe, had, up until today, been the shadowy hand behind the LPC. 
Now he has come out in public. He claimed that the LPC firmly 
controls six counties, including Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, Rivercess, 
Grand Kru, Maryland, and he said, nearly all of Grand Bassa 
County, except Buchanan, which is controlled by the African 
peacekeeping forces. 
  Fleeing women, children, and the elderly, yesterday told 
stories of mass looting of warehouses by forces of the Liberia 
Peace Council.

<F P=106> [By Christophe Parayre] </F>
  [Text] Buchanan, Liberia, March 11 (AFP) -- A murderous 
attack by an armed faction has forced thousands of Liberian 
civilians to flee this week to the iron ore port of Buchanan, 
refugees and relief workers here said. 
  More than one thousand displaced people have arrived here 
daily since Sunday [6 March] for fear of further attacks, aid 
personnel in the town, 90 kilometres (56 miles) southeast of 
Monrovia, told AFP. 
  Guerrillas of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC) militia on 
Sunday launched a "brief, violent attack" on civilians in the 
Compound 2 region, 20 kilometres (13 miles) north of Buchanan, 
killing several, a refugee said. 
  "They opened fire right among the people," he said. "They 
began to throw grenades everywhere. Everybody ran. We left our 
home to go to the bush." 
  The dead included a Liberian worker for the charity Medecins 
sans Frontieres [MSF] (Doctors Without Borders), he added. 
  Available information indicated that the attacks had 
stopped, 
but this had not prevented some 7,000 people from joining 20,000 
other displaced persons already sheltered in Buchanan schools. 
  They had fled fighting between the LPC and the National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), which controls the area and 
was one of three signatories to a peace pact last year, before 
the LPC was formed in September. 
  The attack came a day before the installation of a 
transitional State Council, or collegiate presidency, and the 
official start to the disarming of Liberia's armed factions 
under the July peace accord. 
  But disarmament by troops of a multinational African 
peacekeeping force under the supervision of UN monitors was 
Thursday only a dream here, where five lorries carrying mainly 
women and children arrived in less than two hours. 
  Most of the displaced people were dressed in rags and were 
visibly exhausted, often with nothing but a small bag of 
possessions. After receiving a food card, they went to a 
makeshift reception centre where an elderly woman was handing 
out small rations of rice. 
  In the classrooms, benches and tables were pushed into a 
corner to make space for the new arrivals. Mats were laid on 
the floor for them to sleep on. 
  For the present, the relief agencies were coping, Christine 
Muller of MSF declared. 
  "It's not over," she said. "We are expecting more than 7,000 
new arrivals in the coming days."

the National Assembly and his first deputy, and the chief of 
Army staff. The operation was slated for last night at the 
mosque where the grand prayer of the Night of Power was 
scheduled to take place. 
  According to the newspaper, the conspirators included Major 
Moumouni Boureima and Mr. Wantche Oumarou Mallam, who have been 
arrested by the Niger Armed Forces chief of general staff. 
Still quoting the newspaper, ANP said several other officers 
said to be involved in the coup plot are being questioned at the 
Army Headquarters. However, no official source has confirmed or 
denied the news.

  [Excerpts] Following clashes between police and students at 
Niamey University, one student died and several others were 
wounded. For confirmation, as is appropriate in such a case, we 
sought information from a medical source. We asked the director 
of Niamey National Hospital for the facts: 
  [Begin unidentified doctor recording] What I can tell you is 
that we effectively admitted a student who was in a coma 
resulting from a head injury. He died around 0500 this morning. 
[end recording] 
  So one dead and three wounded. That is the result of the 
violent clashes that took place between students and police 
forces. At the origin of the incidents was the demand by 
students for the payment of six months of scholarship arrears. 
This morning, our reporter Sadou Moussi held a telephone 
conversation with Issa Boubacar, secretary general of the Niger 
Students Union: 
  [Begin Boubacar recording] Yesterday evening, while Niamey 
University students were exercising a constitutional right, 
namely the right to demonstrate to demand the payment of their 
scholarship arrears, the ruling power sent antiriot police 
forces to crush the demonstration. Their savage repression 
resulted in the death of one of our comrades, Tahirou Harouna, a 
first year student at the Philosophy Department. Several others 
were wounded. The incidents took place yesterday around 1700. 
[passage omitted] [end recording] 
  Our reporter Boureima Noumou Maiga also asked Niamey Prefect 
Souleimana Barry for his side of the story: 
  [Begin Barry recording] We were informed yesterday morning 
that students were blocking the bridge with burning tires. We 
know what happened last time when they burned private cars and 
people were wounded. The demonstration was not very big so we 
tried to contain the situation and to open the bridge to traffic 
to enable people living near the bridge to go about their normal 
business. It did not take long for things to be brought under 
control. The bridge was open to traffic and I believe the 
students returned to campus. As there were sporadic clashes on 
campus, the police remained there. They withdrew at around 2000. 
We were informed that one student was injured and that three 
policemen were also wounded. 
  What is surprising in all this is that there were no 
fistfights between the police and the students, according to 
what the police told us. In regard to the wounds the student 
died of, we are still awaiting the results of the autopsy and 
the ongoing investigation. If there were no fistfights, one 
wonders how a person could have been killed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Government communique issued in Niamey on 11 March; read by </F>
Moctar Diallo, minister in charge of relations with Parliament 
and government spokesman--live] 
  [Text] I have come to read this government communique to 
you. It first deals with the situation in the school sector and 
reads as follows: 
  Since early March, a latent crisis has been simmering at 
Niamey University over the modalities for the payment of 
1992-1993 scholarship arrears. In an effort to resolve that 
crisis, a meeting took place on 3 March between Education 
Ministry delegates and representatives of Niger students from 
Niamey University and foreign faculties. The true facts must be 
outlined. At that meeting, it was agreed that priority should 
be given to the payment of 1992-93 scholarship arrears totaling 
440 million CFA francs: 124 million CFA francs for Niamey 
University and 316 million for students in foreign faculties. 
An amount of 240 million was released and distributed on 3 
March. Niamey University students received 80 million while 
those in foreign universities received 160 million. Payment of 
the remaining 200 million was scheduled for this week. On 10 
March, 100 million was released and is available for 
distribution. 
  Unexpectedly, Niamey students issued an ultimatum to the 
government on 10 March at 0900 -- I repeat at 0900 -- demanding 
the payment of arrears due for the first quarter of the 1993-94 
academic year. They said payment should be made by 1400, 
failure of which, quote, the students will mobilize in order to 
come to grips definitively with the government of the Third 
Republic, unquote. To press for their demand, they erected 
barriers, as promised, across Kennedy Bridge -- near the former 
police station -- and in front of the main gate of the 
university campus. The gathering at the barrier blocked traffic 
and prevented peaceful citizens from crossing the bridge. 
  This demonstration was not only illegal. It was obviously in 
violation of the agreement reached with the students' 
representatives, namely that priority should be given to the 
payment of 1992-93 scholarship arrears. You will recall that 
the 6 and 7 January strike that resulted in the closure of the 
campus was prompted by the government's decision to primarily 
pay the scholarships for the current academic year and to 
gradually clear the arrears. Now, as you can see, the students 
are calling for the opposite of what they wanted. 
  In the face of these disturbances, the law enforcement 
agencies moved in to disperse the demonstrators, remove the 
barricades, and to allow free flow of traffic across the bridge. 
During the intervention, the students stoned the security men 
and threw Molotov cocktails at them. In response, the security 
men threw tear gas at the students. Unfortunately, during this 
law enforcement operation, five persons were wounded, including 
two security men and three students, one of whom died from his 
wounds at Niamey Hospital this morning. The deceased is Harouna 
Tahirou, a first-year student in the Department of Philosophy at 
Niamey University. He was hit in the face by a teargas 
splinter. The government deplores the incident and extends its 
deepest condolences to the bereaved family, the university, and 
partners in education. 
  Anxious to safeguard social peace and to ensure a smooth 
academic year, the government appeals to all those involved in 
the educational sector and to the entire population to remain 
calm. It reiterates its willingness to give priority to 
dialogue in the settlement of any social dispute. 
  Concerning the other report on a so-called coup d'etat, the 
11 March edition of (AL-HAVAR) newspaper carried a story on an 
abortive coup d'etat in Niger. The government informs the 
national and international community that the story is baseless. 
The Niger Army is a Republican Army, which is committed to the 
institutions that the Niger people have freely established. The 
government warns those who, through manipulation, 
misinformation, and false rumors, are attempting to destabilize 
the republican institutions, especially by undermining the 
harmony of the Niger Armed Forces at a time when their mission 
of defending territorial integrity and protecting lives and 
property constitute the essential preoccupation of the 
government of the Third Republic and its Army, to desist from 
such practices. I thank you.

  [Text] The Nigerian Government has insisted that it will 
not withdraw any troops from the Bakassi Peninsula over which it 
is involved in a border dispute with Cameroon. The Nigerian 
foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, made the statement after two 
days of talks in Yaounde with the Cameroonian foreign and 
defense ministers. He was responding to Cameroon's demand that 
Nigeria withdraw its troops before President Paul Biya meets the 
Nigerian leader, General Sani Abacha.

<F P=106> [By Randy Zormelo] </F>
  [Excerpt] Lagos, 11 March (PANA) -- French ambassador to 
Nigeria Pierre Garrigue-Guyonnaud said Friday [11 March] in 
Lagos that his country had no troops in the disputed oil-rich 
Bakassi Peninsula. "I can tell you officially and I repeat what 
was said on Tuesday eighth March by the spokesman of the French 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs that none of them is present in 
Bakassi", Garrigue-Guyonnaud said. 
  Garrigue-Guyonnaud told newsmen at a press conference that 
France had historical ties and cooperation agreements with 
Cameroon and that it was in response to a request by the 
Cameroonian Government that it had sent two helicopters and 15 
military assistants to Yaounde on what he called a "logistics 
mission." He said that the level of French assistance to 
Cameroon had not been increased since the crisis began three 
weeks ago, with a reported shoot out between Cameroonian 
gendarmes and Nigerian troops in the peninsula, a border area of 
1,000 square kilometres disputed by the two countries. 
  On the French frigate reported to have arrived in Douala to 
reinforce French presence in the peninsula, Garrigue-Guyonnaud 
said it was part of a routine visit carried out all year round 
along the Atlantic coast of Africa. He said the frigate, the 
Vendemiaire, left Douala on 6 March and is no longer in Cameroon. 
  The ambassador said another warship, the "Jacoubet, arrived 
in Douala on 7 March as part of a long-standing agreement and is 
expected to leave today. "These visits are not related to the 
present situation. A scheduled visit of the vessel took place 
in Accra a few weeks ago," he said. 
  Commenting on the five-day joint military exercises between 
France and Benin, which are to end today, he said they took 
place west of the Couffo River, near Togo and bear no relation 
whatsoever to the territorial dispute between Cameroon and 
Nigeria. Benin lies on Nigeria's western border. 
  "The men and equipment are being transported back to France 
today and tomorrow, at the end of the manoeuvres to which 
Nigeria sent two military observers," he said. The ambassador 
said France has relations dating 20 years with Nigeria despite 
its historical links with Cameroon, and for this reason, 
supported a peaceful solution to the crisis. "Our position is 
clear and has been consistent. We seek a peaceful settlement 
and we have informed the Nigerian authorities at the highest 
level," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The French Government today expressed delight at the 
resumption of dialogue between Cameroon and Nigeria over the 
disputed Bakassi Peninsula. At a news conference in Lagos the 
French ambassador to Nigeria, Pierre Garrigue-Guyonnaud, said 
his country fully supports the diplomatic efforts employed and 
would very much wish that the two countries resolve their 
dispute peacefully. Foreign news correspondent, Godfrey Odu, 
reports that the envoy denied allegations that France is 
aggravating the Bakassi dispute: 
  [Begin recording] [Odu] [Words indistinct] since the 
Nigeria-Cameroon dispute over Bakassi came to a head last month. 
Ambassador Garrigue-Guyonnaud explained that the response by 
France to Cameroon's request for assistance was part of the 
normal respect of commitment entered into between the two 
sovereign nations, and not intended prejudice to the spirit of 
peaceful settlement. He said that France has taken some 
diplomatic initiatives on its own but refused to specify. 
  [Garrigue-Guyonnaud] It is difficult to say I agree with 
you, 
but it is important and difficult to say because it should be 
confidential. But the only thing I can tell you is that we 
encourage [words indistinct], and we think that there is room 
for negotiations. 
  [Odu] Ambassador Garrigue-Guyonnaud said that in response to 
the Cameroonian request, France sent some military assistance, 
but that none of these have been deployed to the disputed 
Bakassi. [sentence as heard] The ambassador said that the level 
of French military aid to Cameroon has not increased since the 
Bakassi crisis, adding that Nigeria as well as Cameroon are both 
friends of France. NTA news took the ambassador up on charges of 
aiding and abetting the Cameroonian efforts to internationalize 
the dispute. 
  [Odu] You have provided legal assistance (?to Cameroon) 
[passage indistinct]. But defense information has it that a 
sizable number of French troops have landed in the Cameroon 
along with unspecified quantities of arms and ammunition. From 
calculations, French interests in Nigeria alone are said to far 
outstrip her business interests in all of her former African 
colonies put together. French companies are doing lucrative 
business in many spheres of the Nigerian economy. Some of the 
largest include ELF Nigeria Limited and Total in the petroleum 
sector; [name indistinct] and SCOA [West African Trading 
Company] in freighting, haulage, and trading; CFAO [West African 
French Company] in the industrial and general goods sector, as 
well as Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited, a leading car 
assembly plant. There are those in the construction industry 
such Bouygue and (Schlumbeger) in oil field services. These 
account for billions of dollars accruing annually [words 
indistinct] in foreign exchange earnings. [end recording]

denied Cameroonian claims of sinking some Nigerian boats and 
killing some Nigerian military personnel and emphasized that the 
government would remain (?open) to Nigerians on the Cameroonian

  [Text] Lagos, 11 March (PANA) -- Nigeria's former military 
ruler General Ibrahim Babangida, has called on Nigerians to give 
full support to the military administration led by Gen. Sani 
Abacha in its efforts to build a united country. 
  In a message on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr (end of the 
Ramadan) made available to journalists Friday [11 March], 
Babangida urged Nigerians not to undermine the unity of the 
country but keep to the tenets of their religion. He said in 
line with the doctrines of Ramadan, Nigerians should always 
create "an atmosphere of love for one another and develop the 
spirit of brotherhood and righteousness and service to Allah and 
the country" in order to live in peace and harmony. 
  This is the first public statement of the former military 
ruler who stepped down seven months ago after plunging the 
country into crisis over the annulment of the results of the 
elections held on 12 June 1993 in which his close friend, 
millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola claimed victory. Before 
stepping down, Babangida handed over power to a civilian interim 
government led by industrialist Ernest Shonekan who was ousted 
by Abacha in November 1993.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Nigerian military government of General Sani 
Abacha is apparently taking a tougher line with the opposition. 
Overt criticism of the government is already banned, but the 
Campaign for Democracy [CD], a leading opponent of former 
President Babangida and advocate of the implementation of the 
June 12 election results, has continued its campaigns, 
especially over the proposed national conference. Well, now, 
according to the Campaign for Democracy, a number of its 
officials have been arrested. Josephine Hazely asked our Lagos 
correspondent, Janet Anderson, who the arrested people were. 
  [Begin recording] [Anderson] The statement says that Femi 
Falana has been arrested -- he is a very prominent member of the 
Campaign for Democracy and a human rights lawyer -- along with 
two other members of the Campaign for Democracy. They are Fatai 
Jubril and Ladi Adebayo. They were both arrested in Ketu, the 
statement says, on Wednesday [9 March]. 
  [Hazely] Now, what about the Campaign's chairman? Is he also 
being sought after, I understand? 
  [Anderson] The statement says also today, some plainclothes 
policemen went to the headquarters of the Campaign for Democracy 
to ask for Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, but he is actually out of the 
country at the moment on an official visit abroad, so they 
weren't able to find him. 
  [Hazely] Did the Campaign for Democracy's statement say why 
three of their members have been arrested? 
  [Anderson] The statement suggests that the two members who 
were arrested originally on Wednesday were arrested for being in 
possession of posters and leaflets, which had captions like: A 
Dictator Cannot Give Democracy and Abacha Cannot Deliver. It 
separately says that Femi Falana was arrested today when he had 
been told that these two members of the CD were arrested, he 
went along to the police station where they were being held at 
[name indistinct] and there, he was arrested as well himself. 
  [Hazely] The authorities themselves haven't come up with any 
word yet on the arrest of these men, have they? 
  [Anderson] No, there hasn't been any official response yet, 
but the press statement only came out within the last hour. 
  [Hazely] And you don't want guess at how people will react 
to 
this, once news gets round that these men have been arrested? 
  [Anderson] I think that there will be some surprise that 
this 
has happened. This is the first time that members of the 
Campaign for Democracy or the other groups who are part of the 
Campaign for Democracy have been arrested since the new 
leadership of Gen. Sani Abacha came in. There was an incident 
earlier this year, when a particular magazine had all of its 
copies seized and the press came down very heavily on Gen. 
Abacha's government as a result of that. So I wouldn't be 
surprised to see some quite heavy headlines over the next few 
days about this. [end recording]

  [Text] In Sierra Leone, the RUF [Revolutionary United 
Front] rebels of Foday Sankoh launched an audacious attack on 
the headquarters of the 5th Battalion in the south of the 
country yesterday. Despite the Strasser government's repeated 
attempts to contain the RUF, the evidence is that the RUF threat 
is by no means over. Our Bo correspondent, Al Hassan Sillah, is 
in Freetown at the moment, where he has been monitoring events. 
He sent this report. 
  [Begin Sillah recording] Rebels of Foday Sankoh's 
Revolutionary United Front, numbering over 150, at dawn 
yesterday attacked the military headquarter town of Koribundu, 
seat of the Army's 5th Battalion, and engaged troops in what 
military sources have described as one of the fiercest battles 
fought with rebels in recent times, with the impact of its force 
said to be heard in Bo, some twenty miles away. 
  According to reports monitored from the area, the rebels, 
dressed in black overall outfits, attacked the town at about 5 
AM yesterday, and troops battled them for four hours till about 
9 o'clock in the morning. According to the SIERRA LEONE NEWS 
AGENCY in Bo, some 50 rebels were killed in the battle, while 
government troops had five of their men killed and three 
officers, including a major, critically injured. Reports also 
say that some 20 civilians were killed as the rebels launched 
rocket-propelled grenades into residential areas of the town, 
while they are also said to have abducted a number of people as 
they fled the scene of the battle. The headquarters of Koribundu 
serves as the most important military guard post in the entire 
southern region and as the battle raged yesterday, the 
authorities made swift moves to protect the rest of the region, 
particularly the headquarter town, Bo. 
  In Bo yesterday, a 10 PM-to-dawn curfew was imposed. All 
social activities and entertainment sessions banned, and several 
roadblocks to and from the township mounted. Panic-stricken 
residents were advised by the military to stay calm. This 
morning, Muslim 'Id al- Fitr prayers were held in individual 
mosques rather than the open (?durbar) grounds in Bo, apparently 
for security reasons, and there is a heavy military presence in 
the town as troops patrol Bo township in vehicles, armored cars, 
and tanks. Most people are spending their 'Id al-Fitr holiday 
indoors. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report from correspodent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The negotiators in Lusaka are subdued by the stands 
adopted by both the government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in discussions on national 
reconciliation. For over a week now, the mediator and the 
troika of observers have been trying to find a common stand 
between government proposals and UNITA's replies. Mr. Alioune 
Blondin Beye only now understands that he is going nowhere. To 
end the game of words, he therefore decided to fly today to 
Huambo and then to Luanda to listen to the voices of ultimatum. 
He was at the airport, but did not travel because the aircraft 
had a breakdown. He will therefore leave for Huambo tomorrow.

  [Excerpts] In the city of Huambo today, Dr. Jonas Malheiro 
Savimbi, president of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA], received Dr. Alioune Blondin 
Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in 
Angola. This is the second visit to Huambo by the UN 
representative in Angola. He arrived in Huambo at 0850 coming 
from Lusaka. He was accompanied by three members of the UNITA 
delegation in Lusaka -- Eugenio Ngolo Manuvakola, delegation 
chief and UNITA secretary general; Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim; 
and Ambassador Isaias Samakuva. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting between Dr. Beye and Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi 
began at 1035 and lasted more than four hours. It was attended 
by members of the presidential office and the party political 
commission, including Army General Arlindo Chenda Isaac Pena 
Ben-Ben, chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA]. No details have been revealed 
about the talks held today between the United Nations and UNITA. 
Sources close to the meeting told the Voice of Resistance of 
the Black Cockerel that Beye and Dr. Savimbi held a multifaceted 
and in-depth debate on issues connected with the peace talks in 
Lusaka. 
  Alioune Blondin Beye lunched with President Savimbi and left 
for Luanda this afternoon. The sources also said the talks were 
characterized by an atmosphere of cordiality. It is hoped Dr. 
Beye took UNITA proposals to Luanda.

  [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the 
UN secretary general in Angola, has arrived in Luanda from 
Huambo, where he held talks with Jonas Savimbi, leader of the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
  Alioune Blondin Beye held talks with President of the 
Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos at the Futungo de Belas Palace 
this afternoon. The discussions centered on the Lusaka peace 
talks. The representative of the UN secretary general in Angola 
decided to hold a private meeting with the president, because he 
was dealing with very serious and delicate issues. Not even 
interpreters were allowed at the meeting. The audience lasted 
20 minutes. 
  Alioune Blondin Beye did not want to say what he discussed 
with the president. He said he had made a contract with the 
press that the parties could not hold talks and the same time 
make statements to the press. 
  [Begin recording] [Beye, in French fading into Portuguese 
translation] We have been holding peace talks in Lusaka since 15 
November. You are also aware that this morning I stopped over 
in Huambo to meet with Dr. Savimbi. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What exactly did you talk about with 
the president of the republic? 
  [Beye] It was normal for me to assess the situation of the 
peace talks with the president of the republic. 
  [Reporter] You also visited Huambo today. What guarantees 
did you receive from the UNITA president on the peace talks? 
  [Beye] As you are aware, we made a contract with the press 
that we do not want to hold negotiations through the press, and 
therefore I cannot reveal what I talked about with Dr. Savimbi 
and the president of the republic. All I can say is that the 
meetings I had in Huambo and here, at the Futungo de Belas, were 
very useful for the peace process. [end recording]

  [Text] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye 
returned to Lusaka, the Zambian capital, today. He left the 
Angolan capital without disclosing anything substantive 
concerning the talks. As always, in his few contacts with the 
press he reminded everyone of the information blackout 
[preceding word in English], but the truth is that everybody's 
attention is turned to Lusaka at this stage. 
  Observers believe that talks may gain new impetus in the 
wake 
of UN Special Representative Blondin Beye's contacts with 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, in Luanda, and Jonas Savimbi, 
in Huambo. 
  Before leaving the Angolan capital, Blondin Beye held talks 
with Catholic Cardinal Alexandre do Nascimento, who expressed 
the hope that there will be a happy ending to the Lusaka peace 
talks.

  [Excerpts] In Angola there have been new developments in 
the peace process, with the government attempting a 
rapprochement with Washington and pledging to do its utmost to 
ensure the success of the Lusaka talks. President Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos has sent a message to US Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and received Bill Clinton's special envoy. All of 
this on the same day that the conference of the Angolan and Sao 
Tomean episcopate has again urged the warring parties to allow 
peace to return to Angola once and for all. 
  So, international pressure is growing, with the UN Security 
Council due to pronounce on the future of UNAVEM-2 [United 
Nations Verification Mission] in four days' time. Our colleague 
Mario Ribeiro has heard the views of the two sides: 
  [Ribeiro] [passage omitted] President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos 
had a meeting today with Stephen Morrisson, President Bill 
Clinton's special envoy. No statements have been forthcoming 
but we have learned that Bill Clinton's envoy expressed the 
United States' commitment to helping Angola, but only after a 
nationwide cease-fire has been signed. Angolan presidential 
spokesman Aldomiro da Conceicao told Renascenca that the 
government is committed to the success of the Lusaka talks, but 
that UNITA is not: 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] The government has made the 
concessions necessary for making it [success] possible, but, on 
the other hand, there must also be goodwill, and above all 
sincerity on our adversaries' part. [end recording] 
  [Ribeiro] In Luanda today, at the close of the General 
Assembly of the conference of the Angolan and Sao Tomean 
episcopate, the bishops urged UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] and the government to come to an 
agreement and stop fighting once and for all. From Lusaka, 
UNITA's Jorge Valentim said this was precisely his movement's 
goal: 
  [Begin Valentim recording] This appeal speaks of a big heart 
with room for all the Angolans. That is the kind of Angola we 
want, an Angola that does not discriminate against anyone. We 
want no more ostracism of the kind we endured last year. This 
is why national reconciliation must be discussed in great depth, 
and the exclusion law [as heard] must be abolished. And in 
government too, there must be no posts barred to UNITA. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The Northern Command of the Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] yesterday denied reports that the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] 
navy was carrying out joint patrols with the Zairian navy. 
According to the FALA Northern Command, the reports are not true 
and it is part of the Luanda government's dirty politics. 
  The Northern Command agreed however that UNITA was involved 
in nonoffensive military maneuvers in sea and river waters, with 
a view to protecting the strategic city of Soyo. It said the 
maneuvers will continue until the threat against the city from 
Cabinda disappears. It also said the maneuvers do not 
constitute a threat to public security. On 2 March, FALA forces 
captured a ship carrying war materiel, military uniforms, and 
fuel destined for government troops in (Chissanga). The ship, 
its cargo, and the crew continue to be detained by UNITA.

  [Text] 1. Our formidible party, the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which represents the 
oppressed masses, is celebrating the 28th anniversary of its 
creation. On this day we want to pay homage to all our heroes 
who have fallen along the way. 
  On this day we would like to remember with special 
tenderness 
and profound grief the most illustrious figures in our struggle, 
notably former UNITA Vice President Jeremias Chitunda, UNITA 
Secretary General Mango Paulo Alicerces, and Engineer Elias 
Salupeto Pena. 
  2. We would like to thank all who have supported our party 
for helping resist the most brutal and irrational offensive by 
the enemy, together with its foreign allies, in 1992 and 1993. 
  3. We want to congratulate all renewed resistance forces 
that 
have kept our glorious flag of the Black Cockerel flying, fanned 
by the winds of hope of an Angola that will not surrender. 
  4. In the wake of intense consultations between the UNITA 
Party leadership and the Lusaka-based negotiating team that came 
to Huambo, UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi is only 
expected to talk to the nation on 16 March. 
  5. After four hours of talks with Alioune Blondin Beye, 
special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, in 
the city of Huambo on 12 March, UNITA President Dr. Jonas 
Malheiro Savimbi told his colleagues in the UNITA Political 
Commission the following words with that particular conviction 
he is renowned for, quote, peace and national reconciliation 
will be achieved in Lusaka. UNITA has not fought for 28 years 
just for the sake of securing some ministries. Our UNITA Party 
will be defended against all moves aimed at its destruction. 
Our opponent of today is not any stronger than our opponent of 
yesterday, unquote. 
  [Dated] Huambo, 13 March 1994, the year of reflection on our 
African identity

  [Text] The president of Zimbabwe, Mr. Robert Mugabe, has 
appealed to Zimbabweans working in Botswana to do their best to 
help develop the country. President Mugabe was addressing the 
Zimbabweans at Zimbabwe's High Commission in Gaborone last night. 
  He told them that his government does not see them as 
traitors for leaving Zimbabwe for Botswana, but expressed the 
hope that when they ultimately return home they will be able to 
take with them their experiences to develop Zimbabwe. He also 
briefed his audience on a wide range of issues, ranging from his 
state visit to Botswana to the economic situation in Zimbabwe 
under the structural adjustment program which ends next year. 
  He said his visit to Botswana is in the spirit of 
cooperation 
between the two countries to strengthen bilateral relations and 
increase the volume of trade between them. President Mugabe 
assured the meeting that the structural adjustment program was 
yielding better benefits for the country, adding that more 
investors are now coming into the country as a result of the 
program. President Mugabe will address a press conference at 
the Sir Seretse Khama Airport shortly before leaving for home.

  [Text] President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe left Gaborone 
this afternoon after a four-day visit to Botswana. He told 
journalists before his departure that he believed creating 
additional border posts, and involving local leaders and 
villages next to the Botswana-Zimbabwe border, could curb the 
problem of illegal border crossings. President Mugabe 
attributed the problem of illegal border crossings to 
unemployment, which he said is everywhere, even in Zimbabwe. He 
also admitted that a bureaucracy problem existed at the Zimbabwe 
Immigration Department, which he said hindered Batswana 
businessmen and women to do business. He promised that 
something would be done about it. 
  Commenting on the former Ethiopian leader's status in 
Zimbabwe, Mr. Mugabe said Mr. Mengistu Haile-Mariam sought 
refuge in Zimbabwe in accordance with international law. He 
said no extradition treaty exists between the two countries and 
in any case the treaty usually deals with individuals who commit 
crimes of a nonpolitical nature.

  [Text] The president, Sir Ketumile Masire, and his 
Zimbabwean counterpart, Mr. Robert Mugabe, have commended the 
existing bilateral trade exchanges that exist between their 
countries. They also expressed the need to further enhance such 
cooperation for the benefit of the two countries. 
  In a joint communique issued at the end of President 
Mugabe's 
four-day state visit to Botswana, the two presidents called for 
more efforts to be put in exploring other areas of cooperation, 
in particular the tourism sector. They also resolved to 
undertake measures, including the increase of border posts to 
facilitate legal and unhindered movement across the common 
border, and to make joint border patrols to curb illegal border 
crossings and cattle rustling. The communique says President 
Mugabe has expressed Zimbabwe's appreciation for the generous 
gesture by Botswana in giving that country a part of her quota 
of beef exports to the European Community for 1993. 
  The heads of state commended the mediation efforts in the 
now 
subsided conflict in Lesotho by the international community, 
including Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe. On South Africa 
Sir Ketumile and Mr. Mugabe welcomed the positive steps by 
Inkatha Freedom Party Leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi to 
register provisionally for the forthcoming South African 
elections scheduled for next month. They expressed hope that 
the rightwing parties will also join the negotiation process and 
participate in the forthcoming elections. The communique says 
the two presidents called for national reconciliation and 
appealed to the international community for humanitarian 
assistance for the Angolan people. 
  On the situation in Somalia the two presidents noted with 
concern the decision by Western governments to withdraw their 
troops from Somalia, observing that the international community 
has an obligation to help the Somali people while conflict 
remained unresolved. They also discussed the conflict in Sudan, 
Liberia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina and the suffering inflicted on 
the people.

  [Text] Finance Minister Eneias Comiche has said that 
subsidies being paid to demobilized soldiers are in accordance 
with General Peace Accord stipulations. The Mozambican finance 
minister was reacting to remarks by Mozambique National 
Resistance leader Afonso Dhlakama that the [figure indistinct] 
meticals paid to a common soldier lags far behind the cost of 
living. 
  Minister Comiche noted that, in terms of the agreement, 
demobilized soldiers are to receive six months salary 
corresponding to their rank and demobilization date on the basis 
of the salary system in force in the Mozambican Government Army. 
The finance minister also noted that, in addition to the six 
months paid by the government, over the next 18 months 
demobilized soldiers will receive subsidies made available by 
the international community. 
  He added that in the plan for the reintegration of 
demobilized soldiers, the lowest figure is (?72,000) meticals 
and the highest 600,000 meticals.

<F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>
  [Text] Nairobi, March 11 (AFP) -- Somalia's warring 
factions opened talks here Friday [11 March] on the disputed 
southern port city of Kismaayo following fighting there last 
month, a senior United Nations official said. 
  Interim UN special envoy to Somalia Lansana Kouyate said 
factional leader Mohamed Farah Aidid was taking part in the 
UN-sponsored talks with several other warlords including his 
ally Omar Jess. 
  Kismaayo is claimed by Jess and Mohamed Said Hersi, known as 
General Morgan, son-in-law of ousted ruler Mohamed Siad Barre. 
Fighting between their militiamen killed at least nine people in 
the city last month. 
  Kouyate said Morgan was expected in the Kenyan capital 
Nairobi within days to join the talks. 
  "These are informal consultations and I expect them to last 
from five days to a week," Kouyate told AFP. "I am optimistic, 
not only about Kismaayo but about Somalia in general, because I 
detect a new willingness on all sides to make peace." 
  Aidid aides confirmed that "informal talks" were under way. 
But sources close to the warlord said he was still distrustful 
of the UN and would prefer to launch his own initiative to 
restore peace. 
  Kouyate declined to speculate about face-to-face talks 
between Aidid and his arch-enemy self-styled Interim President 
Ali Mahdi Mohamed. 
  Both warlords are currently in Nairobi, staying in different 
luxury hotels in the centre of the Kenyan capital. 
  Ali Mahdi arrived here this week from Cairo where he 
attended 
a meeting of leaders of 12 Somali factions opposed to Aidid. 
  Aidid has strongly condemned plans by the factions to form a 
National Salvation Committee as a first step towards setting up 
a government by the end of this month, when US troops are 
scheduled to complete their pullout from Somalia. 
  Ali Mahdi was not taking part in the Kismaayo talks because 
he has no forces in the city, Kouyate said. 
  Kouyate dismissed predictions that civil war will again 
engulf Somalia after the US withdrawal. 
  "The general situation has improved," he said. 
  "Even the upsurge in banditry is a positive sign, because it 
shows two things. Firstly, the bandits realise that there will 
be less money around after the Americans leave, and secondly 
even they know that the political signals point towards a 
possible settlement, so they are looting while they still can." 
  Aid agencies have borne the brunt of a wave of attacks this 
year presumed to be the work of bandits.

problems. The chairman concluded by saying: Unity, justice, 
progress and equality.

  [Text] A faction leader in Somalia, General Mohamed Hersi, 
generally known as General Morgan, was scheduled to arrive in 
Nairobi today to prepare for a meeting of Somali factions. The 
meeting will discuss the troubled Kismaayo region. 
  The port of Kismaayo is contested by two warlords, General 
Mohamed Hersi and Colonel Omar Jays, the main ally of south 
Mogadishu's strongman, General Mohamed Farah Aidid. Morgan is 
the son-in-law of deposed Mohamed Siad Barre. 
  The meeting comes amid fears that the departure at the end 
of 
this month of United States and other peacekeeping troops from 
Somalia will lead to renewed civil war, with Kismaayo as one of 
the main danger zones. 
  In a related development, efforts by KTN to find out the 
fate 
of a Kenyan attached to the UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM], 
John Wanjohi, who was kidnapped in Mogadishu, were fruitless. 
Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they had 
unsuccessfully tried to get information from the UNOSOM office. 
Wanjohi and a New Zealander, Wayne Hargreaves, were reportedly 
seized from their vehicles in Mogadishu yesterday.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 11 March -- The vice president and 
minister for planning and national development, Professor George 
Saitoti, this morning released the much-awaited Kenya population 
census for 1989. Prof. Saitoti told the press at the Treasury 
Building that volume one of the census which was launched 
contains data by district at sublocation level. It also 
describes population by sex and age, by sex and education, by 
sex age and literacy and by tribe. 
  The vice president allayed some speculation that the 
government had anything to hide on the census figures. He 
asserted that the truth is that the govenrment was concerned 
that in a number of areas, wananchi [citizens] reported that 
they were not reached at all by census enumerators. However, he 
reiterated, whereas the national average for undercount was 6.3 
percent for some districts, the undercount was more significant, 
comparing favorably [as heard] with other censuses in the world. 
He cited the U.S. 1990 mail census with an undercount of 15 
percent recorded. 
  According to the report recorded as per August 1989, the 
population figure stood at 21,443,636 comprised of 10,628,368 
males and 10,815,268 famales. The Rift Valley Province leads 
with 4,981,613, followed by Eastern 3,768,677, Nyanza 3,507,162, 
Central 3,116,703, Western 2,544,329, Coast 1,829,191, Nairobi 
1,324,570 and Northeastern Province with 371,391. [passage

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali and the 
defense minister, Mr. Aftab Shaban Mirani, flew into Mogadishu 
from Nairobi today to celebrate 'Id al-Fitr [Muslim festival] 
with Pakistani troops in Somalia. Commander of Pakistan's 
contingent Brigadier (Soleh Dabbaf) and other UN officers 
greeted the Pakistani leaders at the airport. Later, they were 
flown by a helicopter to the Pakistani brigade headquarters 
situated at the Mogadishu University campus. PTV correspondent 
Sarvar Munir Rao says Mogadishu gives the look of a ghost city 
with devastation all around. At the brigade headquarters, Brig. 
(Soleh Dabbaf) gave a detailed briefing regarding deployment of 
Pakistan troops and their area of responsibility. He said 
Pakistan's soldiers are performing their duties with zeal and 
enthusiasm in an area which is not only the largest but also 
difficult and challenging. In the evening, the foreign minister 
and defense minister will visit the newly established Pakistani 
UN hospital and meet the UN force commander, Lieutenant General 
(Abu Sama bin-Bakr).

  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- Three black people were 
were shot dead by white men in Mafikeng, Bophuthatswana on 
Friday [11 March], witnesses said. The three bodies were found 
in Mafikeng's Main Street on Friday afternoon following days of 
bloody conflict in Bophuthatswana. 
  The two men and a woman, with half her face shot away, lay 
in 
the street near the Mafikeng Town Square for at least three 
hours and were still there at 6pm. 
  Heavily armed white rightwing insurgents, who entered the 
homeland early on Friday with the aim of assisting 
Bophuthatswana security forces in quelling the popoular 
uprising, finally left the Bophuthatswana Defence Force airfield 
at about 4.30pm. 
  The rightwing action backfired badly on them -- during the 
course of the day at least three rightwingers were shot dead, 
and five were wounded by Bophuthatswana soldiers. 
  Shops inside the flashpoint Mega City shopping complex were 
set alight on Friday afternon following more than 24 hours of 
running battles between looters and people responsible for 
keeping them at bay. 
  A vacant lot behind the complex, adjacent to the 
Bophuthatswana government buildings, has been used as a site for 
burning garbage and tyres.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- About 400 vehicles, mostly 
pick-up trucks and filled with right wing insurgents, left their 
makeshift headquarters in Bophuthatswana on Friday afternoon 
after day-long clashes with Bophuthatswana Security Forces and 
residents. The khaki clad and heavily armed rightists had camped 
at the Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] air strip for most of 
the day. 
  Shortly before 4.30pm, there were up to 400 vehicles filled 
with the right wingers at the air strip and they finally formed 
a long convoy heading towards the South African border and the 
Western Transvaal. The rightists were all gone by shrtly before 
6pm, according to reports. 
  The rightists had made it difficult for journalists covering 
the crisis in Bophuthatswana to interview them -- or even 
approach the BDF air strip. It was not immediately clear what 
prompted the final departure -- but there was speculation in 
Mmabatho the retreat was prompted by the arrival of SA Defence 
Force troops whose task, in conjunction with the Bophuthatswana 
Defence Force, is to restore order in the strife-torn territory. 
  At least three of the invadors were killed execution style 
after being ambushed by Bophuhatswana security force members.

were fired, and he also suspected the rightists had suffered 
more casualties. 
  The situation was so bad that the rightists had to ask for 
an 
SA Defence Force [SADF] escort out of town. 
  "The SADF said they would help get them out as long as they 
promised not to return. An officer told them `if there is 
contact we will take care of it. If you people shoot we will 
leave you in your own,'" Oosterbroek said. 
  The rightists left town heading towards the border and were 
by shortly after 8pm said to be regrouping for a revenge attack 
against the BDF -- but this could not be immediately 
independently confirmed.

  [Text] Another right-winger believed to an AWB [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] members has been shot dead in 
Bophuthatswana. The commander of the SADF [South African Defense 
Force] in the homeland, Brigadier Johan Coetzee, said in 
Mmabatho that it happened last night while the defense force was 
escorting right-wingers out of Bophuthatswana. They were 
ambushed, and shots were fired at the right-wingers and the 
defense force. Four right-wingers were wounded by the 
attackers, and one of them died later. There were no casualties 
among the defense force troops. 
  Our Durban staff reports that one for three right-wingers 
shot dead by a member of the Bophuthatswana security forces 
yesterday was the AWB commander in Natal, General Nick Fourie. 
The other two were apparently also senior AWB members.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Information Service of </F>
Bophuthatswana on 12 March on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] The Bophuthatswana authorities announced today that 
murder charges will brought against those allegedly responsible 
for the execution of two members of the AWB [Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement], after a 
confrontation with the Bophuthatswana Security Forces in 
Mmabatho on Friday [11 March]. Major-General Jack Turner, chief 
of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force (BDF), said a full-scale 
investigation had been launched to identify the killers and to 
bring them to justice. If necessary, the investigation would be 
broadened to include independent participation. 
  General Turner said: "We are filled with revulsion at this 
horrific incident. This sort of summary and barbaric action 
forms no part of the protective and peacekeeping role for which 
the security forces of this country are responsible and we are 
duty- bound to bring the culprits to book. We are now studying 
video film material taken at the scene by TV media personnel 
prior to the shooting incident, to see if this can materially 
assist us with the investigation and to identify the 
perpetrators. We are also appealing to those who have 
information which could assist us with the investigation to come 
forward as soon as possible. Their information will be treated 
in the strictest confidence. We would like this murder 
investigation to be as transparent and open as the law will 
permit. I can give the categoric assurance that once we have 
ascertained all the relevant facts, a murder docket will be 
opened by the Bophuthatswana Police and the alleged killer or 
killers will be brought before the courts as soon as possible." 
  General Turner also announced that strong disciplinary 
action, including legal prosecutions if warranted, would be 
taken against those members of the security forces who had 
allegedly been involved in the harassment and assault of members 
of the media, while they were carrying out their professional 
duties. General Turner said no stone would be left unturned in 
identifying the culprits. Members of the media who wished to 
provide information which could assist with this inquiry, as 
well the investigation into the shooting incident involving the 
AWB members, could contact him on: tel: (0140) 861828 fax: 
(0140) 863419. 
  With reference to the presence and deployment of AWB 
contingents inside Bophuthatswana this week, General Turner 
emphasised that these AWB members had been operating inside the 
country without the consent of the Bophuthatswana authorities, 
and had not consulted or liaised with the security forces as to 
their entry into the country. General Turner said that late on 
Thursday evening, he had been alerted to the fact that 
heavily-armed AWB members in bakkies [pickup trucks] had 
assembled at Rooigrond, about 20kms from Mmabatho, under the 
command of AWB leader, Eugene Terreblance. He had instructed 
Colonel Manne Botes of the BDF to proceed to Rooigrond to tell 
Mr Terreblance that his forces were not welcome in 
Bophuthatswana and to immediately withdraw his men, as well as 
those already in Mmabatho itself. Mr Terreblance's reaction was 
that he "did not take orders from colonels." 
  "Subsequently, Mr Terreblance was accompanied to Mmabatho 
where I personally made it clear to him that he and his men 
should leave the country immediately as their presence here 
would create friction and pose problems for us. In addition, I 
told him that our security forces were dead set against the 
presence of the AWB in Bophuthatswana. Mr Terreblance was 
visibly upset and claimed that his offer of assistance was being 
spurned, but after lengthy discussions, he agreed to leave with 
his men. Regrettably, he reneged on this undertaking, and we 
later received several reports of incidents in which AWB members 
were involved in random shooting forays, as well as harassing 
troops and making racial insults. All this had the effect of 
increasing tensions and stirring up deep emotions among the 
local public and the security forces." 
  General Turner added that on Friday, while BDF troops were 
on 
parade at the Molopo military base in Mmabatho, the AWB had 
deployed in the veld outside the base and had opened fire on his 
men. Fortunately, no-one had been hurt. The overall situation 
had also been aggravated by the fact that unidentified elements 
in RSA [Republic of South Africa]-registered cars had been 
cruising the streets of Mmabatho/Mafikeng, firing at random on 
civilian homes and properties with automatic weapons. 
  General Turner said that once agreement had been reached to 
allow the SADF [South African Defense Force], the BDF and the 
Bophuthatswana Police to conduct joint security operations 
within Bophuthatswana, these forces had worked throughout the 
night to clear the area of unruly elements and to restore 
stability. 
  General Turner said he also wished to clarify the position 
regarding the presence of Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner 
National Front] (AVF) forces inside Bophuthatswana. He said 
General Constand Viljoen had offered the assistance of 
Volksfront troops under the command of experienced leadership, 
to protect public buildings and strategic installations. The 
Bophuthatswana Security Council initially accepted this offer, 
with the strict qualification that the AVF forces be assembled 
at a specified gathering point, to be used only in this 
protective role, should the need arise. A force of about 1,000 
AVF men were duly assembled on Friday, under strict supervision, 
at a military air base about 20 kms outside Mmabatho. They 
proceeded directly to the base and were not involved in any of 
Friday's security force operations. At about 5PM on Friday, 
after consultation with General Viljoen, the AVF was requested 
by the Bophuthatswana authorities to depart and their convoy was 
escorted from Bophuthatswana under the guidance of the BDF. 
  General Turner said he wished to express his sincere 
sympathies to the families and relatives of all those who had 
been killed or injured during the unrest in Bophuthatswana in 
the past few days.

<F P=106> [Report by E. H. Kemp] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The chairman of the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], Mr Justice Johann 
Kriegler, flew to Mmabatho on Friday [11 March] night to ensure 
that the Bophuthatswana government will co-operate fully with 
the IEC. This follows two hours of talks between President F W 
de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on the 
Bophuthatswana crisis. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler will meet President Lucas Mangope to 
obtain his assurance that free and fair elections will be 
allowed in the territory. He will submit a report which will be 
discussed by the management committee of the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] on Saturday. 
  Mr Mandela, flanked by ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa 
and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo, told journalists Mr 
Mangope's statement on Friday in which he said he would 
recommend to the Bophuthatswana parliament that the homeland 
participate in the April election, was "inadequate". He said the 
Transitional Executive Council had laid down four conditions 
with which Bophuthatswana had to comply in order to normalise 
the situation. 
  Besides committing itself to free and fair elections and 
co-operating with the IEC, the TEC's resolution also demanded 
that Mmabatho remove all restrictions on free political activity 
and co-operate fully with the TEC regarding its reincorporation 
into South Africa. 
  Asked whether Mr Mangope had effectively been restored to 
power, the ANC president said information from both the South 
African Defence Force [SADF] and the commander of the 
Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] indicated that Mr Mangope had 
"lost the loyalty and control over the security forces. 
  "He has also lost control over the civil service and the 
masses in Bophuthatswana. There is no government in 
Bophuthatswana." 
  Both Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk said it was essential that 
there should be full co-operation between the South African 
Government and the TEC on stabilising the situation in 
Bophuthatswana. 
  Mr de Klerk said the security situation had been brought 
under control by the SADF, with the full co-operation of the BDF. 
  He said members of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement] had left the territory and a 
group rallied by Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] 
leader Gen Constand Viljoen was also in the process of leaving. 
  Mr de Klerk said in terms of the TEC act, the governments of 
each of the independent states would remain in office until the 
election. referring to Bophuthatswana, he said: "In less than 
two months, that government will stop governing. It will then be 
replaced by a new negotiated system. This is the last chapter of 
an old imperfect system." 
  He denied any agreement between himself and Mr Mandela that 
Mr Mangope should be removed from office. Mr de Klerk said the 
objective of Friday's negotiations was not to restore Mr Mangope 
to power "on the same basis as he held power yesterday". 
  "His statement today has changed that. He is now committed 
to 
participating in the election." 
  Mr de Klerk said he believed Gen Viljoen had tried to "play 
a 
constructive role to prevent an escalation of the violence and 
restore law and order".

  [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] Chief Justice Johan Kriegler, who met 
Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope in the early hours of 
Saturday [12 March], had failed to obtain the cooperation of the 
homeland leader with regard to the April election, President F W 
de Klerk said. 
  "The government accordingly believes that very firm action 
is 
now required to ensure stability within Bophuthatswana and to 
ensure that free and fair elections will take place throughout 
the territory," Mr de Klerk said in a statement to SAPA. 
  An earlier statement released by the IEC on Saturday made no 
reference to the failure to obtain President Mangope's 
cooperation in regard to the election. 
  "As indicated yesterday, Judge Johan Kriegler, the chairman 
of the Independent Electoral Commission, at the request of the 
government, visited President Mangope as a follow up to the 
announcement made earlier by President Mangope with regard to 
his participation in the forthcoming election," said President 
de Klerk's statement. "The purpose of judge Kriegler's visit 
was to ensure the full cooperation of President Mangope with 
regard to the election and all other aspects related to the 
electoral and constitutional process in Bophuthatswana. I have 
now been informed that the assurances that were sought by the 
IEC could not be obtained. 
  "The government accordingly believes that very firm action 
is 
now required to ensure stability within Bophuthatswana and to 
ensure that free and fair elections will take place throughout 
the territory. I have consequently instructed Minister Roelf 
Meyer, who is attending this (Saturday) morning's meeting of the 
management committee of the TEC [Transitional Executive 
Council], to obtain the cooperation of the TEC for all steps 
which might reasonably be necessary to ensure this. Minister 
Meyer will be making certain specific proposals on behalf of the 
government in this regard." 
  The earlier IEC statement said that during the meeting 
between Mr Mangope and the commission "full and cordial 
discussions took place regarding President Mangope's announced 
recommendation (to take part in the April election)". 
  The IEC statement recalled that Mr Mangope had on Friday 
"issued a statement relating to a recommendation he intended 
making to the Bophuthatswana Parliament concerning the upcoming 
South African elections. Pursuant thereto and in view of the 
unrest that had broken out in Bophuthatswana, the IEC resolved 
to communicate urgently with President Mangope and also with the 
South African Government and the TEC. Thereafter, at the joint 
request of President de Klerk and Mr Mandela, Judge Kriegler and 
Advocate (Dikgang) Moseneke, chairman and vice-chairman of the 
IEC, met urgently with President Mangope in the early hours of 
this morning... 
  "The IEC representatives were also requested by President 
Mangope to convey to Messers de Klerk and Mandela his concerns 
about the violence and consequent loss of life, damage to 
property and 'politically instigated intimidation' in his 
country. The IEC has reported accordingly to Messers Roelf 
Meyer and Cyril Ramaphosa on behalf of their principals."

<F P=106> [Interview with Independent Electoral Commission Chairman </F>
Justice Johan Kriegler and Vice Chairman Dikgang Moseneke by 
presenter Leslie Mashokwe in the "Newsline" program; place and 
date not indicated -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] I am joined here by the chairman and the 
vice chairman of the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], 
Justice Kriegler and Advocate Dikgang Moseneke. Good evening 
gentlemen, and welcome. 
  [Kriegler] Good evening. 
  [Moseneke] Good evening. 
  [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, let me start with you. Free 
political activity -- is that going to be going on in 
Bophuthatswana now? 
  [Kriegler] Most certainly, that is one of the priorities at 
this stage. Priority one is to get law and order and ordinary 
civil society going as soon as possible. But as the same time 
electioneering, free political activity is absolutely 
imperative. We have already put all of our plans in motion. The 
IEC will be visibly present in Bophuthatswana, or the 
ex-Bophuthatswana and the various composite sectors thereof 
within the next two days. 
  [Mashokwe] You are presently in Mmabatho, what about the 
other areas? Seemingly concentration is here now and the other 
areas are not well attended, like in Itsoseng, for instance, 
where we were yesterday? 
  [Kriegler] Now Leslie, I made the point, maybe it was not 
picked up. It is our duty to see that the election as a 
reality, as a gateway to the future, is visible in all of the 
parts of the former Bophuthatswana, and we will see that it is 
done within the next few days. 
  [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, we would want you to explain 
this to us: it would appear there is a party called the 
North-West Democratic Christian Party, something like that, 
which we are informed is going to be led by President Mangope. 
What is the story there, was this party registered before. Are 
we seeing a new leeway being given to President Mangope, or 
ex-president Mangope to come on board here? 
  [Moseneke] Leslie, the North-West Party was registered in 
time together with all the other parties who were registered, 
and duly submitted a list within the time that lists had to be 
submitted. It is quite well known now that we were approached 
with an application to amend the name of the party to be 
North-West Christian Democratic Party and the photo of the 
leader was also changed to be the photo of ex-president Mangope. 
So clearly that is the vehicle that he is likely to use and he 
is entitled to if he wants to, to run elections under the name, 
North-West Christian Democratic Party. 
  [Mashokwe] Are we talking here of a party that is going to 
be 
running for national and regional offices. Do you remember? 
  [Moseneke] Come again, will you repeat that please? 
  [Mashokwe] Is the North-West Christian Democratic Party 
going 
to be contesting elections, regionally and nationally? 
  [Moseneke] No the registration is limited to the province of 
north-west, so that is where they would contest the elections, 
and not nationally. 
  [Mashokwe] Talk to me about the preparations, it would 
appear 
even in South Africa itself preparations are not well, at an 
advanced stage. Are you going to be able to distribute your 
resources in the north-west area, which was not within the plans 
I would imagine? 
  [Moseneke] Let me start with the first remark. Preparations 
are well underway, and we are working as hard as we can to make 
sure that the whole country is ready for elections on the 26th, 
27th and 28th. And in Bophuthatswana obviously the start there 
is much -- is late, and we are sending, as Judge Kriegler said, 
a special SWAT team whose function would be to be bring 
Bophuthatswana up to the same speed as the rest of the country. 
  [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, I would like you to explain to us 
exactly how visible these people are going to be here, come 
tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? 
  [Kriegler] First of all our monitors will be in 
Bophuthatswana by not later then Tuesday. We will have 
established offices in Bophuthatswana by not later then midweek, 
that is election administration, voter education, and our 
ordinary monitoring teams will be there from not later then the 
middle of this week. It is a special effort that is being made. 
Our program for the access of political parties will be 
particularly stressed in Bophuthatswana, and there is no reason 
at all to doubt that the citizens of the north-west will be as 
well able as the rest of the citizens of this country to make 
their choice freely and fairly at efficiently administered 
voting stations on the 26th, 27th, and 28th of April this year. 
  [Mashokwe] Already there is concern about the fact that the 
National Peacekeeping Force will be overextended come the 26th, 
27th, and 28th. Are you going to have bodies and men who will 
then be deployed in this region? 
  [Kriegler] There is no reason to link the National 
Peacekeeping Force to the elections. The ordinary agencies of 
law and order in the country, in collaboration with the IEC will 
be in a position to ensure that the electorate can exercise 
their right to choose their own future. 
  [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, if you could come in here. 
We talk about a free and fair election that is going to be 
exercised in Bophuthatswana, yet we saw the might of the SADF 
[South African Defense Force], ISD [Internal Stability 
Division], SAP [South African Police] and everybody else in this 
area -- are they going to be forcing the South African way of 
thinking, or way of looking and demanding things as opposed to 
allowing people to choose and decide whether they want to be 
free and partake in these elections? 
  [Moseneke] Leslie, you know that they are there, present 
now, 
for a very specific and limited purpose -- that is, to restore 
law and order, and to ensure that normal services are available 
to the citizens of Bophuthatswana, indeed who are South Africans 
citizens. We perhaps should start talking about South African 
citizens. Having said that, we will be monitoring to make sure 
that the presence of the army, which normally would be 
inconsistent with free and fair elections, does not result in 
that. We will have to make sure that they limit themselves to 
the normal law and order functions, which will not in any way 
impede free electioneering by all parties -- the normal 
functioning, for instance, of voter education programs, and all 
other preparations that we need. An example that comes to mind 
would be establishing voting stations, and I've no doubt that 
the security forces would have little or nothing to do with that 
sort of function. So, in short, they are there for a limited 
purpose to restore law and order, and to protect the rights of 
our citizens there present, but not to stand in the way of 
conducting a free and fair election. 
  [Mashokwe] What about President Mangope's party, is it also 
going to be given the kind of leeway, freedom to run amock here 
and hold rallies? 
  [Moseneke] Every party duly registered would be entitled to 
conduct rallies, and Mr. Mangope's party is a party so 
registered, and they too should be allowed the opportunity to 
canvass, and the opportunity to fight elections like any other 
party which would be contesting elections in the north west 
region. 
  [Mashokwe] We seem to hear, Judge Kriegler, your colleague 
there, Advocate Moseneke, talking about: we will made sure that 
people get free and fair elections, we will do this and that. 
How visibly are we going to see the IEC -- what are we talking 
about when we say we will make sure that the defense force 
doesn't get involved in this -- who are we and what are we 
talking about here? 
  [Kriegler] Leslie, let's get one thing clear. An election is 
about people and political parties. An election will succeed or 
fail because the political parties and their supporters play the 
game. We are the referee. If the players want to make a fight 
of it, we will have to be tough about it. We have the muscle, 
we have the necessary legislative power to prosecute people, to 
ban parties from participation, to scrap their votes in any area 
where they don't make it possible for others to play. We will 
not hesitate to do that. But, we will also at the same time, 
particularly in areas such as the ex-Bophuthatswana, be 
singularly alert to ensure that the remnants of an earlier 
regime are not permitted to pervert the political process; nor 
will we permit the abnormal situation where there are military 
forces there at the moment to reduce the unrest and to bring the 
country back to sensible normal operations -- we will not allow 
those forces unreasonably to interfere with the right of all 
political parties to put their point of view. And I may say, 
the real point is not to allow the parties to put their point of 
view, but to allow the people who have got to make a choice to 
hear all of the choices that are available so that they can make 
an intelligent choice come the election. 
  [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, your last word on -- we have 
like 30 seconds left. We know that Bophuthatswana has been 
independent. A new administration is in place and the laws of 
this country are still in place anyway. The IEC has legally no 
right to be exercising its authority here? 
  [Moseneke] Well, IEC clearly has a right to exercise 
authority in Bophuthatswana. You need to look at the electoral 
act, you'll see that the country is defined to include 
Bophuthatswana, so we are acting lawfully. Let me just very 
quickly say to you, who are we? We are the monitoring 
department, we are the many monitors that you'll see in 
T-shirts, in our cars with our logos and our flags. You'll see 
pamphlets, you'll see offices were people can go. That is what 
we are, that's the IEC. You'll find it there present in all the 
regions of Bophuthatswana. 
  [Mashokwe] Thank you, Advocate Moseneke, Judge Kriegler. 
Thanks for talking to us. That was "Newsline" from Mmabatho, 
and I may just mention that the pictures of President Mangope 
have been removed from this hotel where we are, and the 
conference room has been changed from Manyane Conference Room to 
Conference Room only. That was Leslie Mashokwe from Mmabatho, 
and from the team here, goodnight.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bophuthatswana President Lucas </F>
Mangope by SABC reporter Danie Hefers on 12 March; place not 
given--recorded; interview conducted in English] 
  [Excerpt] [Hefers] Mr. President, firstly I have to ask 
you: Who is in charge of your country at the moment? 
  [Mangope] Well, we are undoubtedly in charge of our country. 
When I say we, I mean my government. 
  [Hefers] But still we have the SA [South African] Defense 
Force in the streets of Mmabatho and Mafikeng right at this 
moment? 
  [Mangope] Well, as the result of recent happenings, we have 
an agreement with the South African Government in terms of which 
the South African Defense Force, which is in the country, as you 
say, but they have not taken over -- they are there to help, and 
that is just that? 
  [Hefers] And are you happy with that situation? 
  [Mangope] Well, so far, I don't see anything wrong with it. 
  [Hefers] Do you think that the presence of the SA Defense 
Force has played a role in stabilizing the situation? 
  [Mangope] Well I think that has to be put in perspective. My 
own defense force was very, very, very instrumental, together 
with the police, that section that has not insurrected; they are 
very much in charge of the situation, and I think they did a 
very a [word indistinct] to do to restore in as much as it was 
within their power to do so. 
  [Hefers] Mr. President, what is the feedback at the moment 
that you are getting from your people in Mmabatho -- I mean your 
generals, your cabinet ministers, and so on -- about the 
situation? 
  [Mangope] The situation is that there has been, I think in 
the true character of communism, an operation as we have seen it 
in Eastern Europe, in Russia; this has been typical communism, 
and a chance to overthrow a legitimate government. And I think 
I must really pay special tribute to my defense force, to my 
police, to my security people, and even to my colleagues in the 
government for the manner in which they had faced this upheaval, 
which undoubtedly was caused by the African National Congress 
[ANC], the Communist Party, and perhaps to the littlest extent 
the National Party. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bophuthatswana President Lucas </F>
Mangope by SABC correspondent Danie Hefers on 12 March; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope says he is 
still in control of his country. In an exclusive interview with 
TV news reporter Danie Hefers this afternoon, he blamed his 
opponents for the violence in Bophuthatswana. He also denied 
rumors that he was in hiding. President Mangope told Danie 
Hefers that a final decision on participating in the election 
stil had to be made. 
  [Mangope] I want to emphasize that it will be Parliament in 
its wisdom that will decide whether to take part in these 
elections or not, and Parliament will have also, of course, to 
decide on what are the logical consequences of a decision to 
take part in those elections. 
  [Hefers] Do you still see a future for the Freedom Alliance 
after all that's happened now? 
  [Mangope] I think because of what has happened the Freedom 
Alliance should be even stronger, because I think we are 
fighting forces, for want of a better description, forces that 
are there really to bring about anarchy, to intimidate, to bring 
the true character of communism, to make the future bleak for 
everybody. 
  [Hefers] Mr. President, a lot of damage have been caused by 
the violence this past week. Who's going to pay for all this? 
  [Mangope] I think the price is going to be high. There's no 
doubt about that. I think my people are going to suffer as a 
result of what has happened. Now you say: Who is going to pay 
for this? I think the children of my people are going to pay 
for this, in that schools have been burned down, in that 
shopping facilities have been burned down, in that facilities 
that are scarce, facilities that we don't readily find in 
Africa, have been destroyed. And I say to the shame of the 
African National Congress [ANC], their leaders, the Communist 
Party, and even, as I said, the Nationalist Party, my people are 
going to suffer -- that unfortunately it will be too late, it 
will be too late unfortunately. But there is no doubt that they 
are going to suffer. 
  [Hefers] Mr. President, I've been in the country since 
Monday; I've been through all the violence. I've spoken to 
people. I heard people shouting, asking for your head. Is 
there blood on your hands after all the violence this past week? 
  [Mangope] I have no feelings of animosity to anybody, but I 
want also to emphasize that I have no fear, whatsoever. I know 
that what I have done has been right, I have said to my people, 
I have slaved for them, I have established here sites of 
developments, that is not readily come by, as I say, in most 
African countries. I have no regret for what I've done.

  [Text] Pretoria March 13 SAPA -- SA Foreign Affairs 
Minister Pik Botha told Bophuthatswana leader Lucas Mangope 
Saturday [12 March] night that his presidency was no longer 
recognised by the South African Government. 
  Mr Botha, accompanied by senior African National Congress 
negotiator and Transitional Executive Council (TEC) member Mac 
Maharaj, told Mr Mangope he could not continue as head of the 
Bophuthatswana government. 
  In a statement sent to SAPA early Sunday morning, Mr Botha 
said the SA Ambassador to the homeland, Prof Tjaart van der 
Walt, had as an interim measure been placed in charged of the 
administration of the territory. This would be until the SA 
Government and the TEC had agreed on "an appropriate form of 
government" and until elections had led to new government 
structures being established. 
  Referring to the number of wounded and killed in the 
homeland 
this week and the looting which has taken place, Mr Botha said 
it was clear Mr Mangope was no longer in control. The situation 
was in danger of deteriorating into anarchy and the lives and 
property of South African citizens were threatened. 
  "The time has now arrived to take steps to ensure law and 
order as well as the free and peaceful participation of the 
people of Bophuthatswana in the election process," he said. 
  Accompanied by SA Defence Force Chief Gen George Meiring, Mr 
Maharaj and National Party and TEC representative S.S. van der 
Merwe, Mr Botha had in this light "personally informed President 
Mangope...that his presidency was no longer recognised by the SA 
Government and the TEC, and that in the circumstances he could 
not continue as head of the government of Bophuthatswana." 
  SA and Bop security forces would continue to jointly 
maintain 
law and order, said Mr Botha. Bop civil servants, including 
those recently dismissed, should be assured their pensions, 
salaries and positions would not be detrimentally affected. 
  The historic move to dismiss Mr Mangope follows an earlier 
call by the African National Congress for the TEC to replace the 
homeland leader with an interim SA Government/TEC Administration. 
  It also follows on an appearance by the Bop leader on 
National Television on Saturday, during which he said he and his 
government were "undoubtedly" still in charge of the homeland.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Members of the management 
committee of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] flew to 
Bophuthatswana on Saturday [12 March] afternoon to decide on the 
fate of homeland President Lucas Mangope. The African National 
Congress [ANC] earlier asked an emergency meeting of the 
management committee to replace Mr Mangope with a new 
administration under the direction of the TEC and the South 
African Government. A detailed proposal will be considered by 
the TEC on Tuesday. 
  The management committee, after a five hour-meeting, stopped 
short of calling for Mr Mangope's replacement. It decided to 
send to Mmabatho a team consisting of among others ANC Secretary 
General Cyril Ramaphosa and Constitutional Development Minister 
Roelf Meyer. But the TEC will be hard pushed to resist an ANC 
call for Mr Mangope to go. 
  The TEC team visiting Mmabatho was briefed to assess the 
overall security situation, to consider practical steps to 
ensure services were restored and to "decide on the spot on the 
action to be taken in the light of President Lucas Mangope's 
latest statement in which he has not responded in direct terms 
to the call for free and fair elections and transitional steps 
to be taken for the re- incorporation of Bophuthatswana into 
South Africa". 
  Mr Mangope met Independent Electoral Commission chairman Mr 
Justice Johann Kriegler on Friday night, but failed to give 
guarantees on free political activity. 
  At a press conference after the management committee met, Mr 
Ramaphosa said the management committee felt that Mr Mangope 
needed to go much further in complying with a TEC resolution 
last week to allow free and fair political activity. He said it 
needed to be agreed that the TEC and the South African 
Government should agree that the situation had deteriorated to 
the extent that Mr Mangope could no longer exercise effective 
control. He said action needed to be taken to replace Mr 
Mangope with an administration set up by the TEC and the South 
African Government. 
  Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Meyer met behind closed doors during the 
management committee meeting. Mr Meyer went to the management 
committee with specific proposals from President F W de Klerk 
aimed at returning stability to the region and at ensuring free 
and fair political activity. 
  The TEC took a resolution last week giving Mr Mangope a week 
in which to ensure free political activity in the homeland, 
failing which he would face a range of punitive financial and 
diplomatic sanctions designed to ensure compliance. 
  The management committee meeting took place amid ANC 
unhappiness with the manner in which Mr Mangope appeared to have 
salvaged his position as head of state and then compound the 
injury by not giving assurances to Mr Justice Kriegler.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the government and the Transitional </F>
Executive Council on 13 March; place not given] 
  [Text] On 21:00, Saturday 12 March 1994, a delegation of 
the State President and the South African Government as well as 
the Management Committee of the Transitional Executive Council 
(TEC) met with President Lucas Mangope. The delegation 
consisted of Minister R.F. Botha (Minister of Foreign Affairs), 
General George Meiring (Chief of the South African Defence 
Force), and Messrs Mac Maharaj and Fanie van der Merwe of the 
Management Committee of the TEC. 
  Minister Botha informed President Mangope that the South 
African Government, acting in conjunction with the Management 
Committee of the TEC had noted that: 
  1. The Government of President Mangope is no longer in 
control 
  events in Bophuthatswana; 
  2. All effective administration has seized [as received] to 
  exist; 
  3. The civil service, including the police and army refuse 
to 
  recognise the authority of the government of President 
  Mangope. 
  Accordingly, the SA Government in conjunction with the 
Management Committee of the TEC had come to the conclusion that 
President Mangope was no longer in charge of the administration 
of Bophuthatswana. 
  In the circumstances the current South African Ambassador, 
Professor Tjaard van der Walt has, as an interim measure, been 
placed in charge of Bophuthatswana until such time as the South 
African Government and the TEC agree upon the appointment of 
stable administrative structures and the elections have been 
held in terms of the 1993 constitution. Professor van der Walt 
will meet the secretaries of all departments and other public 
servants to ensure the immediate restoration of effective 
administration. 
  The South African Defence Force (SADF) has been entrusted 
with the task of maintaining law and order under the direction 
of the South African Government acting in conjunction with the 
TEC. 
  President Mangope, for his own safety and protection, will 
be 
secured by the SADF. 
  Citizens of South Africa, and all those resident in 
Bophuthatswana, can now engage in free political activity and 
participate without let or hinderance in the forthcoming 
elections. We urge all to exercise the right in a peaceful and 
orderly manner and with due regard to the urgent need for proper 
administration to be established. 
  All public servants, the police and the army, including 
those 
dismissed by the government of President Mangope in the recent 
weeks, are guaranteed their jobs, salaries and pensions and are 
urged to co-operate with the interim administrator, return to 
their duties and participate in the process of establishing 
effective administration for the benefit of all citizens and 
residents in the area. We urge all to enable a speedy return to 
normality in all spheres of life. 
  We have taken these steps in the interest of good 
governance, 
sound and effective administration, protection of life and 
property and in order to ensure that all are able to engage in 
free and fair elections in an atmosphere of peace without any 
intimidation in whatever form.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 13 SAPA -- Deposed Bophuthatswana 
President Lucas Mangope had accepted the fact that he was no 
longer in power in the homeland, Bophuthatswana Defence Minister 
Rowan Cronje said on Sunday [13 March]. Speaking to journalists 
from his home he said he wanted to think of his future in 
politics before making a decision or commenting on it. 
  Mr Cronje, who also holds the ministerial portfolios of 
state 
affairs and civil aviation, said that he had spoken to South 
African Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha on Saturday night 
regarding Mr Mangope's removal from power. 
  He also spoke to Mr Mangope who "told me what had happened 
-- 
without comment. I think he has accepted what has happened," Mr 
Cronje said. 
  He said he did not think he would take part in the April 
elections, adding "for what party?" But Mr Mangope was "fairly 
keen" to participate as part of the registered party, the 
North-Western Democrats. "The president has enhanced this 
country in a very short time with development, infrastructure, 
leadership and services -- which is remarkable for Africa and 
all this will stand to his credit," he said. 
  One of the reasons for the collapse of order in 
Bophuthatswana was due to agitation from outside. "There were 
statements from the ANC's [African National Congress] premier 
designate for the North-Western area, Mr Popo Molefe and from Mr 
Carl Niehaus of the ANC threatening rolling mass action. There 
have been a lot of foreign cars and a lot of strange faces on 
the streets since Wednesday," he said. 
  Mr Cronje said the Freedom Alliance [FA] was a negotiating 
alliance and not a political one, and the FA had managed to 
negotiate constitutional decisions by a group that differed 
politically. "We managed to get more powers for the provinces 
and this was to be able to give more power to the provincial 
public service to ensure more jobs for civil servants and to 
allow them to have work close to home, Mr Cronje said. 
  He was not able to confirm talk of any collusion between the 
BDF [Bophuthatswana Defense Force] and the massive group of 
right-wing insurgents that infiltrated the capital of the 
fragmented homeland on Friday. What there was evidence of was 
that the BDF, one of the top defence forces in Africa, had 
rounded them up and kept them contained at the air force 
airfield on Friday. 
  He also could not confirm reports of officers siding with 
the 
rightists fleeing the homeland. Mr Cronje added that there were 
a number of officers in the BDF who had been seconded from the 
SADF [South African Defense Force]. 
  He added that the government pensions fund had been audited 
by a firm of British actuaries whose finding was that it was the 
"soundest pension fund in Africa". He also said the fund did 
not even run to the R2 billion [rand] that was allegedly 
siphoned off from it. 
  He also denied any possibility of house arrest for Mr 
Mangope 
who was being secured by SA Government personnel. "All 
governments have a responsibility for all heads of state and 
former heads of state for life. If you go to a country place in 
George, you will find security around former State President P W 
Botha. He is not under house arrest."

  [Text] Mr. Lucas Mangope has vacated his presidential 
residence in Mmabatho, and several of his cabinet members, 
including the chief negotiator of Bophuthatswana, Mr. Rowan 
Cronje, have resigned. The commissioner of police, General P. 
Seleke, is also out of office. 
  This follows an announcement by the South African Government 
that its ambassador, Dr. Tjaart van der Walt, has taken over as 
acting administrator of the homeland. Dr. van der Walt said at 
a news conference that Mr. Mangope had accepted that he was no 
longer in power. He had returned to his house at Matswedi and 
measures had been taken to ensure his safety. Dr. van der Walt 
said the joint South Africa and Bophuthatswana security forces 
had succeeded in stabilizing the situation in the homeland. Dr. 
van der Walt said there would now be free political activity in 
Bophuthatswana, South African constitutional regulations would 
apply, and South African officials could be seconded to assist 
with the administration of the homeland. 
  Shops would be able to reopen from tomorrow, and glass 
companies had been approached to repair broken display windows 
to discourage further looting. It was hoped to have schools 
reopened as soon as possible, and steps would be taken to get 
the television services back on the air. Dr. van der Walt 
appealed to striking public servants to return to work, and said 
their salaries and pensions were secure.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 13 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana's schools 
and shops are expected to reopen on Monday [14 March] and civil 
servants, on strike for weeks, are also expected to get back to 
work, the homeland's new administrator, Dr Tjaart van der Walt, 
said on Sunday afternoon. Dr van der Walt, addressing a media 
conference at the South African Embassy said he had held 
meetings with community leaders while one of his colleagues had 
spoken to public service heads of departments. Both had 
emphasised the need for the homeland, wracked by violence for 
days, to return to normal. 
  Starting off the conference by saying "the past days have 
been horrendous," he went on to say he as administrator would 
"leave no stone unturned until justice has been done". Dr van 
der Walt said he had been the one to contact South African 
Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha to send SA [South African] 
Defence Force troops to the embassy in Bophuthatswana "to 
protect South African lives". "After that it was up to other 
negotiators to take decisions to move out of the embassy. What 
we desperately need to achieve is law and order, peace and 
quiet. We wanted Bophuthatswana's participation in free and 
fair elections." 
  Dr van der Walt appealed to the press "not to crucify 
anybody 
at this stage" as there were many reasons for the collapse of 
law in the homeland. 
  The decision was taken to strip the cabinet of its powers 
and 
to remove the former president, Lucas Mangope, from power as 
time was running out for the homeland to participate in the 
elections. "I tried to convince Mr Mangope of the urgency of 
the matter often," he said. "The political government is no 
longer in place -- Mr Mangope and the cabinet have no power ... 
but the government's executive departments will continue to 
function." 
  Mr van der Walt reiterated Mr Botha's statement of early 
Sunday that civil servants, including those fired by strike 
action, would be employed. This included staff at the 
Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] who were fired on 
Wednesday after occupying the building on Tuesday. Mr van der 
Walt emphasised the urgent need to reopen the BBC to establish 
communication with the people. 
  The SA Police had to start taking over in the now 
incorporated homeland so rule of law could be maintained. 
  Regarding the removal of Mr Mangope from power, Dr van der 
Walt said: "I can't say he accepted it, but he complied." He 
added after the conference, in reply to a question, that Mr 
Mangope "had lost touch with reality and the will of his people." 
  Dr van de Walt also appealed to the civil servants not to 
demand their pensions be paid out now that they had the 
assurance of both the Bophuthatswana and South African 
Governments that their funds were safe. He added that a number 
of cabinet ministers had resigned and cite? the example of 
Health Minister Ned Khaole "who resigned sometime last week but 
was seen at the Victoria Hospital helping out with their heavy 
workload after this had taken place." 
  Head of the police force Gen P J Seleke had also been 
removed 
from his post, Dr van der Walt confirmed.

  [Van der Walt] There is a very small distinction between the 
laws of Bophuthatswana and South Africa. In many respects, the 
laws of Bophuthatswana are more advanced than those of South 
Africa. But to make it easy, those Bophuthatswana laws that is 
not in a position to be a free and fair election will still 
apply. 
  [Mashokwe] What are we dealing with here, Dr. van der Walt? 
Please explain to me. Is Bophuthatswana still in place, but 
the government administration has been removed? Therefore the 
laws of Bophuthatswana are still in place, and Bophuthatswana is 
still an entity, as it were. 
  [Van der Walt] I spoke to the chief justice this afternoon 
and asked him to continue with the legal procedures as usual, so 
all the normal Bophuthatswana laws are still in place, and we'd 
like to do this as legally as possible. But there has been an 
outcry. There has been a deep-felt concern from the people in 
Bophuthatswana that they want to participate in the election. 
So that's why I say those laws in Bophuthatswana that inhibit 
free and fair political activity is null and void. 
  [Mashokwe] Are you saying to me the laws in South Africa 
will 
now apply in Bophuthatswana, which is independent? 
  [Van der Walt] No specific law will apply there. 
  [Mashokwe] You don't need a parliament or anything to ratify 
the [word indistinct] of the policies, the new governor, new 
administer to somehow come in with all [word indistinct]? 
  [Van der Walt] Because of the agreement between the two 
defense forces, and because of the fact that Bophuthatswana 
Defense Force requested us to come in here, and because I've got 
to (?read) reality, I value human life, human quality of life, 
I'll remain within the confines of the law as far as humanely 
possible in that sense, even to the niceties, but at this stage 
the priority is to get the country moving once again. 
  [Mashokwe] Let's elaborate on moving once again. When are 
people going back to work? 
  [Van der Walt] Tomorrow. 
  [Mashokwe] Have they been informed? 
  [Van der Walt] Yes, we requested them to go back. I had 
discussions with senior civil servants. I meet a delegation 
again tonight. I'll be speaking to civil servants again 
tomorrow at nine. I had discussions with leaders of the public. 
So we call on the civil servants and people in public to go 
back to work as normal, and we will address their grievances. 
But by all means, let this part of South Africa get moving once 
again. And in that sense, let's say: Make what Bophuthatswana 
has achieved in the past 16 years still alive and an asset for 
the Province North-West. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay, the people of Bophuthatswana Broadcasting 
Corporation, for instance, have been fired--all of them--lock, 
stock, and barrel. Are they going to be reemployed and going 
back to their posts tomorrow? 
  [Van der Walt] Yes indeed, and that applies to all civil 
servants. My government will guarantee their salary, their 
pension, their possessions. Whether they've been fired or not 
in all departments. Secondly, we're urgently looking at parity 
because, in quite a number of ways, Bophuthatswana is lagging 
behind South Africa. Of course, this will take a bit of time, 
so the civil servants at least can expect this month their 
normal pay. Next month, we'll have had time to look at the 
situation so that we can be all equal -- equal work, equal pay. 
  [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand this: They demanded 50 
percent increase or they will strike. Are you saying you'll 
give that to them come the first of May. You'll only have a 
government of what, like 30 days after the [word indistinct]. 
  [Van der Walt] Yes, we're meeting with them. Indeed there 
are certain structures within the civil service who are 50 
percent behind salaries, not only in the Republic of South 
Africa, but in Transkei, Venda, and Ciskei. So what we want to 
have is parity, equality. We will deal with each case with the 
greatest responsibility and in closest consultation. 
  [Mashokwe] Are you talking of addressing....[pauses] Talking 
of parity, Dr. van der Walt, is it going to be backdated? -- 
because parity that these people are looking for does not date 
from the first of April or the first of May. They say other 
civil servants in South Africa were given these increases years 
ago, months ago. How are you going to deal with that? 
  [Van der Walt] I'm not a one-man-show. I have committees 
working with this kind of thing, but I'd like to assure the 
people that we'll see that justice is being done. I can't go 
into the details. I do refer to the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting 
Corporation, the remnants of the board, and unfortunately quite 
often when you deal with structures here I've got to speak about 
the remnants. They met this afternoon. They assured me that they 
hoped to be on the air, television and radio, by 1100 tomorrow, 
and then we'll have the possibility of direct communication with 
the broader public. So our priority is to go back to work 
normal. There is still communication, because that was a serious 
problem in the past, and then we move ahead. 
  [Mashokwe] The chairman, is he still chairman, the son of 
the 
president? 
  [Van der Walt] No, he is out. 
  [Mashokwe] Is he out? What about the oldies, the pensioners 
who haven't been paid? They are hungry sitting over there and 
complaining? 
  [Van der Walt] We've got to get....[pauses] Our priorities 
is 
this way; deal with the bigger picture, see what we can do with 
the general structure, and then the sooner we can look at 
individual cases we'll do that, but I urgently ask people to be 
patient at this stage. We referred earlier to political 
rallies, et cetera, et cetera. My urgent plea would be, be calm; 
Justice Kriegler will give us a program. Give us time to put 
those things in order, and may I say I'm very happy that Mr. 
Mandela already responded to our serious call to postpone his 
coming here for at least a day. All political leaders are 
welcome, but at this stage it is a risk to have a rally or 
demonstration or mass meeting. 
  [Mashokwe] He's not coming tomorrow then. When is he coming? 
  [Van der Walt] He's not coming tomorrow. At this [word 
indistinct] preliminary on Tuesday. My personal wish would be 
just give us a little more time. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Tjaart van der Walt thanks for talking to us, 
and thanks for your time. 
  [Van der Walt] Thank you very much. It's a privilege, and 
let's do something to make Bophuthatswana an asset for the new 
South Africa.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 13 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] has welcomed the appointment of former 
Bophuthatswana Ambassador Professor Tjaart van der Walt as 
administrator of the strife-torn homeland. 
  Congratulating the Batswana for their "courageous struggle 
against the brutal Mangope regime," the ANC said in a statement 
on Sunday [13 March] the homeland's residents could now engage 
in free political activity and next month's election. "We urge 
all to exercise this hard won right in a peaceful and orderly 
manner," the statement said. 
  It condemned the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] and other white rightwingers who had tried 
to keep President Lucas Mangope's government in power. "Their 
efforts were doomed from the start and turned out to be a 
pathetic and dismal failure. Many died because of their brutal 
and blundering thuggery -- including some in their own ranks -- 
and many more sustained serious injuries. We hope that 
rightwingers, who have in the past so easily threatened 
violence, will now finally realise that war is no solution," the 
statement said. 
  Now was the time for all democrats to take hands and ensure 
that every South African voted next month without fear of 
violence or intimidation.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 14 SAPA -- The predicted return to 
normality in beleaguered Bophuthatswana, now de facto part of 
South Africa, got off to a slow start on Monday [14 March]. 
However, downtown Mafikeng looked more like a business area than 
it has done since Wednesday with people, taxis and cars 
thronging in the streets. 
  Station Street, the scene of most of the clashes between 
security forces and rioting civilians, resembled more than ever 
a country town on market day with the taxi rank full and people 
shopping. Most of the stores were open, including those cleaned 
out by looters, as mopping up operations after four days of 
violence seemed to have ended. 
  The road between Mafikeng and the capital Mmabatho had heavy 
traffic flow in both directions and parking lots outside 
government and parastatal buildings in mmabatho were filled with 
cars. Most operations seemed to be returning to normal after the 
civil service strike. 
  Full-scale cleaning up operations started in earnest at the 
extensively looted Mega City shopping complex adjacent to the 
government buildings, although none of the businesses there had 
any stock to count or sell. 
  Flash point of the wave of unrest that rocked the fragmented 
homeland, the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation, also 
reopened on Monday. Corporation staff were back at work, 
clearing up broken glass and garbage spilt during a police 
routing of employees who occupied the building and effectively 
shut down the radio and television service for more than a week. 
  Broadcasts will resume operations only on Tuesday. In spite 
of no broadcasts, the radio news room was a hive of activity.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 14 SAPA -- The Bophuthatswana civil 
servants' stayaway entered its fourth day on Monday [14 March], 
discounting statements by interim administrator South African 
Ambassador Dr Tjaart van der Walt on Sunday that they would be 
back at work today. Only a few white Bophuthatswana government 
officials arrived for work at the government offices in Mmabatho 
and there was little economic activity in the downtown 
Mmabatho/Mafikeng central business districts. 
  Hardly any public transport was running during the usually 
busy early morning peak hour. Mini-taxis were standing idle at 
their ranks and most vehicles on the roads were driven by white 
motorists. 
  The Mega City shopping complex in central Mmabatho, which 
was 
looted on Thursday night, was still closed on Monday morning. 
Most shops and department stores in Mafikeng were also closed. 
  There was still a strong presence of South African troops 
deployed on street corners and protecting key points in Mmabatho 
and Mafikeng. 
  The South African Defence Force has declined to give details 
of the number of troops sent to Bophuthatswana to quell the 
disturbances. But it would appear that at least two crack army 
battalions equipped with a variety of highly mobile armoured 
personnel carriers are deployed in the Mmabatho/Mafikeng area.

  [Text] Bophuthatswana interim administrator Dr Tjaart van 
der Walt has committed the South African Government to bringing 
about salary parity between Bophuthatswana and South African 
civil servants "as soon as possible". Addressing about 3,000 
civil servants in Mmabatho's civic theatre on Monday [14 March] 
morning, Dr van der Walt said: "The South African Government 
guarantees the salary and pension privileges of every civil 
servant, including those who were dismissed in the past." 
  He then promised parity of salaries with South African civil 
servants' pay grades "as soon as possible". "Your salaries will 
be paid at th? end of the month, but do your jobs," Dr van der 
Walt told his cheering audience. 
  Dr van der Walt said in spite of the sad events and 
atrocities of last week's unrest, "we'll get Bophuthatswana 
moving like never before". "We'll make Bophuthatswana the 
backbone of the north-west as part and parcel of the new South 
Africa." 
  Dr van der Walt said he had warned the South African 
Government last year about the "grassroots unrest" in 
Boputhatswana. The "sad fact was that, humanely speaking, the 
loss of life and property in the homeland could have been been 
prevented. But we are here to pick up the pieces". 
  The people of Bophuthatswana could now regard themselves as 
South African citizens and participate in the elections. 
  Dr van der Walt said he took full responsibility for calling 
in the South African Defence Force to stabilise the situation in 
the troubled homeland, and apologised for the right-wing 
insurgence into Bophuthatswana last week, saying the SA 
Government was not responsible for this. 
  He told the civil servants the security situation was under 
control and nobody needed to feel intimidated or threatened. 
  Dr van der Walt's remark that he had informed 
Bophuthatswana's former President Lucas Mangope on Saturday 
night that his presidency was no longer recognised, was 
applauded loudly by the audience. 
  He also promised the civil servants the government would 
"carefully consider" civil servants' concerns and "look 
sympathetically" at all reasonable demands. 
  Dr van der Walt said he had been in touch with Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, 
who had told him the IEC was drawing up a plan of action for 
free and fair political activities in Bophuthatswana for the 
April elections. Contact with community leaders at the weekend 
would continue. 
  Calling on the civil servants to "return to normality as 
soon 
as possible", Dr van der Walt said outside experts would be 
brought in to help the Bophuthatswana civil service get back on 
its feet.

  [Text] The Bophuthatswana government's unwillingness to 
create free political activity in the area had left the ANC 
[African National Congress] with no choice but to support the 
uprising in the homeland, Popo Molefe, ANC premier-elect for the 
North West, said yesterday. 
  He told WEEKEND STAR that resistance to the homeland 
government had developed "organically". 
  The ANC, he said, had attempted for some time to persuade 
the 
Bophuthatswana government "to be sensitive to the desires of the 
people by opening up the space for free political activity. 
  "We thought that by doing so we would help Chief Lucas 
Mangope and his government to bow out gracefully," Molefe said. 
  The homeland's rejection of offers made by the ANC had left 
the organisation with no option but to throw its weight behind 
the striking workers. 
  Molefe said a powder keg had been simmering for a long time 
in the area, and shootings and daily arrests had provided the 
spark. 
  The intervention of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] 
in the crisis had resulted in the opening up of a climate for 
free political activity, he said. 
  "It is important that we call on the Bophuthatswana security 
forces to co-operate with the people and the TEC, and to refrain 
from shooting their own people. This, we believe, will create 
the conditions for their speedy integration into the new defence 
force, police force and civil service," Molefe said. 
  He further appealed to the public to refrain from the 
destruction of property. Businesses provided jobs, he said.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 13 SAPA -- A delegation from the 
Mafikeng branch of the ANC [African National Congress] gathered 
at the gates of the South African Embassy on Sunday [13 March] 
evening, to protest against the deployment of the SA [South 
African] Police Internal Stability Unit [ISU] members in 
Bophuthatswana. According to the branch secretary, Ephraim 
Motoko, said: "ISU members are harassing residents, kicking in 
doors, and searching their houses for stolen goods," Mr Motoko 
told SAPA. The ISU seem to be intent on recovering items 
removed from the massive and now burnt out Mega City shopping 
complex in three days of frenzied looting. 
  The ANC is also complaining that the embassy staff, or the 
temporary administration is mainly white and want that issue 
addressed. "We are demanding the inclusion of blacks to 
neutralise the white staff," he said.

  [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Events in Bophuthatswana 
had been orchestrated by an "unholy" ANC [African National 
Congress]/SACP [South African Communist Party]/National Party 
[NP] alliance which should take responsibility for the loss of 
life in the strife, Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi 
Hartzenberg said on Saturday [12 March]. In a statement, Dr 
Hartzenberg expressed the CP's dismay at the past week's unrest 
in the homeland, whose embattled leader President Lucas Mangope 
was a partner with the CP in the election boycotting Freedom 
Alliance. 
  According to the CP leader, the ANC/SACP/NP alliance had 
orchestrated a "communist revolution" in Bophuthatswana through 
various ways. These included ferrying busloads of ANC activists 
to the area, carefully planning strikes, instigating student and 
youth vandalism, selective Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation, ANC armed wing] shooting actions and intimidation of the 
homeland's security forces as well as a "massive SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] and leftist media campaign of 
disinformation". 
  "The killing of four Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] members was an indication of the ruthless 
manner in which the operation had been carried out", Dr 
Hartzenberg said. He reiterated that the CP would never contest 
the election. "To do so would make the CP guilty of complicity 
in the enslaving of the Afrikaner Boerevolk [Boere nation] by a 
communist government of national unity." 
  He further contended that the proclamation of 52 magisterial 
districts as unrest areas was a ruse. "(Law and Order) Minister 
Hernus Kriel's proclamation...is a selective enforcing of his 
powers because he deliberately did not include areas where 
unrest was happening. In not doing so he gave the ANC the 
opportunity to continue their revolution unhindered." 
  The CP leader concluded by calling on all "Boere Afrikaners" 
and those people who had become involved in the "struggle" to 
regroup and consolidate. "The four Afrikaners who offered their 
lives...should serve as an incentive to us to also pay the 
highest price in order to achieve our nation's freedom in our 
own fatherland. The struggle which our fathers started, will 
rage until we die or vanquish," Dr Hartzenberg said.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the office of the chief minister of </F>
kwaZulu, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, on 13 March on the SAPA PR Wire 
Service] 
  [Text] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] and the 
South African Government have illegally removed President Lucas 
Mangope from office in Bophuthatswana and this should send 
warning signals to all democrats as to the intentions of the ANC 
[African National Congress]/SACP [South African Communist 
Party]/SA [South African] Government/NP [National Party] 
alliance. It appears that opposition to the fatally flawed 1993 
constitution, as amended, will be smashed by whatever means, 
including orchestrated mob violence and anarchy under the guise 
of popular uprising. 
  President Mangope has been overthrown not by violent, 
looting, demonstrators under the control of the ANC/SACP but by 
the South African Government, in league with the ANC/SACP, in 
terms of powers which they have given themselves. 
  It is significant that at no stage during this week's 
turmoil 
did the ANC/SACP/SA Government deplore the criminal activities 
of those engaged in public murder and mayhem. This deliberate 
plan to oust an elected leader was plain for all to see and now, 
staggeringly, it is being applauded by some here and abroad as a 
triumph for democracy! The facts are that this action has 
placed South Africa on a slippery slope to chaos. 
  By removing President Mangope in this manner, democracy has 
already been dispensed with in South Africa and I fear for our 
future. The right to disagree with the ANC/SACP/SA 
Government/NP alliance is being ruthlessly snuffed out. The 
right to intellectually oppose and to resolve differences 
democratically, stifled by the manipulators of baying mob 
violence and the tactics of terror and intimidation. When will 
administrative decree become the order of the day throughout 
South Africa, as it is now in Bophuthatswana? 
  There appear to be indications that the same strategies are 
being devised for action in kwaZulu/Natal. All I can say is 
that kwaZulu/Natal is not Bophuthatswana. We are intent on 
seeking democratic ways and means of reaching constitutional 
agreements, in the best interests of our citizens and to the 
satisfaction of his majesty the king of the Zulu nation, based 
on consensus and compromise and a peaceful way forward. 
  Recent events in Bophuthatswana shame South Africa and 
reveal 
the clenched fist of the ANC/SACP/SA Government/NP alliance 
acting in tandem. For this they are now praised by their 
supporters here and abroad, but for how long? By their actions 
they have placed the people of our country in grave danger with 
their contempt of our laws and international standards of 
conflict resolution. I appeal to the international community to 
use all the resources at its disposal to warn the ANC/SACP/SA 
Government of the consequences of their action.

  [Text] More reaction to the latest developments in 
Bophuthatswana, this time from a delegation of the Mafeking 
branch of the ANC [African National Congress]. Members have 
protested outside the South African embassy in Mmabatho against 
the deployment of the Internal Stability Unit [ISU]. The ANC 
branch claimed the ISU has been harassing residents in the 
search for looted goods. 
  And the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has called for the 
prosecution of former Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope and 
has called for ballistic tests on the weapons of right wingers 
who moved in to the homeland earlier last week.

  [Text] Fifty-two magisterial districts have been declared 
unrest areas as a result of the events in Bophuthatswana. The 
minister of law and order, Mr. Hernus Kriel, said this step had 
been taken to prevent the possible spread of violence from 
Bophuthatswana to South Africa. The areas include virtually all 
towns and cities in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] area, as well as large parts of the western 
Transvaal, the northern Transvaal the [Orange] Free State, and 
northern Cape.

  [Text] Pretoria Mar 13 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel has lifted unrest restrictions placed on 52 areas 
during the violence in Bophuthatswana. In a statement on Sunday 
[13 March], Mr Kriel said the lifting of restrictions would take 
place at midnight of 13/14 March. Mr Kriel added that the 
unrest restrictions had been declared "to contain and combat any 
possible overflow of unrest from the homeland during the 
crisis," and not "to inhibit in any manner...(the) expression of 
free and fair political activity."

  [Text] Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel's declaration of 
52 magisterial districts as unrest areas -- which was also 
lifted at midnight -- has been a selective implementation of his 
powers, because he did not include districts where there has 
been current violence. By doing so he is indeed giving the ANC 
[African National Congress] an opportunity in these areas to 
continue its revolution unhindered.

<F P=106> [Report by E H Kemp] </F>
  [Text] Ermelo March 13 SAPA -- Neither President F W de 
Klerk nor Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Johann 
Kriegler knew about the declaration of unrest areas in 52 
magisterial districts, African National Congress [ANC] President 
Nelson Mandela said on Sunday [13 March]. Addressing about 
15,000 people at a rally in Wesselton outside Ermelo, he said he 
had telephoned Mr de Klerk and Mr Justice Kriegler on Saturday 
night after an ANC rally in Kimberley was prohibited in terms of 
the declaration. Mr Mandela said Mr de Klerk told him he had 
not known about the declaration and the subsequent banning of 
the ANC rally. Mr Justice Kriegler, whose commission has to 
ensure that the April election was free and fair, had also not 
been consulted about the matter. 
  "The amount of confusion and lack of consultation among 
members of the government is frightening. One department does 
not know what another is doing. There are times when even Mr de 
Klerk does not know about matters of fundamental importance." 
  The ANC leader said the declaration of unrest areas seemed 
"calculated to undermine free and fair elections". 
  He said he had also discussed with Mr de Klerk the 
controversy surrounding Housing Minister Louis Shill's 
R90-billion [rand] housing scheme. He said it was wrong for a 
government minister to make announcements on important issues 
without prior consultation with other institutions and parties 
involved in the transition process. "These are the actions of a 
government which is panicking because they see the writing on 
the wall. They are abusing their position to do things which in 
terms of the sane policies, they should not be doing." 
  Mr Mandela received a thunderous welcome when he arrived at 
the Wesselton stadium at about 3PM. Drum majorettes and 
drummers led the procession as the ANC leader, on the back of an 
open bakkie [pickup truck], waved and gave clenched fists 
salutes. Mr Mandela, who was accompanied by the ANC's candidate 
premier for the Eastern Transvaal, Matthew Phosa, and Prince 
James Mahlangu of the Intando Yesizwe [Will of the Nation] party 
of kwaNdebele, also inspected a company of Umkhonto We Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation, ANC armed wing] troops from the Chris Hani 
detachment.

  [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Gen Viljoen expressed his 
deepest sympathy to the next-of-kin of the AWB [Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement] members who 
were executed by a Bophuthatswana Defence Force soldier in 
Mmabatho's streets on Friday [11 March]. 
  He condemned the African National Congress [ANC] for its 
"onslaught" in the homeland to topple President Lucas Mangope. 
He also accused the government of willfully watching the 
goings-on. "The ANC demonstrated what use they have of 
violence...If this is the pattern for the future it spells no 
good for South Africa." Both the government and the ANC could 
not be allowed to dominate South Africa, he said. 
  There was tension between him and the controlling bodies of 
the AVF [Afrikaner National Front]. He had also realised he was 
not acceptable to a "large proportion" of AVF supporters, the 
general said. Also, many of his supporters, had urged him to 
create an opportunity not to vote for the National Party [NP]. 
He had also experienced "great pressure" from the security 
forces that they did not want to vote for the NP. 
  Gen Viljoen said he had by Saturday morning not had contact 
with Dr Hartzenberg. There was a good relationship between him 
and Dr Hartzenberg and he would assist him in strategic planning 
as military adviser, said the general.

  [Text] Pretoria March 13 SAPA -- Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen on Sunday 
[13 March] questioned why Lucas Mangope was toppled by the South 
African Government and the African National Congress despite Mr 
Mangope's undertaking to recommend to his parliament that 
Bophuthatswana take part in the April elections. 
  "I am asking for a special urgent meeting of the Freedom 
Alliance as this action is materially affecting the security 
situation," said Gen Viljoen in a statement. 
  Gen Viljoen said an AVF force in Bophuthatswana was 
withdrawn 
after South African Defence Force [SADF] Chief Gen Georg Meiring 
gave an assurance that the SADF would not be instrumental in 
toppling Mr Mangope. 
  The toppling of Mr Mangope affected "hopes of an 
all-inclusive settlement, not even to mention participation in 
the elections," said Gen Viljoen. 
  "I am also calling on the international community to use 
their influence in solving this new crisis."

<F P=106> [Report by F. Pienaar] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 13 SAPA -- The Executive Council of the 
Conservative Party [CP] in Natal on Sunday [13 March] pledged 
its support to Freedom Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen in 
order to contest the April election. The council's decision 
follows the resignation last week of CP Natal leader Carl Werth, 
who also pledged his support to Gen Viljoen's Party. In a 
statement the council said it had decided at a meeting on Sunday 
to support the FF. The council is one of the CP's highest 
policy making bodies in Natal. 
  "Of the ten members of the Executive Council, only one had 
decided against contesting the election," the statement said. 
Seven of the members supporting Gen Viljoen are: CP Natal 
Deputy Chairman Duncan du Bois; Gunther Gathmann, Magriet 
Torlage, Braam Joubert, Gordon MacGregor, CP Natal Chief 
Information Officer Roger Whiteley and Neels Fourie. 
  Mr du Bois told SAPA on Sunday night that while the council 
members have not yet resigned officially from the CP, their 
membership would lapse. He said the CP has "undoubtedly but 
regrettably" been given a blow by the council's decision. The 
CP preoccupation with establishing a volkstaat [Afrikaner 
homeland] and nothing else had precipitated the defection as 
such a volkstaat had limited appeal in Natal, Mr du Bois said. 
"The fact that the CP of late has seen fit to follow the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] direction 
of a volkstaat and nothing else did not give us a choice." 
  He was reluctant to state that the CP in Natal had become 
disillusioned with the party's national leadership, only saying 
the AVF "had distorted the policy of the CP as laid down in the 
party's constitution of 1991." He added: "We have not deviated 
from CP policy." 
  Mr du Bois said he was confident that most CP supporters in 
Natal would follow the council's lead and vote for the Freedom 
Front. "Generally, as far as Natalians are concerned, we wanted 
to vote for an anti-National Party, anti-African National 
Congress front. The Freedom Front affords them the vehicle to 
do just that." He admitted that "there may be a few 
disenchanted people going to stick with the Volksfront".

  [Text] The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance

disappointed by General Viljoen's decision to participate in the 
election. The statement, which was issued before the news of 
Gen. Viljoen's resignation, said that the AWB was forced to 
concede that those who had called Gen. Viljoen a political Judas 
-- I suppose sent by the ANC [African National Congress] and the 
South African Communist Party alliance -- had been correct.

<F P=106> [Report by Robert Brand] </F>
  [Text] Right-wing unity is under renewed pressure in the 
wake of the Bophuthatswana crisis, with the Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] considering 
pulling out of the far-right umbrella organisation, the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF]. 
  Bitter accusations were flung at AVF leader General Constand 
Viljoen for his role in the AWB's disastrous retreat from 
Mmabatho yesterday. 
  AWB spokesman Fred Rundle said he would be most unhappy to 
remain in alliance with Viljoen. "We don't trust him," he said. 
  "We are very disillusioned and disappointed with the role 
General Viljoen played in Bophuthatswana. He has no credibility 
left with our people," an angry Rundle said from the AWB's 
Ventersdorp office yesterday. 
  About 4,000 AWB members pulled out of Mmabatho yesterday 
after being requested by Viljoen to leave the territory. During 
the retreat three AWB members were shot dead, apparently in cold 
blood, by members of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force. A 
further five AWB members were wounded in skirmishes. 
  But Rundle denied that AWB members had been involved in 
clashes with members of the Bophuthatswana security forces and 
said the organisation had not been chased out of Mmabatho. "Our 
people left because we were asked to leave." 
  He said Mangope had personally asked AWB leader Eugene 
Terreblanche for assistance to stabilise the situation in 
Mmabatho. "President Mangope personally had discussions with our 
leader, and asked for his help." 
  The Bophuthatswana government has denied this, saying it had 
asked Viljoen for assistance on condition the AWB would not be 
involved. 
  Asked whether the AWB would remain a member of the AVF, 
Rundle said: "We will settle that at our next meeting. I am a 
member of the AVF's executive council and I, for one, would be 
most unhappy to remain a member if General Viljoen is there. 
  Viljoen was not available for comment late yesterday.

<F P=106> [By Norman Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 13 SAPA -- The right-wing Pretoria 
Boerekommando is uncowed by the public execution of Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement--AWB] members 
in Mmabatho, saying they would not follow Freedom Front leader 
Gen Constand Viljoen into an election. Speaking at the 
Wonderboom Fort they occupied in Pretoria on Sunday [13 March], 
Commandant Willem Ratte, a former 32 Battalion Commander, said: 
"We can't agree with what Gen Viljoen says. We can't take part 
in our own funeral by taking part in the Azanian election." 
  Cmdt Ratte and a group of Boerecommando members in army 
browns occupied the fort while a small but steady stream of 
right-wing supporters trundled up the hill to express their 
moral support. The group was armed, and had barricaded the 
historic fort with razor wire and sandbags. The vierkleur 
[four-color; flag of the former Transvaal Republic] and South 
African flags were hoisted on the corners of the half-moon 
shaped fort, similar in design to the Schanskop Fort they 
previously occupied. 
  The security forces seemed to take no interest in the 
occupation this time, after over-reacting at Schanskop. Traffic 
police were on hand to regulate the traffic of curious arriving 
visitors. 
  Cmdt Ratte said he expected the city council, which owns the 
fort, to meet on Monday and to request the police to remove them 
by force. "The situation may become a little bit serious. 
We'll see what happens," he said, in an interview at the fort. 
He said Gen Viljoen intervened last time, ending the Schanskop 
siege, even though this was against the occupants' wishes. 
  Asked whether the rightwing may avenge the execution of the 
AWB men in central Mmabatho, Cmdt Ratte said this would be 
difficult because it would be difficult to identify the guilty 
party. "The real guilt lies with the South African Government. 
They created the conditions for that type of situation." 
  Cmdt Ratte objected to being labelled militant, saying 
Afrikaners were a small group threatened by a mass of Azanians. 
Afriakners had to choose between slavery under African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela and South African 
Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo, or to making a stand. "It 
is a question of self-preservation. We will be swamped if we 
don't make a stand," he said. 
  Asked about the dented image of the rightwing after the 
Mmabatho fiasco, Cmdt Ratte said the rightwingers had been 
caught unawares by the Bophuthatswana Security Forces suddenly 
switching their allegiance to the ANC after they had been 
promised job security under an ANC government. 
  The ANC and the South African Government, after staging a 
coup in Bophuthatswana, would now bring similar pressures to 
bear on kwaZulu, he added.

  [Text] Ventersdorp March 14 SAPA -- Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] leader Eugene 
Terreblanche was on Monday unfazed by events in Bophuthatswana, 
saying the AWB would be built up to be even stronger levels than 
it was. 
  Addressing a news conference in Ventersdorp, he accused 
Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen of having betrayed the 
Afrikaner. By going to Parliament, Gen Viljoen would now go on 
to the paylist of African National Congress [ANC] President 
Nelson Mandela. 
  Asked whether the AWB's hasty retreat from Mmabatho, during 
which it lost three men, did not dent the AWB's credibility, Mr 
Terreblanche replied: "I do not know how you can ask such a 
question. It is only because you don't have the facts and are 
not part of my people and my nation." 
  He said the AWB lost only three men in Mmabatho while eight 
were wounded, compared to 50 dead and 280 injuries on the part 
of the Bophuthatswana security forces, and this pointed to a 
brilliant victory for the AWB. 
  He was not sure whether there would be elections from April 
26-28, because the country was headed for a revolution. 
  Mr Terreblanche wanted to know how Gen Viljoen could secure 
a 
volkstaat [homeland] for the Afrikaner if he became part of a 
communist election. 
  Speaking in the hot Ventersdorp town hall, and flanked by a 
row of AWB officers, he said Mr Mangope had been toppled because 
Gen Viljoen's forces could not handle the situation in Mmabatho 
after the AWB had been ordered out. 
  The SADF [South African Defense Force] then moved in and 
handed over the control of Bophuthatswana to the ANC and the 
South African Communist Party. 
  Mr Terreblanche said the Mmabatho events had been a 
communist 
plot, and he had been ordered out of the city because he would 
not have allowed the administration to fall to communists. He 
had been betrayed by communist elements in the Bophuthatswana 
and South African Government. "I fought the lot of them. They 
posed as loyal people to their own governments." 
  There were heated exchanges with journalists during question 
time. Some journalists at the conference still bore black eyes 
sustained during encounters with rightwingers in Mmabatho. 
  Mr Terreblanche denied that his forces shot dead any women 
in 
Mmabatho, saying such casualties should be ascribed to crossfire. 
  Bophuthatswana's former minister of state and Freedom 
Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje had by now managed to give away 
two fatherlands, he said. 
  He added that the AWB would consider rendering assistance to 
kwaZulu if such help was requested. 
  South Africa was now close to confrontation and revolution, 
and the borders of the volkstaat would be drawn by the outcome 
of war. Mr Terreblanche said the Transvaal and [Orange] Free 
State, and northern Natal and Richards Bay would form part of 
the volkstaat, minus the homelands in these areas. 
  President F W de Klerk could not count on the loyalty of the 
defence force if he wanted to use it against the rightwingers 
and the nation, and he would be unable to counter the African 
National Congress/SA Communist Party revolution. "We are 
heading for chaos, not an election. We are heading for a 
revolution, not peace and prosperity." 
  Asked again whether the AWB had not retreated from 
Bophuthatswana with its tail between its legs, Mr Terreblanche 
said: "Ag please, don't you want to ask a real question." He 
accused the journalist who posed the question of being part and 
parcel of the communist conspiracy. 
  Mr Terreblanche said dockets had been opened to investigate 
the public execution of two wounded AWB men in Mmabatho and the 
AWB would not rest until the guilty persons had been brought to 
court. A senior AWB officer said funeral arrangements for the 
three AWB dead had not yet been finalised.

  [Text] A former leader of the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front], General Constand Viljoen, has 
resigned from the Freedom Alliance. This was announced at a 
Freedom Alliance meeting in Kimberley today. Speaking after the 
meeting, IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi said the Alliance had agreed that General Viljoen 
should resign so that he could lead his Freedom Front in the 
election. General Viljoen said that he was prepared to join the 
Freedom Alliance as the leader of the Freedom Front. Meanwhile, 
the former Conservative Party leader in Natal, Mr. Carl Werth, 
has confirmed that eight of the region's 11 executive members 
have agreed to stand as candidates for the Freedom Front. He 
said that they had taken the decision at a recent meeting. 
Leaders of the Freedom Alliance meeting expressed strong 
disapproval of the deposing of Dr. Lucas Mangope as president of 
Bophuthatswana. Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Dr. Mangope had 
been betrayed and stabbed in the back. He said there was a need 
for the alliance to review its position following the weekend's 
events. 
  A Conservative Party spokesman said the events in 
Bophuthatswana had been planned by the ANC [African National 
Congress] through the Transitional Executive Council, to deprive 
the state of its independence.

  [Text] Kimberley March 14 SAPA -- The presence of 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] monitors at polling 
booths would not make any difference in areas affected by 
violence, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi said on Monday [17 March]. "I hope they are not 
overestimating themselves," he told a Kimberley breakfast 
meeting attended by about 20 businessmen. 
  Mr Buthelezi said free and fair elections could not be held 
amid the kind of violence experienced in Natal. Violence could 
increase as the election date got closer. 
  He reiterated the failure of the interim constitution to 
provide federalism or regional autonomy for South Africa, saying 
the prognosis for a genuinely democratic government emerging 
under this constitution "is not good at all". "The 1993 
constitution is there to ensure the African National Congress' 
battle for a central dictatorship will be easily won." 
  Although excluded from the April election, Mr Buthelezi said 
he still hoped "sanity could prevail" and a solution could be 
found so all parties could join the fold. While it was 
traumatic for white Inkatha members not to vote, this was not 
the case for black members "who have never voted anyway", he 
said.

  [Text] Pretoria Mar 14 SAPA -- State President F W de Klerk 
on Monday [14 March] denied there was a strategy under way to 
destabilise kwaZulu, its Chief Minster Mangosuthu Buthelezi and 
the position of the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini. The chief 
minister, who is also the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, 
on Sunday said: "What they did to Bophuthatsawna they want to do 
to kwaZulu." His warning followed the uprising in the 
Bophuthatsawna homeland which subsequently led to the overthrow 
of its leader Lucas Mangope. 
  Addressing academics on a one-day election tour of Pretoria 
and th East Rand, both as statesman and National Party leader Mr 
de Klerk said: "There is no basis whatsoever for such an 
accusation." 
  "In terms of the interim constitution and the Electoral Act, 
the kwaZulu government can govern until the election comes." He 
warned, however, that the IFP decision not to participate in the 
election "creates a dangerous situation". 
  He appealed to both Mr Buthelezi and the African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela to control their 
followers in the run-up to the election. 
  Regarding the handling of the Bophuthatswana crisis, Mr de 
Klerk said the ANC had created the impression "via the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council]" that the ANC was in control of 
the situation. Mr de Klerk said the South African Government was 
in control of the crisis from the first signs of possible 
trouble in the homeland. He slammed the propagandistic 
inferences that the government "was sitting on its hands" 
throughout the crisis. 
  The next destination on the De Klerk roadshow included a 
short stopover in the predominantly Indian area of Laudium, west 
of Pretortia. About 1,200 NP [National Party] supporters 
welcomed Mr de Klerk in a parking lot behind the Laudium 
shopping centre. 
  Mr de Klerk again highlighted the NP's economic policy which 
he said was in line with policies which had created wealth in 
countries like America, France, Germany and Japan. Mr de Klerk 
criticised the ANC's economic policy which he said was based on 
policies which had led to poverty in countries like Mozambique, 
Poland and Russia. 
  A small group of ANC supporters waving ANC banners and 
posters also turned up to hear Mr de Klerk speak amidst some 
heckling and toyi-toying. Mr de Klerk thanked the ANC supporters 
for allowing him to speak to his supporters. 
  Mr de Klerk's next stop will be Sandton, north of 
Johannesburg, where he will address members of the business 
sector.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "There is nothing </F>
sacrosanct about 27 April" -- article published in English] 
  [Text] Isn't it amazing how the Government and the ANC 
[African National Congress] are so adamant on April 27 as the 
ONLY possible date for the first ever democratic 
elections for South Africa? 
  Most South Africans are surely puzzled as to why this should 
be the case. 
  We certainly are, given that the matter is by no means as 
cut 
and dried as it is made out to be. In the first instance, we 
should cast our minds back to how it was that this date was 
agreed to in the first place. 
  What happened was that all the parties at the World Trade 
Centre, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] included, agreed to a 
resolution which stated that the election date should be set 
ONCE there had been sufficient progress in 
negotiations. 
  However, the ink was barely dry on this when Messrs 
Ramaphosa 
and Meyer started agitating to have the date set -- 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE AGREED-TO PRECONDITIONS HAD NOT 
BEEN SATISFIED. 
  In other words, there had not been sufficient progress in 
negotiations. Indeed, the joint stonewalling by the Government 
and ANC -- in refusing to even consider the IFP's proposals on 
the form of state, on the negotiations process and on violence 
-- resulted in an impasse which was "resolved" by way of the 
mechanism of "sufficient consensus." 
  The date was set, and on 2 July the IFP walked out of 
Kempton 
Park in protest. 
  In other words, 27 Apri? was not a democratically determined 
(ie, all-inclusive) election date. Not only were the 
preconditions agreed to beforehand totally ignored, but those 
parties which objected to this procedural abuse were simply 
overruled. 
  To these parties, 27 April never therefore assumed the false 
status to which it was subsequently elevated. 27 April was 
merely another symptom of the characteristic World Trade Centre 
craziness which urged that dates be set BEFORE 
substantive agreements were properly reached, instead of 
AFTERWARDS. 
  The fact is that those parties which created the 27 April 
problem and who now believe the date cannot be changed, are 
living in cloud-cuckoo land. 
  Reality #1 is that the prime objective before all parties 
should be to create an all-inclusive constitutional settlement 
without which the elections and subsequent "democracy" may well 
be severely threatened. 
  Surely it is self-evident that the prime issue is reaching 
an 
agreement, and that the implementation of this must come next? 
To put the cart before the horse is both stupid and dangerous. 
  Reality #2 is that certain parties have already been 
conducting their election campaign for many months. They have 
had road shows, have conducted massive advertising campaigns, 
and have done all that parties do by way of presenting 
themselves to the electorate in order to win votes. 
  Other parties, however, have not even started yet. This may 
suit the Government and ANC which now have a huge head start, 
but since everyone agreed early on in the negotiations process 
to a levelling of the playing field in order to allow parties to 
participate in fair and free elections, it stands to reason that 
this agreement be adhered to. 
  The big question, of course, is whether this is possible. 
Not in terms of political will, but constitutionally. 
  Reality #3 is the simple fact that there is absolutely no 
valid reason why the date cannot be changed. The term of office 
of the present government expires in September this year, at 
which stage an election must be called. 
  In other words, there is no legal or constitutional 
impediment to elections being held in May, June, July, August or 
September. It changes absolutely nothing other than the date 
itself. 
  We all know the ANC and Government are reluctant to change 
the date, but equally, we all know it can be changed should 
there be a need to do so. The question is -- are the 
Government and ANC more concerned with behaving as they have 
done to date, in forcing through their deal regardless of the 
consequences, or are they prepared to be reasonable? 
  Nothing stops the date being changed other than obstinacy, a 
stubborn refusal to be fair and a desperate attempt to gain 
power at all costs. It is surely time for a rethink -- if 
they're the democrats they profess to be, there should be no 
problem in being reasonable. 
  After all, we've waited more than three hundred years for 
this momentous occasion -- does a month or two really make that 
much of a difference?

  [Text] Cape Town March 11 SAPA -- National Party [NP] 
election canvassers in the Transkei would have to travel in 
Casspirs if the South African and Transkei authorities could not 
agree on election security, Transkei leader Maj-Gen Bantu 
Holomisa said on Friday. Speaking after a rally at the 
University of the Western Cape, he said Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel had apparently snubbed a Transkei Military Council 
offer for a joint public relations exercise to persuade 
Transkeians to allow NP canvassing in the territory. 
  In a telephone conversation, Mr Kriel had wanted guarantees 
for the safety of NP offices and party workers in Transkei, Gen 
Holomisa said. However, Transkeians were under the impression 
that the South Africans were "hell-bent on our killing our 
people". For this fear to be dispelled, the two countries had 
to meet and work out a security plan, but Mr Kriel seemed to 
have neglected taking up his advice, Gen Holomisa said. 
  "I cannot see how I can let him deploy his people (in 
Transkei) because of the security risk." Without a security 
agreement on political activities "the NP will have to take 
Casspirs; we do not have armoured vehicles". 
  If agreement had not been reached within a week, the matter 
of NP canvassing in Transkei could be referred to the 
Independent Electoral Commission.

  [Text] George March 14 SAPA -- The rights of the individual 
and a free market economy were the Democratic Party's [DP] two 
major election platforms, DP leader Dr Zach de Beer told an 
informal gathering during an election roadshow in George on 
Monday morning. 
  The DP carcade -- including DP Western Cape premiership 
candidate Hennie Bester, former Labour Party Minister Chris 
April and former George Women's Army College head Hilda Burnett 
-- stopped at a house in the coloured residential area of 
Parkdene where about 40 people sat waiting under a tree. 
  Dr de Beer told them now that apartheid was "a thing of the 
past, we must work at creating a better life for all". 
  The DP wanted to help South Africans improve their living 
standards through a free market economy. 
  After his short speech, the gathering, led by former Dominee 
Mr April, sang: "Up the mountain, down the valley, Jerusalem is 
my home." 
  As the carcade moved through George's business district and 
residential areas with a loudspeaker blaring "Vote for the DP, 
the party of peace", locals smiled and flashed two fingered 
peace signs. Some looked on merely bewildered and bemused. 
  At the Simbaba feeding scheme -- funded by World Vision -- 
about 80 wide-eyed toddlers sang hymns and vied to shake the 
visitors' hands. 
  United Nations observers, journalists and traffic police are 
accompanying the DP tour, which proceeds from George to Hoekwil, 
Kleinkrans, Sedgefield, Knysna, Plettenberg Bay and -- on 
Tuesday -- Mossel Bay. 
  In an interview with SAPA at the start of the tour on Monday 
morning, Dr de Beer sharply criticised President F W de Klerk 
for failing to secure Bophuthatswana's reincorporation into 
South Africa through negotiation after he (Dr de Beer) had 
raised the issue in Parliament early last year.

  [Text] Election campaigners of the Democratic Party [DP] 
youth in the Western Cape got their second rebuff this afternoon 
when they were forced to leave the Good Hope College of 
Education campus in Khayelitsha. A vociferous group of ANC 
[African National Congress] supporters blocked their entry to 
the college building. The DP leader in the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, Mr. Tony Leon, held an 
impromptu meeting with the students representative council and 
the college administration. The DP then decided to withdraw 
from the campus. Mr. Leon said their being barred from both the 
Good Hope College and the Peninsula Technikon in Belville 
earlier today made a mockery of the Electoral Act.

<F P=106> [Report by Greg Arde'] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 14 SAPA -- A senior member of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], Ben Ngubane, on Monday said his 
party could still participate in the April elections, despite 
having missed last week's deadline for submission of election 
candidate lists. IFP Central Committee Executive member, Dr 
Ngubane, said in a statement: "As far as we are concerned, last 
Friday's deadline is immaterial as to whether or not we decide 
to participate in the elections". 
  He said Inkatha had not missed the election boat, and would 
still decide whether or not to join the April poll. This 
decision was subject to negotiations on the modalities of 
international mediation in South Africa's constitutional impasse. 
  Dr Ngubane also dismissed as "a lie" any suggestion that he 
was considering leaving the IFP and changing parties in order to 
fight the election. He said such a suggestion was aimed at 
sowing division in the IFP. "It is a lie that I have considered 
changing parties because last week's lapsed registration of 
candidates deadline has ostensibly resulted in the IFP being 
automatically disbarred from participating in elections. This 
is patent nonsense. Not only would I not consider leaving the 
IFP irrespective of our participation or otherwise, but as far 
as we are concerned last Friday's deadline is immaterial as to 
whether or not we decide to participate in the elections," Dr 
Ngubane said. 
  Last week the IFP said it would not submit an election 
candidates list until there was international mediation on 
outstanding constitutional differences. 
  Mediation would have to achieve amendments to the interim 
constitution, secure the position of Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini and rationalise the electoral process and timetables 
to ensure a free and fair election in which all parties could 
participate on an equal footing. 
  The IFP indicated the deadline for the registration of 
parties and the submission of candidate lists could be changed 
by proclamation by State President F W de Klerk. The body 
governing elections, the Independent Electoral Commission, said 
at the weekend that the time was up for parties to join the poll 
because the ballot papers were already being printed.

  [Text] Durban Mar 13 SAPA -- Home Affairs Minister Danie 
Schutte has hinted that senior Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
members are to join the National Party [NP] soon, SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. 
Addressing members of the Italian community on Sunday [13 
March], in Durban, Mr Schutte said the National Party would 
accomodate some of the IFP leaders in the candidate list for the 
national assembly. He said several IFP leaders have indicated 
willingness to join the National Party, but declined to say who 
had made approaches to join the NP. 
  Meanwhile, it appears the NP is not the only party which has 
been approached by top level IFP members. Democratic Party 
candidate for the national list, Kobus Jordaan, said his party 
has also been approached.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] says it will 
continue talks with the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] even though 
it has decided against participation in next month's election. 
The ANC national chairman, Thabo Mbeki, said at Dundee in 
northern Natal that the ANC would ensure that constitutional 
agreements with the IFP on international mediation were 
implemented after the election. The meeting in Pietermaritzburg 
that was to have been addressed by Mr. Mbeki was disrupted by a 
bomb threat. Police sniffer dogs were used to search the 
premises, but nothing was found.

  [Text] East London Mar 13 SAPA -- Gunmen burst into a 
church service in Mdantsane, Ciskei, on Sunday [13 March] and 
after separating the worshippers according to race, shot dead in 
cold blood the three they perceived to be white. Speaking in 
East London on Sunday night Ba'hai leaders expressed shock and 
dismay at the senseless killing of three members of their 
spiritual community. 
  The dead men are: Dr Shamam Bakhshandegi, 29, a dentist who 
worked at Mdantsane hospital; Mr Riaz Razavi, 44, the director 
of finance at the University of Fort Hare; and Mr Hooshmand 
"Alex" Anvari, a visiting American national. 
  A Ba'hai leader in the Eastern Cape, Mr Cyrus Mahmoudi, said 
the four gunmen had entered the church at about 2PM. "I don't 
know weapons very well," a shaken Mr Mahmoudi told SAPA, "but, 
according to some members of the congregation, at least one of 
the men had an AK-47, the others had pistols. There was no 
discussion at all. These men said they wanted the white people 
to stand one side." 
  The three the victims, who were picked out because they had 
a 
lighter skin colour than everyone else present, were then told 
to empty their pockets. After they had complied with the 
gunmens' request "they were brutally shot down in cold blood in 
the presence of many women and small children". 
  Mr Mahmoudi said that at no time had the gunmen given any 
reasons for their actions. "This was a blatantly racist attack 
against us, a church which has always preached that we are all 
one kind." 
  The killers then grabbed a set of car keys belonging to one 
of the men they had shot dead and made their getaway in the 
stolen car. 
  Another Ba'hai elder, Cecil Cook, of Stutterheim, said the 
"attack was on a religion which believes in the unity of 
mankind. Nothing could be more racist." 
  The Ciskei Government released a statement on Sunday night 
deploring the "despicable and cowardly action". The statement 
added that "every effort" would be made to apprehend the killers. 
  "The stage has now been reached when it is only fair to 
announce that no mercy will be shown to the sub-humans who 
perpetrate such crimes."

dead by gunmen during a service near East London. The killing 
seems to be racially motivated. [passage omitted] 
  Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel expressed shock at the 
killings. Mr. Kriel said in a statement that the attack 
emphasized the need for a national summit on the violence in the 
country. An ANC [African National Congress] spokesman Ncebisi 
Bata slammed the killings, saying that they were the work of 
criminal elements.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 14 SAPA -- A caller claiming to 
represent the Azanian Liberation Army [Azanla] on Monday claimed 
responsibility for Sunday's Baha'i church killing. A man calling 
himself "Mabuto" telephoned SAPA at 7.15am and said Azanla was 
behind "the attack". 
  When asked if he meant the attack at Mdantsane's Baha'i 
centre, near East London, he said: "That's right". He said he 
was telephoning from the Eastern Cape but when pressed for 
further information, the caller said he was "in a rush". 
  Three men were killed in an apparently racially motivated 
attack by gunmen who burst into the centre, lined them up 
against a wall and then shot them dead in cold blood. 
  SAPA could not independently verify the authenticity of the 
call.

  [Text] Durban March 13 SAPA -- Hundreds of hostel dwellers, 
believed to be Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters, have 
occupied the King Goodwill Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi where an 
African National Congress [ANC] rally was to be held on Sunday 
morning, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
news reports. The meeting was to be addressed by the ANC's 
Natal premier candidate Jacob Zuma and other ANC officials. 
  Police tried to negotiate with hostel representatives but 
were told the men would not leave. ANC officials were demanding 
that police disarm and remove the armed men who were blocking 
the entrance to the stadium. 
  Reporters on the scene said the situation was extremely 
volatile and was being watched by ANC officials from a nearby 
building which was surrounded by police vehicles. Police 
reinforcements were called in while a light aircraft circled 
overhead to monitor the crowd. Sporadic shooting was heard in 
the vicinity of the stadium on Saturday night but there were no 
reports of casualties.

  [Text] An IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporter has been 
killed at Umlazi, and thousands of ANC [African National 
Congress] supporters have begun marching on the nearby King 
Zwelithini Stadium. Witnesses say a man in a bakkie [pickup] 
began firing on groups of ANC supporters. A short while later 
he was stabbed to death and his vehicle was set alight. 
  The incident began when hundreds of IFP supporters occupied 
the stadium this morning ahead of a planned ANC rally there. 
The ANC contingent, who were turned away earlier by police 
using tear smoke, has regrouped and is heading for the stadium. 
The ANC says it is to lay charges against IFP members for 
contravention of the Electoral Act, and said that IFP supporters 
had flouted the terms of last month's agreement between Mr. 
Mandela and Dr. Buthelezi which guaranteed free political 
activity.

  [Text] Durban March 13 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] on Sunday [13 March] moved the venue of an 
election rally at Umlazi after Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
supporters occupied the stadium where it was to have been held, 
SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
reported. However, many of the ANC supporters who turned up at 
King Zwelithini Stadium in the township north of Durban remained 
behind to watch police and peace monitors trying to persuade IFP 
supporters to leave the stadium. Those remaining were still 
demanding the stadium be vacated. Police were negotiating with 
them also. 
  Earlier, an IFP supporter was stabbed to death and his 
vehicle set alight after he allegedly shot at ANC supporters 
outside the stadium. 
  Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa, top ANC 
official Mr Thabo Mbeki and five other ANC officials were kept 
waiting while new arrangements for the rally were made. ANC 
supporters were earlier teargassed by police, according to a 
radio report.

<F P=106> [By Clive Govender] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 13 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] on Sunday [13 March] lodged an official complaint 
with the Independent Electoral Commission, after Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] supporters occupied the venue of an ANC election 
rally in Umlazi, Durban. ANC regional monitoring co-ordinator 
Roy Ainslie, charged that Section 61 of the Electoral Act had 
been contravened. The section prohibits interference with free 
political activity. "We are extremely concerned that this could 
be a foretaste of what we can expect on election day unless 
something is done about the nature of policing." 
  He charged police were unable to contain the situation. 
Police could not be immediately reached for comment. 
  A tense standoff ensued earlier as thousands of ANC 
supporters thronged the street leading to the King Zwelithini 
Stadium, while about 500 metres away, several hundred IFP 
supporters mobilised in the stadium. Police fortified the road 
with armoured vehicles, and stood rifle at the ready, to prevent 
any potential clashes. 
  Later police teargassed ANC supporters who were preparing to 
leave shortly after an address by ANC National Chairman Thabo 
Mbeki, Southern Natal Chairman Jeff Radebe and Transkei ruler 
Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa. Supporters scattered for cover, and a 
volley of gunfire pierced the smoke-filled air. No one was 
reported injured. 
  Within minutes the street where ANC supporters had cheered 
on 
their leaders, was empty, bar the piles of shoes left behind by 
retreating men, women and children. Monitors on the scene 
charged that police had lobbed teargas canisters first, forcing 
fleeing supporters to fire. Minutes later, the stadium's 
occupants left in the opposite direction. 
  In a telephonic interview later, IFP spokesman Ed Tillet 
condoned the occupation of the stadium. He said the occupation 
was a response to continued attacks on its members in Umlazi and 
surrounding townships. "What's happened doesn't surprise me. 
Under normal circumstances we would never condone this. The 
extraordinary circumstances prevailing in the area have 
culminated in this action. We believe the ANC has got their just 
rewards. This is a taste of their own medicine." He added the 
occupation was sanctioned by the SA [South African] Hostel 
Dwellers Association and not the IFP. The association is 
non-aligned but IFP-sympathetic. 
  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] member Pravin Gordhan 
charged that police failure to remove IFP supporters from the 
stadium showed its partiality to them. "There is also an 
unwillingness by police to ensure the electoral act can be put 
into place throughout the country," Mr Gordhan told SAPA. 
  Meanwhile in his address to the mass of supporters, Mr Mbeki 
said: "The ANC are not cowards. If we were we would have 
entered the stadium, but because of our nature we prefer not to 
use violence." On a political note, Mr Mbeki charged IFP leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi was afraid to contest elections due to a 
fractional support base. He said if Mr Buthelezi's claim to 
have millions of IFP supporters were true, he should participate 
in the April poll. 
  Gen Holomisa, speaking in his capacity as chairman of the 
Military Council of Transkei, urged all homeland defence forces, 
and private armies to be placed under the control of the TEC. 
This would ensure that troop deployment would no longer be 
undertaken by the National Party Government, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Radio Pretoria Chairman Rev. Mossie van den </F>
Berg by Radio Pretoria announcer -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Van der Berg] Let us make an 
appeal and direct a plea to all our people. Let us -- man, 
woman and child across the breadth and length of our country -- 
throw in our weight behind the resistance strategy which the 
National Front is in the process of getting off the ground, and 
which we hope -- and I want to try and announce this at this 
stage -- on Friday 25 March will reach a climax by what we have 
decided to call, and which we will advertise during the coming 
week, `Capital Day in Pretoria.' During the coming week the 
National Front will start distributing information throughout 
the entire country. 
  This will begin on 22 March -- from the furthest corners, 
and 
it will gradually move toward Pretoria, and on 25th of this 
month we hope to -- for the first time -- stage a real 
demonstration in Pretoria not only for our people's enemies to 
see, but they must also feel it in their bodies that they cannot 
provide security and safety for anybody in this country without 
having satisfied the Boers regarding their own future. 
  My plea to all our listeners is: Let us stop flinging 
accusations: let us -- with more resolve than ever before -- 
tackle and perform the task at hand shoulder to shoulder. As 
far as we are concerned, it is a forgone conclusion: There is 
no way that we will get involved in the election on 27 April. 
Our task is to see to the resistance campaign and to muster the 
force of the Boer people. Thank you very much. 
  [Announcer] Reverend, I just want to ask you. You have just 
mentioned Capital Day on the 25th. What is going to happen on 
that day, or is it premature to talk about that now already? 
  [Van der Berg] We are going to get every man, woman, and 
child from throughout the country, and particularly from around 
Pretoria, to come to Pretoria and show the world that if there 
is one piece of soil on which the Boer nation can make an 
undisputed claim, then it is Pretoria. And from that point the 
freedom struggle must continue forward. 
  [Announcer] Where is this meeting going to take place? 
  [Van der Berg] We hope Pretoria will be too small [announcer 
laughs]. But the nucleus of the meeting will be at Church 
Square. 
  [Announcer] Rev. Mossie, thank you very much. We will get 
more detail in the course of next week to give our people.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  WEEKEND STAR </H6>
  Right-Wing Intervention in Bophuthatswana -- "Not one of the 
images coming out of Bophuthatswana in this week of mayhem has 
been pretty," begins the Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English in 
its 12-13 March edition in a page-10 editorial. "One element of 
the drama which stands out as particularly odious, alongside the 
looting and anarchy, is the involvement of the armed right 
wing....which took it upon itself to descend, bristling with 
weaponry, on Mmabatho and Mafikeng when the Bophuthatswana 
crisis was at its height." "Men with rights and duties no 
greater than ordinary civilians acted as an arrogant and 
dangerous vigilante gang -- a pack of Boere Bronsons," who have 
"delusions of military grandeur quite out of kilter with the 
realities of South Africa's power balances. There is no moral 
basis for their perception of themselves as gun-toting guardians 
of a higher cause." 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  Bophuthatswana Crisis, Election -- "South Africa has emerged 
from a nerve-stretching week somewhat shaken, but in better 
shape to conduct elections," claims the Johannesburg SUNDAY 
TIMES in English on 13 March in a page-28 editorial. "The way 
has been cleared, apart from some mopping up, for the elections 
to be extended into Mr Mangope's erstwhile fiefdom." The South 
African Defense Force restored Mangope to power once before and 
will not do it again. The SUNDAY TIMES is thankful that 
"fortunately, the registration of political parties has closed, 
and that ends the negotiation phase of the transition. There is 
no longer any need to woo intransigent, tinpot dictators." "As 
for the much-touted right-wing threat, it has been halved by the 
sorry performance of the white irregular forces, and halved 
again by the resignation of Gen Viljoen from the Volksfront 
[National Front]." 
<H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>
  `Lesson' From Bophuthatswana -- Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION 
in 
English on 13 March in a page-6 editorial states that "first, 
shall we pass our condolences to ALL families and the business 
community who lost their beloved ones and property, during the 
Bophuthatswana debacle. But we would be failing in our duties 
if we did not indicate who is to blame for this saga. It is the 
Bophuthatswana Christian Democratic Party (CDP) leader Lucas 
Mangope, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweeging's [Resistance Movement] 
(AWB) Eugene Terreblanche, Afrikaner Volksfront's [National 
Front] (AVF) General Constand Viljoen and Inkatha Freedom 
Party's (IFP) Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  Death of AWB Members in Bophuthatswana -- Johannesburg 
RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 13 March in a page-20 editorial condemns 
the Afrikaner Resistance Movement's senseless action in 
Mmabatho, Bophuthatswana, in which three of its members were 
killed recently. The editorial says the AWB action did not only 
do that organization harm, but also those whose case it pretends 
to be serving. "The corpses in the street were not yet cold 
when President Lucas Mangope announced that he had all along 
been planning to participate in the elections. The AWB men had 
been sent to help in upholding his government." "Have the three 
in Mmabatho died in vain? Perhaps not, provided their death has 
brought far right factions and their supporters to their 
senses." However, "the accusing finger for the Bophuthatswana 
debacle also points at the ANC [African National Congress], its 
leaders, and its unchecked supporters." In Cape Town, General 
Bantu Holomisa enthusiastically announced that Bophuthatswana 
has been given a stiff dose of "vitamin ANC," with kwaZulu's 
turn next. "Concerned South Africans now have reason to believe 
that dishing out `vitamins' is part and parcel of the ANC's 
election strategy for the rest of the country." "In such a 
climate, if calmness is not restored soon, another din -- a 
catastrophe perhaps -- is waiting in every street at any place." 
If the AWB is guilty of "hotheaded stupidity," the ANC's 
"plundering hordes" are just as guilty. "May all political 
parties read the writing of the warning finger of Mmabatho and 
take heed."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Election Progress After Bophuthatswana Unrest -- Referring 
to 
the unrest in Bophuthatswana, Johannesburg THE STAR in English 
on 14 March in a page-10 editorial says: "The main winner, now 
visible through the smoke and blood of battered Mmabatho, is 
South Africa's transition." "Two great obstacles have been 
removed from the path to democracy. First, citizens of the 
territory will be able to vote in the election, as is their 
right." Second, the "white rightwing now has an electoral 
vehicle," in the form of the Freedom Front, and "the continuing 
coherence of the Freedom Alliance is in question." The 
"authority of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] was 
enhanced, and the SADF [South African Defense Force] was shown 
to be willing to obey constitutional authority. The country 
stared once more at the spectre of civil war, and shrank back. 
It was an awful way to achieve progress, but that is the 
outcome." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  TEC Responsible for Ensuring Free Political Activity in 
kwaZulu -- "The blame for what happened in Bop [Bophuthatswana] 
lies squarely at the door of ousted President Lucas Mangope; the 
ANC [African National Congress] exploited his autocratic 
obstinacy and South Africa's lack of resolve, and is now 
claiming a splendid political victory," notes Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 14 March in a page-18 editorial. 
"The confrontation over democracy in Bophuthatswana should have 
happened long ago. A political ultimatum, backed by the threat 
of financial sanctions and military intervention, would have 
saved the lives and property lost in the past few days. Instead 
the TEC and the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], charged 
with ensuring free political activity, shied away from 
conflict." As for the people in kwaZulu, they "have the same 
right to vote as people in Bophuthatswana. If they are denied 
it, there will be the same confrontation and for the same 
reasons. Whether or not Inkatha participates in the election, 
the TEC and the IEC need to make it clear now that they will 
act, forcibly if needs be, to ensure free political activity." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Government, TEC Action Needed Against Election Spoilers -- 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 March in a page-10 
editorial says Bophuthatswana's Lucas Mangope "contributed 
largely to his own downfall" by announcing, "in the face of a 
paralysing strike by the homeland's civil servants, that there 
would be no elections in Bophuthatswana and, by implication, no 
re-incorporation into South Africa." "The key lesson of 
Bophuthatswana is that nobody should be allowed to mess with the 
lives of ordinary people and hold to ransom the democratic 
process. The Government and the TEC will have to act with much 
greater speed and ruthlessness against others who, for instance, 
are going to attempt to sabotage the April elections. If they 
don't act, they can be sure the people will." 
<H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>
  Don't Postpone Elections -- Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in 
English on 13 March in a page-6 editorial notes that the Inkatha 
Freedom Party (IFP) and General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front 
"are now asking for the postponement of the election date." 
"Clearly, since the ANC has agreed that there should be 
mediation, we can only assume that it also understands that, 
should such mediation not deliver by April 27, there will be no 
election on that date. On the other hand, should mediation bear 
fruit in a month the ANC must understand that it will not be 
able to convince the IFP to take part in the polls, because 
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi will -- as he has already done -- 
argue that he has not had enough time to campaign." Therefore, 
"whether we grant a volkstaat [homeland], give Natal to Chief 
Buthelezi, follow the transitional constitution or stay as we 
are -- conflict is inevitable, because neither of the above will 
ever satisfy spoilers."

  [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] General Constand Viljoen has resigned 
from his position as the chairman of the AVF's Directorate of 
Generals. Gen Viljoen announced the decision at a news 
conference in Pretoria on Saturday [12 March], adding that 
Friday's events in Bophuthatswana had convinced him to take part 
in the election under the Freedom Front [FF], and to take on the 
National Party [NP] and the African National Congress [ANC] on a 
political level. He added he would remain as military adviser 
to Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg. 
  Gen Viljoen said he doubted if he would ever carry out 
another operation with the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging 
[Resistance Movement -- AWB]. He said they had disobeyed orders 
not to enter Bophuthatswana on Friday and once inside refused to 
leave. 
  Turning to the candidates list of the Freedom Front, CP 
[Conservative Party] MP Pieter Mulder, who also attended the 
news conference, revealed the names of other CP MPs who might 
contest the election under the FF banner. 
  They are Dr. Mulder, his brother Corne Mulder (Randfontein), 
Mr Joseph Chiole (Pretoria West), Carl Werth (Natal CP leader) 
who two days ago resigned from the CP, Pieter Groenewald 
(Stilfontein) who submitted the list on Friday night, Mr Willem 
Botha (Uitenhage), and others. 
  Gen Viljoen, who is heading the FF candidate list, said a 
meeting would be held soon to choose a leader. His name 
appeared on top in order to beat the registration deadline. "I 
don't want to pull away the AVF's power base, I intend to create 
my own," he said. Dr. Mulder confirmed a committee had been 
established to maintain unity in their ranks. This was aimed at 
managing a split which the decision to participate in the 
elections could cause. There were differences in strategy over 
how to obtain a volkstaat [homeland] but there was no division 
over the concept itself, he said.

  [Text] The Freedom Alliance has voiced its support for 
President Lucas Mangope after this morning's meeting in 
Kimberley. The alliance strongly attacked the South African 
Government for taking over control of Bophuthatswana. 
  [Begin recording] [Inkatha Freedom Party President 
Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, in English] We feel what has happened to President 
Mangope in Bophuthatswana is a disgrace. We believe that what 
has happened to President Mangope is in fact unchristian. We 
feel that President Mangope has been betrayed, has been 
double-crossed, and we feel that it strengthens our resolve 
never to take the word of President de Klerk or his government. 
  [Correspondent Andries van Zyl] The meeting decided that 
General Viljoen, who has submitted a list of candidates for his 
Freedom Front, should withdraw from the alliance. 
  [Viljoen] Our participation in the election depends on a 
complete accord -- there are actually two accords to be 
fulfilled. The first accord has been entered into with the ANC 
[African National Congress] and the government. 
  [Van Zyl] Dr. Hartzenberg said that the CP [Conservative 
Party] is working hard to prevent a split after rumors that 
certain CP members support General Viljoen. 
  [Hartzenberg, in English] We do not promote splits. We are 
not in favor of splits, and we try to prevent it. Therefore, we 
talk to each other, and we see whether we can come to a solution. 
  [Van Zyl] General Viljoen admitted that the tug of war 
concerning participation in the election could lead to a split 
in Afrikaner ranks. 
  [Viljoen] I am very worried about this. It is not a good 
situation and I have tried to bring about Afrikaner unity, but 
one reaches a stage where you have to make such a decision. If 
I do reach a certain decision, then I want to state very clearly 
that this is not as a result of personal interest. The only 
factor I consider is what is in the best interest of my people, 
and I am there to give the strategic guidance. [end recording]

  [Text] The deposed Bophuthatswana president, Dr. Lucas 
Mangope, says the South African Government has not taken over 
power in the country, but has looted it politically. Speaking 
to the media before the Freedom Alliance meeting in Kimberly 
this morning, Dr. Mangope said he still regarded himself as 
president of Bophuthatswana, though operating from his residence. 
  He said the executive management of his political party, the 
Bophuthatswana Christian Democratic Party, would meet later 
today to discuss a possible election alliance with the 
North-West Democratic Party. The Bophuthatswana Christian 
Democratic Party has not registered as a political party, but 
the North-West Democratic Party has. 
  The alliance meeting is to be attended by the leader of the 
Freedom Front, General Constand Viljoen, the leader of the 
Conservative Party, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, and the leader of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Bophuthatswana President Dr. Lucas </F>
Mangope at the meeting of Freedom Alliance leaders in Kimberley 
by unidentified correspondents on the "Newsline" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] What is the purpose of this meeting 
today? 
  [Mangope] Well, it is to look generally at the situation and 
to determine the strategy forward. 
  [Correspondent] Doctor, what is your position in the 
politics 
right now? 
  [Mangope] I have no intention to give up political activity. 
I am determined politically to fight because, as you are aware, 
there has in Bophuthatswana been a lot of looting that has taken 
place. The African National Congress [ANC], the [South African] 
Communist Party, and the National Party government have looted 
Bophuthatswana politically also, and I must fight to correct 
that situation. 
  [Correspondent] Doctor, you have been dismissed as president 
of Bophuthatswana by the South African government. Do you 
accept it? 
  [Mangope] When Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Maharaj of the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council] came to see me to tell me that 
I would no more be president, I told them first of all that I 
had done no wrong at all, constitutionally. I had not broken 
any law at all. I told them that they have no right whatsoever 
to remove me; it was the Batswana people who elected me as 
president, and to show that they were out to loot Bophuthatswana 
politically, they refused me even to address my people to tell 
them that they had come to tell me that I would no more be 
president. 
  [Correspondent] Do you still regard yourself as president of 
Bophuthatswana? 
  [Mangope] I am still president of Bophuthatswana. 
Constitutionally and legally, I am president of Bophuthatswana. 
  [Correspondent] Where are you operating from at this point 
in 
time? What's the status of your office? 
  [Mangope] Well, I'm operating from my private residence. 
  [Correspondent] So the South African Government took over 
control of Bophuthatswana. What's your reaction on that? 
  [Mangope] They didn't take over control. They looted 
control. There was a lot of criminal looting in Mmabatho, and 
the South African Government looted political power. 
  [Correspondent] Doctor, in short, your reaction, your 
feelings on what has happened, the events of the past week, and 
your position right now? 
  [Mangope] Well, I think it augurs frighteningly for the 
future. The future is bleak with the type of communistic 
political activity that I've seen. I think we have reason to be 
terribly concerned for the future. 
  [Correspondent] Is your party going to take part in the 
election? 
  [Mangope] Do you know, it is very interesting. When I told 
Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Maharaj, after they had told me that I was 
deposed, that I would be taking part because I have political 
principles and convictions that I want to espouse, they said I 
would not be allowed. They have no right to stop me from taking 
part in politics. 
  [Correspondent] Do you still have all your cabinet ministers 
in your government? 
  [Mangope] My cabinet ministers are 100 percent behind me. My 
Christian Democratic Party is still intact. We are doing 
everything we can. If we are allowed, we want to register and 
fight the elections, because we want to expose the ANC, the 
Communist Party, the National Party government, for what they 
are. You know, Mr. Pik Botha came accompanied by Mr. Maharaj, 
who apparently came to ensure that Mr. Botha carried out his 
instructions -- Mr. Maharaj's instructions... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Can I ask you, please, the 
last 
question from my side. The South African Government, the 
National Party government, gave independence to Bophuthatswana 
many years ago. Now the same National Party comes and says to 
you, fine, you are dismissed as president, and you are not 
independent anymore. 
  [Mangope] If that is not a diamond bright example of 
dishonesty, then I don't know what is. Freedom and 
independence, once given, can never be taken back. 
  [Correspondent] Are you considering any steps to gain 
control 
of Bophuthatswana? 
  [Mangope] I am going to be about, politically. I am not done 
with it. I want to assure you that. I want to expose, for the 
good of South Africa, for the good of South Africa, I want to 
expose the ANC, the Communist Party, and the South African 
Government for what they are. For much too long, ever since the 
beginning of the negotiations, we have had secret deals between 
the National Party government and the Communist Party, and the 
ANC. As a result of that, as a result of such secret deals, 
such as is evidenced by the Record of Understanding, we have 
this flawed constitution. And I want to tell the South African 
public, you know, each time they have come to me, it has always 
been at night. Even Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Maharaj got to my 
house at night. I don't know what the reason is for that. 
  [Correspondent] What's your comment about this irony that in 
the 1988 attempted coup, Pik Botha came to your assistance, and 
today it is the same man who orders you out of office? 
  [Mangope] Doesn't that expose the man for what he is? Does 
that not expose the man for what he is? 
  [Correspondent] There's an observation that people voted 
with 
their feet to ensure that they have free political activity. 
Your comment? 
  [Mangope] I told Mr. Botha and Mr. Maharaj on the 15th of 
this month, this is next Tuesday, that's tomorrow, my parliament 
would be taking a decision on whether to register or not, and 
flowing from that decision, free political activity would ensue. 
I also told them, flowing from that decision, that my 
parliament would endorse the South African law that puts into 
being the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. But do you 
know what? They would not allow me those two days only to put 
this matter to my parliament. They would not allow me to 
address my people, my people who elected me as president. They 
would not allow me to address my people and tell them that I had 
told Botha, that I had told Maharaj, that they do not have the 
right to remove me. They have no legal or constitutional right 
to remove me. They would not allow me that. 
  [Correspondent] Do you still regard yourself, then, as the 
president? 
  [Mangope] I am constitutionally and legally president. They 
have looted political power. 
  [Correspondent] What is then going to happen to this 
parliamentary session? Are you going to go ahead outside of 
Mmabatho or whatever? 
  [Mangope] Well, I think you should direct that question to 
Dr. van der Walt, who is the so-called administrator of 
Bophuthatswana.

<F P=106> [By Jonathon Rees] </F>
  [Text] Kimberley March 14 SAPA -- Freedom Front leader Gen 
Constand Viljoen has resigned from the Freedom Alliance and on 
Monday [14 March] vowed to fight the African National Congress 
[ANC] and National Party [NP] with all means at his disposal. "I 
will fight them on the beaches. I will fight them on the 
plains," he said, adding that the main reason he had registered 
his Freedom Front for the April elections was to prevent an 
ANC-NP monopoly in a constitution-making government of national 
unity. 
  He blamed the NP and ANC for last week's Bophuthatswana 
violence, flaws in the constitution and unrest. 
  Speaking in Kimberley after Freedom Alliance leaders met to 
discuss their circumstances after recent developments, Gen 
Viljoen said the Freedom Front might apply for membership of the 
alliance. 
  Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said 
the 
alliance was outraged at the "unchristian, double-crossing 
betrayal" by the government of Bophuthatswana President Lucas 
Mangope. 
  Mr Mangope said he still considered himself president of the 
territory and was considering legal action againt the 
government. "They had no right whatsoever to oust me. I am 
constitutionally and legally still the president of 
Bophuthatswana." 
  Gen Viljoen said his participation in the elections would 
still depend on certain guarantees from the ANC and NP. Although 
worried he could cause a split in the Afrikaner right wing, he 
said his departure from the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner 
National Front, AVF] would more likely benefit Afrikaner unity 
in the long term because there were now two groups on different 
paths but with the same objective -- self-determination and a 
"volkstaat" [homeland]. 
  Gen Viljoen said his new Freedom Front did not intend to 
draw 
support away from the Afrikaner Volksfront or the Conservative 
Party [CP], but to recruit other Afrikaners and ex-NP members. 
This would reinforce support for the volkstaat ideal, he 
said."What is important is that we must fight the NP and fight 
the ANC with everything available...on all possible fields we 
must attack." 
  He said his decision to leave the AVF was prompted partly by 
differences in opinion and political thinking with its 
controlling bodies. 
  But the last straw was the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] and its refusal to obey 
instructions during last weeks' military intervention in 
Bophuthatswana. 
  "To me it is very clear that a military option with the AWB 
would be a most dangerous thing to do. I am afraid I have had 
enough proof that I can not trust them to obey orders." 
  Gen Viljoen did not, however, rule out a military solution 
without the AWB. Asked about reported looming splits in the CP, 
its leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said although there were 
"differences of opinion on a small scale" talks were under way 
in a bid to stave off divisions. 
  He was confident of a volkstaat being achieved. "We will 
have 
our self-determination and freedom in our territory. It is not 
possible to stop us achieving our ideals."

  [Text] Pretoria March 14 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front, AVF] will not contest the April 
elections and its power base is virtually undamaged, AVF leader 
Ferdi Hartzenberg said on Monday [14 March]. The decision to 
boycott the poll had been re-affirmed by the AVF's highest body 
at its latest meeting, Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement. 
  In an apparent reference to Gen Constand Viljoen's 
resignation from the directorate of AVF generals, Dr Hartzenberg 
said the AVF's power base was "virtually uninjured". The AVF 
would continue to pursue its ideal of attaining freedom and 
self-determination for the Afrikaner/Boerevolk [Boer people], he 
said. 
  "Participation in the elections is viewed as a fatal choice 
for the existence of our people and I as leader of the AVF can 
never commit myself to that. 
  "The necessary internal organisational measures have been 
arranged so that the AVF can continue with its task with the 
least possible disruption. 
  "The power base of the AVF is virtually intact and we 
continue with the implementation of our planning for the next 
weeks," said Dr Hartzenberg, who is also "president" of the 
right-wing transitional assembly.

  [Text] Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg 
says the registration of General Constand Viljoen's Freedom 
Front is a political mistake. 
  Addressing about 250 people at a public meeting in 
Nelspruit, 
Dr. Hartzenberg said he had great respect for Gen. Viljoen on 
military matters, but he said the fact that the general had 
offered his Freedom Front to the Inkatha Freedom Party and 
Bophuthatswana to take part in the election, ensured 
participation in the election and not support for a volkstaat 
[homeland]. Dr. Hartzenberg reiterated his view that 
participation would lend credibility to the election, and his 
party would therefore not take part in it. 
  [Begin Hartzenberg recording, in Afrikaans -- in progress] 
In 
this case the constitutional principle -- that a nation must 
have the right to self-determination, to have the right to 
choose its own government -- is being cast aside completely. 
Here our people do not choose our government, other nations 
collectively choose a government for South Africa, and that 
constitutional principle becomes completely crushed. [end

that he supported General Constand Viljoen. He said he is still 
committed to the National Front and to the CP Executive 
Committee's decision not to participate in the election. Mr. 
Hoon said Mr. Viljoen had recently made statements with which he 
could not identify. One of them was that 85 percent of his 
fatherland will fall under an ANC [African National Congress] 
government. 
  Another development is that CP MP for Lydenburg, Mr. Dries 
Bruwer, has announced his resignation from politics. He had 
been the CP's spokesman on agriculture. Mr. Bruwer had also 
been chairman of the Transvaal Agricultural Union.

  [Text] She is scared for her husband's safety, says Mrs. 
Ristie Viljoen, wife of General Constand Viljoen. "I am afraid 
they will shoot my husband," she told RAPPORT yesterday. 
  While right-wing anger has been boiling over this week over 
Gen. Viljoen's decision to participate in the coming election, 
Mrs. Viljoen lifted the veil on warnings last Sunday that an 
assassination plot on her husband was being planned. 
  Two telephone calls, in which Gen. Viljoen was told that an 
attempt could be made to assassinate him, led to the forming of 
a thick security cordon around the Viljoen couple while they 
relaxed on their farm near Ohrigstad. 
  They were warned in two telephone calls shortly after their 
return from an excursion on the farm to inspect Dr. Viljoen's 
cattle. 
  Soon thereafter, Conservative Party leader Ferdi 
Hartzenberg, 
who probably knew about the threats, phoned Gen. Viljoen. 
  Almost immediately after the warnings a large number of men 
clad in "brown uniforms" and armed with rifles were employed on 
the farm to protect Gen. Viljoen. 
  Mrs. Viljoen says she was unnerved by a foreign television 
crew which lingered unusually long on their farm and even hung 
around the farm dwelling. She was concerned that they too had 
heard about the threat and wanted to be on the scene -- should 
something happen. 
  Gen. Viljoen, who is known for his bravery as a soldier, did 
not sleep at his usual place that night, but rather spent the 
night elsewhere. 
  "I am afraid they will shoot my husband, but the Lord has a 
purpose for everything," a visibly concerned Mrs. Viljoen told 
RAPPORT yesterday. "It would be terrible if he had to go in 
this way, especially since the far right wingers are the people 
that he always wanted to protect." 
  She is worried that there is not sufficient control over 
some 
right-wing elements. "Yesterday in Mmabatho they threw military 
discipline overboard and refused to accept his instructions." 
  However, she finds solace in the new political direction her 
husband is heading in after his decision to take part in the 
election. 
  Her husband -- "he is the most loyal man possible" -- has 
done all he could to bring about right-wing unity, but it has 
just not been possible.

  Azapo [Azanian People's Organization], the local ANC

Human Rights organization are in the forefront of a campaign to 
oust Dr. van der Walt from his post. Azapo says it rejects Dr. 
van der Walt's appointment. A spokesman, Mr. Philip Kepadisa, 
said that they will make Bophuthatswana ungovernable through 
stayaway action and strikes. The ANC says Dr. van der Walt is a 
companion of Mr. Mangope and has worked with Mr. Mangope to 
oppose free political movement in Bophuthatswana. Lawyers for 
Human Rights say they are drawing up a report of complaints 
against Dr. van der Walt. This will be handed over to the 
Transitional Executive Council later this week.

  [Text] Johannesburg Mar 14 SAPA -- State President F W de 
Klerk said on Monday [14 March] those still calling for a 
Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] were "chasing a dream", because 
the economic and demographic realities of South Africa did not 
allow for a volkstaat. He warned that any attempt by the 
rightwing to disrupt the election process would lead to tragedy, 
"and (still) the process will continue". 
  Addressing businessmen in Johannesburg during his one-day 
election tour of Pretoria and the East Rand, Mr de Klerk said 
the events which unfolded during the demise of the 
Bophuthatswana government should make the rightwing "stop in 
their tracks" and think. Referring to the Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] invasion 
of the homeland which led to the death of three rightwingers, Mr 
de Klerk said "the chaos caused by the AWB and (Freedom Front 
leader Constand) Viljoen's people, should make the Conservative 
Party's Dr (Ferdi) Hartzenberg stop and think". 
  Mr de Klerk said a government of national unity under a new 
dispensation would supply a political framework which would 
create growth and encourage investment. He said South Africa had 
an important role to play on the African continent and the 
international community saw South Africa as the gateway to 
Africa.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Carel Boshoff, head of the Afrikaner </F>
Freedom Foundation] 
  [Text] The intention of the Freedom Front to take part in 
the coming national election is based on the fact that the 
Afrikaner needs more than one instrument in his struggle for 
freedom in his own fatherland. The ultimate goal to obtain his 
own volkstaat [homeland] is indispensable; it's just a question 
of how to attain it. 
  From this point of departure participation in the election 
has got nothing to do with the acceptance of the 1993 
constitution, nor with the legitimacy of the new government. 
Whoever the government may be, the presence of Afrikaners in 
the elected structures will be to claim their volkstaat and to 
make use of every means to achieve their goal. 
  More or less 2.8-million Afrikaners would not be wise to 
rely 
on power or numbers alone. Blacks in South Africa outnumber 
them by more than 80 percent; unfortunately for both they 
occupied the same regions in the country. For the Afrikaner, in 
order to claim a volkstaat of their own, they should become the 
indisputable majority in the region where they intend to 
substantiate their claim. 
  That is not possible before April 27, the day of the 
election, and, therefore, every opportunity should be taken and 
all power and knowledge should be applied to bring it about. 
During that time the Afrikaners should consolidate their 
interests within the new South Africa, insist on their claim for 
a volkstaat to be recognised and accommodated in the 
constitution in an irreversible way. 
  But there is real doubt the transitional constitution does 
not provide for that. Political scientists De Villiers and 
Sindane say: "A unitary system of government has only one power 
centre and all sub-national units exist at the behest of the 
centre. The central government can delegate powers to the 
sub-national units -- regions, states or provinces -- and can 
take these back at will. It can dissolve the sub-national units 
and create new boundaries or new units. Resource allocation as 
well as budgeting is centrally done. The logic for the 
establishment of a unitary system is different from that of a 
federal system." 
  In a full page analysis of what is called "the final hurdle" 
in BUSINESS DAY (March 3), a group of concerned business people 
concentrates on the two real issues: the powers of the 
provinces are inadequate; the central government can override 
all provincial powers. It says: under the new constitution and 
despite the most recent concessions, the central government can 
override the social welfare policy of a province. The central 
government can override a province that allows private 
hospitals. Provinces cannot determine their own trading hours 
for shops or regular street traders. Provinces have far less 
regional powers than Punjab in India or Sarawk in Malaysia or 
New South Wales in Australia or Ontario in Canada or Texas in 
the United States. 
  On the other hand, the ANC [African National Congress] will 
easily win the central election and will have all the central 
power. In regions they win their regional policies can be 
identical to their central polices. Therefore we appeal to the 
ANC/National Party to agree to the following changes: increase 
provincial powers meaningfully. Remove central control over 
these powers, and safeguard these changes effectively. 
  For the Afrikaner that is what it is all about. To enter 
into a new dispensation without such changes is a risk to our 
national life. Therefore demands for the change of the 
constitution is still hampering the election and it may even 
cause a deadlock. The concession made by the Freedom Front to 
register provincially for the election is a gesture of 
willingness towards the government/ANC. This was in reaction to 
a gesture by the ANC/government adding a new principle 
authorising the constitutional assembly "to include in the new 
constitutional text provision for communities sharing a common 
cultural and language heritage to exercise a recognised form of 
internal self-determination should it be proved that there is 
substantial support in such a community for such 
self-determination." 
  But even this addition does not guarantee a volkstaat 
because 
it is still possible for the winning party to practically 
override all efforts of self-determination in the regions and 
even declare the whole country as one province. 
  The deadlock between the parties has led to the request for 
international mediation. It is my belief that we need the 
mediation of a number of objective experts acceptable for the 
different parties. The success of mediation has been proved in 
a number of crucial situations all over the world and it must be 
applied in our situation. 
  If all the obstacles are eliminated and the Afrikaners need 
for a volkstaat is recognised, there should be no reason why 
they, as members of the Freedom Alliance, would not take part in 
the election. When that happens there is enough reason to 
believe that the Freedom Alliance may become the second 
strongest power in South African politics. 
  The Afrikaners can begin immediately to plan and develop 
their volkstaat and other members of Freedom Alliance should be 
accommodated in a real federation according to their will.

<F P=106> [Statement by the ANC issued on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
11 Mar] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  A Realistic Programme for Real Jobs. A Press 
Statement from the African National Congress. </H3>
  The ANC [African National Congress] election manifesto is 
titled: "For Jobs, Peace and Freedom". There is good reason why 
`jobs' comes first. Without jobs to get the country's more than 
3 million unemployed into work, there is little chance of peace 
or freedom for any of us -- the main aim of all ANC policies. 
  Our election programme promises the creation of at least 
two-and-a-half million jobs within five years! Real jobs -- not 
charity handouts. Real useful work -- not useless "job creation" 
schemes for digging holes and filling them in again. 
Two-and-a-half million real jobs, which will provide a real base 
for reconstruction and a new South Africa, and for the 
development of its industrial, commercial and agricultural 
sectors. Two-and-a-half million people taken from the ranks of 
the desperate and the hopeless, and given the chance of dignity 
and human development which only real, secure, full-time useful 
work can provide. 
  This is the promise and the substance of the ANC 
Reconstruction and Development Plan. It is not a glib 
generalisation to fill the temporary demands of our election 
campaign. It is a long-term plan which sets the social 
parameters for an ANC government for years to come. 
  New jobs cannot be created by reckless spending on ephemeral 
schemes. In our programme, the two-and-a-half million jobs will 
be created steadily, through the unfolding over a five-year time 
scale of an unprecedentedly massive programme of essential 
public works. 
  These are the detailed focus points of that programme: 
  The building of up to 300,000 low cost homes a year, 
totalling at least one million in the first 5 years. A national 
network of primary health care centres with maternity care 
services and safe supervised childbirth facilities for virtually 
all women. Clean on-site water supplies to all households in 
urban and rural areas, with first priority given to schools and 
clinics. Electricity supply to 25 million households within 
five years, with first priority for schools and clinics. 
Tele-communications to all schools and clinics within two 
years, and rapid expansion of the service nation-wide 
thereafter. Immunisation against disease for 90 percent Of 
children within three years. A range of free and nation-wide 
health-care services for the aged, the disabled and the 
unemployed. The training of three thousand community 
development workers in 5 years, and half the nationally required 
district health workers within 3. Expansion of the schooling 
system, to give at least ten years schooling to all children, in 
classes of not more than 40. 
  Those are the numerically determined elements of the 
programme. There are further unquantified elements, such as the 
building of road and rail networks, setting up vocational and 
management training schemes, providing nation-wide sanitation 
and refuse disposal services, and so on. 
  These projects will create hundreds of thousands -- perhaps 
millions of new jobs, directly. The indirect spinoffs will 
create many more, from such auxilliary activities as manufacture 
and supply of materials, to transportation, training and 
retraining, planning, marketing and so on. 
  This massive plan of development and construction cannot be 
carried through by central and provincial governments alone. To 
even attempt to do so would require the creation of an equally 
massive bureaucracy and administrative apparatus. This is a 
burden our country cannot afford. 
  We will therefore encourage the private sector, through with 
special incentives, to take a large part of the financial and 
material burden on themselves. We will encourage all portions of 
the private sector to shift its focus from the area of 
speculation and luxury production to the new opportunities to 
enterprise contained in the ANC Reconstruction and Development 
Programme. 
  We will encourage citizens everywhere to take full part in 
the detailed planning of the programme through democratic 
peoples' forums, and so tailor the programme to meet detailed 
local needs. We will encourage citizens to volunteer to assist 
the paid teams which will be providing the main man and 
woman-power needed for the physical realisation of all the local 
development projects. 
  We will set the same criteria for the planning and for the 
execution of the whole programme, viz: preference to be given 
to small private enterprises as contractors and suppliers before 
the large monopolies favoured by the past NP [National Party] 
regime. Preference to be given to labour intensive rather than 
capital intensive methods of construction and service provision, 
to maximise the number of new jobs. Priority in the 
distribution of jobs and contracts to be given to the most 
dispossessed and deprived sectors of the population, rather than 
the rich favoured by the NP regime. Priority in the allocation 
of labour, material and finance to be given to those regions 
worst neglected by the NP regime. Priority in opportunity to be 
given to women rather than men, and to blacks before whites, to 
redress the inequalities left over from the NP, regime. 
  We will pay for this scheme without any general need to 
raise 
tax rates, partly through savings from by cutting back the NP's 
swollen bureaucratic apparatus; partly by cutting out the waste, 
the multiplication of administrative structures, and the 
corruption which flourished in the NP era; but mainly with new 
revenue created from turning thousands of unemployed into 
employed taxpayers, and from taxes payable by private-sector 
enterpreneurs on their new profits from the public works 
programme. 
This is the ANC programme for jobs. It is realistic, and it is 
realisable.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 13 SAPA -- African National 
Congress [ANC] [Orange] Free State premiership candidate Patrick 
Lekota has re-emphasised land redistribution as ANC policy, SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. 
Addressing a farm workers forum in the Senekal District on 
Sunday, Mr Lekota said an ANC government intended buying farms 
that were being put up for sale. These will in turn be resold 
to aspirant trained black farmers. He said these farmers would 
be assisted with equipment and implements. Mr Lekota said an 
ANC government would allow farmworkers to form and belong to 
labour movements. He said farmworkers would not have to work 
longer than 40-hours a week.

Holomisa says once the ANC [African National Congress] comes 
into power it will see to it that all defense force weapons kept 
in private homes are returned to the force. He was addressing 
students at the University of the Western Cape today. 
  [Begin recording] [SABC correspondent Gary Alfonso] Gen. 
Holomisa told a cheering crowd of about 3,000 students that more 
people have died of violence in the period before the election 
than during the liberation struggle. He said there is an urgent 
need to restore law and order in the contry, something which, he 
said, the National Party is unable to do. He said the ANC 
envisages a two-phased process of disarmament. 
  [Holomisa, in English] We will refer the matter to the 
constituent assembly and it is debated there, so that all those 
weapons which the right-wingers are carrying all over the 
streets of South Africa can be returned back to the stores where 
they belong. 
  [Alfonso] Gen. Holomisa said the second phase will involve 
cooperation with South Africa's neighbors to prevent illegal 
weapons from being brought into the country. [end recording]

  [Text] The National Housing Forum has given the go-ahead 
for the 90 billion rands housing scheme for the poor which was 
announced by the government three weeks ago. The forum, which 
put the final touches to the plan yesterday, said a subsidy 
policy would be in place for individual, collective and rental 
ownership. The plan would also provide for a mechanism to 
obtain mortgage and nonmortgage-based finance. 
  The forum's decision to support the government's housing 
subsidy scheme has been welcomed by Housing Minister Louis 
Shill. Mr. Shill caused a stir several weeks ago by announcing 
the scheme while it was still under discussion. 
  In a separate development, the government has approved the 
provision of funds to begin the construction of the flood 
attenuation [as heard] dam outside Ladysmith. The funds, which 
will form part of the department of water affairs and forestry 
budget, will become available on the first of next month.

  [Text] Durban March 15 SAPA -- At least six people were 
killed and seven injured in Enseleni township on Natal's North 
Coast on Tuesday [15 March] when gunmen in a bakkie [pickup 
truck] sprayed early morning commuters with gunfire, police 
said. Durban police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said eyewitnesses 
saw a red bakkie carrying armed men into the township, about 
15km north of Empangeni, at about 4am. 
  "They opened fire at two different bus stops, killing six 
people and injuring seven. The victims were shot at random." 
  The attackers were armed with AK-47 rifles, 9mm pistols and 
shotguns, said Maj Naidoo. The attack comes amid heightened 
political tension in the volatile northern Natal region and 
ahead of a visit to the University of Zululand by African 
National Congress President Nelson Mandela, who will address 
supporters there on Saturday.

  [Text] Durban March 15 SAPA -- Roads were barricaded by 
rocks and burning tyres in Umlazi on Tuesday [15 March] to 
reinforce an African National Congress [ANC] march and stayaway 
to demand free political activity in the sprawling Durban 
township, police said. The Umlazi sub-region of the ANC planned 
a march at 10am to protest against the blockade of its rally at 
the King Zwelithini Stadium in the township at the weekend. 
  Thousands of Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters occupied 
the stadium on Sunday, preventing ANC supporters from entering 
to hold a rally. At least five people died in violence 
apparently linked to the confrontation. 
  Meanwhile, Umlazi's usually busy main roads were quiet on 
Tuesday morning with almost no vehicle movement in the area. 
  District kwaZulu police commissioner Brig Alwyn Burger 
described the township as "tense and almost lifeless". He 
reported several barricades on main roads and alleged there had 
been intimidation. "People feel threatened and they're staying 
at home." 
  But, Umlazi's ANC Secretary Thami Ndlela denied allegations 
of intimidation against his organisation. "It's not the policy 
of the ANC," he said. He added that the overwhelming majority of 
Umlazi's residents supported Tuesday's protest. 
  "We're expecting tens of thousands at our march. They are 
not 
only ANC supporters but people like church and businessmen who 
are very concerned at Sunday's events." He said a memorandum 
would be delivered to the local magistrate, demanding free 
political activity and noting the IFP's alleged contravention of 
the Electoral Act. 
  "We're also calling for the rapid deployment of the national 
peace keeping force here to replace the kwaZulu Police and 
Internal Stability Unit," Mr Ndlela said. 
  "We believe these forces are partial and they demonstrated 
this by not acting to remove the people from the stadium at the 
weekend."

  [Text] Durban March 11 SAPA -- Flags were still flying in 
Ciskei's capital Bisho on Friday [11 March] afternoon, and the 
homeland government said order had been restored to the ranks of 
dissatisfied soldiers who protested against pension payments 
this week. Ciskei government spokesman Cedric Harrop allayed 
fears of an uprising. 
  "There's orchestrated political incitement to scare people 
stiff about their pensions, but it's totally under control and 
everything is back to normal," he said. 
  The Ciskei Civil Servants Association (Cisa), however, said 
there was still cause for concern about pension payments. 
  On Thursday and Friday soldiers from 1 Ciskei Battalion 
demanded a direct address from the homeland's military ruler, 
Brig Oupa Gqozo, who later spoke to them. 
  Senior civil servants in the homeland said soldiers wanted 
to 
be paid their accumulated pensions before the April elections, 
to secure their money before a new government took control. Mr 
Harrop said a new government could not interfere with the fund 
because it was independently managed by an international 
company. "It's immune from interference from this or any other 
government." He said the only people who could benefit from the 
fund were Ciskei civil servants after retirement. 
  Other sectors of the civil service had expressed disquiet 
about their pensions in the past, and the soldiers' protest was 
just another ripple of general discontent. Mr Harrop said: 
"Ciskei people, particularly civil servants, occasionally get 
excited when they've had a bit to drink, but they calm down 
after a while." 
  Cisa spokesman Mthimkulu Mashiya said although Bisho was 
calm, there was no telling how civil servants would react to 
decisions made about their pensions, especially because the fund 
was controlled unilaterally. 
  He said a meeting was planned next week when civil servants 
would address the pension fund issue directly. The fund was 
administered without workers' representation and "I don't see 
how they can be happy with it", he added. 
  Rumours of an uprising were doing the rounds in Bisho on 
Thursday, some prompted by events in Bophuthatswana and others 
by South African Minister of Law and Order Hernus Kriel telling 
a meeting there was talk of a Ciskei coup. 
  Mr Harrop said as far as he could gather the soldiers were 
satisfied and had returned to their posts -- "the flags are 
still flying."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Bophuthatswana Events To Encourage ANC To Topple Buthelezi 
-- 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 11 March in its page-6 
editorial maintains that "events in Bophuthatswana have put paid 
to the involvement of any members of the Freedom Alliance in the 
election other than Ciskei." The incidents in Bophuthatswana 
will "cast a shadow over South Africa, encouraging ANC [African 
National Congress] attempts to topple Chief Buthelezi and 
increasing the chances of White Right resistance." 
  Warning Against `Bophuthatswana Treatment' for kwaZulu -- 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 14 March in its page-6 
editorial notes that the "Bophuthatswana crisis" has ended with 
the takeover of the Bophuthatswana administration by the South 
African Government and ANC-dominated Transitional Executive 
Council and the appointment of Mr Tjaart van der Walt, until now 
South African ambassador to Bophuthatswana, as administrator. 
THE CITIZEN hopes kwaZulu "will not be given the Bophuthatswana 
treatment and that Chief Buthelezi will allow the election to 
take place, even without IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
participation, without offering any resistance. As for the 
White Right, the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has proved 
a paper tiger and the Conservative Party [CP] is in danger of 
splitting. With the CP in disarray, the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front] is weakened, and with the IFP isolated, so is 
the Freedom Alliance." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  IFP Must Allow Others To Campaign Unhindered, Vote -- Having 
decided against participating in South Africa's first nonracial 
election in April, the IFP "must accept the responsibility of 
ensuring that it does not hinder those who do wish to vote," 
declares a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English 
on 15 March. The IFP may deny that it intends to use 
"undemocratic methods to discourage those wishing to cast 
ballots" but "events on the ground look ominous. On Sunday at 
least five people were killed in Umlazi, near Durban, after 
armed IFP supporters occupied a stadium where the ANC was due to 
hold a rally, forcing the meeting to be held elsewhere." "The 
IFP leadership is facing a test -- and so is the Transitional 
Executive Council, fresh from its admirably decisive performance 
in Bophuthatswana." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Divisions in IFP Over Election Participation -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 15 March in a page-10 editorial sees 
"divisions" in the IFP with the organization saying it will not 
participate in the elections, and others, like central committee 
member Ben Ngubane, saying "the election is still a definite 
option." BUSINESS DAY believes there is "a slender chance of 
participation despite the apparent firming of deadlines. 
Barring this, Inkatha has only one card: the king." If the 
IFP refuses to contest the polls, Mandela "can afford to tone 
down the rhetoric and simply point to the fallacy of Buthelezi's 
claims. But he has still to convince Zulus generally that the 
future of the monarch and traditional chiefs is safe with an ANC 
government, and that rank and file public servants need have no 
fears of being dismissed or victimised." "If the ANC wins a 
handsome share of the Natal vote, and finds the mediation 
tiresome, it will be sorely tempted to dismiss Inkatha as 
irrelevant, and pull out. Buthelezi will then be consigned to 
the political wilderness, and there will be no coming back." 
  Call for Prosecution of Killers of AWB Members -- A second 
editorial on the same page refers to the execution of two AWB 
men in Bophuthatswana, saying the ANC's Popo Molefe "may be 
unmoved by the killing members of a group of armed, racist 
invaders, some whom had reportedly been shooting black 
civilians. He may feel the AWB men got what they deserved, but 
to move from there to the argument that nothing should be done 
about cold-blooded murder is a slippery and dangerous path." 
"Rights are universal and freedoms indivisible," and we cannot 
"believe it is wrong to shoot Chris Hani but not Alwyn 
Wolfaardt. The last thing the ANC should be encouraging is the 
belief that only crimes of which it disapproves will be 
prosecuted, or that some people can take the law into their own 
hands." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Need To Woo Azapo Into Election Process -- "While we will be 
watching with trepidation the Inkatha Freedom Party's 
non-involvement in the election, we need to bite the bullet and 
get on with it," states a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 15 March. However, it makes SOWETAN 
"uncomfortable" that "Azapo [Azanian People's Organization] has 
been ignored despite the fact they are the only party to stick 
to their guns. If the IFP is wooed back into the process every 
attempt should be made to get Azapo back."

  [Text] After a 72-hour strike by public service, 
parastatal, and private sector employees, Beninese workers 
resumed work this morning. Paul Ayemona, spokesman of the 
Collective of Independent Labor Unions and the Interunions 
Crisis Committee takes stock of the three-day strike: 
  [Ayemona] The Collective of Independent Labor Unions 
has established three facts: First, that despite the untrue 
statements liberally made by the government, the Beninese 
workers widely followed the strike call. Second, the government 
does not seem willing yet to listen to workers or it is simply 
reluctant to admit the sufferings of the people. Third, 
Beninese workers are determined to use all legal and peaceful 
means at their disposal to increase their purchasing power. 
  Should the government maintain its stand, the trade unions 
will feel obliged to adopt new measures. Here are more details 
with Mr. Ayemona speaking to a Benin radio reporter: 
  [Ayemona] We have organized days of mobilization and 
information for workers and the people. As early as next week, 
that is as early as 16 March, the strike movement will resume 
with the possibility of negotiations. The issue at stake is the 
purchasing power of workers. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] It seems now that the 
government is willing to enter into negotiations with you. What 
about that? 
  [Ayemona] That is what the government thinks. Now, 
there is pressure from the workers because we believe that the 
government is not the only decisionmaking organ. We want to 
help it to make a decision as partners and friends. 
  On the government's side, serenity prevails despite the 
strike call. There is a status quo. Timothee Adanlin, minister 
of civil service and administrative reform, has the details: 
  [Adanlin] The government is observing the same 
attitude. It means we are available for discussions with 
workers and their representatives on the measures to be taken to 
maintain the most peaceful social atmosphere. 
  [Correspondent] Does that mean that you are calling on 
workers for more negotiations? 
  [Adanlin] We can go back to the negotiation table 
anytime. I am currently waiting for the workers to make contact 
and to tell us their position. I refer to position because I do 
not know what they are planning to do now. For our part, we are 
making every effort to prevent a strike. We believe there is no 
need for a strike before we discuss the issues at stake and 
reach satisfactory solutions for all workers. 
  Asked on how the government would react to an indefinite 
strike, the labor minister said: 
  [Adanlin] I do not believe there will be an indefinite 
strike. What did the government do to trigger the last strike? 
The government just said that the right to go on strike is a 
right that should be enjoyed and used within the limits imposed 
by the law. What the law says is that the right to go on strike 
should not be used to cause disturbances and to disrupt public 
order. I would like to express my personal satisfaction with 
the fact that trade unionists kept the promise made to the head 
of state. They promised to make every effort to prevent public 
disturbances during their strike and true to their word, public 
order was not disrupted. This is indeed satisfying.

  [Excerpt] A new party has appeared on the Beninese 
political scene. The Action and Progress [Generation Action 
Progres] party was inaugurated at the International House in 
Porto-Novo this morning. In his welcome address, the party 
chairman, lawyer Yves Edgar Monou, took stock of the country's 
33 years of independence which were marked by failure and 
success as well as unrest and peace, and this raises questions 
and requires sober reflection. According to Monou, Beninese 
should stop destroying their own genius and strive for the 
consolidation of the current democratic process which they 
invented in Africa. The whole Beninese people must change their 
mentality and behavior. Let us listen to Lawyer Monou: 
  [Begin recording] We must change our mentality and make a 
new 
national and patriotic interest one of our major concerns. From 
now on, our daily concern should be how to come together as an 
individual and advance, always advance, relentlessly and 
(?straight) on the path of progress. We should also strive to 
make our youth the true spearhead of our country. In short, we 
should draw lessons from past mistakes and resolutely turn to 
the future and prove the relevance of the thought of Oscar 
Wilde, an English author of the last century, who said that 
youth is the only valuable asset. [end recording] [passage

  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, today 
held talks with the Nigerian foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, 
at the Castle, Osu. They discussed Nigeria's border conflict 
with Cameroon, the Liberian peace process, and the devaluation 
of the CFA franc, and the economic and social consequences for 
the West African subregion. 
  At a news conference after the talks, Babagana Kingibe said 
the desire of the Nigerian Government is to seek accommodation 
and reconciliation and to resolve the conflict with Cameroon 
through dialogue. He said as part of efforts to find a peaceful 
solution to the dispute, the two countries have been invited to 
Cairo, Egypt, on Wednesday [16 March] by the OAU Conflict 
Resolution Committee. Babagana Kingibe said Nigeria will 
cooperate fully with the committee to see to a peaceful 
resolution of the dispute. On Liberia, he expressed confidence 
that things will go well with the peace process this time 
because indications are that all the factions are eager to see 
peace prevail in the country and will therefore adhere to the 
Cotonou accord. 
  The deputy minister designate for foreign affairs, Dr. 
Mohamed ibn Chambas, said the role of France in the dispute 
between Nigeria and Cameroon is being viewed with concern by 
Ghana. He said the French, by their action, are meddling in the 
affairs of two sister African countries. They should, 
therefore, leave the problems to Africans to solve.

  [Text] Liberia's one-week-old Transitional Council has got 
down to business today with a bid to seize the political 
initiative, even though some important differences between the 
three main factions still have to be settled. A new cabinet was 
supposed to take office today, with members drawn from the 
interim government, the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia], and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia], just like the council itself, and although that has 
been delayed, the council has taken important decisions over the 
currency and over the control of Liberia's natural resources. 
Miss Nii Nartey Alison reports in this telex from Monrovia: 
  The Transitional Council declared both the old and the new 
$5 
notes legal tender throughout Liberia. Until today's 
proclamation, the old bank note known as the J.J. -- because it 
bears the picture of Liberia's first president, J.J. Roberts -- 
had been primarily used in areas controlled by Charles Taylor's 
NPFL. The new note, the Liberty, has on its face the seal of 
the Republic of Liberia and had been the legal tender in areas 
controlled by the former interim government of Amos Sawyer. 
  Prior to the civil war, the J.J. was the medium of exchange, 
but it was declared illegal by Sawyer's government when it was 
discovered that most bank notes in the country had been looted. 
The move, however, was resisted by Charles Taylor. He declared 
the Liberty illegal in his enclave. 
  The council also declared that the National Transitional 
Government had full authority over the country's mineral 
resources and that only people designated by the state council 
could engage in the export of minerals. This proclamation is 
clearly designed to stop the NPFL and ULIMO from exploiting the 
natural resources within areas they occupy. 
  Meanwhile, the induction of cabinet ministers is due to be 
held today, but it appears that the controversial posts of 
ministers of foreign affairs, defense, justice, and finance have 
not yet been resolved. Appointees of the NPFL yesterday failed 
to show up at a breakfast time confirmation hearing. Instead, 
they flew to Gbarnga by helicopter for consultations. 
  [Later in the cast, BBC World Service in English adds the 
following: "The new transitional council in Liberia has 
dissolved the three armed factions involved in the four-year 
civil war and the previous interim government. Although all 
five council members signed the decree, the two ULIMO members 
immediately issued a press statement saying it was a violation 
of last year's peace agreement. They said it was the 
institutions set up by the factions that were meant to be 
dissolved, not the factions themselves. The council, which was 
sworn in last week to guide the country to free elections, also 
declared all natural resources under its authority. A BBC 
correspondent in Monrovia said the clause is clearly designed to 
stop the former factions from extracting taxes and export duties 
for themselves. The council was expected to install its cabinet 
ministers today."]

  [Text] Although significant steps towards peace and 
democratic elections in September were taken in Liberia this 
week, serious snags remain, especially in a demobilization of 
fighters of the three parties to the Cotonou agreement, which 
has been sluggish. Initially, only fighters of the AFL [Armed 
Forces of Liberia] began to hand in weapons. Yesterday NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] fighters began disarming. 
But ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] 
has faced problems. It has been racked by internal splits, and 
over the weekend there were reports that rival ULIMO factions 
had been fighting. Well, the UN special representative to 
Liberia, Trevor Gordon-Somers, has been traveling around the 
different parts of Liberia. On the line to Monrovia, Josephine 
Hazely asked him what news he had of inter-ULIMO fighting. 
  [Begin recording] [Gordon-Somers] In fact, as far as I know 
there was none yesterday and the day before. There was fighting 
in ULIMO going back a week ago in Tubmanburg, but since 
Tubmanburg calmed down I have had no evidence or no information 
that there has been fighting anywhere else among ULIMO. 
  [Hazely] In that right, because we are getting reports that 
there has been fighting in the Todi center itself? 
  [Gordon-Somers] Well, I visited the Bong Mines, the Todi 
Mission, Kakata, I think on Thursday [10 March] and we talked 
with the fighters, we saw them massed in their center, and what 
they told us was that they were waiting for clear instructions 
from their high command. Now, Mr. Alhaji Koromah, in fact, sent 
written instructions, as I understand it, to the field commander 
and then sent in one of his commanders out to him, and as has 
been reported to me they started disarming this morning and I 
think that it is a good sign that they have started their 
disarmament today. 
  [Hazely] So, as far as you can gather, the faction fighting 
within ULIMO is more or less (?finished now). 
  [Gordon-Somers] I would like to believe that but, I mean, 
one must not oversimplify these matters. Notwithstanding the 
reconciliation efforts, it doesn't necessarily heal in one day. 
But I believe that it is a very positive sign and I think that 
the best indication that there is calm in ULIMO headquarters and 
in the various ULIMO barracks is that they have started 
disarming. At least it means that fighters themselves have a 
sense of confidence that they are not going to be attacked by 
one faction or the other. 
  [Hazely] As has been reported, ULIMO commander Roosevelt 
Johnson has not acknowledged Alhaji Koromah as the leader of 
ULIMO. 
  [Gordon-Somers] That is correct. 
  [Hazely] Okay, let's talk about Charles Taylor's NPFL now. 
You, I understand, went to watch some of them disarm yesterday. 
What did you see? 
  [Gordon-Somers] That has taken place in NPFL territory. 
This is between Konola and Sir George Philip Mission or 
something of the sort. Well we... [pauses] there were some... 
[pauses] I -- the figures may vary but -- I suspect it was about 
400 NPFL fighters who were assembled with their weapons and we 
processed them through yesterday evening between three o'clock 
and I think they must have finished at about six or seven 
because I left before they were completed. 
  [Hazely] What sort of weapons did they hand in? 
  [Gordon-Somers] They were handing in weapons like some types 
of machine guns or AK's or what was it, and there were some 
mortars. 
  [Hazely] What was the mood of the fighters from what you 
could judge? Were they happy to hand in their weapons or did 
they do this grudgingly? 
  [Gordon-Somers] No, they were extremely happy. They were 
singing songs and dancing around, and their commanders who were 
with them were cheering them on and dancing with them. It was a 
very happy occasion, and some of them to whom we spoke indicated 
their readiness, their willingness, they want to go back to 
school, they want to go and do something else. It was a very 
happy occasion. [end recording] 
  [London BBC World Service in English at 0600 GMT on 14 March 
adds that "Fighters of one of Liberia's largest armed factions 
have begun to surrender their arms to the African peacekeeping 
force. They were ordered to do so yesterday by the National 
Patriotic Front leader, Charles Taylor, despite a political 
dispute over the composition of a new transitional government 
and continued factional fighting clashes. Fighting has 
continued among members of the ULIMO faction around the town of 
Todi, which has been designated a disarmament site."]

  [Excerpts] On 24 and 28 February, and on 4 and 7 March, the 
government and the National Union of Malian Workers [UNTM] held 
negotiations on the memorandum submitted by the union on 18 
February. The meeting took place in the conference hall of the 
Ministry of Employment, Civil Service, and Labor. The 
government was represented by Employment Minister Mohamed Ag 
Erlaf and Finance and Trade Minister Soumaila Cisse, while the 
delegation of the UNTM's National Executive Bureau was led by 
Secretary General (Isse Doghoe), who was accompanied by an 
executive member. Mamadou Diallo has the details: 
  [Diallo] Following the deliberations, the two sides signed 
the following 13-point agreement: 
  1. All civil servants who were promoted from 1991 to 93 will 
receive compensation, in the form of a bonus equivalent to a 
step increase on the new wage scale, effective 1 January 1995. 
  2. The transfer to the new pay scale, on the basis of the 
1990 wage index, will be effective on 1 April 1994. 
  3. Compensation for all arrears owed workers from (?1988) to 
1990 will be paid on the basis of the current salaries to the 
affected workers, in the form of one month of salary in 1994 and 
an additional one and a half months of salary in 1995. The 
money owed pensioners and families of deceased civil servants 
will be paid in a lump sum. 
  4. Effective 1 April 1994, the salary index will be 
increased 
by 10 percent. 
  5. The UNTM has explicitly requested that the 5-percent pay 
raise slated for 1995 be granted in 1994. The government is 
considering the raise for 1 October 1994, following the meeting 
on the structural adjustment program slated for June of this 
year. [passage omitted on points 6 to 11 outlining agreement on 
study of staff housing, financing of shopping center for 
employees, compiling of report on internal finances, control of 
drug prices, supervised training for workers leaving due to 
retrenchment or retirement, and assumption of internal debts] 
  12. Both sides also agreed to sponsor a tripartite meeting 
to 
be attended by the government, the UNTM, and the employers' 
association, in order to coordinate the amount of family 
allowances and the rate of increase in the interoccupational 
guaranteed minimum wage. 
  13. The present draft agreement covers and supersedes the 
list of grievances submitted by the UNTM on 18 February 1994.

Niger at the first summit of heads of member states of the 
Economic and Monetary Union of West Africa [UEMOA]. Tomorrow's

devaluation of the CFA franc on the economies of members. 
  Many observers believe that by deciding in July 1992 in 
Dakar, Senegal, to transform the West African Monetary Union, 
UMOA, into UEMOA, the heads of the member states demonstrated 
their determination to consolidate their monetary union against 
the background of an international economic environment 
unfavorable to the continent. 
  The head of state was accompanied on the trip by several 
cabinet members, including the ministers of finance, commerce, 
mines and energy, as well as the secretary of state for 
cooperation.

  [Text] Lagos, 14 March (PANA) -- Education and Youth 
Development Minister Iyorchia Ayu has promised tough new 
measures against cult activities on the campus of the country's 
universities. Ayu, speaking in Benin, capital of mid-west Edo 
State at the weekend, said that law abiding students and 
security agents would continue to "receive the full backing of 
government" in dealing with cultism. He did not elaborate, but 
urged parents and teachers to advise their wards against acts of 
indiscipline, saying that "beyond financing of facilities is the 
need for moral re-armament." "The nation is going through a 
despicable phenomenon in our school system. Our collective 
psyche has been assaulted by the tragic wave of secret cults on 
our campuses. Bizarre killings, intimidation, violence and 
indiscipline precipitated by activities of secret cults on our 
campuses is daily on the rise," the minister said. 
  His statement came in the wake of the closure of University 
of Lagos (UNILAG) on Saturday [12 March] by the authorities 
because of alleged cult activities by the students. On 2 March, 
suspected student cult members clashed openly at UNILAG, 
incurring the wrath of the student union, which accused the 
university authorities of inaction and launched an anti-cult 
capaign that crippled academic actitives for two days. In 
closing the university, the authorities cited "arson and general 
breakdown of law and order", saying that while they "condemn 
cult activities, hoologanism and indiscipline" should not be 
condoned. The registrar, Dr. A.A. Omotosho, has also announced 
the proscription of the students' union. 
  He said in a statement that "for the avoidance of doubt, all 
students union organisation by whichever name they are 
described, including students' union caretaker committee, are 
hereby proscribed." The registrar said that last Saturday, some 
1,000 UNILAG students "raided" the Lagos home of the 
university's former lecturer, Idowu Sobowale, just as he 
addressed a press conference, alerting the nation on the 
"takeover of the institution by gangsters". The students were 
alleged to have destroyed household items and abducted the wife 
of Sobowale, who is now editor-in-chief of a metropolitan 
newspaper, THE REPUBLIC. Sobowale's wife reportedly escaped 
when the bus in which she was being conveyed by the students ran 
out of fuel. 
  Cult activities, reminiscent of American-type campus 
fraternities in the 60s, assumed a worrying dimension in 
Nigerian institutions of higher learning in the 80s resulting in 
a government clamp down. Initially, the Nigerian campus 
societies were a varitable vanguard for anti-colonial campaigns 
in the country. But later day societies manifest violence and 
despicable tendencies. In the past months, security agents have 
reported the arrests of some 300 suspected student cult members 
in different parts of the country. Some of them were shown on 
national television in their strange dresses and carrying 
weapons, including matchetes, with which they reportedly 
terrorise the campus communities.

  [Text] In Nigeria, there has been trouble at the campus of 
Lagos University, UNILAG, home to 15,000 students. It involves 
the student union's attempts to clamp down on followers of 
secret cults on the campus. The leader of the university 
student's union, Omoyele Showore, has been leading the clamp 
down on the secret cults. He's been taken to hospital and is 
reportedly in a critical condition after being set upon by a 
gang. And now it seems the campus has been shut down. From 
Lagos, Obadina reports: 
  [Begin Obadina recording] The University of Lagos, UNILAG, 
has once again been closed down by the school authorities. The 
order to students to go home came after a fortnight of bloody 
clashes, as student union activists tried to expel members of 
violent secret cults from campus. On Friday [11 March] the 
president of the student's union, Mr. Omoyele Showore, was 
stripped naked, beaten up, injected with a poisonous substance, 
and left in a coma by a gang of about 60 thugs said to be either 
cult members or hoodlums hired by cult members to serve the 
violent warning to other students not to interfere with cult 
activities. 
  The students retaliated by burning a Peugeot 504 saloon car, 
said to belong to a cult member; by interrogating two cult 
suspects who were paraded naked before a crowd of 400; and by 
setting fire to the household effects of one member of the 
university administration suspected by the students to have left 
detained alleged cult suspects go free. Students in Lagos today 
expressed disappointment at the situation, saying that exams -- 
in some cases, final exams postponed from last September -- were 
due to start next week. They described cult members as academic 
fallouts whom they suspect to have instigated the troubles to 
avoid exams. 
  There are about five cults parading themselves on campus in 
Lagos. They call themselves (?Tie Eye), the Mafioso, the Black 
Cats, Buccaneers, and the Vikings). They have been banned from 
campus since the early 1980s and only began reappearing late 
last year. Their presence has been marked by intergang 
feudings, increased numbers of rape, and the presence of arms, 
including a grenade on campus. The cults, which seem to be 
degenerate forms of 1960s American-style college fraternities, 
are said to attract the sons of the Nigerian elite. Student 
union activists, who have detained suspected cult members and 
handed them over to the police, complain that the authorities 
are yet to take action against the cult suspects. [end recording]

  [Text] The results of the second round of 20 February 
legislative elections were proclaimed today. The Togolese 
Supreme Court, during its extraordinary hearing held this 
morning at the Grand Hall of the Palace of Justice in Lome 
proclaimed the results of the 24 seats contested during the

  [Begin recording] [Bayete] The Supreme Court in its 
judgement 
this morning confirmed the results of the 19 seats given by the 
National Electoral Commission [CNE], out of the possible 24. 
The court, through its president, Emmanuel Apedo, observed that

accordance with established procedures and were carried out 
satisfactorily. 
  Concerning the five seats in dispute, the Supreme Court gave 
its decision based on the documents submitted by the CNE. In 
the cases mentioned above, three of the five seats were won by 
the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and two by the Togolese 
Union for Democracy [UTD]. 
  The president of Supreme Court, Emmanuel Apedoh, reads the

  [Excerpts] The Togolese Supreme Court announced its 
decision this morning. The two political parties opposing 
President Gnassingbe Eyadema won 43 out of the 81 seats in the 
National Assembly following the 6 and 20 February legislative 
elections. [passage omitted] 
  Since no single party won an absolute majority, what will 
the 
opposition do to accede to power, in view of the official and 
final results of the elections? Yao Agboyibor, leader of the 
Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], has this to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Agboyibor] Forming a coalition is an 
imperative, for although one can say that in theory no party won 
the majority, the people's situation is obvious. The results 
are being hailed as a victory by the opposition, which is a 
victory for all those who want to see things change in our 
country. So, there is a kind of spontaneous feeling for the 
forming of a coalition. Those who champion the old order are 
together, while those of us who want change must come together. 
The Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] and the CAR cannot, 
under the present circumstances, do otherwise but form a 
coalition. We have always called for such a move. The time has 
come for us to translate that call into a reality. A UTD- CAR 
coalition is imperative for the people. In fact, merely 
questioning the formation of such a coalition would throw into 
doubt the idea of such a coalition, which would be a pity. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Let us assume that such a 
coalition would hold together. Which of you -- the UTD's Edem 
Kodjo or you Mr. Agboyibor -- will be the next prime minister of 
the Togolese Government? 
  [Agboyibor] The problem should not be viewed in terms of a 
choice between two persons. The parties offered their platforms 
to the people, who then chose. The results are there to confirm 
their choices. It is on the basis of these results that we can 
determine which party is in a better position to assume this 
fundamental responsibility of heading the government. Once a 
party has been chosen, its members will make internal choices. 
  [Correspondent] If I got you right, you mean that since the 
CAR won 36 seats and the UTD seven, the CAR should automatically 
demand the premiership. 
  [Agboyibor] It is not a matter of demanding, but of 
complying with the choice of the people. I think that as 
democrats we must take into account the election results as a 
criteria for solving the problem. If we emphasize individuals 
we will not succeed. 
  [Correspondent] It does not seem as though any consultations 
are currently under way between the UTD and the CAR regarding 
the appointment of a prime minister. 
  [Agboyibor] Oh, we have made contacts on the basis of the 
verdict and our contacts are ongoing. [end recording] 
  [Paris AFP in English at 1309 GMT on 14 March in a 
Lome-datelined item adds the following: "Agboyibor on Monday 
[14 March] told AFP that he was `delighted' at the result, which 
he described as a `victory for the Togolese people.' `We are 
convinced that the consultations which will soon begin regarding 
the appointment of new leaders will lead to choices in line with 
the voting,' he said. `Any other outcome would be a scandal.'"]

put in the way of the party during the election campaign, it has 
been officially recognized as a buffer group in the new National

recovery which are today the major priorities of the Togolese

  [Text] The head of state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, 
received Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Babagana Kingibe in 
his private residence in Lome II this morning. The Nigerian 
minister was accompanied to the presidential private residence 
by Ouattara Fambare Natchaba, his Togolese counterpart, and His 
Excellency Vincent Okobi, the Nigerian ambassador to Togo. 
After his discussions with the head of state, Mr. Kingibe had 
this to say to correspondents: 
  [Begin recording] [Kingibe] First of all, since the Supreme 
Court published the results of the recent legislative elections, 
we congratulated the Togolese people and expressed the hope that 
from now on there will be progress concerning the ruling of the 
country under a democratic regime and in line with the 
Constitution. 
  Of course, we also discussed the problem prevailing between 
Nigeria and Cameroon. As you know, President Eyadema took some 
initiatives with a view to mediate between the two countries. 
Recently, he sent my brother, the Togolese foreign minister, to 
Cameroon, which I also visited. The head of state and I 
reviewed the developments in the situation and reached a number 
of conclusions, mainly how to pursue dialogue in order to 
resolve the problem peacefully. This is the wish of everybody, 
including the Nigerian and Cameroonian leaders. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In view of the recent 
developments in the situation, what conclusions did you reach? 
  [Kingibe] We stressed the need to relentlessly pursue 
efforts 
toward finding peaceful solutions to the dispute; that is, 
through dialogue. We also stressed the need to avoid at all 
costs violence and more tension on the peninsula. [end recording] 
  As for Anthony Ani, the Nigerian deputy foreign minister, he 
recently began a tour of five African countries for their 
support in the border dispute between his country and Cameroon. 
He is expected to visit Gabon, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and 
Zambia.

  Rumors in Lusaka speak of a government document detailing 
the 
portfolios to be given to UNITA -- namely, the Provinces of 
Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, and ambassadorial posts in 
Cape Verde, Algeria, Mexico, and UNESCO. At the central level, 
the rumors say UNITA would be given the portfolios of tourism 
and hotel industry, and construction materials. There are other 
portfolios, but unfortunately we have no details about them. 
  UNITA wishes to have the portfolios of territorial 
administration and geology and mines. It also wants its deputy 
ministers in the defense, information, and other ministries. 
UNITA is scheduled to comment on the government offer tomorrow, 
following Blondin Beye's meeting with Jonas Savimbi. 
  It has been report that the UN Security Council has 
adjourned 
its meeting on Angola for 16 March, pending UNITA's response to 
the government offer. A UN Angola Verification Mission aircraft 
will fly to Huambo tomorrow to fetch UNITA's Eugenio Manuvakola, 
Jorge Valentim, and Isaias Samakuva and bring them to Lusaka. 
They have been in Huambo since 12 March receiving instructions 
from Jonas Savimbi.

the airport. The organizations, which include Care 
International and Medecins Sans Frontieres [Doctors Without

is government-controlled, has been under siege by the UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels for 
more than one year. They control most of the surrounding 
countryside. The attacks were largely ineffective, but 
intensified at the end of last week.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Joaquim Chissano at ceremony in </F>
Massinga troop assembly area, in southern Inhambane Province, on 
10 March--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Mozambique Armed Forces/Popular Forces for the 
Liberation of Mozambique [FAM/FPLM] soldiers, noncommissioned 
officers, and officers: we are here in Massinga today, 10 March, 
to formally begin the troop demobilization process in accordance 
with the stipulations of the General Peace Accord which was 
signed in Rome between the government of the Republic of 
Mozambique and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]. In 
terms of the General Peace Accord, the process for the creation 
of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM] will occur 
simultaneously with the assembly and integration into civilian 
life of FAM/FPLM soldiers who are progressively demobilized as a 
result of the implementation of the cease-fire accord. The 
General Peace Accord also states that all units must be 
demobilized by the time FADM is fully staffed. 
  Even though the troop confinement process is not over yet 
and 
the formation of the FADM forces has met with some problems, it 
is important that troop demobilization begins, principally for 
the following reasons: 

  -  The troop confinement process was conceived of as a stage 
in the transition to civilian life or to the FADM forces. That 
stage should not have lasted longer than one month. 
Unfortunately, you have had to stay longer than that at this 
assembly area due to unforeseen reasons; 
  -  Most of the confined soldiers are to be demobilized; 
  -  There is the imperative need to speed up the implementation 
of 
the General Peace Accord by removing difficulties and making it 
easier for its goals to be achieved; 
  -  Most troop assembly areas are more than 100 percent full, so 
it 
is imperative to demobilize soldiers so that space can be opened 
for other soldiers to be confined; 
  -  Basic organizational and financial conditions are already in 
place for demobilization to begin. 

    The Mozambican Government has decided to begin demobilizing 
its forces for all these reasons, and in the spirit which guided 
the signing of the General Peace Accord. We can clarify at this 
stage that this is no unilateral demobilization. Instead, it is 
a matter of the government taking the first step in a 
simultaneous demobilization process that must be complied with 
by both sides. In view of that, the government, Renamo, and the 
UN Operations in Mozambique must guarantee that the process 
occurs simultaneously for both sides. Demobilization is an 
import stage in the process for strengthening peace in this 
country. It is an important stage in redirecting our country's 
human, material, and financial resources so they can be used to 
rebuild the nation, to improve the people's living standards, 
and to help develop our country's social and economic sectors. 
  FAM/FPLM soldiers, noncommissioned officers, and officers: 
those of you who are leaving today to rejoin your families, 
whether it be in urban or rural areas, are leaving their 
uniforms and weapons today to rejoin civilian life. We have 
come here on behalf of the Mozambican State and the Mozambican 
people, united from Rovuma River to Maputo River, to pay the 
nation's homage to its beloved sons. [passage omitted] 
  The sodliers who are getting demobilized today have fought 
for peace. The principal goal of demobilization is to solidify 
peace by neutralizing the reasons for war. So, demobilization 
cannot and should not be a unilateral move, or it may become the 
reason for new conflicts. A simultaneous demobilization process 
means that there are neither victors nor vanquished. The 
Mozambican people are the sole winners in that they gain much 
desired peace. 
  To you, the heroes, we do not hesitate to pay due homage for 
the heroism you have shown in your struggle to defend freedom 
and our fatherland's independence. We are proud to pay you 
homage today. It is with pride that you must now return to your 
homes in the country's cities and rural areas, because you have 
accomplished your mission. You must now work to help solidify 
peace and normalize the lives of all our people, including your 
own lives. You will know how to behave in line with the spirit 
of reconciliation, freedom, dignity, and justice. [passage 
omitted] 
  While you prepare for your new professions, you will 
continue 
getting financial support for two years, the first six months of 
which will be paid directly by the state. The other 18 months 
will be the result of generous contributions and support by the 
international community, which has decided to listen to the 
Mozambican Government's call for increased efforts in that 
direction. We are well aware of the fact that you have many 
needs but only very limited financial resources, but that is all 
the government and the international community can make 
available. We do not have the means to satify our desire to 
give you more. 
  In addition to those salaries, upon arrival in the area 
where he wants to settle for good, each demobilized soldier will 
receive complementary support in terms of seeds, agricultural 
tools, and other small production tools that will help them 
resume productive work. That means that we need to work very 
hard so that we can guarantee our own upkeep and create 
surpluses that will help stabilize and raise our standards of 
living. Only work can help us improve. Only disciplined work 
can release us from famine, poverty, and misery. [passage 
omitted] 
  The government is well aware of the fact that the most 
important consideration, in all this, is the creation of 
conditions that will guarantee work for each citizen. However, 
it is up to us and our efforts alone to create really stable 
jobs. We have to continue working very hard. [passage omitted] 
  Some of you have expressed a desire to be paid the first six 
months in full upon demobilization. Though the government views 
with sympathy the reasons for your concern, it is nonetheless 
important that you do not arrive in your homes empty-handed. 
The government will pay promptly the first three months when 
you get demobilized. You will receive the remainder in your 
districts. Conditions are being created to ensure that everyone 
will receive his dues, even in areas where there are no banks or 
administrative posts. [passage omitted] 
  We want you to be an important factor in the development of 
the national economy and in the reconstruction of the fatherland 
for whose freedom, sovereignty, and territorial integrity you 
fought so hard and gave so much of your youth. The people and 
the government expect of you that you will be the safekeepers of 
peace, freedom, and democracy wherever you may be. [passage 
omitted] 
  Long live the FAM/FPLM forces! 
  Long live the Mozambican people, united from Rovuma River to 
Maputo River! 
  Long live the Republic of Mozambique! 
  Long live national unity! 
  Long live hard work! 
  Long live democracy! 
  Long live peace!

  [Text] Speaking to newsmen shortly after his return from 
the Zimbabwean capital, President of the Republic Joaquim 
Chissano described as pure speculation reports that relations 
between Mozambique and Zimbabwe had cooled down recently. The 
Mozambican head of state had gone to Harare on 13 March on a 
two-day visit. 
  International news agencies and radio stations had 
speculated 
last week that relations between Zimbabwean President Robert 
Mugabe and Joaquim Chissano, his Mozambican counterpart, had 
deteriorated over the last few months. 
  The two heads of state met in Harare to discuss issues 
pertaining to the situation in southern Africa in general and in 
the Frontline countries in particular. President of the 
Republic Joaquim Chissano noted that the situation in Lesotho, 
South Africa, Angola and Zimbabwe itself had been viewed with 
particular interest.

that taxes in force until now have been quite high and he added 
that they were to be reduced for that very reason. 
  Speaking at a meeting with Mozambican and foreign 
businessmen 
in the Mozambican capital, Finance Minister Comiche said such 
reductions had been introduced in the wake of a profound study 
on the prevailing fiscal taxes. Those reduction affect 
primarily the main taxes, notably the Industrial Contribution 
Tax, the Complementary Tax, and the Income Tax.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Cardoso] </F>
  [Text] This will not be the year that the state makes 
substantial savings in areas like the armed forces. 
  This was disclosed by Finance Minister Dr. Eneias Comiche at 
a meeting with Maputo businessmen and senior Ministry of Finance 
officials on 11 March. 
  Comiche said: "There are initial high costs, and that does 
not apply only" to the formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed 
Forces, adding that "such costs have not yet been estimated" -- 
salaries, restoration of barracks, demobilization, and so on. 
  Yet another expenditure that has come as a surprise: 
elections -- $79 million. The international community will 
only contribute 60 percent. The remainder will have to come 
from the State General Budget. 
  Initially the government had put Mozambique's costs for the 
elections at between $3 and $4 million. 
  Comiche's meeting, which ended up being unusually 
informative, began with the minister outlining the legal fiscal 
framework of investment and complaining that "it is with a 
certain regret that so far we have seen no Mozambican 
entrepreneur with investment plans" for duty free industrial 
areas already approved by the government (decree 18/93). 
  As expected, the minister dealt with taxes. 
  Ibrahimo Ibrahimo, for many years a senior Ministry of 
Finance official and currently with an auditors firm, dotted the 
i's by recalling that on average, the fiscal evasion for the 
complementary tax in 1978/79 was 80 percent. He added: "I do 
not believe it has gone down." 
  Ibrahimo described December's fiscal review as an "important 
step," but added: "As for indirect taxation, those were 
insufficient measures. " 
  The entrepreneurs were not as generous in their comments, 
but 
were far from calling things by their own names. 
  Mozambique Commercial Association President Mario Ussene 
said 
the meeting seems to have consolidated the entrepreneurs' 
standing. 
  In private, they say the changes introduced in the fiscal 
system were meaningless, but to the minister they said they were 
a "timid step" in the "right direction." 
  On the question of investment, Ibrahimo stressed that now it 
takes less time to get projects approved, adding that it 
continues to take a long time to implement them. 
  Ibrahimo also raised the delicate question of fines. 
  "There is a general perception that there is no strict 
controlling policy. There are businessmen who are visited two, 
three, or four times by tax inspectors, while others are not 
checked at all." 
  At this stage, Comiche said that in Beira recently, 
businessmen had complained to him about "persecution" by the 
revenue department. 
  "I tried to point out that it is not a question of 
persecution. What happens is that they are not used to tax 
inspectors whom they cannot bribe." 
  He added that he would "reward" the tax inspectors in 
question. He said categorically: "I will not give in to any 
pressure." 
  George Tsilakhis, proprietor of the Agricultural Tobacco 
Company, SAT, also attended the meeting. SAT is one of the two 
companies that still manufactures cigarettes, but which could 
close down their operations if their products continue to cost 
as much as imported cigarettes in view of heavy taxation. 
Imported cigarettes are exempted from tax. 
  Tsilakhis once again reiterated the tobacco companies' call 
to the government: to either substantially lower the taxes 
applicable to Mozambican cigarettes or to scrupulously apply the 
relevant customs duties on cigarettes imported from South 
Africa, Zimbabwe, and Malawi. 
  Comiche acknowledged that there is "a great deal of tobacco 
that enters the country, but does not pay tax." He added: 
"Unfortunately, it is not only tobacco. It is everything." He 
pointed out: "We ought to protect the Mozambican industry by 
controlling borders more effectively." He promised: "We must 
charge a levy on cigarettes that enter the country without 
paying duties. We are studying ways of doing it." 
  Is that a vain promise? 
  Commenting on the minister's promise, a reliable source told 
MEDIAFAX that Comiche has succeeded in controlling imported 
tobacco, but has done nothing to protect the local industry from 
sliding down. 
  MEDIAFAX attended the meeting and took the opportunity to 
ask 
a few questions of the minister: 
  Businessmen throughout the country say government should cut 
the budget deficit by reducing public expenditure instead of 
imposing more taxes. What ministries does he think should be 
shut down for being irrelevant? 
  Comiche said the government is "looking into" the matter to 
see which state agencies should be shut down. 
  "It is only a question of opportunity before a decision can 
be made." 
  The minister said the assets and services account is 
"extremely tight," but acknowledged that the state is not 
"being as austere as one would like it to be." 
  He also agreed that the informal sector should also pay 
taxes. Comiche reiterated the government's position that the 
collection of taxes from the informal sector should be done by 
the town councils' police force. 
  MEDIAFAX: To a certain extent the legal business sector 
evades taxes, but they are not compensated for what they pay. 
The state is also at fault. For many parents, government 
schools are now more expensive than private ones, hospitals 
charge two different fees, and the same applies to passports. 
As for security, enterprises and citizens need to hire the 
services of private companies, paying thousands of contos per 
month. 
  Comiche acknowledged that the question of different prices 
is 
widespread, but noted that the situation cannot be corrected 
through tax evasion. 
  Turning to the question of private security companies, the 
minister said he did not know whether in a way they encouraged 
crime to secure contracts. 
  MEDIAFAX: Who are the informal businessmen supplying the 
black market and ending up not paying taxes? 
  Comiche "passed the buck" to Trade Minister Daniel Gabriel 
who was also present. Gabriel elaborated on informal trade, but 
did not give names or clues. 
  MEDIAFAX: Mozambican and foreign investors see the 
investment code as an improvement on the previous legislation. 
But would it be legitimate to put Mozambican entrepreneurs in 
dire straits on an equal footing with foreign entrepreneurs who 
have capital readily available? 
  Comiche said he was surprised with the question because 
"Mozambican entrepreneurs had asked for equal treatment" when 
the issue was raised at the 1992 seminar. 
  The minister said "local savings is negative. We need to 
look for foreign savings." 
  He stressed that "the law forces foreigners to establish 
partnerships with Mozambicans." 
  Regardless, Comiche noted that 95 percent of small and 
medium 
state enterprises have been privatized by Mozambican businessmen. 
  The meeting also discussed customs and excise. 
  Manuel Alaje, deputy national customs and excise director, 
told the meeting that "we have been accused of doing nothing, 
but when we want to adhere to the law, the importers threaten 
us." 
  He added that the state cannot control "a 6,000-km border." 
  As an example of the most common form of tax evasion, he 
said 
"yesterday we detected an underinvoicing case involving 600,000 
contos." 
  In its "futile attempt" to adhere to the law, he said 
customs 
and excise established in December 1993 an office for the 
verification of imported merchandise. 
  He said by 9 March customs and excise had managed to recover 
5 million contos that would have been otherwise lost. 
  Based on what Mozambican tobacco companies estimate, that 
figure is only 5 percent of what the state revenue should 
collect in customs duties on imported tobacco. 
  Alaje said customs departments have been "replacing 
personnel" in an attempt to reduce the amount of money being 
pocketed by their functionaries, and to increase state revenue. 
  "Even yesterday all the staff members at Namaacha were 
replaced without anyone noticing it." 
  "We are doing what is humanely possible." 
  He added that things ought to be done very carefully due to 
"death threats." 
  The minister told the meeting that fiscal revenue amounts to 
26 percent of the gross domestic product, a ratio [preceding 
word in English] that Comiche regards as "higher" that in 
underdeveloped countries like Mozambique. 
  At the start of the meeting Comiche said something that is 
worth keeping on the record: "A reduction in taxes means less 
revenue for the state." 
  Over the past few years, entrepreneurs and economists have 
stated otherwise: substantially lower taxes and a wider 
collecting system covering the informal sector would end up 
increasing state revenue. 
  Would it be possible for the government to try this option? 
  By the way, when will the government reveal the budget so 
that everyone knows how each metical is spent? 
  P.S. Once again, an IMF team was in Maputo in a visit 
shrouded in utmost secrecy. It did not meet with the World Bank 
or the donors. 
  MEDIAFAX learned that the visit had something to do with the 
question of counterpart funds. 
  We have also learned that the IMF already completed or is 
about to complete a study on taxation.

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama has called on the government to make available 
funds for the operation of the unarmed political parties. 
Dhlakama was reacting to the position of the political parties 
that they will boycott the first free and democratic elections 
in the country, scheduled for next October, if the Mozambican 
Government does not make available money. 
  Afonso Dhlakama also told Radio Mozambique that he will 
preside over his troops' demobilization ceremony at the Neves 
Assembly Area in Inhambane Province on 18 March. The Renamo 
leader said this shortly before his departure for Renamo's 
headquarters in Maringue.

military training to men to fight Renamo, should the latter win 
the elections scheduled to be held in October of this year. 
  The Renamo political delegate for Cabo Delgado Province also 
said that some Frelimo Party officials had gone to military 
training centers in Tanzania last month.

  [Excerpts] On 7 March it will be a month since Lieutenant 
General Lagos Lidimo was promoted to his present rank, following 
his appointment to the Supreme Council of the Mozambique Defense 
Armed Forces (FADM). [passage omitted] 
  Reacting to the appointment and subsequent promotion of the 
senior government army officer to the FADM Supreme Council, 
diplomatic sources in Maputo expressed regret at the choice, 
linking Lidimo to Mozambique's shadowy war period when he was 
chief of Military Counterintelligence (JIM). Other diplomats 
went as far as to approach FAM/FPLM [Mozambique Armed 
Forces/Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique] 
officialdom to express their annoyance at Lidimo's appointment. 
Moreover, they noted issues relating to the period before 
independence when Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] 
guerrillas clashed with Portuguese colonial troops in 
Mozambique, particularly in Cabo Delgado where Lidimo was born 
and operated. 
  Contacted by DOMINGO, senior government army officers 
categorically rejected those arguments, emphasizing that that 
amounted to interference in the country's domestic affairs. 
They based their views on the fact that Lagos Lidimo played a 
leading role in the defeat of Portuguese colonialism and in?the 
dismantling of a [U.S.] CIA network in Mozambique. They noted 
that possible resentment harbored by certain circles after those 
two events could have prompted the diplomats' attitude. They 
also mentioned the role played by Mateus Ngonhamo in the war 
that ended in 1992, during which he operated in central and 
southern Mozambique, where most of the bloodiest 
Renamo-sponsored massacres were reported. They said as the 
country moves toward national reconciliation and 
democratization, the international community ought to assist 
Mozambicans in reconstructing their lives in peace instead of 
opening old wounds.

  [Text] The presidents of Mozambique and Zimbabwe say 
African leaders should be hospitable towards the Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance] leader, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, to 
dissuade him from going back to war. Mr. Dhlakama has been 
shunned by many regional leaders since the peace pact in 1992 
ended the 16-year-old civil war between Renamo and the 
Mozambican government. A report from Harare quotes a Mozambican 
official as saying that President Robert Mugabe and President 
Joaquim Chissano have appealed to African leaders to put aside 
their hostility towards Mr. Dhlakama to promote peace in 
southern Africa.

  [Text] President Ange Felix Patasse left Bangui early this 
afternoon for Ndjamena, the Chadian capital, to attend the 
summit of heads of state of the Customs and Economic Union of 
Central Africa [UDEAC]. Prior to his departure, President 
Patasse stated in an interview granted our colleague Pedinguere 
Ouporo that Central Africa is ill and that the Ndjamena summit 
(?will strive) to remedy the situation. Let us listen to him: 
  [Begin Patasse recording] This Ndjamena meeting is crucial 
for the subregion. Apart from the problems confronting the Bank 
of Central African States, there is also that of [words 
indistinct], and we have to make decisions concerning the UDEAC 
too. Another issue is the creation of an economic and monetary 
community in Central Africa. I cannot tell the other countries 
the prospects ahead of us, but as I told you, the Central 
African subregion is ill. The subregion needs to wake up the 
UDEAC. I think we may face some disappointments in Ndjamena. 
But we are also anxious to know whether we will overcome our 
nationalistic tendencies and make way for true subregional 
integration. Achieving this objective will enable our 
respective peoples to realize that actually their future depends 
on integration and not on nationalism which has hampered our 
progress so far. [end recording] 
  In another interview, President Patasse strongly denounced 
all acts that might disturb the established law and order. He 
also stated that the Central African people, who bitterly 
suffered from injustice, torture, and underhanded dealings, have 
sovereignly decided to establish a lasting democratic state that 
can help all Central Africans participate in the management of 
public affairs. In conclusion, he severely warned the advocates 
of violence and called on the people to be extra vigilant to 
block the way to those yearning for past inhumane atrocities 
they underwent under previous regimes.

  [Text] Bangui, 11 Mar (AFP) -- The former president of the 
Central African Republic, General Andre Kolingba, was "struck 
off" the ranks of the Army under a decree signed today by his 
successor, Ange Felix Patasse, the national radio announced in 
Bangui. The national radio pointed out that the "striking off" 
measure against the general was taken through the implementation 
of a presidential decree signed in 1985 by Mr. Kolingba himself, 
who was then head of the Military Committee of National Redress. 
  Under this decree, "the officer struck off the Army ceases 
to 
be on the seniority list and thus is not promoted." The decree 
adds that "any officer who is a candidate in any election or 
holding any elective office shall be struck off the Army rank." 
This decision comes a few days after the arrest of several 
senior officials of the general's party, the Central African 
Democratic Rally, RDC. These officials were accused of 
"ordering acts of social tension" in Bangui. 
  After a meeting on 8 March with President Patasse, Gen. 
Kolingba observed that by these arrests "he was being targeted" 
and described these arrests as a "very dangerous derailment of 
the young democracy" in Central African Republic. The general 
added that he was not to be held responsible for any social 
disturbances or unfortunate events that might come up in the 
country."

  [Text] Paris, 13 March (PANA) -- "I have not come for the 
purpose of doing a strip-tease dance or to make myself liked, 
but simply to make myself understood," Congolese President 
Pascal Lissouba declared in an interview with the PAN AFRICAN 
NEWS AGENCY at the end of a working visit to France. President 
Lissouba implicitly confirmed the poor climate of 
Franco-Congolese relations, however he hinted that the situation 
was becoming progressively better. 
  Citing journalists, whom he blames for being more or less 
responsible for this situation, President Lissouba, in a flash 
of wit, indicated that "the dark clouds are clearing (...) and 
things are going to be all right." Issues concerning security 
and the devaluation were the focus of his discussions with 
French authorities. 
  The Congo has asked for French assistance in reorganizing 
its 
security services, the weaknesses of which were exposed by the 
recent unrest in Brazzaville. When questioned about the 
devaluation, the Congolese president warned against the risk of 
repeating the maneuver due to negative reactions on the part of 
the countries concerned. 
  "The devaluation is just a monetary adjustment. If the 
economies of African states are in poor shape because negative 
policies were pursued, it is clear that those same policies will 
produce the same results as before," President Lissouba stated. 
  The devaluation should not be perceived as France abandoning 
the franc zone countries, according to President Lissouba, who 
advocates subregional and regional cooperation and the joint 
development of scientific and technological potential. 
  Speaking on his country's economic situation, President 
Lissouba announced that an agreement would be signed with the 
IMF in the "coming days," stressing that "things are well under 
way." Furthermore, President Lissouba confirmed that his country 
would reduce the number of civil service employees by 8,000, 
this on instructions from the IMF. According to President 
Lissouba, the Congo has the world's highest number of civil 
servants per capita. He stated that this is because the civil 
service is the country's sole industry. However, the Congolese 
head of state gave assurances that the affected workers will be 
redeployed elsewhere, "as quickly as possible."

  [Text] Libreville, 14 Mar (AFP) -- The curfew in force in 
Gabon since early December 1993 has been reduced. It will now 
be in force from midnight to 0530, that is from 2300 to 0430 
GMT, as of tomorrow, the national radio announced today. It was 
in force from 2100 GMT to 0430 GMT. 
  The curfew was imposed following the disturbances that 
marked 
the reelection of President Bongo on 5 December. The results of 
the poll were challenged by the opposition, and the government 
decreed a "state of alert" marked by the curfew and banning of 
gatherings. 
  This "state of alert," which was lifted on 13 February, was 
reimposed a week later, because of a general strike launched by 
a confederation of labor unions close to the opposition. The 
strike engendered acts of violence which resulted in the death 
of nine people in four days, according to official figures.

  [Excerpts] Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix arrived in 
Kigali early yesterday evening leading a delegation of 13 
parliamentarians and about 20 journalists. The minister 
discussed his visit in an interview with (Seraphin Byiringuru): 
  [Begin Delcroix recording] First of all, I am here to visit 
the Belgian soldiers who are members of UNAMIR [UN Assistance 
Mission to Rwanda]. I came here to encourage them. This is my 
first concern. 
  Second, I am taking the opportunity of this first visit to 
make contacts with my colleagues -- my colleague at the Defense 
Ministry, my colleague at the Foreign Ministry -- and to see the 
president, to hold talks on the situation in the country. 
[passage omitted] 
  You know that Rwanda is the only country with which we have 
very special military cooperation. We have maintained it. We 
had similar cooperation with other countries, but it was 
suspended. It continued with your country, and I am happy about 
this. I will try to continue with it over the coming months and 
years, but there must be conditions to help me convince our 
public opinion and my colleagues within the government that it 
is worth continuing. That is why it is really necessary for the 
situation to improve within the next few weeks. This is the 
message I also want to address to your people. [end recording]

received Angolan Ambassador Felisberto Monimambo in his office 
today. 
  The minister informed the Angolan ambassador that the 
Zairian

statements in contempt of the nation's unity and integrity made 
on Angolan soil by some Zairians in their quest for fame. The 
Zairian Government regrets that the Angolan authorities have to

disturb the fraternal and neighborly relations between the two 
countries. 
  The Zairian Government, therefore, calls on the Angolan 
Government to take all the necessary measures to discourage all 
those who may try to use its territory as a springboard for acts 
of destabilization against Zaire. The Zairian Government wishes 
to reassure the public that it has taken all the necessary steps 
to protect its territory and, if need be, it will exercise its 
right to prosecute.

  [Text] Kampala, March 14 (AFP)--The new armed struggle 
between government forces and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance 
Army (LRA) rebels is threatening to bring a new round of civil 
war in northern Uganda, observers here noted on Monday [14 
March]. 
  The fluid political atmosphere caused by eruption of new 
fighting, followed the collapse in January of secret talks 
between President Yoweri Museveni's government and LRA rebels, 
now estimated to number a few hundreds. Museveni, who has 
insisted that Kony's rebels were now a spent force, issued a 
three-week ultimatum for the rebels to surrender but they have 
so far defied him. 
  The rebels, who claim to be fighting a holy war against what 
they call a foreign occupation of Uganda, have stepped up 
ambushes and abductions in northern Ugandan districts of Kitgum, 
Gulu, Apac and Lira since the talks failed. 
  Heavily-armed government troops, backed by Armed Personel 
Carriers (APCs), have on the other hand been deployed at 
strategic points, along Lira-Kitgum road in preparation for what 
looks like a possible massive counter offensive against the 
rebels. Sources here have also said that a low-flying military 
combat helicopter and a nummber of APCs were now patrolling the 
bush along the Lira-Kitgum road, an area where the rebels have 
intensified their activities in the last two weeks, rendering 
the road impassable and paralysing all normal activities in the 
region. 
  Last Monday, the LRA rebels engaged government troops in a 
fierce battle in the area, which left one rebel killed and a lot 
of property of fleeing villagers destroyed. The battle was the 
result of a surprise attack by government forces on the rebels' 
hideout at Minakulu in Apac district, which forced the 
guerrillas to pull back towards the Murchson Falls Nataional 
Park, where they are believed to be having bases, along the 
banks of the River Nile. 
  But so far government forces have made no attempts to strike 
the suspected rebel bases in the national park, the sources 
said. 
  The renewed fighting, which observers here expected now to 
escalate with another big government offensive aimed at wiping 
out the rebellion once and for all, has thrown the population in 
the region into panic and revived memories of six years of a 
bloody civil war, which has killed and injured thousands of 
people since it erupted with a vegeance in 1987. 
  Chances for a peaceful settlement appears to have been 
severely shattered, with both sides apparently now resigned to 
settle the issue militarily. 
  Consequently, observers are increasingly fearful that the 
general chaos and civil disobedience, resulting from the 
unending rebel hostilities in northern Uganda, could disrupt the 
democratisation process in this part of the country, which is 
also home to most leading opponents to Museveni's "no-party" 
political system. 
  Two weeks ago, all Constituent Assembly candidates' campaign 
rallies were suspended for a week in Kitgum district due to 
growing insecurity. The elections, scheduled for March 28, are 
only two weeks away, with no near solution to the conflict in 
sight. 
  Museveni, who recently concluded a working visit to the war- 
ravaged region, has again repeated his earlier appeals to the 
rebels to renounce rebellion, but the rebels appear to be 
sticking to their guns until the government guaranteed their 
immunity to prosecution on surrender. 
  The rebels fear possible charges for torture and murder they 
committed on the civilian population during their operations in 
the region, and had demanded government guarantees before they 
could surrender, but the government rejected the demands. 
  At least six girls, reported abducted from Puranga Catholic 
Mission two weeks ago are still being held hostage by the rebels 
in an unknown locality.

<F P=106> [Report by Mark Gevisser] </F>
  [Text] With under seven weeks to go to the election, the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] is struggling against 
late registrations, a debilitating office move, the logistical 
strain of a last-minute change to two ballots, and conflict 
between its commissioners and its directorate. 
  International observers and non-governmental organisations 
members fear the IEC is dangerously behind deadline, though 
senior IEC members insist that they are "on track". Both 
insiders and outsiders agree, however, that the election date 
cannot be changed. 
  After just over a month on its feet and a disruptive move 
from the World Trade Centre to premises in Johannesburg, the IEC 
is only beginning to put its national infrastructure in place. 
Furthermore, the lack of clarity on final registration 
deadlines and the sheer pressure of the task at hand, has caused 
serious tensions between the IEC's senior directorate staff and 
its commissioners. 
  According to senior sources, director of electoral 
administration Piet Colyn tendered his resignation late last 
week because of interference by the commissioners, but was 
persuaded to stay. Colyn, the director-general of home affairs, 
denies that this incident took place. 
  Several commissioners confirm, however, that this tension 
does exist. "All the authority seems to lie with the 
directorate," said one, "and it's almost impossible for us to 
find out what's going on. But we are the ones who are ultimately 
responsible to the electorate." But another commissioner said 
"our working relationship with the directorate does not have 
major problems." 
  Is South Africa going to be ready for an election that will 
see up to 25-million people pass through about 80,000 voting 
booths in 10,000 polling stations observed by at least 10,000 
monitors and staffed by 207,000 officials? 
  Senior officers have just been appointed in the nine 
regions, 
from which they have until the end of the month to set up 
offices and recruit and train regional monitoring and 
administrative staff. And the last-minute registration crises, 
along with the late decision to move from one ballot to two, 
have placed an unexpected burden on the electoral timetable. 
  Many in the international observer missions and in the NGOs 
that have been doing monitoring and voter education are anxious 
that the commission appears to be behind schedule. 
  "People have great expectations," says Alice Coetzee, 
project 
director of Idasa's [Institute for a Democratic Alternative for 
South Africa] Pretoria branch. "I'm scared. If it is a 
shambles, we're going to muck up our only chance." 
  This sentiment is generally shared by members of the 
international observer community. The following issues have 
been raised with the IEC by members of these organisations: 

  -  That only a small percentage of the requisite 
administrative field-staff have been appointed, and that the 
appointment process is a month behind the timetable the IEC set 
for itself. 
  -  That provincial offices are behind deadlines. 
  -  That the double-ballot system might put pressure on 
voter-flow, 
which might result in tension at the polling stations. 
  -  That the IEC has estimated too few voting compartments. 
  -  That the double-ballot system means many of the polling 
stations will be too small. 
  -  That the security forces who will play a crucial role in 
safeguarding the passage of the ballots have not yet been 
identified and trained. 

    IEC commissioner Ben van der Ross responded: "We South 
Africans are a pretty resourceful lot. We're getting the 
message from the UN crowd that we can't do it. But we'll put 
this thing together. We're not a Cambodia or one of those places 
in a state of collapse." 
  Said Bheki Sibiya, the IEC's regional director in 
kwaZulu-Natal: "Certainly, the situation is slower than it 
should be...If the job is `substantially' well done, that's the 
best we can hope for." 
  Senior officials of the IEC's monitoring and electoral 
administration directorates are convinced that, even with the 
delays and hitches caused by the registration uncertainty, they 
can have their structures in place in time. 
  Colyn said that nearly 2,000 district electoral officers 
will 
be in place in two weeks. "And once they are there, it's an 
easy job recruiting officials to staff the polling stations." 
  Monitoring director Peter Harris said his department was 
also 
"on track". His department is recruiting and training monitors 
at the rate of around a thousand a week, and he is certain the 
10,000 monitors will be in place by early April. Monitoring 
logistics chief Francis Wilson knows that anxiety is rife at the 
apparent lateness of appointments, but said "the bulk of the 
monitors aren't needed until the polling days." 
  Van der Ross underscored this point: "Yes, it's true that we 
need 200,000 electoral officials. But about 150,000 of these 
are just to be employed for a couple of days, and their job will 
be quite mechanical. Really, they don't need more than an hour 
of training." 
  Mary Burton, presiding officer in the Western Cape, is cool 
and confident about the task ahead of her: "The time scale 
looks manageable". 
  She, along with many other newly-appointed IEC officials, 
noted that applications for positions and offers of secondment 
from the business and non-governmental sectors are pouring in. 
"I think," said one official, "that a few people are panicking. 
that's to be expected...give us a chance to actually put our 
structures in place." 
  Colyn acknowledged that "our major concern is violence. What 
happens, for example, if the situation is so violent in an area 
that polling officials don't report for duty? It is my duty to 
plan for alternatives". 
  Van der Ross said the double-ballot system has caused 
logistical problems and there was difficulty in locating large 
enough polling stations. 
  The overwhelming sense from all the senior IEC officials 
canvassed is the election will not be smooth and flawless but, 
given the limited amount of time, it will happen. 
  There's an aphorism going round the IEC's new nine-floor 
premises on Kruis Street: the commission's work is like 
building a ship while already at sea. Swimming against a tide 
of unpacked boxes and unconnected telephone-lines earlier this 
week, one wag was moved to quip: "Let's hope it's an ark, and 
not the Titanic."

  [Excerpts] Starting tomorrow, a reward awaits any Beninese 
who provides information that could help retrieve the arms and 
ammunition stolen from the Ouidah Military Camp. This was 
disclosed this morning by Minister of Defense Desire Vieyra. He 
observed that it was time to curb the growing insecurity 
threatening the country. 
  [Begin recording] [Vieyra] [Words indistinct] especially 
when 
one holds the defense portfolio. What I can say right away -- 
with the permission of the head of state -- is that exceptional 
ailments call for exceptional remedies. The government is 
prepared to handsomely reward anyone who helps it to uncover 
where these arms and ammunition are being hidden. A 
2.5-million-CFA-franc award is promised to any person who helps 
us retrieve these arms and ammunition. This is not an 
undemocratic deviation or aberration. It is done in countries 
all over the world. So we are not inventing something or doing 
anything abnormal. Where the safety of our peaceloving 
citizenry is threatened, the government must do all it can to 
reassure them. This is exactly what we mean to do now. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Which department should 
Beninese 
wishing to offer information contact? 
  [Vieyra] The Ministry of Interior. On 14 March, a special 
telephone number will be provided at the Ministry of Interior 
which people can use to communicate information. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Beninese may also want to be sure that their 
identities are kept secret. 
  [Vieyra] Their anonymity is fully guaranteed. Yes, fully 
guaranteed. They run no risk at all. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  France will also be closely involved in handling the 
security 
situation in Benin. Hence, a French delegation is due to arrive 
in Cotonou next week.

  [Text] Two months after the devaluation of the African 
Financial Community [CFA] franc, the heads of state of the West 
African Economic and Monetary Union met in Ouagadougou to take 
stock of the situation. As planned, they told Westerners about 
their impatience. Jean-Karim Fall reports: 
  [Fall] After five hours, the participants adopted a final 
communique in which they said that, despite some tensions, 
inflationary pressure has been curbed thanks to the actions 
undertaken since the devaluation of the CFA franc. French 
sources report that the average inflation rate in the zone 
amounts to around 30 percent. 
  Participants also expressed their concern over the debt 
stock 
and over the speed of payments of the promised assistance. This 
was one of the main concerns of the member countries of the 
zone. On this issue, the backers -- the IMF and the World Bank 
-- answered that they have never been so quick. However, French 
Minister of Cooperation Michel Roussin said: We will speed up 
procedures. He believes that it has been the first time in 
years that everyone has heeded the Africans' call. 
  On the whole, the heads of government and of state in 
Ouagadougou expressed their concern over the social consequences 
of the devaluation of the CFA franc. The backers -- France, the 
IMF, and the World Bank -- tried to reassure them by repeating 
that all the promises made in Dakar will be kept.

  [Excerpts] The deliberations of the two summit meetings of 
the heads of state of West African Economic and Monetary Union 
[UEMOA] and the West African Economic Community [CEAO] ended 
today in Ouagadougou. This multilateral discussion, which came 
about two months after the devaluation of the CFA franc, is 
aimed at enabling the various partners to discuss the backup 
measures with the representatives of France and the 
international financial institutions. The final communique, 
read by Jean Konan Banny, governor of the Central Bank of West 
African States, highlights the efforts of the various member 
states to contain the negative effects of the devaluation. 
  [Begin Banny recording] The heads of state and government 
noted that despite some pressure, the actions taken helped to 
contain inflation. In view of these first (?signs), the heads 
of state and government reaffirmed their determination to 
continue with the recovery of their economies in order to attain 
long-lasting growth and job creation. [end recording] [passage 
omitted] 
  At this Ouagadougou meeting, France was represented by 
French 
Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin. After the meeting, Michel 
Roussin spoke to [words indistinct] in this difficult stage. 
Michel Roussin is interviewed by Yannick Mbayala. 
  [Begin Roussin recording] I have come to testify to the 
[word

as it has done since the beginning of this operation [words 
indistinct] according to our means, because France cannot do it 
all. However, Africa has already gone a long way. [passage 
indistinct] [end recording] 
  Concerning the summit on the CEAO, we have just learned that 
it has just ended. In the final communique, the heads of state 
have agreed to dissolve the CEAO. They have therefore 
instructed the ministers concerned to take the necessary 
measures to effect this dissolution.

on items on the agenda, in particular, the project for the 
setting up of the Central African Economic and Monetary 
Community [CEMAC] as well as the examination of two conventions, 
one concerning the economic union and the other concerning the 
monetary union. They will also discuss fiscal and customs 
reform, a project started several years ago; and the maritime 
code, a project which is part of the creation of the future 
common market. These are ambitious projects but we should try 
to achieve these goals by doing away with our selfishness. This 
was stated by President Idriss Deby who is current chairman of

  [Text] Another summit is taking place in Ndjamena, where 
the Chadian president has raised the alarm to rescue the UDEAC 
[Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa]. Here are more 
details from Dieudonne Jonabaye: 
  [Begin Jonabaye recording] On opening the 29th summit of 
countries belonging to the Customs and Economic Union of Central 
Africa, UDEAC, the Chadian president, Idriss Deby, lanced the 
boil which has been sapping the Union for years, namely the 
failure of member states to pay their dues while the very same 
states had agreed to put the functioning of the Union on a 
respectable footing. The Chadian president also said, and I 
quote: Recent events force us to move faster towards the 
creation of a genuine economic and monetary union. 
  According to reliable sources close to the presidency, 
presidents present in Ndjamena and the representative of the 
Equatorial Guinean president are determined to sign the treaty 
creating the community. The same sources indicated that the 
representative of the Cameroonian president reportedly declared 
that he had no mandate from his president to sign the Treaty. 
This is Dieudonne Jonabaye reporting from RFI. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The 29th meeting of heads of state of member 
states of the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa 
[UDEAC] opened this morning at the 15 January Palace. Four heads 
of state are attending this Ndjamena summit: El Hadj Omar Bongo 
of Gabon, Pascal Lissouba of Congo, Ange Felix Patasse of the 
Central African Republic, and Chadian President Idriss Deby, who 
is UDEAC's current chairman. Equatorial Guinea was represented 
at this summit by Deputy Prime Minister Do Anatolio Ndong Mba 
while Cameroon was represented by (Luc Ayan), president of the 
Economic and Social Council. 
  Opening the 29th Council of heads of state this morning at 
the 15 January Palace, Chadian President Colonel Idriss Deby 
called for an active solidarity within the subregional 
organization to meet the numerous challenges of this time marked 
by the devaluation of the CFA franc. We must safeguard the 
organization so as to give it a new impetus to be able to 
achieve a true economic integration. Let us listen to Chadian 
President Idriss Deby as he addressed the opening session this 
morning: 
  [Begin Deby recording] The summit of the (?Central African 
Monetary Union) will be held in a few weeks, following the 
summits in Dakar, Yamoussoukro [words indistinct]. This unusual 
chain of meetings at the highest level demonstrates the 
(?seriousness of our problems). It also shows the need to 
increase our awareness and the need for a concerted approach to 
current problems. Already confronted by difficult political, 
economic, and social realities, our countries are now seriously 
shaken by the devaluation of the CFA franc which occurred in 
January 1994. The summit will offer the right opportunity to 
expand our views on this great (?shock) which has hit the root 
of our economies. We must use the opportunity to take a 
critical look at the life of our common institution [words 
indistinct] and to define future orientations. Indeed, our 
summit on 6 December 1991 in Libreville adopted a program spread 
over several years. Its fundamental objective was to give a new 
impetus to our organization to make it an efficient tool for 
economic integration. That program was the main task we tackled 
during 1993 [passage indistinct] in Bata was used to deepen our 
views and improve the program for the reform and [words 
indistinct]. 
  However, everything is not perfect yet. We achieved 
substantial progress and our discussions continued through 
seminars and workshops by experts. The transport sector of the 
program also led us to [passage indistinct] as you are aware, to 
facilitate the movement of goods between our states, and, in 
particular, the supply of goods to the land-locked states. 
[passage indistinct] was granted by the European Union to 
improve river transportation between Bangui and Brazzaville. 
The European Union also granted an assistance of 5.5 million 
Units of Account, that is (?3.7 billion) CFA francs, for the 
organization of transit process [words indistinct] agreed upon 
by mutual consent. The financial agreement will be signed in a 
few days with the Central African Republic and the UDEAC 
headquarters, which is the regional coordinator for this 
project. Our wish is that all these operations should take 
place (?simultaneously) so as to give our people reasons for 
hope and confidence in our development efforts. [end recording]

  [Text] There is new violence in Bujumbura. Grenade 
explosions last night resulted in deaths and injuries in the 
Burundian capital. It is once again violence of a 
political-ethnic character. The 13 members of the National 
Security Council who have just been appointed by the Burundian 
head of state, Cyprien Ntaryamira, have a lot to do. Gerard 
Furazima reports from Bujumbura. 
  [Begin Furazima recording] Three people have died in the 
area 
of Nyakabiga. This is the toll of the tragedy which took place 
in the evening of 14 March when a group of still unidentified 
people launched a grenade attack on a house at about 0100. The 
house caught fire and was still burning early this morning. The 
fire brigade managed to extinguish the fire, but there was 
extensive damage. 
  This violence of a political-ethnic character has produced 
victims among the Hutu majority ethnic group as well as the 
Tutsi minority. The phenomenon of ethnicization of popular 
areas like Kamenge and Kinama in the north of the capital, which 
are invaded day after day by Hutu looters, is increasing. To 
the south, Nyakabiga and Musaga are more and more inhabited by 
Tutsis. Fear and insecurity prevail within the remaining 
families in all these areas where their respective ethnic group 
members become scarce. 
  A grenade thrown last night in a bar in Musaga in the south 
of the capital resulted in one person seriously wounded. In any 
case, the 13 members of the National Security Council, just 
appointed by President Cyprien Ntaryamira today, have a lot to 
do. Will they manage to stop the diabolical spiral of violence 
in Burundi since the murder on 21 October 1993 of Mr. Melchior 
Ndadaye, the democratically elected president? This is a great 
challenge for them. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Yaounde, 15 March (AFP) -- Cameroon opposition 
leader John Fru Ndi is to travel to Nigeria in a new bid to 
resolve a border dispute which has threatened to grow into open 
conflict between the two countries, a report said Tuesday [15 
March]. 
  In an interview with the weekly MESSAGER, the Social 
Democratic Front (SDF) leader said he wanted to bring diplomats 
who have negotiated for the two countries in the past back into 
the process to help resolve the dispute. "We want to bring 
together all the members of the various commissions set up over 
the years...to establish that the border has been known for a 
long time, and should not be changed," he said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Fru Ndi said in particular he wanted to meet former Nigerian 
presidents, who he said were "living witnesses," to see if they 
could help resolve the dispute. 
  Meanwhile press reports in Lagos said Cameroon President 
Paul 
Biya has agreed to meet his Nigerian counterpart General Sani 
Abacha, but not on Nigerian soil. [passage omitted] 
  French involvement in the dispute also came in for renewed 
criticism Tuesday. France has a military pact with Cameroon, 
and has sent a number of troops and ammunition to Yaounde. In 
Accra, Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibn Chambas was quoted as 
saying: "Ghana is very worried about the French intervention," 
and calling on Paris to withdraw immediately. Fru Ndi told 
MESSAGER that France's "aim is to make us buy arms and kill each 
other while the whites laugh."

  [Text] In Gabon, Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba's meeting 
with opposition and majority group representatives, as well as 
independent candidates at the last presidential elections has 
been postponed. Officially, this was due to schedule 
constraints. The High Council of Resistance took this 
opportunity to hold a news conference in Libreville today. The 
High Council of Resistance says it agrees with the head of state 
and the prime minister on the idea of dialogue. There are, 
however, several outstanding differences to be solved. The 
opposition thinks discussions should focus mainly on the 
progress of democracy. During the news conference, the High 
Council of Resistance deputy chairman, Jean-Louis Agondjo-Okawe, 
stressed that while the opposition remains open to dialogue, it 
will not take part in negotiations in a state of emergency, 
referring to the state of alert, which was reimposed following 
recent disturbances in Libreville. Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe 
spoke to Jonas Lomba. 
  [Begin Agondjo-Okawe recording] The situation must first of 
all be eased. We can then begin negotiations in the presence of 
mediators. First, we need to remove all these obstacles before 
starting negotiations; not to discuss the formation of a 
government or the government's program, but to hold proper 
discussions [words indistinct] on the state of democracy. The 
national conference democracy is still (?in its early stages). 
We do not want to be told that we first have to enter a 
government because that is out of the question. We want the 
United States to be present at the negotiations for a number of 
reasons. First, it is currently the world's greatest power, and 
second, we are obliged to trade with it. It will also be a 
guarantee for the Gabonese. [end recording]

  [Text] Rwanda is sinking deeper into political crisis. 
Listen to Francois Reichmans's report from Kigali. He is a 
colleague with Belgian Radio-Television: 
  [Reichmans] The vehicles of humanitarian organizations can 
be 
seen in the Rwandan capital, as well as the jeeps and the light 
armored vehicles of UN soldiers. There are night patrols, a 
curfew is in force, the town is anxious. Weapons and grenades 
are changing hands. Districts have set up militias armed with 
bows and arrows, as well as bludgeons. 
  There will soon be 2,500 UN soldiers in Rwanda, including 
450 
Belgians who have already been here for four months. The UN 
mission in Rwanda [MINUAR] is an operation aiming at maintaining 
peace. The UN soldiers have been deployed to contribute to the 
implementation of the Arusha peace accords. Things are now at a 
total standstill: There is still no parliament and no 
broad-based government, but a political vacuum and rumors that 
the war has resumed. The UN representative in Rwanda, 
Cameroonian Jacques-Rene Booh-Booh, issued another warning on 
Friday: The UN soldiers may leave: 
  [Booh-Booh] I would like to remind you that the MINUAR 
is saying quite simply that the economic and social situation in 
the country is worsening; that famine is killing large numbers 
of people; that insecurity is taking a firm hold; and that at 
the end of the day, the signatory countries of the Arusha peace 
accord have not yet honored their commitments. The peace 
process is at a standstill. The specter of a new war is 
persisting. I would like you to remember that the MINUAR can 
only enjoy continuing support if parties implement quickly all 
the Arusha peace accords. On 4 or 5 April, if there has not 
been substantial progress in the implementation of the Arusha 
peace accord, we may not continue our activities. This was said 
on several occasions by the Security Council and, only recently, 
by the Security Council chairman. 
  [Reichmans] The outgoing Rwandan prime minister, Agathe 
Uwilingiyamana, came from the main opposition party, the 
Republican Democratic Movement [MDR]. Her successor has already 
been appointed, but he has not yet taken up office. The Rwandan 
prime minister has denounced the paralysis, while the situation 
in the country is worrying: 
  [Uwiliniyamana] We have security problems. Almost 
every day, people are killed, whether they are poor peasants or 
political leaders. Famine is raging in the country. In almost 
every part of our country, people die of hunger every day. 
People die of diseases such as dysentery and malaria. You see, 
we do not have institutions capable of negotiating with our 
donors, our backers, in order to solve these problems. The 
Rwandan people want peace. They can no longer bear waiting for 
the institutions to be set up. The Rwandan people believe that 
this is their only salvation. The setting up of the broad-based 
transitional government means the end of the war, it means 
peace. 
  [Reichmans] Rwanda is stifling under the weight of refugees. 
Those from the north, after the war; those from the south, those 
from Burundi, who came in October. People were traumatized by 
the coup and the massacres in Burundi, the sister country. Two 
officials of political parties were assassinated a fortnight 
ago, and this caused concern. Several attempts to mend the 
accords turned out to be a failure. Political maneuvers led to 
radicalization on both sides. The political center has been 
weakened. The Rwandan prime minister has condemned President 
Habyarimana's division tactics: 
  [Uwilingiyamana] Some political leaders are showing a 
lack of goodwill, irresponsibility even. We have my own 
political party, the MDR, and the Liberal Party. In both 
parties, there have been different tendencies, but at some 
stage, the president started supporting one of the tendencies in 
his party. Division, confusion within both parties has 
prevented the establishment of the institutions. I believe that 
ethnic differences were used. This is more obvious as far as 
the Liberal Party is concerned: They believe that there is a 
Tutsi faction and a Hutu faction. The Rwandan people are not 
ready to give themselves over to this extremism. Extremists will 
always be wrong, whatever their ethnic origins.

  [Text] We move on to the High Council of the 
Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT]. Each day that passes 
curiously resembles the one before it. We all know that faced 
with the wall of misunderstanding erected before him by the two 
political forces on the scene -- each of which stuck steadfastly 
to its guns regarding the appointment of the interim prime 
minister -- Monsignor Monsengwo-Pasinya, HCR-PT speaker, 
submitted for consideration by yesterday's plenary session a 
proposal based on the appointment of a head of government by a 
political group other than that of the president of the 
Republic. This head of government will set up a truly national 
unity team that will have to inspire the confidence of the 
HCR-PT before it is formally enacted into office by an executive 
instrument. Today's plenary session therefore centered on this 
proposal by the HCR-PT speaker but there too, [Oscar] Kambamba 
Kasongo, it was, unfortunately, a fiasco. Good evening, Oscar. 
  [Kasongo] Good evening. You are perfectly right. It was yet 
another fruitless plenary session today at the HCR-PT, where the 
two forces in the arena -- two forces, surely, because there is 
bipolarity -- were unable to agree. 
  The main thrust of this disagreement which has lasted the 
past four days may be summed up by two notions, namely, the 
source of legitimacy of power and the method of appointing the 
interim prime minister. 
  For the Sacred Union -- i.e., the Sacred Union of the 
Radical 
Opposition and Allies [USORAS] -- there is no alternative forum 
to the Sovereign National Conference [CNS] because everyone took 
part in that conference and participated in electing Prime 
Minister Tshisekedi, and also because the two parties present 
contributed to the drafting of the deed setting forth the 
constitutional arrangements for the transition period. 
  The Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC] find their 
legitimacy in the new forum offered by the HCR-PT, the only 
institution that should appoint the prime minister and to which 
the latter and his team will be fully answerable. The head of 
government must therefore be elected by that institution because 
the office of prime minister is vacant at the moment. He must 
also be elected from among several aspirants. In short, 
therefore, these are the stakes on the floor at the People's 
Palace. 
  This evening, Counselor Kamanda wa Kamanda, on behalf of 
USORAS, rejected the proposal put forward yesterday by the 
[HCR-PT] executive organ and categorically ruled out that put 
forward this very evening by Counselor Mutomoba Kafansenda on 
behalf of his political group. This new FPC proposal may be 
summed up as follows: The prime minister should be elected by 
the HCR-PT by a simple majority vote from among candidates put 
up by political camps other than that of the head of state. You 
perfectly understand the issue: The proposal was rejected 
because it contains the notion of election by the HCR-PT, 
instead of by consensus. 
  The Rally of Forces for Democratic Change, commonly known as 
the Allies, also attempted to end the deadlock by making a 
proposal, which was equally turned down because it contains the 
idea of election by the HCR-PT. 
  In short, two points in the various formulas proposed 
receive 
the approval of the two political groups. These are: The prime 
minister is the head of government. That is accepted by 
everyone. Also, he must be installed in office by the head of 
state. That point is also accepted. So the disagreement 
centers mainly on whether the election of the prime minister 
should be done by the CNS or even by the HCR-PT. Opinions here 
depend on whether one belongs to the USORAS or to the FPC. This 
is where the four-day old deadlock -- for that is what it is -- 
really lies. 
  The executives, with the assistance of the parliamentary 
group, has undertaken to handle the dispute which will be 
examined on 16 March from 1000 local time. It may be recalled 
that what we refer to here as parliamentary group is simply a 
group that will comprise the various representatives of the 
forces on the scene.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Hasan Dahli: "Armed Djibouti Opposition </F>
Leader: Opposition in Control of Situation in North"] 
  [Excerpts] Paris--Ahmed Dini Ahmed, leader of the Front for 
the Restoration of Unity and Democracy in Djibouti, has denied 
the report that a military coup has been staged inside his 
organization under the leadership of Oghriyah Kafliyah Ahmed [as 
transliterated]. 
  The report of the coup was circulated after the distribution 
of a hand-written statement in Djibouti city. The report was 
carried by AFP three days ago. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Ahmed Dini stressed that he is 
in 
constant contact with the other members of the political and 
military leadership, who told him that the "information leaked 
by the government and the quarters colluding with it are 
absolutely baseless." He went on: "Under the interception 
policy pursued by the government of President Hassan Gouled 
Aptidon, it is trying to fabricate a coup and problems inside 
the opposition, instead of working to solve the country's 
endless problems." 
  Asked about the military situation in north Djibouti, he 
said: "On 3 March government forces tried to infiltrate our 
positions in the Mabla area between Tadjoura and Wabekh [as 
transliterated], but they were forced to return to their bases 
after suffering heavy losses in lives and equipment." [passage 
omitted] 
  Concluding his statement, Ahmed Dini Ahmed said: "A few 
weeks ago I made extensive contacts with most leaders of the 
Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy and decided in 
principle to hold an emergency meeting on 20 March to discuss 
military and political developments in the light of my visit -- 
the first of its kind -- to Belgium, Germany, and Italy."

  [Excerpts] Nine people were killed and hundreds displaced 
in renewed raids in Molo, Nakuru District [Rift Valley 
Province], by unknown assailants, according to reports from 
survivors of the raids who talked to THE STANDARD in Kisii town. 
About 200 Kisiis arrived in the town on Monday [14 March] night 
and told a tale of a night of terror by a group which killed 
some people and forced the rest out of their houses at Mau 
Summit, Molo Division. 
  A frail-looking middle-aged woman narrated to THE STANDARD 
how her three children were hacked to death by the attackers 
armed with arrows and swords. She claimed that the incident 
occurred last Friday at Kamara Centre, Mau Summit, within Molo 
Division. [passage omitted] The woman also said that her three 
neighbours, whom she identified as Atuti Amenya, Thomas Ariga 
and Joash Omariba, were also killed together with three other 
children. 
  The other fleeing victims claimed that they had been beaten 
up and forced out of their houses in two consecutive nights by 
the raiders. They claimed that they had travelled to Molo 
police station where transport was arranged for and Nyayo buses 
hired to transport them to Kisii. 
  Mrs. Ong'era said that her dead children together with the 
other victims had their bodies taken to Molo Hospital mortuary 
by police. Contacted, the officer commanding police division 
Molo, Simon Kipkania, said he was not aware of the incident, but 
said he would investigate the claims. When THE STANDARD tried 
to reach him later, his family said he had travelled to Rongai.

  [Text] Police have denied reports of a fresh flare-up of 
clashes in Molo Division during which it is alleged nine people 
were killed and hundreds displaced. In a statement to the KBC, 
the Rift Valley provincial police officer, Francis Sang, said 
investigations as on the spot check at Kamara and Mau Summit 
showed that no clashes whatsoever occurred in the area as 
imagined by the reporters from THE STANDARD newspaper in an 
article published today. [sentence as heard] He noted that 
despite having checked with the Molo police chief who refuted 
the story, the two reporters went ahead and published their 
(?illusory) story. Mr. Sang also said a check with the Nyayo 
Bus Corporation confirmed that none of their vehicles had been 
hired to transport those displaced from Molo to Kisii town as 
reported in the press. He said appropriate machinery was 
already in place to ensure the authors of the story, which was 
obviously meant to create animosity and disrupt peace in Molo, 
are brought to book.

  [Text] Kampala, March 15 (AFP)--At least five civilians 
died in crossfire during a fierce battle between government 
forces and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels in 
northern Uganda's Gulu district last Thursday [10 March], the 
official NEW VISION newspaper reported Tuesday. 
  The fighting followed heavy deployment of heavily-armed 
government National Resistance Army (NRA) troops in northern 
Uganda last week, which were reported to have taken up positions 
along Kitgum-Lira road, an area where rebel activity had 
intensified considerably. 
  The rebels stepped up their operations after peace talks 
with 
the government stalled last January. 
  In Thursday's encounter, which forced civilians to flee as 
the gunbattle raged, several other people were reported injured. 
There were no details on the number of soldiers casualties, but 
an NRA truck was seen at Minanuki ferrying bodies of those 
killed in the latest clashes. 
  An eyewitness said an unidentified woman lost one leg after 
she was hit by an rocket-propelled shell as she tried to run to 
safety. 
  Another fierce battle broke out the following day at 
Lela-Lakim lasting over three hours, which may have claimed 
more civilians casualties, New Vision also said. 
  During the two days of battle, many of the local people were 
said to have been ordered to leave their homes for safer zones. 
  This has been one of the bloodiest clashes between the NRA 
and the rebels since the government ordered a counter offensive 
to wipe out the rebels and end the bloody six-year civil war.

  [Text] A delegation from the Nigerian War College headed by 
Brigadier General Victor Malu, which is currently in Uganda on a 
study tour, has held discussions with the first deputy prime 
minister and national political commissar, Mr. Eriya Kategaya, 
and directors in the National Resistance Movement's [NRM] 
secretariat in Kampala. 
  The delegation, which comprises of senior Nigerian officers 
ranging from brigadier to colonels and Nigerian Government 
civilian representatives, is interested in studying the National 
Resistance Movement's structure to see what it could offer in 
the search for a solution to African political, social, and 
economic problems. The delegation has also visited Makerere 
University, where discussions were held with the political 
science and history departments of the university. 
  The first deputy prime minister and national political 
commissar, while opening the discussions, told Nigerian military 
officers of the need for Africa to find permanent solutions to 
its political problems and informed them that this has been the 
chief mission of the National Resistance Movement. He spoke of 
the need to involve the population in politics and to think of 
what ought to be the role of the army in African politics. He 
said the army, which is the most organized part of society, 
cannot escape responsibility in politics of the nation. Mr. 
Kategaya also emphasized the issue of Africa devising its own 
solutions to its problems and commended Nigeria for its leading 
role in the efforts to bring about peace in Liberia.

  [Text] There have been calls for the Council of State of 
the Liberia National Transitional Government to take a decision 
regarding the remaining four unallocated ministries. In an 
opinion poll conducted recently by the first national poll 
administrator, more than 75 percent of those interviewed, said 
since the Council comprises representatives of the parties to 
the Cotonou Accord, the Council must resolve the issue. Some of 
the respondents pointed out that under the Cotonou Accord, the 
Council of State is nonfactional and must make the appointments. 
At the Cotonou meeting in July last year, the four ministries 
-- finance, foreign affairs, justice, and defense -- were not 
allocated due to disagreement by the parties. 
  At a subsequent meeting in Monrovia this February, the 
parties could still not resolve the issue but agreed that the UN 
representative to Liberia, Trevor Gordon-Somers, seek the 
opinion of the OAU, ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African 
States], and the UN secretary general, to advise him on what to 
do before consulting the parties on the issue. On an ELBC Radio 
program, "Hot Line", Ambassador Somers admitted that the issue 
of the four ministries was unresolved. Offering his personal 
opinion, Mr. Somers said if the Council of State was indeed 
imminent, the ministries issue should be (?left for it).

  [Text] Bamako, 14 Mar (AFP) -- Today, the official MALIAN 
PRESS AGENCY [AMAP] disclosed that one person died and six 
others were wounded in clashes between "armed bandits" and a 
Malian military patrol near Nara, 400 km north of Bamako. 
According to AMAP, the incident happened on 11 March when 12 
"armed bandits" -- a term used to describe Tuareg "rebels" -- 
tried to hold the people of Dilly subprefecture to ransom. It 
did not specify whether the victims belonged to the police or 
were "armed bandits." 
  There has been an upsurge in armed attacks, often among 
Tuaregs, in northern Mali since the beginning of March. One 
such attack led to the death of Colonel Bilal Saloum, one of the 
leaders of the Popular Movement of the Azaouad, signatory party 
to the April 1992 peace pact between the Tuaregs and the Malian 
Government.

  [Text] Bamako, 15 Mar (PANA) -- In Mali, the personnel of 
15 public administration establishments [EPA], including the 
MALIAN PRESS AGENCY, and the Malian Radio and Television 
Broadcasting Office, embarked on a 48-hour strike on 15 March in 
response to a call by their union committees. 
  The striking workers are accusing the government of trying 
to 
transfer EPA workers into another department without having made 
any prior arrangements. According to the unions, the 
authorities' decision stems from a promise made to the World 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund to keep salary 
commitments at the current level of 42 billion CFA francs. 
  For two months now, the EPA personnel expenses have 
allegedly 
been charged to Chapter 21 of the national budget, which is on 
subsidies, and not to Chapter 11, which is on salaries. In the 
unions' view, this is likely to make the EPA personnel's salary 
situation precarious in the long run. The state could gradually 
transfer salary costs to the departments which employ them. 
  For several months now, the authorities have been saying 
that 
the rearrangement is purely technical. It should be pointed out 
that they have decided to increase salaries by 15 percent, 10 
percent of which will be paid as of 1 April and 5 percent in 
October. 
  In Bamako, FM transmissions on Radio France International 
and 
Africa No. 1 were interrupted due to the strike, which has also 
affected all the major hospitals in Bamako and its surroundings.

  [Text] The parliamentary opposition has reacted to the 10 
March incidents on the University of Niamey campus. In a 
communique issued today, the parliamentary opposition says it is 
with great sadness that it has learned of the assassination of 
Harouna Tahirou, a student, following the unwarranted police 
intervention on campus, which infringed upon academic freedom. 
The communique further states that this odious act should be 
blamed entirely on the authorities of the Third Republic, who in 
order to ensure their survival no longer hesitate to give orders 
which are clearly illegal. 
  Nigerois can see from these incidents that there is a slide 
toward totalitarianism. The Alliance of Forces of Change 
government has adopted a dictatorial attitude because any time 
social forces demonstrate for their demands to be met, the 
authorities systematically resort to imprisonment and violence, 
leading sometimes to deaths. 
  The parliamentary opposition calls on the government to 
conduct investigations to find out who gave the orders for this 
cowardly assassination so that the culprits can be brought to 
justice. Finally, the parliamentary opposition extends its 
condolences to the bereaved family and the Niger School Union. 
  PNT-Albarka [expansion unknown] has also reacted to the 10 
March incidents. They issued a communique at the end of their 
party's executive committee meeting denouncing, quote, the 
tendency of the Third Republican authorities to seriously 
violate individual and collective rights as seen in the attempts 
to bring the state and private press to heel; the repression 
against student and women demonstrators, and intimidation of 
unions, end quote. PNT condemns the indiscriminate repression 
against the 10 March demonstrators. The attitude which 
accompanies this behavior still exists, although people thought 
it had been done away with, show that the struggle for the 
institution of true democracy is a continuous process.

  [Excerpt] Lagos, 15 March (AFP) -- Nigeria on Tuesday [15 
March] rejected a demand by Cameroon that Nigeria withdraw its 
troops from a border area which Cameroon claims as its own as a 
condition for holding summit talks to settle the dispute. 
Nigerian Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe, interviewed on 
television said the demand was "unacceptable" since the very 
reason for the proposed summit was to discuss the dispute over 
the Bakassi Peninsula in the oil and fish-rich Gulf of Guinea. 
  "Of course that (pre-condition) is unacceptable. The precise 
point of their meeting is to discuss the Bakassi dispute so the 
question of withdrawing from Bakassi before the meeting does not 
arise," Kingibe said. He said however that Nigeria was 
considering an offer from Cameroonian President Paul Biya to 
meet his Nigerian counterpart General Sani Abacha on neutral 
ground in Africa. 
  "As you know, the head of state (Abacha) invited President 
Biya to come to Abuja to discuss the Bakassi problem (...) the 
invitation was extended without preconditions and the invitation 
was accepted without pre-conditions", the minister said. 
  Kingibe who spent two days in Cameroon for talks last week 
said that before he went Biya had said he was willing to attend 
talks in Maiduguri, capital of Nigeria's north-eastern Borno 
State near the Cameroon border. However Kingibe said that when 
he met officials in Yaounde it "became clear that the 
Cameroonians were shifting their position regarding 
conditionalities before the meeting could take place--that the 
gesture of goodwill and good faith should be made by Nigeria and 
that we should withdraw our troops from Bakassi before President 
Biya could meet with General Abacha in Maiduguri." 
  The Cameroonians said that the "Cameroonian public opinion 
would not understand their president coming to Nigeria when 
Nigerian troops are in what they consider to be their 
territory." They suggested that "the two heads of state should 
meet in a neutral country and we are working towards that," 
Kingibe said. 
  Biya said Monday in Yaounde that the meeting could be held 
in 
Cairo since Egypt currently holds the chair of the Organisation 
of African Unity. Kingibe said he would travel Wednesday to 
Cairo to present Nigeria's position on the dispute to the 
Egyptian authorities. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Federal Government has said that it would not 
tolerate unprovoked aggression or intimidation by any foreign 
power. The minister of information and culture, Professor Jerry 
Gana, stated this today in Abuja at a ceremony to commemorate 
the 39th anniversary of the Nigerian Union of Journalists. 
Gbenga Onoyiga reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Onoyiga] Prof. Gana said journalists 
should educate and mobilize people to resist the current 
interference by France, which he said has benefited so much from 
the sweat and resources of Nigerians. He called for the 
promotion of internal cohesion to firmly resist any attempt by 
that country to humiliate Nigeria. 
  [Gana] Enough is enough. We are a very peace-loving nation. 
We are certainly leaders in Africa, but it is not always that 
leaders ought to (?just be humiliated). We believe that we have 
a responsibility, and we hope that diplomacy will solve it. But 
even if diplomacy does not solve it, I (?quickly) warn Nigerians 
to be united, to be mobilized, to be ready for any eventuality. 
  [Onoyiga] The minister urged journalists to take up the 
challenge of defending human rights and social justice without 
destroying the solid fabric of the society. They should also 
protect the society from the growing abuse of the power of 
communication by developed nations. 
  In a paper on government's past election, the chief press 
secretary to the head of state, Mr. David Attah, advised the 
media to keep clear the law as a catalyst in the development of 
the nation by aiding government in identifying problems and 
preparing solutions. He said the present administration should 
be judged on the quality of its decisions. Mr. Attah noted that 
the smear campaign by a section of the press has created 
widespread disaffection and this is why he has called for 
caution. 
  The minister of federal capital territory, Lieutenant 
General 
Jeremiah Useni, in a message, urged journalists to uphold the 
enviable record of the past. The national president of the 
union, Mallam Sani Zorro, urged newsmen to use the day of 
solidarity to rededicate themselves to the great ideals of the 
founding fathers of the union. [end recording]

  [Text] The flag officer commanding Western Naval Command, 
Rear Admiral (Jibril Layinla), says the Nigerian Navy is in the 
desired state of readiness for the protection of the nation's 
territorial waters and her citizens. He was speaking today at a 
news conference on the conclusion of his first command fleet 
exercise which, he said, was aimed at assessing the material 
state of readiness and fleet efficiency of his command. He said 
that the exercise, which started during the Ramadan, was 
designed to assess the fleet weapon system and the performances 
of the men on the machines. He noted that the exercise 
generated a lot of interest against the background of a similar 
military exercise between the French and Beninois navies in 
Benin Republic. 
  While describing the military exercise as routine, Rear Adm. 
(Layinla) said the Navy will spare no effort in carrying out its 
military role of defending the country. He described the 
exercise as successful and debunked the speculations of a 
Cameroonian Navy attack on Nigerian vessels. 
  [Begin recording] We went out today to exercise in an area 
which we call (Alpha Hot Spot), which is off our own waters. If 
you consider the boundary with the Republic of Benin, it means 
we are not far from each other at all. They are on one side of 
the exercise area, and we are on the other side of the exercise 
area. [end recording] 
  On the absence of the Nigerian Navy in the Bakassi 
Peninsula, 
Rear Adm. (Layinla) stated that because the area is too shallow 
for naval ships, it is the responsibility of the Amphibious 
Brigade of the Nigerian Army, while the Navy provides support 
from the sea. The command fleet exercise ended today with four 
ships, a frigate, two fast attack crafts, and a service vessel.

  [Text] Lagos, 14 Mar (AFP) -- The Campaign for Democracy 
[CD], the organization composed of many Nigerian human rights 
associations, wrote to the French, Nigerian, and Cameroonian 
heads of state to stress the irrelevance of a war in the 
resolution of the border dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon. 
In the letters to the three presidents, Francois Mitterrand, 
Paul Biya, and Sani Abacha -- with copies received by AFP today 
-- the CD believes that a war over the Bakassi Peninsula would 
only worsen the two African countries' social problems. 
  In the text sent to President Mitterrand, the CD criticizes 
French intervention in the dispute "because of its potential for 
provocation." "The present French intervention as part of the 
treaty between Paris and Yaounde -- while the dispute could be 
resolved bilaterally and regionally -- contradicts the ideals of 
the United Nations and its bodies, especially the Security 
Council, where your country has a permanent seat," the letter 
indicates. 
  In the letters sent to the Cameroonian and Nigerian 
presidents, the CD accuses the two leaders of using the border 
issue "to divert" their fellow citizens' attention from the 
socio-economic problems of their respective countries. 
  According to the CD, a diplomatic solution should be found 
to 
this crisis which has been affecting the relations between the 
two countries for two and a half months now.

friendly nations over the Bakassi Peninsula dispute with 
Cameroon. Receiving the Iranian deputy minister of culture and 
Islamic guidance, 'Ali Larijani, Prof. Gana described Cameroon 
as Nigeria's brother. He said France should allow both 
countries to settle their differences in a true African way. He 
was happy at the evolving relationship between Nigeria and Iran 
and hoped that when the cultural and education agreement between 
the two countries is signed, it will open up other areas of 
cooperation both in economic and technological fields.

  [Excerpts] Lagos, 15 March (PANA) -- Prince Yormie Johnson, 
the Liberian rebel leader who claimed responsibility for the 
assassination of former President Samuel Doe, says he wants to 
return home to take part in Liberia's political transition 
programme. "I want to go home now. It is not fair to continue 
to keep me here (in Nigeria) and prevent me from participating 
in the peace process," the Nigerian press quoted Johnson Tuesday 
[15 March] as saying. 
  Johnson was leader of the Independent National Patriotic 
Front of Liberia (INPFL), a breakaway faction of Charles 
Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). [passage 
omitted] 
  "Charles Taylor who shed uncountable blood is now 
participating in the peace process. What of me who wanted peace 
all along and supported the cause of peace," Johnson was quoted 
Tuesday as saying. He said that he did not seek asylum in 
Nigeria before he was brought in December 1992. "Nigeria 
plotted my coming here. They have been taking good care of me 
and my family," he said, adding: "If I am to think of the good 
things the government makes sure I enjoy, I may not bother to go 
home." "But the point is this: Where is my future? What of my 
teeming supporters in Liberia, in Europe, in America and 
elsewhere in the world"? he asked. 
  Johnson said he has written to the Nigerian military leader, 
Gen. Sani Abacha and the ECOWAS chairman, President Nicephore 
Soglo of Benin Republic on his fate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Freetown, March 15 (AFP) -- Four Irish people from a 
Catholic mission in the east of Sierra Leone, including a 
three-year-old child, have been killed by rebels, the government 
said Tuesday [15 March] in a statement. 
  Father Felini MacAlister, Robert Elco, a doctor, his wife 
Karena and their daughter Zita were caught by automatic gunfire 
Saturday during an attack by United Revolutionary Front (RUF) 
rebels near the hospital at Panguma, 240 kilometres (145 miles) 
east of here, it said. They had been trying to escape the 
attack in three vehicles along with five other colleagues. One 
of the others, New Zealand doctor Ann Greeling, was captured by 
RUF forces but was freed unharmed by government forces, 
according to the statement. 
  The two others, Irish nun Madeline Naughton and her Nigerian 
colleague Jestina Igwu, escaped unscathed as did Americans Mary 
Tippet and Arthur Gordon. 
  Last August, two nurses from the International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC) were killed and a third wounded in the 
Pujehun region, 210 kilometres (125 miles) southeast of Freetown 
during an attack attributed to the RUF. 
  The rebellion, which started in May 1991, has increased in 
intensity since December in the east near the Liberian border 
and in the south along the Atlantic coast.

Counselor (Hegbor), first deputy chairman--recorded] 
  [Text] The Action Committee for Renewal, CAR, is delighted 
that the Supreme Court of Togo on 14 March proclaimed the 
results of the second round of the parliamentary elections 
exactly as they had been recorded by the National Electoral 
Commission [CEN]. The CAR expresses its profound gratitude to 
all those who worked toward the success of these elections in 
many ways, particularly the CEN, the International Monitoring 
Committee, friendly countries, the French and Burkinabe military 
observers, the international civilian observers, the security 
forces, the prefects, and the mayors. The CAR also wishes to 
thank the electorate who turned out in their numbers during both 
the first and second rounds of the poll. 
  Finally, the CAR thanks its activists, particularly its 
representatives at polling stations, for the quality work done. 
The CAR considers the victory achieved by the opposition as the 
victory of the entire Togolese people, who have in this manner 
expressed their desire for change, for the birth of a new Togo 
in which all Togolese, civilian or in the army, feel a sense of 
brotherhood irrespective of their political persuasion or tribe, 
so that the social and political conditions conducive to 
reviving our country's socioeconomic development may be created. 
To this end, it is important that the men and women who will 
direct the nation's affairs following these elections are chosen 
in accordance with the will manifested by the people.

social peace, and security in the country to enable the rapid 
resumption of economic activities. The modalities for forming a 
new government were not tackled at the meeting but the CAR 
leader said when the time comes the two opposition parties, who 
won the absolute majority of seats at the National Assembly, 
will hold discussions with the head of state as a united front.

<F P=106> [By Francis Ahouadi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Lome, 15 March (AFP) -- Long-standing rivalries 
have quickly resurfaced among Togo's opposition parties to wreck 
their chances of forming a new government after they won a 
majority of seats in the first free general election since 
independence more than 30 years ago. Official results issued by 
the Supreme Court on Monday [14 March] gave the Action Committee 
for Renewal (CAR) 36 seats, making it Togo's leading political 
party after last month's two-round vote. Seven seats went to 
its ally the Union for Democracy (UTD), giving them an absolute 
majority in parliament which has 81 members. The Togolese 
People's Rally (RPT) supporting military ruler Gnassingbe 
Eyadema got 35 seats, and another pro-Eyadema movement, the 
Union for Justice and Democracy, won two. 
  CAR chief Yao Agboyibor immediately hailed the result as a 
victory for the Togolese people and said he was sure Eyadema's 
consultations on the appointment of new government leaders "will 
lead to choices in line with the voting. Any other outcome 
would be a scandal." 
  Agboyibor, 51, a lawyer, was widely expected to be Eyadema's 
choice as premier, since under the Constitution the head of 
state has to pick a prime minister from the parliamentary 
majority. But UTD leader Edem Kodjo sent shockwaves through 
opposition ranks within hours of the results being announced 
when he repudiated a mid-election pact with the CAR. He 
reopened the bidding by stating flatly that nobody could claim 
the 41-seat absolute majority in Parliament without his 
movement, and the UDT was not simply to be accounted part of 
just any coalition. "We want our friends in the CAR to take us 
seriously," he said. "We are a pivotal party and intend 
remaining so." [passage omitted] 
  Agboyibor and Kodjo had a meeting scheduled for Monday but 
it 
was cancelled. 
  Eyadema, who took power in 1967 as army chief of staff after 
leading a coup in 1963, accordingly began consultations with all 
party leaders on Tuesday with his supporters in an upbeat mood. 
They remembered their forecast when the two main opposition 
parties set up a joint front last month that it was only a 
"facade of a coalition and will break up at thefirst 
opportunity." 
  The opposition split has given him more freedom of manoeuvre 
and he may well push for a government of national union. He has 
argued for such a system as a cure for the tiny West African 
state's economic ills and tribal strife since his re-election as 
president last August. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Angola's northernmost and oil-rich Cabinda Province 
is experiencing an explosive political and military situation. 
Reports from that area say that the residents of Subantando, 
north of Choa, put up barricades in the streets in protest 
against the behavior of the Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, armed forces, which are accused 
of attacking innocent civilians and burning homes in retaliation 
for a recent attack by the Front for the Liberation of the 
Cabinda Enclave, FLEC. In recent years, the MPLA-PT army's 
behavior has only increased separatist feelings in Cabinda. 
Recent problems turned out to be the straw that broke the 
camel's back.

  [Excerpt] The National Assembly today continued debating 
the 1994 State General Budget. Prime Minister Marcolino Moco 
today took his team to parliament to argue for the government's 
State General Budget. Despite the war, the economy and society 
will have a budget totalling 85,334,556,405 new kwanzas. The 
new finance minister, [Arnaldo Craveiro], outlined the 1994 
budget. 
  [Begin Craveiro recording] Although the proposed budget is 
restricted by the country's real possibilities, and its drafting 
followed strict austerity measures, it does not mean that one 
cannot expect the budget to contribute to the fulfillment of our 
economic goals. In addition to upholding national defense and 
correcting the deficit, the budget also deals with social 
imbalances through a new price policy, the guarantee of basic 
commodities, and the creation of a reserve of basic food 
commodities to cope with inflation. [end recording] [passage

  [Text] Blantyre, March 12 (AFP) -- The main opposition 
United Democratic Front said Saturday [12 March] it was pulling 
out of the all-party council managing Malawi's transition to 
democracy in protest over moves to bar its leader from running 
in May 17 general elections. 
  The party's vice-president, Aleke Banda, said at a press 
briefing that his party was quitting the National Consultative 
Council after failing to block a new constitutional provision 
barring politicians with criminal records from standing in the 
presidential and parliamentary elections in May. 
  The provision appeared aimed primarily at the front's 
president, Bakili Muluzi, who has been tipped to win the 
presidential election but who served a six month prison term 20 
years ago. 
  "This is wrong, there is no reason why such a rule should be 
build around an individual" Banda said. 
  The council, grouping Malawi's eight political parties, was 
formed to manage the country's transition to political pluralism 
after decades of rule by President Kamuzu Banda.

statement by General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the Mozambique National 
Resistance, Renamo, that he was not keen to lead hungry, 
shoeless, and wageless men, Deputy Planning Minister Tomas 
Salomao said at a news conference yesterday that our country's 
military expenses could this year take up 45 percent of the 
General State Budget. He added that each soldier of the future 
of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM, has been allocated 
a daily sum of 7,200 meticals for his meals. 
  Deputy Planning Minister Tomas Salomo neither confirmed nor 
denied Gen. Ngonhamo's disclosure that two commanders, two 
instructors, and [words indistinct] functionaries had been 
turned out of a hotel in Beira because they had not paid their 
bills. Minister Salomao simply said that there had been no 
reason for that to happen because funds will always be made 
available to cover such expenses. [passage omitted]

Resistance [Renamo] political delegate for that province, that 
the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party and the 
provincial government were giving military training to 800 men 
in Tanzania. 
  Governor Antonio Simbine said that those accusations were 
both false and without foundation. In an interview he granted 
the Radio Mozambique correspondent in that province, Governor 
Simbine noted that [words indistinct] accusations by Renamo 
officers reflect the thought that is uppermost on their minds: 
to return to war, should Renamo lose the upcoming multiparty 
general elections. 
  The governor for Cabo Delgado Province invited the Renamo 
political delegate to report the matter to the UN Operations in 
Mozambique so that the truth can be established. [passage 
omitted] 
  Governor Simbine dismissed as groundless reports that war 
materiel was being stored in the (?lower part) of Pemba, the 
capital of Cabo Delgado Province and he added that there should 
be an inquiry into the matter. The governor for Cabo Delgado 
categorically denied any provincial government involvement in an 
alleged attempt on the life of the Renamo political delegate. 
He said that Renamo should report all it knows to the competent 
authorities, so that investigation can begin. He noted that, 
quote, the government has no need to become involved in the 
assassination of a simple citizen who happens to be an 
opposition politician, unquote.

President Joaquim Chissano noted, quote, let us all turn out at

  Mozambicans living in Zimbabwe delivered a message to the 
Mozambican head of state expressing the hope that peace has come 
to Mozambique to stay and that war may never return. President 
Joaquim Chissano also met with Robert Mugabe, his Zimbabwean 
counterpart, yesterday. The two men discussed the Mozambican 
peace and democratization processes as well as issues pertaining 
to the current level of bilateral cooperation.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Preparations for next year's general election in 
Zimbabwe are now in full swing. President Mugabe could hold it 
any time between March and May, and the opposition parties, who 
only hold a handful of seats in parliament, are hoping to make a 
better show against the ruling party, ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African 
National Union-Patriotic Front]. Today, Zimbabwe's home affairs 
minister gave a press conference and announced that the voters' 
register is going to be completely overhauled before the 
election. Rachel Rawlins was there and she sent us this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Rawlins] Starting next Monday [21 March] 
thousands of civil servants will be distributed to registration 
points throughout the country in an effort to register every 
eligible voter in Zimbabwe. That means not just new voters but 
also those who have registered in the past will have to fill in 
new forms to appear on the computerized roll. Young people who 
reach the voting age of 18 by May next year will also qualify 
for inclusion, but that doesn't mean the election will 
definitely be held in May. 
  Announcing the measure this afternoon, Minister of Home 
Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said it wasn't possible to extend the 
registration process outside Zimbabwe apart from South Africa, 
where, because of the large number of resident Zimbabweans -- 
about 300,000, according to government -- arrangements have been 
made for registration at Zimbabwe's Trade Mission in South 
Africa. Minister Dabengwa said opposition complaints that the 
election was being run by members of the ruling ZANU Party were 
unfounded. 
  [Dabengwa] We cannot allow parties to be involved in the 
conduct of elections. We will have chaos and we will have 
accusations and counteraccusations. This is why we leave it to 
the civil servants to be responsible for the conduct of the 
elections. 
  [Rawlins] But despite this assurance, opposition politicians 
complain of bias in government-appointed commission members, and 
are worried about President Mugabe's sweeping personal powers 
during elections. There are some fears of a repeat of the 
violence of the 1990 elections, particularly the incident where 
a ZANU Party member and a member of the Central Intelligence 
Organization were found guilty of shooting and wounding 
opposition political candidate Patrick Kombai. They were given 
presidential pardons before starting their sentences. Mr. 
Dabengwa gave the assurance that everything will be done to 
avoid violence this time around. [end recording]

  [Text] Harare March 15 SAPA -- The countdown to Zimbabwe's 
next parliamentary elections, due from April next year, begins 
on Monday next week with the start of the registration of 
voters, it was announced in Harare on Tuesday. 
  Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said 7,600 static 
centres manned by 7,900 civil servants, and an undisclosed 
number of mobile booths for remoter regions, would register 
voters. 
  He hoped the process would be completed in two weeks, 
although authorities had an extra 45 days to cope with 
unexpected problems. 
  The date for the elections, the fourth since independence in 
1980, would be announced by President Robert Mugabe, he said. 
"We are gambling he will go for between March and May next 
year," he said. 
  One-hundred-and-twenty seats will be contested in the 
election in the 150-seat parliament. Mr Mugabe has the right to 
appoint another 30. Elections for the post of president are 
every six years, and are due in 1996. 
  The announcement will heighten growing political activity 
among the ruling ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF 
[Patriotic Front]) party and about 10 opposition parties already 
preparing their campaigns. It also suggests it is unlikely Mr 
Mugabe will call an early election to beat deepening 
disenchantment with the government, as has been forecast by some 
political commentators. 
  All the previous elections have been won overwhelmingly by 
ZANU (PF) and pundits predict another outright victory for the 
party. 
  Mr Dabengwa made a point of promising that the election 
campaign and the voting would be free, fair and peaceful. "I 
assure you there will be no violence during the elections," he 
said. "Police will be deployed at full strength throughout the 
country." 
  The election will be the first since 1964 to be held under 
ordinary legislation. Until late 1990 they were held under 
state of emergency legislation which gave authorities 
wide-ranging powers to curb opposition activities. 
  Special provision is being made to register an estimated 
300,000 Zimbabweans living in South Africa, and extra staff will 
be deployed at the Zimbabwe Trade M$ssion in Johannesburg. 
Zimbabweans resident in other countries would not be able to 
register because of the government's "limited resources". 
  In apparent recognition of criticism of hasty and often 
chaotic voter registration for the previous election in 1990, 
authorities this time have started six months earlier. 
  Registrar-General Mr Tobaiwa Mudede said the electorate 
consisted of about 5.5 million people.

  [Text] Mmabatho Mar 16 SAPA -- Deposed Bophuthatswana 
president Lucas Mangope was in effect placed under house arrest 
on Wednesday [16 March] morning. The homeland's interim 
administration had "requested Mr Mangope to stay at his 
residence in Motswedi for his own safety", Lynette Lavender, 
first secretary of the South African Embassy told SAPA. 
  Meanwhile, about 7,000 striking civil servants attended a 
meeting at the Mmabatho Civic Centre, where a workers' committee 
members urged them to return to work "in hours and not days". 
  He said the work stoppage had achieved a number of its goals 
such as the reincorporation of Bophuthatswana into South Africa 
and free political activity now being allowed in the former 
homeland. 
  Donwntown Mafikeng was chock-a-block with cars, buses and 
taxis clogging all the main streets and throngs of people were 
seen on the pavements. "Town is the busiest I've ever seen it," 
a businessman said. Although many of the shops were still bare 
as a result of looting last week, banks were doing a brisk trade 
and those with goods to sell were packed with people.

  [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] is 
determined to tell Bophuthatswana citizens about the elections 
as soon as possible. At a media conference at Lanseria airport 
today the IEC announced that another aircraft will be dropping 
voter information pamphlets over several areas of 
Bophuthatswana. Two airplanes and four trips will ensure that a 
quarter of a million leaflets are dropped to Bophuthatswana 
citizens. After this trip to Mafikeng, two more flights today 
and tomorrow will go to Garankuwa and Taung. The IEC has 
already moved into Bophuthatswana. 
  [Begin IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje recording] We are setting 
up offices in Bophuthatswana and distributing information on the 
election to the voters of Bophuthatswana, offering them our 
assistance to ensure that they have full participation in free 
and fair elections. [end recording] 
  Ten IEC vehicles equipped with loud speakers will soon be 
travelling through the streets of Bophuthatswana. They'll be 
used to tell citizens what rights they have and how their safety 
will be guaranteed. 
  [Begin Cronje recording] We'll be using all the means at our 
disposal, including advertising campaigns, pamphlet campaigns, 
the leaflet drops, and voter education programs on radio, 
television, and in print. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Afrikaner Resistance Movement leader Eugene </F>
Terreblanche, by SABC correspondent Max du Preez, BEELD 
correspondent Tim du Plessis, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
correspondent John Battersby, and DIE AFRIKANER correspondent 
Jakkie Basson; followed by telephone discussion with former 
Bophuthatswana chief negotiator Rowan Cronje; on the "Agenda" 
program -- live] 
  [Text] [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche, may I begin? 
  [Terreblanche] Certainly. 
  [Du Preez] At seven this evening, I spoke to Mr. Rowan 
Cronje 
about your press conference. Mr. Cronje told me to tell you 
this: If Eugene Terreblanche says I or anyone else in the 
government invited him to Bophuthatswana, you must tell him he 
is lying. 
  [Terreblanche] It is not odd that a man who succeeded in 
giving away two fatherlands in his political career would use 
such crude language. 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] He said he has many witnesses -- 
among others, Brigadier Turner. 
  [Terreblanche] Let me speak -- you have posed a question: 
Mr. 
Cronje never asked me to be present. Two years ago, I signed 
several agreements with various people, among others, a military 
accord with the Ciskei -- with Brigadier Gqozo. You will 
remember that about a year or so ago he said that should he be 
threatened, he would make use of AWB [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement] assistance. I have signed agreements with Inkatha in 
the Transvaal -- it has been proved demonstratively by joint 
action in the Vaal triangle. Those agreements still stand. I 
also concluded an agreement in which Mr. Cronje was present 
personally -- in a full cabinet meeting -- with President 
Mangope about a year or two ago. 
  [Du Preez] Can I quickly give you his version of that? He 
said you got up and said: You people in Bophuthatswana are 
against communists. We are also against communists. If you 
should need help, ask us. Mr. Cronje said President Mangope did 
not reply to that. 
  [Terreblanche] Wait a second, please. The whole 
discussion--and this can be confirmed by anyone who was with 
us--the whole discussion actually dealt with the fact that we 
have moved closer to each other; we jointly had the feeling that 
the communists were going to damage the sovereignty of both 
countries. We were received on those conditions. That was the 
subject that was discussed, and that is how we accepted it. I 
just want to add -- so that we do not waste time -- I sent a fax 
to the president early during the week when the situation there 
was starting to deteriorate. There has been telephone contact 
with my office and even from his residence, in which messages 
were sent to the president. And on Friday, when the situation 
grew worse, I personally spoke to him. In my office, I use a 
loudspeaker so that when such matters are discussed and there 
are members of my senior staff present, they can follow the 
conversation. I phoned the president and asked what the 
situation was like. He said it was critical. His words were 
that the situation was very bad. I said to him that at that 
stage I had about 160 men, since we did not have time to 
mobilize more. He thanked me and added that I should try to get 
hold of Mr. Cronje. I hope Mr. Cronje does not deny this as 
well. The phone number supplied to me, Mr. Cronje's number, had 
come from President Lucas Mangope. An hour or so later about 
300 men arrived. I had another discussion with the president. 
I asked him how long he could still hold out, upon which he 
replied that he did not know -- the situation was very critical. 
Then I pertinently asked this question because it seemed as 
though from the side of the National Front it had been said that 
the AWB was not welcome. Then I said: President, did you or 
anyone else say the AWB should not move in, or do you know of 
anyone who said that? He answered no. I still tried to make 
contact with Cronje, and I could not, until I arrived at the 
base in Mmabatho and I spoke to him. Now I hope Mr. Cronje told 
you what was decided between him and me. 
  [Du Preez] I can tell you what he said. It is right here.... 
  [Terreblanche, interrupting] I will appreciate that. 
  [Du Preez] At 1905, he asked me to talk to Eugene 
Terreblanche. I told him that the image of the AWB in 
Bophuthatswana is extremely negative and racist. The 
sensitivity in the Bophuthatswana security forces, regarding the 
AWB, is unbelievable. I asked him courteously and politely to 
leave. Mr. Terreblanche then told me: This night I will never 
forget. It has been a terrible humiliation. I want to fight 
the communists but you do not want me to. 
  [Terreblanche] Is that all he said we spoke about? 
  [Du Preez] Yes. 
  [Terreblanche] Now I understand why Bophuthatswana is where 
it is today. 
  [Du Preez] And Brig. Turner supports that. He says it is 
true. 
  [Terreblanche] Well, let me answer that. I now want to refer 
to a later discussion. I spoke to General Turner -- not 
Brigadier -- on more than one occasion. It was decided between 
him and the general that the AWB....[pauses] Apparently Mr. 
Cronje was under the impression that the AWB was present in 
uniform, with flags and so forth. I was engaged in a discussion 
with him when he asked me if we have symbols denoting rank, 
flags, and uniforms. I told him that the order was for the men 
to move in in civilian clothes. He asked Turner what his 
impression was -- and General Turner is regarded as a very 
honorable man. He said that he has no problem since the men are 
in civilian clothes. He added that it is a civilian force 
present and the AWB is prepared to plan jointly the transfer of 
power to the planners. Now I want to say that it is very 
strange that a venue was prepared for the AWB, because at a 
stage when the AWB numbers rose to between 400 and 500, there 
were 60 members of our other Volksfront [National Front] friends 
-- a venue was prepared and food packages were handed out; 
mattresses were handed out. The intention was to keep us there, 
not to see us go away. At 0500, and one has to be honest, at 
0500 I had another discussion on the insistence of Gen. Turner, 
and he told me the politicians feel that I, Terreblance, should 
leave the territory because the black population were becoming 
agitated at my presence there. Lengthy discussions were held. 
Fortunately, I was not alone and two senior generals on my 
staff were present. The general was very disappointed. I said 
that I would leave with my men upon which one of my generals 
said that if I withdraw then the entire AWB would withdraw. The 
general was very apologetic and said the decision is not his, 
but comes from Mr. Rowan Cronje. This came hours after an 
agreement for us to stay and for us to be part of the armed 
civilian force there. I kept my word and I went to my men and 
withdrew in my personal capacity. If you look at the realities 
-- that I did withdraw and that my men did stay -- then it 
clearly indicates the agreements made. I withdrew personally. 
My generals stayed behind. They would form part of the 
offensive. Weapons would be handed out after which 
Bophuthatswana would be stabilized, and this is the situation 
until that point. 
  [Du Preez] Let's have some questions now. 
  [Du Plessis] Mr. Terreblanche, despite the argument over who 
invited whom, it is clear to me that neither the political 
leaders of Bophuthatswana nor their military leaders wanted you 
or your forces there. But there is also a second reason why you 
should not have been there: Any good general, before committing 
himself to a battle, would gather as much intelligence as 
possible before the time. Your own people are quoted in the 
newspapers. THE CITIZEN, says: The AWB commanders advised him 
on the radio to withdraw immediately from the base, because the 
AWB men would not stand a chance against the armored vehicles of 
the BDF [Bophuthatswana Defense Force]. You ought to have known 
that your men stood no chance against them. You yourself said 
that, in Africa, a white man without a rifle is a dead man. But 
five people died, and they had rifles. It seems to me that in 
Africa a white man without sense and without good judgment is a 
dead man. 
  [Terreblanche] Look, it's no use trying to be sarcastic. I 
hope you will have the good manners suitable to the occasion. 
You have insulted the AWB, saying they have no sense. You are 
not aware of the facts. The facts are that those men were to be 
issued with weapons. 
  [Du Plessis] But they were not. 
  [Terreblanche] The facts are -- look, let me finish, please. 
If you want to engage me in a debate, and try to control me, I 
will refuse to respond. I have no need to speak with you. The 
facts are that an undertaking had been given that weapons would 
be issued, even to the AVF men. But only 280 weapons had been 
made available at that point. Now you say no preplanning had 
been done. We had done very good preplanning. That is why the 
AWB was able to move around, occupy the whole white area, secure 
it, and defend it, after which the defense force decided that we 
should all gather at the air force base, where joint planning 
would be done. That was done, because I was in a foreign 
country and I accepted the right of the general to decide and 
evaluate the situation, and to assemble the men. I took my men 
to the air force base, where we all assembled and passed the 
night together, as guests of the Bophuthatswana Defense Force 
and officers. The following morning, as a result of the 
interference of the politicians -- who, as Mr. Mangope correctly 
pointed out, had an entirely different agenda and did not want 
to stabilize Bophuthatswana, but wanted to destabilize it so 
that President Mangope's government could be overthrown, so that 
he could be compelled to take part in the election, or so that 
he could be replaced by another government which would take part 
in the election. The AWB once again gave heed to the wishes of 
the military authorities in Bophuthatswana.... 
  [Du Plessis, interrupting] But you also shot a few of them 
dead. 
  [Terreblanche] ...that we should withdraw. At that stage not 
a shot had been fired. The AWB was informed that they we should 
withdraw, and what did we do? We withdrew from the operational 
area on the instructions of the Bophuthatswana police and 
Colonel Breytenbach, who almost certainly was speaking on behalf 
of the BDF. We withdrew in vulnerable vehicles, open pick-up 
trucks, headed for the border, without our weapons.... 
  [Du Plessis, interrupting] But firing as you went.... 
  [Terreblanche, interrupting] Wait, wait.... 
  [Du Plessis, interrupting] Were you not.... 
  [Terreblanche, interrupting] You were not there. Let me tell 
you.... 
  [Du Plessis, interrupting] But is it not true that your men 
were firing as they went? 
  [Terreblanche] Of course it is not true. The AWB withdrew. 
But I would like to ask you now, in all fairness, if we are to 
conduct a sensible discussion, please do not interrupt me again. 
Really, don't. The AWB reached a certain point, and that was a 
bridge. The first vehicle had already crossed over, and the 
second vehicle, the command vehicle in which my generals were 
traveling -- an ordinary pickup, people armed with handguns, 
hunting rifles, and other weapons, not operational weapons. 
Right at the bridge the very same defense force which was 
supposed to defend us suddenly started firing on our moving 
vehicles with 40-mm mortars. And that is it. The AWB took 
cover and fired back. The fight started, and they took their 
injured took them out, including Colonel Bouwer and the other 
six injured men who are now in the hospital. These injured 
people were put in the open pick-ups and, firing as they went, 
and as you said, reached the border. The casualty figure, as 
you said, reached 50 dead on the side of the Bophuthatswana 
people, including 10 civilians -- which I sincerely regret. I 
believe they were caught in the crossfire. No one will accept 
responsibility, as to whose bullets hit them. But more than 280 
people, according to the SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation], were injured. Our movement was placed in a 
position where we had to defend ourselves.... 
  [Battersby, interrupting] But where was your victory, then, 
your shining victory? 
  [Terreblanche] Wait a moment, wait.... 
  [Battersby, interrupting] I want to ask you about the 
shining 
victory that you referred to today at the press conference in 
Ventersdorp. In fact, it is the direct opposite of what the 
overwhelming majority of South Africans and foreigners believe. 
I want you to tell us how it is possible that you can speak of 
an overwhelming victory, and a miracle, when in the first place 
your men were thrown out by the AVF's people. Second, your 
people, your soldiers were shot at by the security forces of a 
government which, in your own words, had invited you into the 
country. Third, it was clear that you stood no chance against 
the united forces of the SADF [South African Defense Force]. 
How can that be a victory? I cannot understand it. 
  [Terreblanche] I want you to understand it very clearly, so 
that you will not remain in the dark for so long. It is a 
shining victory when people are sent into an operational area 
with handguns. They were fired upon from Casspirs [armored 
vehicle] and other armored vehicles. They were fired upon in 
open pick-ups and even ordinary sedans. They stopped the 
assault of the mortars and the Casspirs by firing back 
effectively. They moved up to the border, and the outcome of 
the attack was just that -- the total number of casualties on 
the side of the AWB, five were killed, while on the other side 
50 were killed and 285 were....[pauses] Now I want to say to 
you, the reason why..,. 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] Were they the enemy? 
  [Terreblanche] But of course. What do you call the people 
who are firing on you with mortars? 
  [Du Preez] But they were the legitimate defense force, and 
you see them as the enemy? 
  [Terreblanche] Look, everyone knows that the defense force 
and the police had turned against the Bophuthatswana government; 
they mutinied. That is why President Mangope is where he is 
today. And your enemy becomes your enemy within a second. That 
is what we found out there. Those who were supposed to be our 
friends, the communist-inspired elements within the defense 
force -- let me say straight out, that was the dilemma: Many of 
the BDF members welcomed the AWB in the most friendly manner; 
the betrayal which was committed was so shocking precisely 
because it came from the same force which had received us in 
such a friendly manner. The deserters in Mr. Mangope's defense 
force and the police deserters....[pauses] General Turner told 
us that night that 90 percent of his policemen had deserted. 
The next morning the whole Bophuthatswana police force 
deserted. So the AWB drew the fire of the police and defense 
force deserters, who were using artillery and armored vehicles 
against its small-arms fire. And you say you find it difficult 
to see it as a victory? Had the AWB not been able to stop the 
armored vehicles in their retreat, it would have meant hundreds 
of dead in the AWB. But that did not happen. 
  [Battersby] I understand that, but I want to ask again: How 
can it be a shining victory when you yourself withdrew from the 
scene, knowing full well -- as you said today -- that Gen. 
Viljoen had betrayed you several times. How could you... 
  [Terreblanche, interrupting] It remains a victory for us, 
because we pulled out, as we had been asked to do by the BDF. 
We followed the instruction of the head of state whom we 
recognized as the head of state. We did not know that at that 
stage he was no longer head of state. If the head of state and 
his forces say we must withdraw, and we do it, and we withdraw 
honorably, and we are attacked during our withdrawal, and we 
fight our way out, and we fight to gain safety, and we fight and 
we win -- can you still say you can't understand how that can be 
a victory? I am a veteran. I served a long time in Rhodesia. 
For years I served on the South- West African border. I know 
battle under those circumstances. The most difficult battle is 
when you are withdrawing, when you are in fact firing over your 
shoulder. And if you are drawn into an ambush four or five 
times, and you emerge from the presence of death and you bring 
your people home, and your casualty figure is so small that in 
our group only three men fell, with two more later when Gen. 
Viljoen sent out some men; in all that great convoy only three 
men fell, and you tell me that is not a success. 
  [Battersby] But I want to ask you once again, how can that 
be 
a victory when you left your own injured people behind? 
  [Du Plessis, interrupting] And the president you had gone to 
defend was no longer president. 
  [Battersby] How can that be a victory, Mr. Terreblanche? 
  [Terreblanche] Look, those are two questions. There are two 
of you asking questions, so please listen patiently to my reply, 
the two replies. 
  [Du Preez] Could you keep it short? Our time is limited. 
  [Terreblanche] Look. I want to answer you the way you ought 
to be answered. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Rowan Cronje is on the telephone. He would 
like to respond to some of the things you have said. 
  [Terreblanche] He's welcome. I first wish to say I see it as 
a shining victory for people who had to withdraw under fire, and 
only left three bodies behind, while the attackers who had laid 
the ambushes suffered a loss of more than 50 dead and more than 
280 injured. And bear in mind that we picked up our injured, 
except for the three whom we had not seen in the convoy -- 
indeed, we had to search for their bodies where they had fallen. 
I can assure you, had they been left behind by the AWB, I would 
have instituted an investigation. 
  [Du Preez] I think you will have to. Here we have a report 
by a senior AVF man. Tim, do you have it? 
  [Du Plessis] Yes, an AVF man said: I could hear clearly over 
the radio how he was ordering his men not to turn back for the 
injured; they would not stand a chance against the BDF soldiers. 
  [Terreblanche] Let me first ask you, who is the person who 
said that? 
  [Du Plessis] It was a senior member of the AVF who was 
involved in the... 
  [Terreblanche, interrupting] I asked what his name was. My 
name if Eugene Terreblanche; you are Tim. Who is the person who 
made this so-called allegation? Why is he not here on AGENDA 
tonight? I do not react to ghosts. 
  [Basson] I would also like to enter this discussion Max. 
  [Du Preez] Please. Yes. I have been neglecting you a little. 
  [Basson] I would like us to look at the other side of this 
issue, and I would like to hear Mr. Terreblanche's comment on 
the role played by the SADF in the whole matter. We are faced 
with an absolute textbook-type communist takeover where chaos 
and anarchy is first being created.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] Is that a statement or is that a 
question to Mr. Terreblanche? 
  [Basson] It is a question to Mr. Terreblanche. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche? 
  [Terreblanche] I would really like to answer the question 
but 
let him tell me what he wants from me. Give him the opportunity. 
  [Du Preez] We just have a few minutes left, please. I would 
rather like to hear from you now that the question has been 
posed. 
  [Basson] In other words, we would like to know what role.... 
[pauses] Now that the revolution has been completed -- after 
the AWB and the Volksfront have withdrawn, the South African 
Defense Force came into the picture for the first time, and if 
one looks at a document distributed by Joe Slovo, in which he 
also predicts what the situation will be like in South Africa, 
he said: [quotation in English] These actions on the part of 
elements within the regime, extend for example to the continuing 
disruptive actions aimed by the regime's National Intelligence 
Service, against the Conservative Party and Inkatha, as well as 
elements within the South African military establishment.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] Jakkie, excuse me. We really do not 
have time. 
  [Terreblanche] I will answer as quickly as possible. 
  [Du Preez] Thank you. 
  [Terreblanche] It seems clear to me that the 
order....[pauses] After an agreement had been reached for us to 
become part of the joint civilian force there, then I was asked 
at 0430 by Rowan Cronje, via Gen. Turner, to leave the 
territory, because if I did not leave the territory, according 
to him, the SADF would act. I left the territory because I 
expected this and I did not want to take responsibility for 
this. I left the territory as requested. The AWB left the 
territory. You are completely correct in saying this. The 
Volksfront left the area and still the SADF took action. The 
defense force, trying to find a reason to overthrow President 
Mangope, attempted blame us. The defense force went into the 
territory not to stabilize -- it was there, and it knows. If 
anyone was not invited, it is the SADF. President Mangope said 
repeatedly he did not want them there. Gen. Turner told me the 
president told him he did not want them there because if the ANC 
[African National Congress]-National Party defense force enters 
the territory, then he would never be able to get them out of 
his country. That Is the reality and it has been proven correct. 
  [Du Plessis] But I do not see the victory, Mr. Terreblanche. 
  [Terreblanche] But then you would never see the victory. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche, can we cross over to Mr. Rowan 
Cronje. He will speak to us by telephone. Good evening Mr. 
Cronje. 
  [Cronje] Good evening. 
  [Du Preez] You have heard Mr. Terreblanche's version. What 
is your reaction to that? 
  [Cronje] No, I did not hear what he said because my 
television set is not working. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche.... 
  [Cronje, interrupting] But if it concerns the issue as to 
whether they were allowed into the country, then I want to say 
the following: The president contacted me late afternoon and 
said Mr. Terreblanche telephoned him twice. He gave me a 
number, and I returned Mr. Terreblanche's call but there was no 
reply. Early the morning Gen. Turner telephoned me and said he 
understood that the AWB was on the way. We sent Colonel Manna 
Bothes to the border at Rooigrond to stop them from entering the 
country. Gen. Turner informed me by telephone that Mr. 
Terreblanche was not prepared to listen to the colonel and he 
proceeded to enter the country. He held talks with Gen. Turner. 
Gen. Turner informed me about his discussion with Mr. 
Terreblanche, and then I spoke to Mr. Terreblanche. I told him 
that no arrangements were made with us and that no permission 
was requested for the AWB to enter the country. I made it clear 
to him that the perception and the image of the AWB in 
Bophuthatswana is one of racism, that this is a delicate and 
sensitive situation totally unacceptable to the Bophuthatswana 
Defense Force and that it will cause enormous problems. Mr. 
Terreblanche reacted by saying that he will never forget this 
night. He said he had come to fight communists and he was being 
made to feel so unwelcome. He added that he had never been so 
unwelcome in his life in any place. I spoke again to Gen. 
Turner and we arranged, concerning these people who have already 
entered the country -- you will remember that they entered with 
pickup trucks on several roads -- that they should be given 
immediate orders to remove their flags and so forth, and that 
they should be taken to the airport where they could be 
assembled and then be taken out of the country. Thereafter, we 
contacted General Viljoen. General Viljoen, in reaction to that 
telephone call to him, gave a direct order for the AWB to be 
withdrawn immediately. They also ignored that order. That's 
the third one. Several journalists who were with me yesterday 
confirmed that the defense force spent most of the morning 
trying to assemble men on pick-up trucks who were causing 
large-scale damage, resulting in a flare-up of emotions and 
problems, to escort them to the airport so that they can leave 
the country under supervision. This is precisely what I 
arranged with Mr. Terreblanche and with Mr. Turner and this was 
done in the presence of several people. This was confirmed by 
Gen. Viljoen and several others, as well as Gen. Turner. The 
situation is very clear. The developments were tragic. The 
loss of life is inexcusable, and the damage to Bophuthatswana, 
the hatred which never before existed against whites, currently 
being experienced in Mmabatho, is life threatening. It is a 
pity that this has happened. I trust that it will not happen 
again. 
  [Du Preez] Thank you very much, Mr. Cronje. Hold the line 
while we hear Mr. Terreblanche's response. 
  [Terreblanche] I would like to react immediately. You speak 
about a single conversation we had, Mr. Cronje? And you also 
reached an agreement with me just once? Is that the case? 
  [Cronje] I never reached any agreement with you. 
  [Terreblanche] So you never said that if the men do not have 
any insignia, and if they form part of the forces there, and if 
they were not in uniform, then they could remain there, and I 
should personally maintain a low profile? Did you never say 
that? 
  [Cronje] We said the men there with insignia should remove 
them immediately, and they must go to the airport outside the 
city and remain there. They failed to do so. They went into 
the streets. They caused tremendous problems, and we asked you 
to please go. 
  [Terreblanche] No, Mr. Cronje, please answer my question. 
You are not negotiating with the communists now. Please answer 
my question. 
  [Cronje] I am answering your question. 
  [Terreblanche] That morning at 0500, in a second discussion 
with Gen. Turner, he told me you were demanding my head; I must 
leave the area, and the AWB troops must remain. I want to tell 
you something, as you were not present. You gave the 
instruction by telephone. Senior members of my general staff 
witnessed the discussion at 0530 that morning. It was decided 
that I should leave the area, because you said if I remained, 
then the SADF would invade. Now you say all AWB members were 
ordered out. I say it is a pity that at the end of your 
political career you step out of South African politics with a 
cold-blooded lie. It is a shame. I say my general staff can 
confirm the fact. 
  [Cronje] Mr. Terreblanche, the situation was clear. The men 
had been requested to go to the airport immediately. They were 
to remain there; they were not to enter the town. They were to 
leave the country under escort. Those who ignored the request 
and the order of Gen. Viljoen were collected by the BDF. The 
BDF and your forces fired on each other. You had never been 
given permission to enter Bophuthatswana. You had made no 
arrangement. There was no agreement. Indeed, Gen. Turner told 
me that after the discussion you referred to -- and I am not 
aware of the discussion -- you and two of your generals stood up 
and said you were being chased away. And then you stood up and 
walked out with your two generals. I was not present at the 
discussion. I know what I told you, and I know what I told Gen. 
Turner... 
  [Terreblanche, interrupting] Yes. It is clear that you were 
not there. 
  [Cronje] ...and don't talk to me ab0ut a cold-blooded lie. 
  [Terreblanche] I say to you that you are a cold-blooded 
liar. 
Let me tell you, there are many hundreds, a thousand or more 
people, who know of your request that I personally leave the 
area or the SADF would join the fray. 
  [Cronje] Sir, I never spoke to you.... 
  [Terreblanche, interrupting] Give me one reason why I, as a 
person, had to leave the area. It was at your request, and now 
you deny it. Now I understand how you were able to give away 
two countries within a single life. 
  [Cronje] I never spoke to you about the SADF. Not once. The 
instruction was clear: You must go, and your men must go to the 
airport, and from there they must leave the country. At 1100 
our people, in the presence of many journalists, saw how our 
defense force attempted to collect those people who were still 
in the streets -- where they were not supposed to be; they were 
to be at the airport -- to see that they left the country. The 
orders were clear. My discussion with you was clear. Why did 
you tell me you would never forget that night, you had never 
feld so unwelcome? 
  [Terreblanche] It was precisely because it involved me 
personally. 
  [Cronje] It involved the AWB, Mr. Terreblanche, not you 
personally. I never spoke to you personally. It involved the 
AWB.... 
  [Terreblanche, interrupting] Could I refer to another lie? 
  [Cronje] ...that is why all those men went to the airport. 
  [Terreblanche] Mr. Cronje, I was never personally asked to 
leave. 
  [Cronje] I asked you to leave, and for your men to go to the 
airport. 
  [Terreblanche] Mr. Cronje, I don't know how you get it 
right, 
knowing full well that this issue was discussed not only with my 
general staff, but also with the full contingent of the AWB. A 
choice had to be made -- either I left and all left with me, or 
I left, and they remained. And I decided that if they wished to 
remain, they could do so, but not in uniform. Now you claim 
before millions of people that you never said that. It is a 
good thing that you have resigned.... 
  [Cronje, interrupting] During my discussion with you several 
people were present. 
  [Terreblanche] Yes, mine were also present. 
  [Cronje] I spoke to you once, and thereafter I made 
arrangements with Gen. Turner. 
  [Terreblanche] Quite correct. And thereafer Gen. Turner told 
me I must.... 
  [Cronje, interrupting] The arrangement was clear: Your 
people 
were to go to the airport, you must leave, the rest must be 
gathered together, and they must be accompanied out of the 
country. 
  [Terreblanche] So you are placing the blame on your own 
general. You say he told me of his own accord that I must leave 
and the rest could remain. 
  [Cronje] No, my general agrees with me. I checked my facts 
with him. 
  [Terreblanche] Your general will never again trust you, not 
even at a Sunday school picnic. I wish I could see the 
general's face when you say he never told me that you said they 
want my head, that I must leave and the AWB can remain. It was 
discussed with at least 1,000 men who had to make a choice. 
  [Cronje] It is a distortion of the truth. You do not know 
what damage you have done, and the danger you posed to many 
lives. I have seen Gen. Turner's face, Sir. 
  [Terreblanche] It cannot be a happy face. It is just further 
proof that when politicians get involved in military matters, 
this kind of thing happens. You gave the instructions, Sir. 
  [Cronje] If the military intervenes in a country, in a 
neighboring country, without being invited, and causes the 
problems you caused, then I say, long live the politicians. 
Good night, Mr. Terreblanche. 
  [Terreblanche] Yes, those politians who retire the moment 
their country needs them, like you. 
  [Du Preez] Our time has run out, unfortunately. Thank you, 
Mr. Cronje, Mr. Terreblanche, gentlemen. I hope we will one day 
get to know the truth about this tragic episode in our history. 
Good night.

<F P=106> [Report by Christopher Munnion report: "Inkatha Told Poll </F>
Boycott is Danger to South Africa"] 
  [Text] Johannesburg--President de Klerk warned Chief 
Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom Party yesterday that their 
refusal to participate in South Africa's democratic elections 
could lead to the same "tragic events" that befell 
Bophuthatswana. 
  In a series of speeches, Mr de Klerk said he had spoken on 
the telephone to Chief Buthelezi, the KwaZulu leader, reminding 
him that the people of his semi-autonomous state had the right 
to vote in the elections. 
  The Inkatha decision not to participate in the election 
created a dangerous situation for the whole country, he said. 
  An angry Mr Buthelezi, whose Inkatha party failed to 
register 
candidates by the weekend deadline, said Mr Lucas Mangope, the 
Bophuthatswana leader, had been deposed illegally, betrayed by 
Pretoria and the ANC [African National Congress]. 
  "What they did to Bophuthatswana they want to do to 
KwaZulu," 
he said. "All I can say is that KwaZulu is not Bophuthatswana." 
  The exchange between the two leaders served to switch the 
focus to KwaZulu as a possible flashpoint for further 
pre-election violence. Mr Buthelezi's mood cannot have been 
helped by rumours that senior members of Inkatha were 
considering defection to Mr de Klerk's National Party. 
  Dr Ben Ngubane, an Inkatha executive member, fuelled the 
rumours when he said that Inkatha could still participate in 
next month's elections. "Last Friday's deadline is immaterial 
as to whether we decide to participate in the elections," he 
said in Durban. 
  Inkatha's internal problems were only a small part of the 
fractures in the Freedom Alliance, the improbable grouping of 
white Rightwing parties and conservative homeland leaders . 
  Gen Constand Viljoen, the former South African military 
commander, resigned from the Freedom Alliance after registering 
his Freedom Front party for the elections. 
  At a hastily-convened meeting of the Alliance in the 
northern 
Cape city of Kimberley yesterday, Mr Mangope arrived to declare 
that he still considered himself the legal leader of 
Bophuthatswana. He said he was considering legal action against 
Pretoria. If nothing else, his presence at the meeting ended 
speculation that he was under some form of house arrest. 
  Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the Conservative Party, said 
"a communist revolution" had taken place in Bophuthatswana. The 
events there had proved to all that Mr de Klerk could not be 
trusted, he said. 
  The extremists on the Right were conspicuous by their 
absence. The neo-Nazi AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], in 
particular, was licking its wounds after several hundred of its 
members were routed. Armed and uniformed AWB men had converged 
on Mmabatho, the Bophuthatswana capital, last week, ostensibly 
to support Mr Mangope's tottering administration. 
  They were internationally humiliated when three of their 
number were shot dead by Bophuthatswana police-two executed by a 
policeman as they pleaded for their lives. 
  Even so, Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the AWB leader, called a 
press conference in his home town and "Afrikaner heartland" of 
Ventersdorp in the western Transvaal yesterday. He declared his 
movement's intervention in the Bophuthatswana crisis "a shining 
victory". 
  Another white extremist group, the Boerekommando, under its 
fanatical "commandant", Mr Willem Ratte, occupied an historic 
but derelict fort at Wonderboom north of Pretoria at the 
weekend, declaring they would "hold out to the death". 
  They were still occupying the fort last night, despite being 
given assurances by the police and the Pretoria city council 
that they would be totally ignored as the area was remote, 
little used by the public and of "no significance whatsoever".

<F P=106> [By Clive Govender] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 15 SAPA--The African National Congress 
[ANC] on Tuesday demanded the immediate expulsion of the 
Internal Stability Division [ISD] and the kwaZulu Police [KZP] 
from Umlazi, south of Durban. The demand came during a march by 
thousands of ANC supporters to call for free political activity 
in the township. The marchers had handed over the memorandum at 
the Umlazi magistrate's court when they were fired upon by 
another group, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
radio reported. 
  Police used teargas and fired shots to separate the two 
groups as the ANC marchers made their way home. 
  The protest followed the weekend occupation of Umlazi's King 
Goodwill Zwelithini Stadium by hostel dwellers ahead of an ANC 
election rally there. ANC leaders, including Chairman Thabo 
Mbeki and Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa, were 
incensed when police failed to move the crowd from the stadium, 
forcing them to address their supporters on Umlazi's Mangosuthu 
highway. 
  On Tuesday, several thousand ANC supporters delivered a 
memorandum to Chief Magistrate Louis Radyn, calling for the ISD 
and KZP's immediate withdrawal from Umlazi. Mr Radyn said the 
memo would be forwarded to the government and the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC]. The memorandum called for the 
deployment of the National Peacekeeping Force or forces under 
TEC control in Umlazi, and for the Independent Electoral 
Commission to act against those who organised Sunday's 
occupation of the stadium. "The ISD had no legal right to 
prevent us from using the stadium...and attack us with teargas 
and live ammunition," it read. 
  KZP district commissioner Brig Alwyn Burger confirmed one 
woman was shot dead in the township early on Tuesday. Residents 
claimed the KZP shot her, but Brig Burger said there was no 
evidence to that effect and that the claim would be investigated. 
  At the magistrate's court a potentially ugly situation was 
averted when about 300 Inkatha Freedom Party supporters massed 
several hundred metres away. Police kept them at bay, and they 
dispersed soon afterwards. 
  The mood was jubilant and festive, with a sea of people 
dancing to the song "now is the time, the time is now" blaring 
from loudspeakers. Not long after the crowd arrived, the South 
African flag was pulled down by frenzied supporters, ripped and 
replaced by two fluttering ANC flags. Burning tyres and stone 
barricades erected to enforce a stayaway impeded progress 
through the sprawling township and thousands of workers failed 
to arrive at work in the city. 
  The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] meanwhile claimed a "double 
assassination attempt" had been made on Umlazi mayor and IFP 
women's Brigade regional secretary Maria Xulu early on Tuesday 
and that it was possibly linked to the ANC march. IFP spokesman 
Ed Tillett said a group fired on Ms Xulu's home in H section 
about 4.20AM, and her bodyguards returned fire. He said the 
attackers returned 10 minutes later and again fired a volley of 
shots at her home. They were again repelled.

  [Text] The first steps to destabilize kwaZulu have already 
taken place. The situation in Umlazi is extremely tense due to 
strikes in the area. Announcements on SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] news services that several members of 
the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] have joined other parties since 
they want to take part in the election, could very well be a 
ploy to sow confusion in IFP ranks.

<F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 15 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] will not submit an election candidate list by Wednesday 
[16 March] afternoon's extended deadline and will not contest 
the poll unless its constitutional demands are met. This was 
the message from IFP Central Committee member Walter Felgate, 
following renewed optimism that the party might contest the 
April poll. On Monday, senior IFP negotiator Ben Ngubane said 
the IFP had yet to decide on participation in the country's 
first all-race poll. "Far from being out of the elections, 
Inkatha has yet to decide on participation," Dr Ngubane 
reportedly said in Kimberley on Monday. 
  But Mr Felgate said Dr Ngubane's statement was no different 
to the IFP's official stance on elections: "There's no change in 
the IFP's position. I don't know why there is confusion. The 
position of the IFP is unless the December 19 (Freedom Alliance) 
amendments to the constitution are accepted, we will not enter 
elections. Talks on mediation are under way and if mediation 
results in changes to the constitution, then I believe it will 
be in the national interest to ensure timetables are adjusted." 
  He said talks between the IFP and African National Congress 
on mediation would continue on Wednesday. Mr Felgate added that 
the IFP would "most certainly not" submit a candidate list by 
Wednesday's 4.30PM deadline. 
  IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi also said in Kimberley on 
Monday that his party was serious about contesting elections, 
but not before its constitutional demands were met. "We are not 
prepared to commit ourselves to fighting the election until the 
ANC makes a sincere commitment to address our demands," he said. 
  On the printing of ballot papers without the IFP's name, 
Inkatha MP Farouk Cassim said on Tuesday: "There's no good 
reason why they couldn't keep this open. They can't exclude us 
knowing mediation is taking place. We don't see the time limits 
as more important than a solution. Any artificial time limits 
can have very negative results for the country. When we are so 
close, we should go that extra half a metre," he said. Mr 
Cassim said mediation on constitutional disputes was imminent 
and progress was being made on the Zulu king's demands, which 
the IFP has also said must be resolved. 
  Meanwhile, IFP national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said he 
believed the IFP was "out" of the April elections. "It does 
seem like we are not participating," he said on Tuesday. On 
speculation he might leave the IFP for another party contesting 
the poll, he replied: "Nothing could be further from the truth."

<F P=106> [First installment of a two-part interview with ANC </F>
Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa by CITY PRESS Editor Khulu 
Sibiya and Assistant Editor Sekola Sello; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] CITY PRESS [CP]. Why do you and Nelson Mandela 
think April 27 is sacrosanct, that this date cannot be changed 
to accommodate Inkatha and other rightwing parties that may be 
persuaded to take part in the elections? 
  Ramaphosa: There is so much expectation among our people, 
and among the international community, that this is the one date 
that the people of South Africa have with destiny. The 27th has 
been so deeply ingrained in the minds of our people that if you 
were to postpone the elections the consequences would be, to use 
a phrase that has been used before, too ghastly to contemplate. 
  Our people have stretched their patience over the years of 
apartheid so much that there is no further elasticity left 
beyond the 27th. There would be an eruption, an upheaval like 
we have never seen before. 
  The second thing is the international community would turn 
their backs on us. The investing community, the business 
confidence that we have started building up would just be a 
downward spiral. I don't think the economy could sustain a 
postponement of that date. 
  It would make a mockery of the whole process of 
negotiations. 
If you were to tamper with that date, then you would have to 
start saying, "When must the election be held?" -- and then we 
are involved in a huge, lengthy wrangle. 
  We think we have done enough -- virtually everything -- to 
try to bring them on board. But we are prepared to walk the 
extra mile. Mediation to us is the solution and when they 
(Inkatha) proposed it, we grasped it because we believe it would 
not delay negotiations or the elections. 
  CP: Your party's strongest point has been the ability to 
carry your constituency with you even when taking unpopular 
decisions. You demonstrated this when you suspended armed action 
but more graphically following the assassination of SACP [South 
African Communist Party] leader Chris Hani. We contend that if 
you endorsed a postponement there would not be any upheaval. 
  Ramaphosa: One of the central demands we made following 
Chris Hani's death was that an election date must be set -- and 
it was that which calmed the people. It was around that that we 
were able to contain the anger bursting out. It would be a 
betrayal to the memory of Hani if we were to change the election 
date. 
  CP: We further argue that the investing community's 
confidence would be restored and not diminished if an 
all-inclusive settlement, one that involves Inkatha and the 
white right, was reached even if at the expense of a 
postponement. 
  Ramaphosa: We have been talking to the investing community, 
ambassadors and so forth -- and they agree that there should be 
no change. 
  CP: Are you not taking a serious risk with this route? What 
if these heavily armed rightwingers then claim "peaceful avenues 
were closed to them" and the only recourse left was armed 
resistance? 
  Ramaphosa: The risks are far greater for us if the election 
date was changed. Looking at the rightwingers, some of them 
don't want an elections -- let's be realistic on this issue. 
They are afraid of democracy and it is one of their stalling 
strategies. We would be making the biggest mistake if we were 
to change the election date. We would be playing into their 
hands. 
  CP: There are divisions within the rightwing. Wouldn't a 
postponement show your reasonableness and further drive a wedge 
among these factions? You would call the bluff of those against 
elections. 
  Ramaphosa: We have called their bluff. It is already known 
who is serious about elections and who is not. Buthelezi 
(Inkatha leader Mangosuthu) says he needs more time to campaign 
for elections. That is the flimsiest and weakest excuse that 
you can think of. To use such an excuse when it is the future 
of the country that we are looking at does not display 
responsibility. 
  CP: Are you saying Chief Buthelezi is not interested in 
taking part in the elections of all? 
  Ramaphosa: He is afraid of democracy. He is afraid of 
facing the people. His support has been dwindling and he knows 
that. What he is afraid of is losing the elections. If he is 
not afraid, let him go and face the country. 
  CP: There are widespread claims, rumours if you will, that 
the ANC offered him something in order to take part in the 
elections. 
  Ramaphosa: He was not offered anything. Basically we just 
put forward what is possible if the IFP runs for elections. 
There is no reason why, if they have a good showing at the 
polls, they cannot be part of government of national unity. 
They could be in the Cabinet as well, that is in black and 
white in the constitution. 
  CP: Come, come Mr Secretary General. It is rumoured that 
you offered him the deputy presidency. 
  Ramaphosa: If you look at the constitution it is not a 
question of having promised anybody the deputy presidency. The 
first deputy president will come from the majority party -- 
which the ANC is going to be. The second deputy president will 
come from the second largest party. So if Inkatha becomes the 
largest party they have the presidency and the second presidency 
[as published]. But if they become second largest party they 
have the second deputy presidency. It is guaranteed in the 
constitution. No promises could ever have been made of the 
deputy presidency. We can't bend the constitution. 
  CP: How serious and realistic are you about providing one 
million houses within five years? Given the huge amounts and 
the sheer logistics needed, is this not an electioneering 
gimmick? 
  Ramaphosa: We believe it is possible to build up to a 
million houses in five years. It is possible if we harness all 
the resources we have as a nation and direct them towards giving 
our people a better life. The economy can start booming if 
features of our plans can be implemented. 
  May I give an example of how the Israelis have just gone 
about it. They got two or three billion dollars from the U.S. 
and the money was largely used as a guarantee for the loans that 
the people will get. At the same time government obtained loans 
from international banks and other sources. 
  We will be able to get loan guaranteed funds coming in to 
give guarantees to the private sector that their money is not 
going to be lost. The government will be able to back up those 
guarantees. The government will be able to unlock a number of 
resources. A bit of money has been voted in this parliament 
over the years for housing and they have not utilised it. 
  By unlocking and redirecting resources we will be able to do 
it and because we have identified it as a priority we are not 
the type of government who will sit on money. Let me give you 
an example. They (government) voted R4-million [rand] to 
upgrade hostels. But up to today nothing has happened, nothing 
has been spent. 
  Why? Because they have no plan. I think they voted 
R2-billion for housing. What happened? They built 15,000 
houses. 
  The House of Delegates, the House of Representatives have 
been building, yes -- for the Indians and Coloureds because of 
the favoured status that they were given. But have we seen a 
major housing project underway in black areas? Never. What did 
they do in the end? They gave R2-billion to the Independent 
Development Trust [IDT]. And what did the IDT do with the 
money? They built toilet cities all over.

<F P=106> [Report by Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Text] Paarl March 15 SAPA -- The African National Congress 
[ANC] was confident it could pay for its reconstruction and 
development plan from existing resources, the party's economics 
head, Trevor Manuel, said on Tuesday [15 March]. 
  More than 800 people jammed the Paarl East community hall to 
hear Mr Manuel and constitutional expert Dullah Omar. "We have 
done all the sums," Mr Manuel said in response to National Party 
[NP] criticism that the ANC was offering the impossible. "We 
must tell the NP we can pay for it with existing resources." 
  Explaining the ANC's arithmetic, he said working people paid 
extremely high taxes with married women in effect being punished 
for having left their kitchens to earn salaries. 
  "We are going to turn it all around. We are going to look to 
companies which are so lightly taxed and strengthen our base 
from there..." 
  Furthermore there were the imbalances in the budget itself. 
  "Defence is getting more then six times the money allocated 
to housing. There's definitely something wrong there. The 
secret special defence fund alone is R3.83 billion [rand]-- what 
are they doing with it? Printing election posters for the NP? 
Such funds cannot only create housing but jobs. It will have to 
change after April 27." 
  Mr Manuel said insurance companies would be told South 
Africa 
had enough office blocks and super shopping malls. Factories 
were needed where the people could work and money needed to be 
channelled into the townships. 
  "Do it, or we will pass laws to help you do it," he said. 
International agencies were begging to lend the country money 
"but we're saying to them wait a bit, not yet". 
  Mr Dullah Omar said the ANC had demanded from President F. 
W. 
de Klerk and Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha the 
restoration of citizenship to the people of the TVBC [Transkei - 
Bophuthatswana - Venda - Ciskei] states and the re-incorporation 
of the homelands at the start of negotiations more than two 
years ago. 
  "They refused. The fact that they propped up the regime of 
(former Bophuthatswana president) Lucas Mangope for so long has 
cost us dearly. He could have been out of the way a long time 
ago."

  [Text] Pretoria March 16 SAPA -- Any Conservative Party 
[CP] member joining another political party and standing for the 
April elections would automatically be expelled from the CP, 
party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said on Wednesday [16 March]. 
  This follows reports that the election candidate list of 
General Constand Viljoen's newly-founded Freedom Front would be 
submitted on Wednesday. Several CP MP's names are expected to 
be on the list, widely seen as precipitating a split in CP ranks. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said in terms of the party's constitution, 
any 
CP member who became a member of another political party and 
making himself available as candidate in the elections 
automatically excluded himself from CP membership. 
  This conduct would be in conflict with a unanimous decision 
by the CP executive that the polls would be boycotted, he said. 
  Termination of membership would automatically result in 
these 
members losing access to CP facilities and assets, he added.

  [Text] Klerksdorp March 15 SAPA -- The Conservative Party 
[CP] is to hold two "freedom days" to be marked by protests and 
passive resistance involving all towns and cities included in 
the borders of the proposed Afrikaner "volkstaat" [homeland]. 
  CP leader Ferdi Hatzenberg told a "stop the ANC (African 
National Congress)" meeting in Klerksdorp on Tuesday [15 March] 
night all members of the CP, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging 
[Resistance Movement -- AWB] and the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] will take part in the planned protests. 
"It will be our show of strength," he said. 
  The CP new action programme will be implemented in two 
phases: 

  -  March 29, when every town or city in every part of the 
proposed volkstaat will come to a standstill between 8 AM and 2 
PM. Among the planned events are marches, flag hoistings, the 
reading of proclamations, the closing of businesses and schools 
and the establishment of burger [citizen] councils. 
  -  March 31, when a capital city day will be celebrated in the 
town and cities of the proposed volkstaat in same way. 
  "The purpose of the mass action is to force the government 
and the ANC to heed our call for a volkstaat. Everyone will 
join in the activities. Special arrangements will also be made 
to include as many school children as possible."

<F P=106> [Article by Gert van der Westhuizen: "White Wolves Declare </F>
27 April Day of Resistance"] 
  [Text] The White Wolves have declared 27 April to be a day 
of resistance and have called upon members "to hail" the day 
with acts of insubordination. In addition, they plan to take 
down National Party (NP) and African National Congress (ANC) 
posters, boycott Coca-Cola, and delay traffic on highways in the 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area. According to 
the February edition of BOEREBRANDWAG, their official 
newsletter, all parties and organizations taking part in the 
election must be viewed as enemies and traitors to the "Boer 
nation." The White Wolves feel that "Boers" can only participate 
in an election if it is held exclusively for "Boer compatriots" 
in their own state. 
  At the same time, White Wolves members are being encouraged 
to display banners with "Boer slogans" at sports events. The 
four-colored flag [of the old South African Republic] is to be 
hoisted in the organization's various districts as well. Readers 
of the newsletter are "invited" this month to pile up stones in 
front of the doors of "hostile elements" in their districts. 
Coca-Cola will also be boycotted from the beginning of this 
month to 1 April because Afrikaans is no longer being printed on 
its soft-drink containers. This part of the White Wolves' 
resistance plans already began on 22 January when empty "Coke 
bottles" were smashed in front of Coca-Cola plants in Hercules 
and Pretoria. 
  And if everything goes according to plan, the "communist 
government" is going to lose a lot of money in the next three 
months because the White Wolves are going to delay traffic along 
"strategic routes" by driving at a maximum of 60 km per hour on 
various days on highways in the PWV area.

<F P=106> [Report by Mike van Niekerk] </F>
  [Text] Perth -- Australian police are investigating whether 
to charge members of a white supremacist group over a 
fund-raising appeal for the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]. 
  The shadowy National Action, which operates from post boxes 
in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, launched a "White Australia-SA 
[South Africa] Solidarity" campaign in its latest newsletter. 
  "In response to appeals for help from our brother nation, 
the 
Afrikanners of SA, National Action has decided to assist in 
fund-raising for the nationalist AWB," the National Action News 
said in an editorial. Donors are asked to send money to a bank 
account in the name of the AWB Wenkommando [Victory Commando] in 
Ventersdorp in the western Transvaal. The group is also 
offering White Australia-SA Solidarity T-shirts, bearing the 
swastika-like symbol of the AWB. 
  National Action, which is virulently opposed to Asian 
immigration into Australia, is one of a number of rightwing 
groups which operate of the fringes of Australian society. In 
recent months it has published a series of articles promoting a 
"boerestaat" [Boer homeland] in SA and its possible connection 
with right-wing SA backers has attracted the attention of 
Australian police. 
  A police spokesman said yesterday the force was looking 
seriously at the AWB fund-raising appeal as a possible 
contravention of the Crime (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) 
Act of 1978. The Act makes it an offence for anyone in 
Australia to raise money or give money that will be used to 
incite fear or death or violence in the people of any foreign 
country.

  [Text] South Africa's new national flag has been accepted 
by the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. The flag consists 
of six colors: red, green, blue, white, black, and yellow, and 
is in the form of a green letter Y lying on its side. The two 
short legs of the Y are on the left hand side of the flag with 
the space between them colored black. The Y is surrounded by a 
yellow band. The top section of the flag is red and the bottom 
part blue. The ANC's [African National Congress] chief 
negotiator, Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, said the choice of a design had 
been an earnest attempt to promote unity and reconciliation. 
The TEC decided that the Call of South Africa and Nkosi 
Sikelel' iAfrika [God Bless Africa] would both serve as national 
anthems during the transitional period.

  [Text] There has been mixed reaction to South Africa's flag 
of transition which was finally unveiled yesterday after months 
of debate, acrimony and confusion. 
  As the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] revealed the 
design that will flutter over public buildings for the next five 
years after the April election, outside condemnation already 
came in from some quarters. Other parties ventured to express 
cautious acceptance, while some have yet to comment. 
  In its reaction the Democratic Party [DP] said national 
symbols such as the flag should be decided by a referendum. DP 
spokesman Rob Harper said the decision should not be made by the 
National Party or the African National Congress [ANC], but by 
all the people of this country. 
  ANC Regional Publicity Chief Yulelani Nguko commended the 
TEC 
criteria for the design, but slammed it for having nothing which 
one can identify with. Mr. Nguko who was speaking in his 
personal capacity said this may have been the key reason why 
everybody agreed on it. 
  Minority Front leader Amichand Rajbansi came out in favor of 
the flag saying it accommodated both majorities as well as 
minorities.

  [Text] Pretoria March 15 SAPA -- A moratorium has been 
placed on the export and international marketing of landmines, 
Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee announced in Pretoria on 
Tuesday [15 March]. He said the decision, effective 
immediately, followed a United Nations General Assembly session 
in October last year which expressed its concern about the 
indiscriminate way in which landmines caused the maiming and 
death of innocent civilians in several countries. 
  "South Africa is in the forefront in the world in the field 
of anti-mine measures and mine-tracking abilities, but the 
availability of our anti-mine equipment is hampered by 
international armaments sanctions. The effective use of mine 
resistance armoured vehicles such as the South African-developed 
Mamba can protect and save peace-keeping forces from being 
maimed. Several countries such as Bosnia, Mozambique and Angola 
could benefit from our assistance and equipment," Mr Coetsee 
said.

  [Text] Three highly dangerous radioactive sources have been 
stolen from the Vaal Reefs Mine near Orkney in the western 
Transvaal. An Anglo-American spokesman said the sources were 
used to measure the density of mud and had no commercial value 
whatsoever. Two of the sources are gray in color and one is 
bright yellow. All are about the size and shape of a large 
coffee tin, and bear a radiation warning symbol. Mine 
management has emphasized the sources are highly dangerous and 
should not be approached or handled.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Call for Disbanding of Homeland Armies -- Greg Mills, 
director of studies at the South African Institute of 
International Affairs, writes in an article on page 16 of 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 16 March that in the new 
South Africa homeland bureaucracies "have to remain in place, as 
there is already a shortage of trained civil servants." 
However, the homeland military forces "should no longer remain 
intact." "Since independence, the record of these armed 
formations has been blighted by the incidence of intervention 
and instability." Mills says the homeland armies should be 
disbanded as "distinct ethnic units," and instead, the emphasis 
"should be placed on regimental and not political or ethnic 
allegiances." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  De Klerk `Shied' Away From AWB -- "It is time to halt the 
AWB's [Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement] paramilitary posturing and to end its delusions of 
martial grandeur," declares a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 March. "The Bophuthatswana 
excursion should have convinced government or the Transitional 
Executive Council that the AWB's activities must be stopped. 
That does not mean banning it. Like any other organisation, it 
is entitled to meet and propagate unpopular views -- but as 
civilians." "Despite the challenge at the World Trade Centre, 
despite confrontations which have cost lives in Ventersdorp and 
now Mmabatho, President F.W. de Klerk has shied away from 
dealing with this fascist force. The next government will not 
be so timid, but the time to pull the AWB's claws is now." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  `Expedience' in AWB, CP Link With Black Groups -- 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 16 March in a page-10 
editorial believes "there is enough evidence to show that many 
Afrikaners do not support the hysteria evinced by the factions 
under Eugene Terreblanche [AWB leader] and Ferdi Hartzenberg 
[leader of the Conservative Party]. What makes their so-called 
link with black conservative groups odious, is that it is based 
more on expedience and opportunism in the fight against the ANC 
and its allies than coalescence of conviction."
