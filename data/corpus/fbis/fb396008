<F P=106> [By reporters Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229) and Gao </F>
Jianxin (7559 1696 2450)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- The political affairs 
group of the preliminary working committee for the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] 
held its fifth meeting here 24-25 February. The meeting 
discussed and studied the relationship between the 
administrative and legislative organs of the Hong Kong SAR, the 
method of forming the first government -- including the method 
and timing of the election of the administrative commissioner 
and how to form the administrative council and its functions -- 
and the establishment of a consultative committee and its 
functions after 1997. 
  After the meeting, the group's leaders Liang Zhenying and 
Xiao Weiyun gave briefings to reporters. Xiao Weiyun said: The 
administrative organ shall be the leading component of Hong 
Kong's future political system. The Basic Law provides explicit 
stipulations that the administrative and legislative organs 
should check and balance while coordinating with each other. 
Only by keeping the administrative organ as the leading 
component will the government operate efficiently, society 
remain stable, the economy prosper, and living standards be 
improved. This is the principle we will adhere to at all times. 
If anyone, by playing small or big tricks, tries to change the 
system which upholds the administrative organ's leading position 
before 1997, such changes will certainly be rescinded after 1 
July 1997 because they are not in line with the interests of the 
people in Hong Kong and are not conducive to its long-term 
stability and prosperity. 
  Responding to a reporter's question on how China could 
"start 
a new stove," Xiao Weiyun said, Patten's "constitutional reform 
package" [zheng gai fang an -- 2398 2395 2455 2714] violates the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong Basic Law, and the 
agreements reached between China and Britain. Now Britain, 
doggedly going its own way, has submitted the package for 
adoption by the British Hong Kong Legislative Council. This 
means that the door to Sino-British negotiations has been shut 
by Britain's disruption. Needless to say, the Chinese Government 
will "start a new stove" according to the provisions of the 
Basic Law. To this end, the preliminary working committee will 
step up efforts and do solid work to ensure a smooth transition 
of power and the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [By Carol Pui-yee Lai] </F>
  [Text] After the initial fury from China over a decision 
by the Governor, Chris Patten, to put forward an unamended 
version of his political reform bill, senior Chinese officials 
yesterday began toning down the official response. However, 
Wang Fengchao, the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, warned Britain that "it is difficult to see how 
Sino-British co-operation will not be affected on other matters 
in the absence of a co- operative atmosphere". Wong Po-yan, the 
chairman of the airport consultative committee, said yesterday 
in Beijing he believed work on the new airport would be affected 
by the current political rift between Britain and China. 
  At a Preparatory Working Committee reception in Beijing, the 
Chinese Premier, Li Peng, urged members to speed up their work 
because they faced what he called a "heavier burden". Without 
naming Britain or Patten, Li said it should be recognized that 
China was no longer the China of 1840, but of 1994. The wheel 
of history will roll forward, not to be stopped," Li said. 
"China is enjoying political stability and economic prosperity." 
  Wang accused Britain of "going further and further" in 
undermining co-operation between the two countries. He said 
that although economic affairs should not be mixed with 
politics, it would be difficult to separate the two because 
China could not help "feeling emotional". 
  In Tokyo, Chinese Vice Premier, Zhu Rongji, told Japanese 
investors that there would be no change in Hong Kong's law and 
overall system after 1997. "In fact, it would be even more 
profitable for foreign investors after 1997," he said. Zhu, who 
is also governor of the central bank, was replying to a question 
on how he would allay fears of Japanese investors. 
  The softening of China's position failed to comfort Hong 
Kong 
investors, who are worried about possible interest rate rises. 
These concerns sent share prices plummeting as much as 5 per 
cent at one point in yesterday's trading, leaving the Hang Seng 
Index at 9,892 -- a fall of 540 points during the morning 
session. The market picked up later in the day, closing at 
10,100 points, a fall of 3.2 per cent. 
  Zhang Junsheng, a deputy director of the New China News 
Agency (Xinhua), last night hit back angrily at the British 
government for its account of the Sino-British talks -- released 
on Thursday -- by revealing part of the Chinese version of the 
negotiations. Zhang said Britain had misled the Hong Kong 
public by not revealing details of an agreement between Britain 
and China made before the talks were opened on April 22. Zhang 
said that after Patten gazetted his political reform bill on 
March 22, Alastair Goodlad, the British Foreign Minister in 
charge of Hong Kong affairs, sent a message on March 30 to 
request talks with China. Jiang Enzhu, China's Deputy Foreign 
Minister, agreed conditionally to talks and sent a reply to Sir 
Robin McLaren, the British ambassador to Beijing, on April 7. 
  Jiang's letter said it was always China's position to 
resolve 
Sino-British discrepancies through negotiation. He said if the 
Hong Kong government gazetted the political reform bill too 
early it would in effect terminate the talks. Jiang wrote that 
negotiations should be in line with the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the Basic Law and other related Sino-British 
agreements and the memorandum. He said the two countries would 
hold talks in order to guarantee a smooth transition in Hong 
Kong. He wrote that the talks should be conducted with only one 
Chinese and one British official present at the meetings. Other 
members should act as advisers or experts. Jiang said the Hong 
Kong government's tabling of the reform bill in the Legislative 
Council would terminate the talks.

<F P=106> [Report: "Qin Wenjun Revealed That Name List of First Group </F>
of Hong Kong Regional Affairs Advisers Will Be Announced Early 
Next Month"] 
  [Text] The name list of the first batch of Hong Kong 
regional affairs advisers appointed by XINHUA Hong Kong Branch 
will be published early next month. The name list of the third 
batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers will also be made public at 
the same time. A ceremony to renew the tenure of the first 
batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers will be held. In addition, 
the authorities concerned are considering increasing the 
membership of the Preliminary Working Committee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region (PWC). 
  Qin Wenjun, deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, 
attended a cocktail party held by the Hong Kong Association of 
Real Estate and Construction Industries yesterday to celebrate 
the Spring Festival. When asked about progress made in 
appointing "regional affairs advisers," Qin said that the 
Chinese side is stepping up the work, adding that the name list 
of about 300 regional affairs advisers will probably be 
published in early March. The Chinese side is also actively 
preparing for the appointment of the third batch of Hong Kong 
affairs advisers, including looking for suitable candidates and 
soliciting their opinions. He also said that the Chinese side 
is preparing the name list of the second batch of PWC members. 
  Commenting on the possibility that the British side will 
table the second part of the constitutional package to the 
Legislative Council (Legco), he emphasized that the Sino-British 
talks had been suspended unilaterally by the British side. 
Whether the constitutional package is submitted to Legco in 
part or in full amounts to the suspension of the talks, as was 
agreed by the two sides before the talks. The Chinese side did 
not expect this, but since this has happened, the British side 
must accept the consequences. He also said that if the British 
side publishes the minutes of the 17 rounds of talks, the 
Chinese side will follow suit. 
  When asked about support given by the Australian foreign 
minister to the Hong Kong governor's political reform package, 
Qin said: The Hong Kong issue is a matter for both China and 
Britain before 1997 and is China's internal affair after 1997. 
This is a principle the Chinese side has solemnly told the 
world. No third party is qualified to make irresponsible 
remarks on the Hong Kong issue. He also reminded the public of 
the disparity between the remarks by the Australian prime 
minister and the foreign minister. On the human rights issue, 
he reiterated that the Asian region values democracy and knows 
how to expand democracy, including human rights, in line with 
its actual conditions. 
  Qin said he had no idea about the transfer of Zhou Nan, 
director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, to Beijing. Regarding the 
appointment of Wang Fengchao, director of the second department 
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, as deputy director of 
the office, Qin said Wang is the right person for the post, 
because he is familiar with the situation in Hong Kong and Macao.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Chinese Side Has Sincerity, So the British </F>
Side Must Not Erect Obstacles"] 
  [Text] The Chinese side recently agreed to resume the 
airport panel meeting to discuss the fourth airport financing 
plan proposed by the British side. This shows the Chinese 
side's sincerity. The Chinese side has been in favor of 
building a new airport in Hong Kong on the condition that the 
relevant financial package complies with the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU). 
  The meeting will help the two sides exchange information, 
study the feasibility of the newly proposed financial package, 
and ensure that the financial package agrees with the airport 
MOU. The Chinese side has not been given all the materials on 
the project or detailed data on the financial package and cannot 
afford to hire experts to carry out studies like the Hong Kong 
Government, which has great financial strength due to its 
enormous revenue. Given this situation, an airport panel 
meeting, at which the Chinese side can directly put questions to 
the British side and the latter can summit documents and 
materials on the feasibility studies, will certainly help judge 
whether the fourth financial package follows the principle of 
cost efficiency and whether it will leave a heavy financial 
burden to Hong Kong people. 
  Nevertheless, there are still quite a few unclear areas in 
the fourth financial package tabled by the Hong Kong Government, 
which places obstacles before the meeting. 
  After announcing that it had formulated the fourth airport 
financial package before the Spring Festival, the British side 
has launched a propaganda offensive over the last few days, 
repeatedly insisting that the debts of the Provisional Airport 
Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation 
are not government debts and that, as the British Hong Kong 
authorities had met the demands of the MOU by increasing 
investment, the Chinese side should reach an agreement with the 
British side on the "new financial package." 
  According to press reports, under the new financial package, 
the British will increase investment by HK$15 billion [Hong Kong 
dollars], but the PAA and the MTR Corporation will still run up 
debts as high as HK$28 billion, approximately six times the HK$5 
billion stipulated in the MOU. With such a large debt, how can 
the new financial package be said to have "complied with MOU 
requirements"? 
  The British side continued to falsely allege that the debts 
of the PAA and the MTR Corporation are not part of the 
government debt, but such an argument is untenable. Since the 
MOU has stipulated that the British Hong Kong Government is 
responsible for the airport's core projects, how can the British 
side defect responsibility onto the two institutions? Again, 
the two institutions are wholly owned by the government, so 
their debts must be undertaken and paid by the future Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) government after 1997. Just as a 
senior Hong Kong Bank economic researcher pointed out: For the 
two institutions to take on loans is a matter concerning the 
Sino-British agreement. Without sufficient guarantee, the two 
institutions are unlikely to get the money they need. Even if 
banks agree to extend the loans, they would increase the annual 
interest rate to over 10 percent, because the two institutions 
would not be able to give security for their debts. Such a high 
interest rate would make it impossible for the borrowers to pay 
off their debts--though they might be willing to pay the high 
interest due to the lack of a sufficient guarantee--and 
accordingly would increase the banks' risk. The result would be 
that no banks would lend money to the two institutions. This 
analysis also reveals that borrowing money in the name of the 
MTR Corporation and the new Airport Corporation instead of the 
Hong Kong Government contravenes the principle of commercial 
operation and also deviates from the principle laid down in the 
MOU. If the two sides fail to reach agreement on the financial 
arrangements for the new airport, will the PAA and the MTR 
Corporation be able to get the money they need? 
  The British side described the fourth financial package as 
the best choice because of the increase in investment, termed it 
a generous gift for the Chinese side, and urged the Chinese side 
to rapidly accept the offer. This argument is not supported by 
facts. As long as one compares the sharp increase in the 
construction costs with the small and slow increase in the 
British Hong Kong Government's investment, one will realize that 
the most important concern is for the airport financial package 
to follow the principle of cost effectiveness. If construction 
costs are not capped and get out of control, the debt will 
continue to grow much faster than investment. In 1991, the 
construction costs of the new airport were HK$98 billion. In 
March 1992, they increased to 120 billion, and today have 
reached 175 billion -- and still no cap has been set on them. 
In the first airport financial package, there was an unexpected 
"callable equity [huo you fu zhai 2057 2589 6298 0280]" of HK$21 
billion and the combined debt of $73 billion to be owed by the 
PAA and the MTR Corporation, totaling HK$94 billion. A 
financial package with such huge debt was naturally opposed by 
the large numbers of Hong Kong people and the Chinese side. 
Then the British side, forced to change its tactics, put 
forward the second financial package in September 1992. In this 
package, the British side demanded that 50 percent of the 
proceeds from selling the 62 hectares of land above the airport 
railway due the SAR government be injected into the rail plan in 
an attempt to use the SAR government's money to help pay the 
debt. Even so, the debts of the PAA and the MTR Corporation 
were still as staggering as HK$22.9 billion. As the British 
side's attempt to appropriate the land premium due the SAR 
government was strongly criticized, the British side tabled the 
third airport financial package in June 1993. In this financial 
package, the British side agreed to plow into the railway plan 
its 50 percent share of the land premium from the sale of the 62 
hectares and to allocate HK$5 billion from the Hong Kong 
government's financial surplus to symbolically increase the 
investment, but the debts of the PAA and the MTR Corporation 
soared to HK$45 billion, nine times the figure set in the MOU. 
In the meantime, the British side was busy providing 
appropriations and parceling away the airport project in an 
attempt to create a situation of high cost and low returns, and 
a huge debt in the future which China would be forced to take 
over. In view of this attempt, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office made a firm four-point statement. Sensing that its coy 
plan was not going to work, Britain pulled another trick -- the 
fourth package. From the zany growth of the airport's 
construction costs and the Hong Kong government's symbolic 
increase in funding, we can see that the most crucial point in 
the airport package is the principle of cost efficiency. If 
prices keep rising with no end in sight, the only thing that 
will happen is that actual debt will rise alongside the cost. 
This will happen despite any agreement between China and 
Britain on the financial arrangements. There is no guarantee 
that the debt will not keep increasing. 
  China has always supported the construction of a new airport 
to ensure and develop Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and 
has consistently insisted that the airport project observe the 
principles of cost efficiency and not saddling the future SAR 
government with a financial burden. If Britain had followed the 
provisions of the MOU, there would have been a financial 
arrangement agreement. Britain should have the sincerity to act 
in accordance with the MOU and stop its stalling tactics, for 
that is the only correct way to solve the airport problem.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Whole Truth of Talks Has Come Out"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
announced the truth of the main issues discussed at the 
Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 electoral 
arrangements. This was a necessary response made at the request 
of members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's 
[SAR] Preparatory Committee and people in different circles and 
was also aimed at the British side's unilateral publication of 
the White Paper last week, which distorts the contents of the 
talks. The publication of the truth about the talks is good 
for clarifying views and enables the facts to refute the British 
side's slanders and attacks. 
  After reading the full text published by the Chinese side, 
Hong Kong people will, naturally, understand that during the 17 
rounds of talks in eight months last year, there was a strong 
contrast between the two sides' stands and attitudes: The 
Chinese side was sincere during consultations, took the overall 
interests into account, repeatedly expressed its views with good 
intentions, made flexible concessions, and showed extreme 
forbearance. Whereas the British side acted obstinately and 
shamelessly; was rude, unreasonable, and overbearing; raised 
side issues; and deliberately undermined the talks. We can say 
that the concessions the Chinese side made at the negotiating 
table exceeded the expectations of many Hong Kong people; apart 
from this, the Chinese side was ready to enter into further 
consultations and seek further mutual understanding and mutual 
accommodation but the British side finally took action which 
caused a breakdown in the talks. Despite all this, the Chinese 
side still maintained the tolerance of a large and proud 
country, kept its former commitments, and did not publish the 
British side's inglorious record at the talks. However, the 
British side was the first to violate the understanding if 
secrecy between the two sides, so that the Chinese side had no 
alternative but to publish the main points which had been 
distorted by the British side. 
  Reviewing the talks, their whole process seems to appear 
before us. Of course, this makes it easier to see more clearly 
that the British side was bent on confrontation and had no 
sincerity on reaching an agreement with the Chinese side through 
negotiations. Originally, both sides had agreed to proceed with 
the talks on the basis of the "three conformities," namely 
conformity with the Sino- British Joint Declaration, the Basic 
Law, and Sino-British understandings. From the very beginning 
of the talks, the British side resorted to the tactic of 
confirming the "three conformities" principle in abstract and 
negating it in reality. As a result, the talks were delayed and 
could not proceed on a correct track. The White Paper published 
by the British side last week mentions that the British side 
evaded the principles confirmed by the Chinese side according to 
the "three conformities." "Annex One" to the Chinese side's 
full text published yesterday fully lists the contents of the 
eight-point principles confirmed. Chinese and foreign 
personalities can see that these principles are the original 
meaning of the "three conformities." Why did the British side 
say that it was difficult to confirm? It did this because it 
wanted to persist in Chris Patten's "three violations" program, 
having no sincerity at all in the talks! 
  The British side's White Paper uses the elections of 
functional constituencies to attack the Chinese side, saying 
that the elections of functional constituencies "can be 
manipulated by others" and "may lead to corruption and 
irregularities." As a matter of fact, the elections of 
functional constituencies were invented by the British side and 
they recommended them to the Chinese side. Long ago, both sides 
had already reached an agreement and understanding on the nature 
and electoral methods of functional constituencies. The problem 
was that the British side wanted to break the agreement and 
change the elections to disguised direct elections, therefore it 
tried to play down the importance of functional constituencies' 
elections at all costs. Unquestionably, functional 
constituencies' elections have their limitations but, as a 
transitional means under the principle of gradual and orderly 
progress, they will play a positive role. What was published by 
the Chinese side yesterday provides strict logical reasoning in 
refuting the British side's slanders on functional 
constituencies' elections and the participants. What was 
published by the Chinese side points out: The British side's 
accusation is utterly groundless and does not respect voters or 
the incumbent legislative councilors elected by functional 
constituencies. 
  The main topic of the 17th round of Sino-British talks was 
on 
Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements. However, from 
the very beginning of the talks, the British side insisted on 
talking about three issues purely within the category of Chinese 
sovereignty, including the personnel arrangements for the Hong 
Kong SAR's Preparatory Committee. What was published yesterday 
clarifies the Chinese side's stand on these questions. Hong 
Kong people also know that from the beginning of the talks, the 
British side talked glibly about setting what it calls the 
objective criteria for boarding the "through train." Logically 
speaking, there must be convergence of rails before a through 
train can pass. As Hong Kong people put it vividly: There must 
be a "through train" before passengers can board it." 
Furthermore, many Hong Kong people pointed out long ago that 
the definition of qualifications for "boarding the through 
train" completely falls within the category of Chinese 
sovereignty and so does not require any consultations with the 
British side at all. But the British side wanted to talk about 
the so-called "criteria" for "boarding the through train." What 
was published yesterday reveals that the Chinese side even made 
major concessions on this and provided four-point explanations 
but the British side did not accept and insisted that a pledging 
method should be introduced to replace the appointment of 
members for the SAR's Preparatory Committee. As a matter of 
fact, it wants to completely deprive the Preparatory Committee 
of its appointment right--a right which gives expression to 
Chinese sovereignty. 
  The publication of the truth about the talks suggests to 
Hong 
Kong citizens and the entire Chinese people that these 
colonialists who are moving toward their doomsday are 
ferociously and constantly making harsh demands. If this can be 
tolerated, what cannot?

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng 
submitted a motion to the Sixth Meeting of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, asking for examining 
and deliberating the draft labor law. 
  Li Peng said in his motion: To meet the requirements of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure; promote 
reform of the labor system; protect laborers' legitimate rights 
and interests; establish, safeguard, and develop a stable and 
harmonious labor relationship between employers and laborers; 
and promote economic development and social progress, the 
Ministry of Labor and departments concerned have drawn up a 
draft labor law. The draft has been discussed and adopted by 
the State Council's executive meeting. 
  Entrusted by the State Council, Labor Minister Li Boyong 
briefed the meeting on issues concerning the draft labor law. 
Li Boyong said: In compliance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
direction on formulating a labor law, which he proposed at a 
central work conference, the former State Bureau of Labor had 
initiated the drafting of a labor law with departments 
concerned. Over the past decade or so, the draft has been 
revised over 30 times following a great deal of investigations 
and studies as well as repeated assessments. Since the 14th CPC 
Congress, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs under the State 
Council, the Ministry of Labor, and the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions have further studied, assessed, and revised the 
draft law. Presently, various departments are of the opinion 
that it is extremely necessary and imperative to formulate a 
labor law; conditions are ripe for this work. 
  Li Boyong said: It is necessary to draw up a labor law to 
protect laborers' legitimate rights and interests and maintain a 
stable and harmonious labor relationship between employers and 
laborers. Since reform and opening policies were adopted, 
China's non-publicly-owned economic sectors have developed 
significantly, and publicly-owned enterprises are also stepping 
up the pace of changing operating mechanisms; thus the labor 
relationship is becoming more complicated and diversified. In 
the course of such a profound transformation, a sound and 
perfect development in labor legislation is, in an objective 
sense, necessary for correctly readjusting and safeguarding the 
legitimate rights and interests of both sides of a labor 
relationship and for resolving contradictions between employers 
and laborers; it is very pressing to keep laborers' legitimate 
rights and interests from being infringed upon through 
legislation. In fact, the practices of extending laborers' 
working hours at will, cutting their wages, rejecting necessary 
labor protection for them, and even humiliating and physically 
punishing workers, which lead to seriously vicious incidents, 
have been frequently reported in some localities and 
enterprises, particularly nonpublicly owned enterprises, in 
recent years because a law that will provide better protection 
for laborers' legitimate rights and interests is absent. Some 
foreign-invested enterprises openly harmed laborers' interests 
under the pretext that there is no labor law in China, 
deteriorating the labor relationship and disturbing social 
stability. Many deputies and members from every past term of 
people's congress and committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference have submitted motions and 
suggestions for accelerating the legislation of a labor law. 
  He said: Formulating a labor law is a pressing need for 
developing a socialist market economy. Under the market 
economic structure, a market is required as a basic means for 
allocation of the labor force. As the market economy develops 
and labor reform deepens, China is gradually improving its labor 
system, developing it in the direction of requiring a market to 
allocate the labor force; the development, allocation, and 
employment of the labor force are markedly more commercial and 
social; and openness and competition in the labor market are 
increasingly prominent. These developments objectively lead to 
the requirement that all aspects of the labor relationship be 
incorporated into the track of market operations. The behavior, 
rights, and obligations of the subjects in a labor relationship, 
as well as the order of the labor market, need to be 
standardized and safeguarded by law. Therefore, we badly need 
to draw up a labor law. 
  In his briefing, Li Boyong also elaborated on the guiding 
ideology for legislating the draft labor law, to what extent it 
is applicable, labor contracts, cutting staff and workers, 
working hours, and other issues.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- The Credentials 
Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress (NPC) submitted a name list of nine NPC candidate 
deputies to the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation today. 
  They have been elected by the Standing Committees of 
provincial people's congresses and approved by the Credentials 
Committee of the NPC Standing Committee. 
  The nine candidates are Zhang Rongmao and Liang Zengbiao 
from 
Liaoning Province, Zheng Longzhe from Jilin, Jin Nengchou from 
Fujian, Li Rongqin from Shandong, Li Changchun from Henan, Wei 
Jisong from Guangxi, Chen Shineng from Guizhou and Zhang Xiuming 
from Xinjiang. 
  Chen Shineng was elected governor of Guizhou Province by the 
Guizhou Provincial People's Congress last year. 
  The nominations will be subject to deliberation by the Sixth 
Session of the NPC Standing Committee, which began today. 
  The new candidates are supposed to replace the deputies who 
have died, resigned or been discharged from their positions. 
  Five deputies, Yang Lieyu, Aisin Giorro Pu Jie from Liaoning 
Province, Fan Haogu from Henan Province and Gao Xianhua from 
Sichuan Province, died of illness during the past year. 
  Aisin Giorro Pu Jie was a brother of Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, 
China's last emperor. 
  One deputy, Wu Disheng, former mayor of Shenyang City in 
Liaoning Province, died in a plane accident last year when he 
was visiting Israel. 
  A deputy from Shandong, Jiao Zuguang, asked to resign from 
the position of deputy to the NPC, and his request was approved 
by the Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial People's 
Congress. 
  Two deputies, Wang Zhengguang from Yunnan, and Xu Xiaocheng 
from Xinjiang, were deprived of their NPC deputy status for 
corruption and other illegal practices. 
  Wang Zhengguang, former head of Wenshan Prefecture in 
Yunnan, 
is being investigated by the local procuratorate for taking 
bribes.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- The Xiamen Special 
Economic Zone (SEZ) in east China's Fujian Province, is expected 
to be empowered with legislative rights by the National People's 
Congress (NPC). 
  The Sixth Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, 
which 
opened today, will deliberate the draft decision to authorize 
the people's congress and its Standing Committee in Xiamen to 
formulate laws and regulations, and the Xiamen People's 
Government to issue decrees for the special economic zone. 
  The NPC Law Committee said that Xiamen, one of the earliest 
special economic zones in China, has been authorized by the 
State Council to implement some free port policies and appointed 
to be a pilot SEZ for urban economic structural reform. 
  With China opening wider to the outside world, especially 
with more contacts across the Taiwan Straits, Xiamen has become 
an important "window" in developing economic and trade ties with 
Taiwan and foreign countries. 
  The draft decision will be submitted to the Second Plenary 
Session of the Eighth NPC, which falls on March 10, for further 
deliberation. 
  The NPC Law Committee said that the draft decision was 
initiated by more than 60 NPC deputies from Fujian Province.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- The fifth meeting of the 
Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC] National Committee Standing Committee held a plenary 
session at the CPPCC auditorium this morning. The session 
decided to elect Wang Chengxi and 29 others as additional 
members of the CPPCC National Committee. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, 
attended the session, which was chaired by Vice Chairman Yang 
Rudai. 
  According to a briefing, of the additional members, 16 are 
CPC and 14 are non-CPC members. They include three women, three 
ethnic minorities, three members of the democratic parties; and 
one representative from non-publicly owned economic sectors. 
After the addition, the CPPCC National Committee has a total of 
2,097 members. Of them, 834 are CPC and 1,263 are non-CPC 
members, accounting for 39.75 percent and 60.25 percent of the 
total, respectively. 
  The additional members are small in number, but they reflect 
the policy of "overall consideration and all-round arrangement" 
and are closely related with the current practical needs. 
Intellectuals account for a fairly large portion of the new 
members. Among them are academicians, professors, experts, and 
scholars, embodying the concept of respecting knowledge and 
talented people. There is also a fairly large number of 
celebrities from Hong Kong; they, a total of seven, are mostly 
people who have invested in the mainland and contributed to the 
country's opening up and economic construction. Paying attention 
to the arrangement of minority nationalities is a tradition of 
the CPPCC and a major component of the CPC's nationality policy. 
The three newly elected ethnic members are personages yielding 
some influence and having a high status in their respective 
localities and nationalities. A representative from non- 
publicly owned economic sectors, who is patriotic, respects his 
profession, and abides by the law, has also been elected. 
  At the plenary session today, Wang Zhaoguo explained a 
proposed namelist (draft) of additional vice chairmen and 
Standing Committee members and election of a new secretary 
general of the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee. 
  At the session, Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission, delivered a report on progress 
in the ongoing anticorruption drive. The report consists of 
three parts: Basic Assessment of the Nationwide Anticorruption 
Drive Since Last August; Experiences and Practices of the 
Anticorruption Drive in the Previous Stage; and Anticorruption 
Tasks in 1994. 
  Noting that the CPPCC National Committee has all along paid 
close attention to and supported the anticorruption drive, Wei 
Jianxing urged all CPPCC National Committee members to, as 
always, care for and support the anticorruption drive by making 
suggestions, airing views, taking part in work inspections, and 
providing important clues to help investigate violations of law 
and discipline. According to him, this year CPPCC National 
Committee members will be invited to join supervisions and 
inspections organized by the Central Investigation Groups so 
that the anticorruption drive can be carried out in a 
thoroughgoing, sustained, and more effective manner. 
  Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi 
Ngawang Jigme, Hong Xuezhi, Zhao Puchu, Qian Weichang, Hu Sheng, 
Qian Zhengying, Su Buqing, Ding Guangxun, Dong Yinchu, Sun 
Fuling, and Ann Tse-kai attended the session.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- China will have a 
labor law to protect the legal rights of employees in the 
country. 
  A draft labor law submitted today by the State Council to 
the 
country's legislature for deliberation stipulates that all 
laborers are entitled to rights to choose jobs, to be paid, to 
rest, to have job protection and to receive job training. 
  Laborers' rights should be equal, irrespective of 
differences 
in nationality, race, sex and religious belief, the draft said. 
  The law will also authorize employers to fire employees 
within certain limits, when the enterprises are in true 
difficulties. 
  "An enterprise on the brink of bankruptcy or in grave 
difficulty may reduce working staff, provided that the decision 
is agreed upon by the trade union organization in the enterprise 
or after consultation with all the staff members," the draft 
said. 
  Li Boyong, minister of labor, explained the draft to the 
legislators at the Sixth Session of the Standing Committee of 
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which started today. 
  "The rights of enterprises to dismiss employees for reasons 
other than employees' faults will guarantee the legal rights of 
employers to run businesses independently and will give 
enterprises a certain edge in market competition," Li Boyong 
told the meeting. 
  However, the limits set for job reductions are "necessary 
for 
China's social stability," he said. 
  Because China has far more laborers than required, and such 
a 
disparity cannot be changed in a short time, massive job 
reductions would lead to social chaos, he added. 
  The current session will conduct a preliminary review of the 
draft law. 
  The draft law also rules that the contract system will be 
the 
fundamental form in shaping China's labor relations between 
employers and employees, in both private and publicly owned 
enterprises. 
  "This is based on China's experiments in implementing the 
systems and experiences of other market economies," Li Boyong 
said. 
  There are already 25 million contract laborers in China, Li 
said. 
  The draft also accepts in principle the form of "collective 
agreement" -- which is reached by the trade union organization 
and the enterprise on matters of payment, working conditions and 
welfare for the employees. 
  This system will be mainly implemented in private 
enterprises. Publicly-owned ones may follow the steps after 
property rights are cleared and operation improved, Li said. 
  The minister of labor said that the primary reasons to make 
the law are "to protect the legal rights of laborers, establish 
and maintain stable and harmonious ties between employers and 
employees, and promote China's labor system in line with the 
establishment of the socialist market economy." 
  He said that without a systematic legal system to protect 
working people's rights, China has in recent years witnessed 
quite a few labor disputes in enterprises, and some "major and 
grave" labor accidents, especially in private enterprises. 
  He said workers have been forced to work long hours, or 
their 
pay cut without reason in some private enterprises. 
  Some workers have even been humiliated or beaten by bosses 
from outside China's mainland, he said. 
  Li said the draft has been revised more than 30 times since 
its first version in 1978. The provisions have all been tried 
out and accepted by all regions, industries, and enterprises of 
different forms of ownership. 
  International labor conventions and common practices in 
market economies have also been referred to in the drafting, Li 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- China is very unlikely to 
grant the International Red Cross Society (ICRC) access to its 
jails in the foreseeable future despite the recent start of 
official negotiations on the issue, a high-ranking ICRC official 
said Wednesday [2 March]. 
  "ICRC has been talking to the Chinese Government on the 
question of access to prisoners for a number of years now. 
There's nothing new there," Jean-Michel Monod, the ICRC's 
delegate-general for Asia and the Pacific, told reporters. 
  Monod, who has been participating in these talks, said, 
however, that the position of Red Cross negotiators has improved 
since Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen last November 9 
officially invited the Red Cross for talks. 
  Prior to Qian's announcement, China had always denounced 
such 
requests as tantamount to interfering in the internal affairs of 
a sovereign state. 
  The announcement came shortly before a U.S.-China summit 
which was expected to focus on human rights issues, including 
access to political prisoners, a demand the U.S. had raised 
repeatedly hoping visits would reduce torture and other abuses. 
  "I do not wish that these negotiations are perceived 
exclusively in the framework of the U.S.-China relationship over 
MFN (most- favored nation status)," Monod said, adding that 
access to political prisoners is a longstanding, traditional Red 
Cross concern beyond all national interests. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has warned that he will not 
extend preferential trade treatment when MFN comes up for 
renewal in June unless China improves up its poor human rights 
record. 
  The Red Cross has checked jails in over 50 countries and 
will 
not modify its conditions for visits to Chinese prisons, Monod 
said. 
  Concerning the talks in Beijing in mid-January, it is far 
too 
early to speak about a "half access or a quarter opening or a 
tenth of a promise," he said, predicting it will be a "long 
process" until China accepts the idea of a neutral humanitarian 
organization entering its prisons in order to protect the 
detainees' rights. 
  Meanwhile, the Red Cross has spelled out its terms for the 
visits, "the same conditions as for any other country," which 
will be discussed in a number of more technical follow-ups 
focusing on the wording and legal problems, Monod said. 
  Once a government gives the green light for prison checks 
the 
Red Cross insists on free access to all prisoners of a 
previously defined category. 
  Prisoners may not be transferred from their actual place of 
detention, must be allowed to talk in private, and be guaranteed 
continued contact with Red Cross personnel. 
  Given that negotiations are still in their infancy and that 
defining the content of an ICRC visit or the category of 
prisoners is already "really difficult," Monod warned against 
high hopes for a quick solution to the issue. 
  "We will try to solve all the issues step by step," he said, 
adding that it is anybody's guess when the first prison visit 
would be realized.

conditions," which has already been submitted to the CPC top 
echelon. 
  Hu Angang, and Kang Xiaoguang, two young or middle-aged 
scholars from mainland China recently presented this updated 
"report on national conditions," which focuses on analyzing the 
current corruption issue and sets out the original idea of 
creating new systems to eradicate corruption. 
  Last year, the report on national conditions set out by Hu 
Angang and Wang Shaoguang [3769 4801 0342] dealt with augmenting 
the central government's guidance in the conversion of the 
market economy and many of their suggestions in the report have 
been adopted by the CPC top echelon and became the contents in 
the plan for improvement, of which the most popular was the 
"tax-sharing system." 
  Likewise, the new report on national conditions aims at the 
malpractice of the day, by making in-depth and incisive 
analysis, and embodies the courage and vision of intellectuals 
of a new generation on the mainland. In their analysis, the 4 
June incident was under reexamination. 
  It has not been long since the report was presented and the 
reaction by the CPC top echelon is still unknown; however, when 
some intellectuals read the report in question, they shared the 
"heavy hearts" of the authors in their reaction. 
  Beginning today, this paper will carry excerpts of this 
report in three installments. The report analyzes the present 
conditions and causes of corruption, and boldly explores 
measures to achieve a radical cure. The academic discussions 
are deleted because of a limit in space without the authors 
permission. [end editor's note] 
<H3>  The Extent of Corruption Has Become Cancerous </H3>
It is not exaggerating to say that the extent of corruption in 
mainland China has already become cancerous and is rapidly 
spreading throughout the society. Any government whcih is 
incapable of fighting corruption will be an incompetent one. 
All such governments are destined to collapse. It is 
impossible for a corrupt and incompetent government to carry out 
modernization. The inevitable ending is that the people will 
overthrow the corrupt government. It does not matter whether or 
not the government collapses; nevertheless, modernization will 
vanish like soap bubbles and the goal of catching up with the 
world advanced countries, for which several generations have 
strived, will be out of the question. 
  This report proceeds from the institutional factor to 
analyze 
the root cause of corruption in China and to explore and discuss 
the channels for eradicating corruption. A basic viewpoint of 
this report is that it is imperative to create new systems to 
eradicate corruption and to guarantee reform, opening up, and 
development by fighting corruption. The report comprises of 
five parts. The authors devote the first part to analyzing the 
institutional root cause of corruption during the period of 
conversion to the market economy. The authors define corruption 
as being rent-seeking [xun zu 1416 4436] activity. The essence 
of corruption in China is precisely the fact that officials from 
the top down are vying for acting as ones seeking leases and 
motivated by personal gain under the role of stimulating 
mechanism. In the second part, the authors brief on several 
kinds of the most common rent-seeking activities, including the 
dual-price system, special economic privileges, high tariffs, 
and import quotas, and the "preferential policies" for some 
regions or groups. The authors believe that the government's 
excessive intervention and a distorted market will provide 
monopoly for particular interest groups and the cause for 
rent-seeking activities taking on a vicious cycle. The third 
part sets out the concept that "development is the last word as 
is fighting corruption" [fa zhan si yin dao li, fan fu bai ye 
si yin dao li 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810 0646 5201 2408 0048 
2508 4289 6670 3810] and indicate the imperativeness of holding 
aloft the banner of reform and opening and the banner of 
fighting corruption simultaneously, to create new systems to 
eradicate corruption and guarantee reform and opening by 
fighting corruption. The fourth part sets out the concept that 
creating new systems is the basic channel for fighting 
corruption; it is necessary to do away with or cut back rent [zu 
jin 4436 6855] and restrict rent-seekers as well as special 
privilege groups through institutions. In creating new systems, 
it is unnecessary to launch mass campaigns to avoid 
anticorruption struggle evolving into a "Great Cultural 
Revolution." And the last part focuses on designing major 
measures for creating new systems to eradicate corruption, such 
as lifting controls over loan interest rates, while including 
them on the track of the market interest rates, and advocating 
the concept of "everyone being equal before interest rates"; 
lifting control over foreign exchange rates, while merging them 
with the market exchange rates; removing nontariff trade walls 
and lowering tariff rates by a wide margin; publicly auctioning 
import licenses and delegating the powers of direct imports and 
exports to enterprises in various categories; abolishing 
industrial administrative departments and commissions and 
establishing trades associations; strictly restricting monopoly 
and unfair competition and guaranteeing enterprises in all 
categories can freely join or withdraw from the trade to 
participate in competition; strictly banning party and 
government organizations from running companies, reducing the 
scope of administrative officials, raising their salaries by a 
wide margin, while "supporting the government with normal 
taxes"; and, at the same time, strictly banning the Army from 
participating in business, while "supporting the Army with 
normal taxes" to increase military expenditure by a wide margin. 

<H3>    I. The Institutional Root Cause of Corruption: 
Economic Rent </H3>
  True, the atmosphere of corruption in society is related to 
the ideology, morals, and style of some party and government 
cadres. However, should the atmosphere of corruption remain 
despite repeated banning and rage with ever greater ferocity, 
that must be highly connected with the system. Today, our 
anticorruption struggle is to a large extent a moral practice; 
in actual fact, the corruption today is mainly institutional 
corruption. The major root cause of the phenomena of corruption 
lies chiefly in institutional shortcomings, namely, the 
institutional shortcomings in the period of converting to the 
market economy. With such a system, even those straight and 
honest people would soon degenerate and join the rank and file 
of corruption, becoming captives of institutional corruption as 
soon as they have power in their hands. 
<H5>  Rent-Seeking Activities Lead To Worsening of Corruption </H5>
  Let us take a look at an example of "lobbying a ministry for 
allotment of funds." Suppose a certain central department has 
10 million yuan of financial allotment of funds or for project 
investment and 10 provinces would like to acquire the monetary 
resources. Because of the limitation in funds, it is impossible 
for every province to get them, thus competition between them 
takes shape. The representative of every province is ready to 
spend 1 million yuan to openly, or semi-openly, "bribe" the 
department in question in order to obtain a monetary resource 
that is 10 times the cost of the bribe. Suppose some province 
has succeeded in obtaining the allotment with a bribery cost 
greater than 1 million yuan. When the present value of the 
monopoly after discount is 10 million yuan, with the general 
volume of the resource remaining unchanged, the resource will 
flow from nine losers to one successful province. This is like 
gambling, with many people buying lottery tickets and only one 
or two lucky ones hitting the jackpot. 
  Rent-seeking activities have exemplary effects which lead to 
the worsening of corruption. Because rent-seekers can easily 
obtain huge or super high profits without going through market 
competition and technical renovation, this provides a strong 
stimulation to them while attracting more people to participate 
in rent-seeking activities, resulting in the spread of 
corruption on a still wider scope. Rent-seeking does not lead 
to an increase in social wealth; on the contrary, it leads to 
low efficiency in resource allocation and a grave waste of 
resources. 
<H3>  To Find a Radical Cure for Corruption, the "Rent" Must Be 
Abolished </H3>
  In the course of converting to the market economy, the 
dual-price system is the root cause leading to extensive 
rent-seeking activities. Economic rent equates the difference 
between the market and official prices. Here, prices are 
referred to in a broad sense, including commodity prices, 
capital prices (interest rates), foreign exchange prices 
(exchange rates), and prices for imports (quotas and permits.) 
So long as the two-track price system exists, economic rent 
will surface, stimulating officials with power and rent-seekers 
with money to participate and share the economic rent and the 
phenomena of corruption will grow increasingly serious. That is 
precisely the institutional root cause for the phenomena of 
corruption in China. In reality, officials are economic bodies 
and have motives of personal gain. Under certain restrictions, 
(such as institutional and moral restrictions) their behavioral 
criterion is to seek their own maximum interest. It is not 
abnormal for officials to have motives of personal gain. In 
China, an official's objective function can possibly be: The 
expansion of the economic strength of his own unit or locality, 
an expression to his accomplishments in government, his 
promotion, increase in actual or invisible income, a say in 
distributing resources, and consideration for his children, 
friends, and relatives. Because officials have motives of 
personal gain, they must be restricted with institutions. The 
crux lies in the system that shapes the "economic rent." When 
someone has "something for rent," people will bribe him for that 
something and will he turn down the bribe when there is no 
institutional restriction? Whoever is in that position will 
have the chance to seek something for rent and be stimulated by 
such rent-seeking activities. So long as such "rents" exist in 
the system, corruption will be bred. The only solution to it is 
to create new systems, build new-type modern systems, abolish 
such "rents," and create new systems to eradicate corruption. 
<H5>  II. The Most Common Rent-Seeking Activities </H5>
  Rent-seeking activities are connected with the government's 
excessive intervention in the market; without such intervention, 
and the particular monopoly provided by such intervention, there 
would be no way to seek such rent. Here, a point needs be 
explained, namely, there are two sides to government's 
intervention in the market economy. When the government's 
intervention creates conditions for fair competition in the 
market economy, implements the unified taxation system and tax 
rates, builds a unified market system to prevent the shaping of 
monopoly by some interest groups, such intervention is effective 
and falls in the category of proper intervention. When the 
government's intervention results in a distorted market, 
jeopardizing the fairness in market competition while providing 
some interest groups with preferential policies and implementing 
discriminatory policies for other interest groups, such 
intervention will be ineffective and fall in the category of 
excessive intervention. This being the case, the excessive 
government intervention has provided legitimacy for rent-seeking 
activities, whereas many rent-seekers have conveniently found 
grounds for legitimate rent-seeking from government policies, 
institutions, and regulations. That is the fundamental cause 
for the worsening of rent-seeking activities. 

<H3>    Worsening of Rent-seeking Activities Because of 
Intervention </H3>
  In the course of converting to the market economy, the most 
common rent-seeking activities are: 
  First, the dual-price system. Excessive government 
intervention results in price distortion. For example, when the 
government controls the prices of certain commodities, because 
of great demand, market prices are far higher than official 
prices and the price differences shape into economic rent. For 
another example, the government controls the volume of bank 
loans and interest rates and the market interest rates are twice 
the official interest rates. The bank directors, clerks in 
charge of loans, and the rent-seekers share the "interest rent." 
Take still another example, the government controls the volume 
of foreign exchange as well as exchange rates, with the market 
exchange rates far higher than official ones. Those officials 
who have the power to examine and approve foreign exchanges are 
those who enjoy the "exchange rate rent." 
  Here, a point that needs be explained is that since reform, 
the degree of marketization in China has rapidly expanded and 
the dual- price system tends to transit in the direction of the 
one-track market price system. Presently, prices of farm and 
sideline produce, retail prices of commodities in society, and 
prices for production materials under the state's direct control 
or planning guidance account for a very small proportion. 
Although the rent in this area remains, it is taking on a 
tendency to wane or disappear. Likewise, the dual-track system 
of foreign exchange rates is moving toward a merger between the 
two and the bulk of foreign exchanges are transacted according 
to the market exchange rates. Likewise, rent in this area is 
waning or disappearing. Presently, the largest rent comes from 
the banks loans and interest rates. The government continues to 
intervene in bulk in the volume of loans and compulsively 
stipulates interest rates. Although the official interest rates 
have risen somewhat they are still far lower than the market 
interest rates. With a special permit from the state, the bank, 
this particular interest group, shares the greatest rent by 
monopolizing the use of the rarest resource--capital. A glance 
at the most luxurious bank buildings that have risen up in many 
large cities, including many counties and towns, serves as 
evidence to prove this point. They are just part of the rent 
and have a very close resemblance to the external characteristic 
of major banks all over the United States. 
  Second, special economic privileges. Primarily this refers 
to privileges beyond the law and institutions and second, it 
refers to special economic permits which have violated the 
principle of fair competition and which the law and institutions 
have failed to restrict. For example, the trade's monopoly in 
operation, allowing only state-owned enterprises the power to 
monopolize the operation in some trades, while barring 
enterprises in other categories to freely enter and participate 
in competition; protecting the essential income of a small 
number of state-owned enterprises which is higher than the 
essential income of other industries. A typical example is the 
petrochemical industry, with the entire industry monopolized by 
a single company. Consequently, this special interest group 
enjoys the economic rent all by itself. Take for another 
example, the special permit for producing or marketing certain 
categories of commodities. The exclusive possession of the 
trade in tobacco, or in the operation of telephone and telegram 
services are on lease with a special permit issued by the 
government. When those enterprises acquire the monopoly, they 
willreceive monopolized profits, namely profits exceeding the 
normal level. 
  When the government allows some special interest groups to 
have an industrial monopoly and a special permit in operation, 
the unhealthy atmosphere in the trade will remain stubbornly 
despite repeated bans. On the other hand, those interest groups 
will draw a portion from their monopolized profits to bribe 
government officials so that the latter can come out in the open 
to intervene and impede other enterprises from participating in 
competition to protect their monopoly status and guarantee that 
their industrial economic rent will not be expanded and shared 
by others. This being the case, to abolish those special 
economic privileges and allow other enterprises to participate 
in fair competition is the way to radically cure the unhealthy 
atmosphere in trades. 
  Third, high tariffs for imports and import quotas. There are 
both advantages and disadvantages in high tariffs to the 
development of national industry. From the angle of advantages, 
high tariffs serve to protect the infantile national industry 
from international competition and enable it to develop rapidly. 
From the angle of disadvantages, when the industry is to 
transcend the infantile phase and is monopolized by a small 
number of enterprises, those enterprises will give up their 
efforts to improve technology and quality and augment their 
market competitiveness with the protection of high tariffs. 
They enjoy the same essential income far higher than other 
industries. 
  The control over import quotas and import permits has become 
the major source, as well as chief characteristic, of 
rent-seeking by foreign trade departments and companies. A 
foreign trade company general manager said publicly: "If we 
delegate power of imports and exports to enterprises, who then 
will support us?" Obviously, to artificially set up a tariff 
wall, implementoing an operational monopoly in foreign trade is 
actually protecting the vested interests of those government-run 
organizations and monopoly groups under the pretext of 
protecting national interest. 
  And fourth, the government's "preferential policies" for 
certain regions or groups. Everyone knows that "preferential 
policy" is not a mere scrap of paper but has a great content of 
gold, which equates providing certain monopoly to a certain 
province or trade. For example, regarding the implementation of 
"tax reduction or exemption" over a certain province, the 
conversion of resources takes the form of handing over less 
taxes to the state; the province or trade that succeeds in 
acquiring such "preferential policy" is always the one that pays 
the least tax (referring to ratio), and which equates with 
enjoying a "blood transfusion" from other provinces and regions, 
thus indirectly acquiring a sort of economic rent. 
<H5>  Special Groups Monopolize Huge Profits </H5>
  Aside from the aforesaid rent-seeking activities, there are 
stil other types of such activities which, in essence, are all 
utilizing institutional shortcomings and enabling a small number 
of special interest groups to resort to means of unfair 
competition to acquire tremendous profits through monopoly. 
  In a nutshell, the government's excessive intervention has 
shifted market distortion which, in turn, gives rise to economic 
rent and stimulates rent-seekers' corruption. The greater the 
extent of the government's excessive intervention, the more 
obvious is market extortion and the higher the economic rent 
will be. That is the main cause for the increasingly intense 
corruption in Chinese society today. However, there are two 
sides in government intervention. If government intervention is 
capable of readjusting and correcting market distortion, 
economic rent will be reduced, as will the phenomena of 
corruption. Obviously, such intervention does not mean to 
change the market economic mechanism and restore the planned 
economic structure; on the contrary, it is to make full use of 
the market economic mechanism and cure corruption through 
creating new systems. 
<H5>  III. Development Is the Last Word, As Is Anticorruption </H5>
  "Development is the last word." Without development, there 
would be no way out for China. Development has always been 
China's most important economic goal. However, development 
involves some conditions and corruption should not be the price 
nor the lubricant for development. To engage in corruption is 
doubtlessly suicidal and is sure to jeopardize development, lose 
opportunities, and interrupt the process of modernization in 
China. 
  The "4 June" incident is a typical example that gave us much 
food for thought. In analyzing the causes of the incident, Deng 
Xiaoping said: "One of the causes is the breeding of corruption 
phenomena which has made some of the masses lose faith in the 
party and government." In addition, he said: "No slogans on 
opposing reform and opening have surfaced in the recent incident 
and the slogans focused on fighting corruption. Of course, to 
some people, such slogans are just a background and aimed at 
bewildering people's minds with anticorruption." That showed 
the breeding of corruption had roused complaints from the broad 
masses, which was an important cause that sparked the "4 June" 
incident. Otherwise, there would not have been a million people 
taking to the street demonstrating in Beijing. History is our 
best teacher. However, times have passed and circumstances 
changed and few people would think today: What suddenly sparked 
the "4 June" incident? And still fewer people would care: 
Would such an incident repeat itself from now on? Nevertheless, 
should a nation lack profound reviewing and serious 
understanding such an incident, it could hardly avoid a 
repetition of the historical tragedy. 
<H5>  Five Types of Periodical Shock and Social Instability </H5>
  Reviewing the more than 40 year's historical progress, we 
find two outstanding characteristics in the social development 
of China: First, a considerably high economic growth rate; and 
second, the instability of economic and social development, 
accompanied by five types of periodical shock, namely, periods 
of economic fluctuations, structural change, political struggle, 
mass campaigns, and student movements. Such instability finds 
root in the economic system within the Chinese Government. 
Despite the fact that great changes have taken place in various 
systems in China since reform, such instability can still be 
very keenly felt. Regarding the relations and causes for these 
five types of cycles, the authors will discuss this further in 
another article. Here we shall do some analysis centering 
around the issue of the rise of corruption and anticorruption. 
  The CPC as a party in office since the PRC's founding has 
controlled the bulk of economic resources of the whole society, 
with a huge state organ controlling those resources. 
(Explanation: The words bureaucrat and bureaucracy are used 
neutrally in the following.) Simultaneously, two issues 
surface; first, the flooding of bureaucratism and low work 
efficiency and second, the malpractice of acting the high and 
mighty official and corruption. Because of the lack of an 
external force to restrict power, as well as an independent 
supervising system, those two issues have always awaited a 
solution and perplexed the leading members. Mao Zedong's way 
was precisely to frequently unfold political struggles and 
launch mass campaigns. The movement against the three evils 
[corruption, waste, and bureaucracy], the movement against the 
five evils [bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, 
cheating on government contracts, and stealing economic 
information as practiced by owners of private industrial and 
commercial enterprises], and also the "four clean-up movements" 
were all to conduct periodical purges of corrupt elements and 
the opposition inside the bureaucratic system; however, he 
believed that all those movements had failed to resolve the 
problems. Hence, the imperativeness of the "Great Cultural 
Revolution," namely, relying on the masses outside the 
bureaucratic system to launch a noninstitutional purge on a 
still wider scope. During the period of the "Cultural 
Revolution," Mao Zedong landed himself in a "dilemma": On the 
one hand, he wanted to do all he could to destroy the huge 
bureaucratic organ which he had personally founded; on the 
other, he had to rebuild another bureaucratic organ, which a 
modern country must rely on for its operation. However, he 
refused to resign to such a situation and, before he passed 
away, he was determined to carry the "Great Cultural Revolution" 
through to the end. The tragedy of Mao Zedong in his later 
years was very complicated. We have to acknowledge that his 
stubbornness in fighting bureaucratism and corruption 
represented the aspirations of the broadest masses; 
nevertheless, when he resorted to noninstitutional means (such 
as class struggle, political struggle, and mass campaign,) we 
cannot evade the fact that he committed fatal mistakes and 
eventually dragged the entire nation into an abyss of turmoil. 
  In the course of rebuilding the state bureaucratic organ 
since reform, the planned economic structure characterized by 
centralization has gradually been broken up, with the market 
economic mechanism characterized by decentralization in 
decisionmaking; at the same time, organizations of legislation, 
supervision, and law enforcement have gradually been set up, 
completed, and perfected. This shows that China has made 
substantial progress in the development toward marketization 
economically and legalization socially. However, the issues of 
bureaucratism and corruption have not been settled, because of 
the aforesaid cause of institutional shortcomings and the 
surfacing of special interest groups, which will be discussed 
later in this article, corruption has become the greatest social 
pollution in China in the conversion to the market economy and 
is continuously worsening the social environment. 
<H5>  Corruption Inside the Party Might Interrupt Reform </H5>
  Corruption has always been the gravedigger for the 
government. 
  We are anxious that the vicious corruption inside the party 
is the most likely factor which will interrupt the course of 
reform and modernization from now on. The man in the street 
outspokenly refers to some cadres as "corrupt officials" and 
"local tyrants and evil gentry." Inner-party corruption will 
lead to the Communist Party and its government losing the 
foundation of their legitimacy, namely, the people's approval of 
the party and government is reducing. That is one of the 
expressions that the national strength of Chain is universally 
waning. Some scholars have noticed that corruption has 
politically endangered the prestige and strength of the party 
and the state political power, resulting in the people's doubts 
about the political authority of the Communist Party and the 
state. The corruption of the rank and file of cadres of the 
party and state will eventually shake the foundations of the 
party and state power as well as the entire social system, hence 
social instability. 
  "Water may allow a vessel to float on it and it can also 
upset it." Should we allow corruption to spread unchecked, 
while failing to thoroughly resolve corruption, especially, the 
high-ranking tier inside the party, it is not impossible for the 
Communist Party to collapse because of institutional corruption. 
In actual fact, the party leaders are aware of this possibility.

  [Text] 
<H3>  VI. Institutional Upgrading Is the Fundamental 
Way of Opposing Corruption </H3>
  There are temporary and permanent cures for corruption. It 
is a temporary cure to morally encourage incorruptibility among 
officials, urging them to exercise self-discipline and keep 
politically clean. It is a permanent cure for corruption to 
root it out of its hotbeds. 
  As we mentioned in the previous article, the current 
corruption in Chinese society has something to do with the 
process of transformation to a market economy, including 
institutional defects, institutional changes, and an imperfect 
legal system. If corruption occurs in certain departments, 
localities, and among certain cadres, we can regard the 
phenomenon as an isolated case and mainly adopt the method of 
fighting it morally, enforce the law on the very few corrupt 
officials, and make public several major and important cases to 
"send a warning to a hundred by executing one." Nevertheless, 
when corruption has become a common practice in society and 
people in the higher echelons and the lower levels are all 
seeking rent [xun zu 1416 4436], this shows there is big trouble 
with the existing structure which will foster and breed corrupt 
elements of all descriptions, major and minor. The exclusive 
use of "party discipline and state laws" against corruption is 
just like cutting the fragrant-flowered garlic, which grows 
thickly once its previous patches are cut. This being the case, 
it is necessary to eradicate the hotbeds and soil which breeds 
corruption with institutional upgrading. 
  Objectively, corruption can be found at any time and 
everywhere. However, in different societies and under different 
structures, corruption differs in degree and scope. By 
remedying corruption permanently through institutional 
upgrading, we mean minimizing the scope of corruption 
characterized by people seeking rent through institutional 
checks. 
  Establish a market economy system. 
  By institutional upgrading, we mean establishing a modern 
market economic system and an economic environment based on fair 
competition. This includes abolition of the double-track price 
system, economic privileges, and economic monopoly; promotion of 
the free flow of production elements and trade freedom; 
restriction of special interest groups; correction of excessive 
government intervention; and the reduction of the loss of 
government effectiveness. The adoption of these reform measures 
conforms to the goal set by the Chinese leaders to establish a 
socialist market economy system and will thus greatly help 
expedite the marketization process of the Chinese economy, cut 
the cost of social business, and promote economic prosperity and 
social progress. 
Resistance comes from within the CPC. 
  Resistance to anticorruption comes from within the CPC, with 
its main manifestation being the formation of Communist-led 
special interest groups of all descriptions. The CPC is not a 
monolithic bloc. It does not share identical interests and does 
not have unity in steps. Otherwise, so long as the party 
Central Committee issues an order, corruption would disappear 
across the country or at least would be controled. Within the 
CPC and the state machinery, various kinds of independent 
economic and political interest groups have emerged. This is 
one of the most important characteristics of the changes which 
have taken place in Chinese society since reform was introduced, 
a reflection of the development of the internal groups of the 
party and the state machinery from being unified to being 
pluralistic and from being centralized to being decentralized. 
The role of the political party has been weakened while the 
role of interest groups is intensifying. State authority is 
diminishing while group authority is expanding. These groups 
are special interest groups rather than the interest groups in 
the general sense, such as the interest groups of the workers, 
of the peasants, of the teachers, and of the scientists. Their 
main characteristics are as follows: 
  First, motivated by their own interests, they set the 
pursuit 
of their own group's maximum interests as their objective. They 
are exclusively concerned about the growth of their own group, 
disregarding the loss of society's total wealth. Therefore, so 
long as there is a lack of institutional checks or there are 
economic rent [zu jin 4436 6855], motivated by their own 
interests, they will seek the rent. 
  Second, they belong to groups of a profit-sharing nature and 
participate in sharing society's resources and profits. 
Although they constitute a small proportion of the country's 
total population, they are always in a position to obtain a 
higher proportion of economic resources. 
  Third, they are exclusive and monopolistic in nature. They 
exclude other groups from participation in profit-sharing 
activities, hinder the free flow of production elements by 
opposing their competitive opponents' participation, and 
increase their social monopoly. Of course, when they share 
economic rent and other resources with their opponents, or 
resist external threats and rectification efforts, they will 
collude with each other intensively and extensively, "one 
official covers up for another official" and, thus, make 
themselves more complicated and difficult to deal with. 
  Fourth, they are highly influential and able to cause the 
"lose of government effectiveness." They try every possible 
means to influence government policy and even the policymaking 
of the highest echelons of leadership. They also ask for 
excessive government intervention, or the intervention by top 
leaders, to achieve some economic privileges and preferential 
policies and promote their own interests. They try by every 
possible means to oppose and hinder the adoption of reform 
measures conducive to fair competition because the measures will 
mean the loss of many of their monopolistic benefits. 
  Fifth, their vested interests are rigid. There can be an 
increase rather than a reduction in the absolute interests they 
obtain and in the relative interests they share. 
Reform touches on vested interests. 
  The characteristics mentioned above determine that any major 
measures for institutional upgrading will undoubtedly meet with 
strong opposition from these special interest groups because 
reform touches on their vested interests and may put them in an 
unfavorable position. For example, many interest groups 
disagree to such reform measures as cutting customs duties and 
abolishing import restrictions and exclusive state control in 
foreign trade. Just as Paul A. Samuelson said: The history of 
tariff protection has revealed more opposite cases. Some 
industries are in their infantile stage forever. What is 
protected by the government is the vested interest groups which 
have always refused to cast away their diapers for many years 
rather than infantile industries. (Paul A. Samuelson and 
William D. Nordhaus: "ECONOMICS" (12th) Chinese edition, 
published by the China Development Publishing House in 1992, p 
1450) 
Interest group behavior should be standardized. 
  The difficulty with market-oriented reform is how to handle 
some special interest groups. Practicing the market economic 
principles based on fair competition will, in essence, help 
reduce or get rid of the economic rents exclusively shared by 
these special interest groups. Institutional upgrading is aimed 
at standardizing the commercial behavior of these special 
interest groups, restricting their monopoly, and allowing other 
groups or manufacturers and business people to get involved in 
competition, rather than eliminating and expropriating them so 
that the market based on competition becomes more mature, 
monopolistic profits will become average profits, and economic 
rents will disappear gradually. 
  Proper government intervention is a prerequisite for 
institutional upgrading. In real economic life, the government, 
more often than not, will provide certain special interest 
groups with some sort of monopoly, intentionally or 
unintentionally, such as economic privileges or preferential 
policies. Thus, the other groups will follow suit and also seek 
preferential policies conducive to their interests. 
  The government, in particular the central government, can 
both create and eliminate unfair competition. It must be made 
clear that the purpose of government intervention is to define a 
series of regulations for market competition, put an end to 
market distortions and ineffectiveness, create a market economic 
environment based on fair competition for the various kinds of 
main players in economic activities (including special interest 
groups and general interest groups), and bring the role of the 
market economy into the fullest play. 
To oppose corruption, we must not rely on launching mass 
movements. 
  Anticorruption is an institutional upgrading activity. It 
needs careful planning, organization, and implementation. To 
combat corruption, we must not rely on launching mass movements, 
or turn anticorruption into a political movement, because a mass 
movement or a political movement cannot remove the institutional 
roots of corruption, or remedy institutional defects, and is 
bound to lead to either confusion or disturbance. 
Anticorruption is an institutional reform in the genuine sense. 
The road to the most successful institutional reform is one of 
active reform progressing step by step. 
  Institutional upgrading needs to bring the "superiority of 
achieving development at a later date" of the countries starting 
modernization later than others and the leading role of the 
central government into play, achieve institutional upgrading at 
relatively less cost and higher speed, and wipe out, once and 
for all, the conditions breeding corruption. As a latecomer to 
modernization and modern market economy, China can learn from 
and use for reference the experiences in institutional upgrading 
which have taken hundreds of years for developed countries to 
achieve at a high price, including institutional framework, 
economic systems, and legal standardization. This is the 
so-called "superiority of achieving development at a later date." 
  With the government playing a leading role and the help of 
the superiority of achieving development at a later date, it is 
possible for China to lower the economic rents in the various 
aspects of endeavor and check the vicious expansion of 
corruption by carrying out market-oriented reform in a 
relatively short time, say, two or three years, and, further, to 
roughly establish the framework of the socialist market economic 
system in a relatively short time, say, 10 years or a little 
longer. 
We Do Not Oppose the Use of Ethical Restraining 
Forces. 
  Finally, what needs pointing out is that we favor curing 
corruption permanently by institutional upgrading. However, 
this does not mean excluding and opposing the use of ethical 
restraining forces but, on the contrary, they must be 
strengthened and fully used. The following major reform 
measures to be taken are all based on this idea. At the same 
time, consideration has also been given to short- and long-term 
measures. Some measures can be gradually put into effect in the 
short term and some take a relatively long time to implement. 
<H3>  V. Suggestions for Major Institutional Upgrading Measures 
To Cure Corruption Permanently </H3>
  1. Liberalize interest rates and make them market oriented. 
Capital is the most sought after element of production and, 
while capital is the source of economic growth, it can become a 
bottleneck for economic expansion. In a market economy, 
"everybody is equal before interest rates." This is one of the 
basic conditions for the main players in economic activities of 
all types to enjoy fair competition and economic freedom. 
Interest rates are the use price of funds and reflect the 
relationship between fund supply and demand. For many years, 
state-owned banks have pursued official interest rates in some 
enterprises (mainly state-owned enterprises) and market interest 
rates among some other enterprises (mainly nonstate-owned 
enterprises). Moreover, they gave "preferential treatment" to 
the former in the form of a loan quota ration and employed 
"discriminatory treatment" to the latter. 
This is the typical way of doing things based on the "theory 
of the unique importance of class origin," a method which 
violates the principle of fair competition in the market 
economy. It is one of the main causes for the distortions in the 
funds market and the large-scale rent-seeking activities. 
Moreover, the current banking and financial activities are 
basically directed by administrative orders. Under the pressure 
of political groups, the banks grant "political background" 
loans and governments at all level directly interfere in the 
banks' loan business. The basic line of thinking on cracking 
the crux of this problem is to turn the "double track" interest 
rate system to a "single track" market interest rate system, 
liberalize interest rates, relax the restrictions on loan 
quotas, forbid the pursuance of discriminatory or preferential 
interests rates toward any enterprises, let "everybody be equal 
before interest rates," and grant financial discounts and 
subsidies to loans used by such sectors as agriculture, energy, 
and telecommunications. For this purpose, we suggest: 
Pursue the idea that "everybody is equal before interest 
rate." 
  --Pursuing market interest rates and abolishing official 
interest rates. Savings interest and loan interest rates should 
fluctuate side by side. Commercial banks are entitled to decide 
their own interest rate levels. Government organizations are 
not entitled to issue mandatory orders on loan and interest rate 
levels to commercial banks. Interest rates can be liberalized 
in two steps: First, official interest rates can be increased 
gradually and oriented to market interest rates and restrictions 
on loan quotas can be relaxed gradually and, second, interest 
rates can be oriented to the market and restrictions on loan 
quotas can be lifted. 
  --Promoting development of commercial banks and interbank 
fair competition. We should lift the restrictions on bank 
businesses (including regional and trade restrictions), allow 
the development of nongovernmental commercial banks and the 
participation of foreign commercial banks in competition in the 
domestic market, eliminate the restrictions on the free 
participation of financial enterprises in such competition, and 
let relevant departments be in charge of examining and approving 
the qualifications of enterprises to engage in financial 
activities. Several major specialized banks are still occupying 
a monopoly position. They should be divided into smaller banks 
and encouraged to compete with one another in accordance with a 
fair competition mechanism. 
  --Pursuing mortgages on assets (funds) in enterprise 
lending. 
Mortgage loans are extended to enterprises, which use 50 to 75 
percent of their funds (circulating funds plus fixed assets) as 
pledges, according to their types (production enterprises and 
enterprises engaged in circulation) and the degree of their 
creditability. Once enterprises default on their loan 
repayments or their assets are less than their debts, they will 
be confiscated and sold by public auction by the banks. 
  --Granting loans to agriculture, communications and 
transport, energy, telecommunications, and other basic 
industries and giving them government financial discounts and 
subsidies to promote their development. Some of the 
help-the-poor funds of the poverty- stricken areas should be 
changed into financial discounts and subsidies to help the areas 
develop their economies. 
Abolish exclusive state control in foreign trade and turn 
down trade barriers. 
  2. Since customs tariff rates were cut, nontariff trade 
barriers were removed, and the reform of exclusive state control 
in foreign trade was introduced, the Chinese economy has rapidly 
become more market-oriented and the market orientation index has 
increased from 25 percent in 1979 to 63 percent in 1992. 
Nevertheless, China's foreign trade structure, in particular 
its import structure, still conspicuously retains the 
characteristics of the planned economy, such as exclusive state 
control in foreign trade, import licensing and control, high 
customs duties, and export control. These ways of doing things 
are, in fact, protection by the government of the interests of a 
small number of interest groups and some producers at the 
expense of the interests of the whole and the consumers. They 
have hindered the overall liberalization [kai fang 7030 2397] of 
the Chinese economy and thus are detrimental to promoting the 
free flow of production elements and both domestic and 
international competition. Therefore, it is increasingly urgent 
to reform the foreign trade structure, in particular the import 
structure. It is also the only way of reducing and eliminating 
the economic rents brought about by the structure. For this 
purpose, we suggest: 
  --Lowering customs duty rates by a wide margin and 
eliminating nontariff import restrictions; scrapping the import 
licensing of major commodities, lifting administrative controls 
over imported commodities, and simplifying customs duties; and 
terminating various localities' power of tariff concession, 
which should go to the central government. 
  --Eliminating exclusive state control in foreign trade, 
empowering enterprises of all types to directly import and 
export, treating state-owned and nonstate-owned enterprises 
equally without discrimination, with the relevant departments in 
charge of enterprises' import and export qualifications, and 
auctioning the import approval documents for major commodities. 
  --Lifting restrictions over the operation by foreign capital 
of such industries as commerce, trade, banking, insurance, 
communications and transport, post and telecommunications, real 
estate, and tourism, and boosting the competitiveness of the 
tertiary industry at home. 
  --Removing controls over foreign exchange and gradually 
establish a floating exchange rate system to make the renminbi a 
freely convertible currency and promote the internationalization 
of the Chinese economy. 
  --Gradually using international market commodity prices and 
establishing links between international and domestic markets. 
  --Pursuing an appropriate, protective policy toward 
agriculture and infantile industries at home but a more liberal 
policy toward car, petrochemical, and other monopolistic 
industries. 
Put monopoly under strict control and promote fair 
competition. 
  3. Put monopoly under strict control and ensure that 
enterprises of various types and localities compete with one 
another on a free and fair basis. 
  Competition is the core of the market economy and also a 
motive force in economic development. However, the market 
economy does not operate in a vacuum, with competition going 
unregulated. One of the important government functions in the 
market economy is to set "regulations" for competition through 
policies and laws; create an environment of fair, open, and just 
competition for the main players in economic activities; and 
ensure the effective operation of the market economy. 
Antimonopoly is interference by the government in the 
incomplete market competition. It is achieved by enacting a set 
of laws with which to standardize and restrict enterprise 
behavior such as monopolizing the market and forbidding 
enterprises from taking irregular actions to compete. The 
formation of monopoly has many factors, including product 
difference, superior cost, and the rate of economic returns. 
The most important reason is institutional hindrance. To put 
it another way, the system has restricted other manufactures and 
business people and the element of recourse from getting free 
access to the markets for certain professions and trades. If 
the market is open and allows fair competition, those who corner 
it have to engage in a fierce competition with other 
manufacturers and business people who have free access to the 
market, their monopolist profits will gradually disappear. To 
prevent monopoly operations and ensure fair competition, we 
suggest: 
  --Enacting an antimonopoly law as soon as possible to curb 
monopoly, unfair competition, and the conspiratorial actions of 
a small number of enterprises and reorganizing and disbanding 
some monopoly organizations and enterprises, in particular, 
companies or trade companies with exclusive control over certain 
industries which must be divided into more than two companies so 
that they will compete with each other. 
  --With the exception of a small number of public trades 
(such 
as water supply, electricity supply, gas supply, and post and 
telecommunications) and the military industry, most trades will 
not restrict enterprises engaged in other trades from having 
free access to the market and set up manmade barriers to the 
market. Companies are prohibited from monopolizing public and 
service trades (such as communications and transport, 
telecommunications and telephone, insurance, and broadcasting 
and television). The government should exercise the necessary 
economic controls and impose restrictions on their prices, 
product varieties, and the conditions of market access. 
--Prohibiting the adoption of means other than efficiency 
competition to compete, such as preferential interest rates and 
franchised operations. 
  --Accelerating the transformation of various industrial 
departments and companies from monopoly to fair competition in 
their sectors and the transformation from the control of 
state-owend enterprises to the industrial management of 
state-owned enterprises and nonstate-owned enterprises and from 
administrative departments to trade associations. 
Market unity helps break regional confinement. 
  --Reaffirming the principle of separating finance and 
industry and preventing the convergence of financial monopoly 
and industrial monopoly; implementing the provision made by the 
Central Committee and the State Council on 28 July 1989 that 
trust investment companies and other financial institutions are 
prohibited from directly running nonfinancial enterprises and 
those which have been set up should be separated in terms of 
functions within the specified time. The operational scope and 
funds of the abovementioned companies should be reassessed so 
that finance and investment are separated. 
  --Abolishing various kinds of preferential policies and tax 
concessions, including the multifarious practices in violation 
of fair competition adopted by the special economic zones, 
development zones, cities enjoying provincial status in the 
state plan, and companies whose development plans are listed 
separately in the state plan. 
  --Breaking down market barriers set up by different regions, 
ensuring the free flow of production elements, and establishing 
a single domestic market.

Conditions Analysis Group: "Creating New Systems To Eradicate 
Corruption Once and For All (Part Three of Three)"] 
  [Text] 4. Party and government organizations should be 
strictly forbidden to engage in business activities. With "the 
administration maintained by regular revenue," the high salary 
system for bureaucrats should be introduced. 
  Whether or not officials should live on government pay or 
should "do business" or be allowed to "earn extra income" is a 
controversial issue. 
  We believe officials should only live on government pay. 
They should never be allowed to "do business" or "earn extra 
income" under any pretext. It is imperative to "maintain the 
administration with regular revenue." "Maintaining the 
administration with regular revenue" means the government 
collecting compulsory taxes and then paying the salaries of 
government officials and other personnel in the form of fiscal 
outlay. In developed industrialized countries, this pay is 
considered "bureaucratic pay" and a "high salary system" is in 
operation. Normally, the average bureaucratic pay scale offered 
by the public sector is higher than, or equivalent to, the 
average pay scale offered by the private sector. The pay scale 
for central government officials is even higher, because more 
skills, higher educational qualifications, and richer experience 
are required of these officials than employees in the private 
sector. On the one hand, the high salary system conforms to the 
theory of human capital investment returns and attracts a 
constant flow of outstanding members of society into the 
government bureaucracy to help improve the quality of that 
bureaucracy. On the other hand, "high salaries foster honesty 
in official conduct." When bureaucrats enjoy relatively 
handsome and stable salary income and decent living standards, 
the temporary gain obtained through corruption and embezzlement 
will have to be greater in order to make it worthwhile because 
of the risk of losing the income of "bureaucratic salaries" for 
ever. This will check the impulse for corruption among 
bureaucrats to a great extent but if the low salary system is 
operating, it will cause many outstanding members of the 
bureaucracy to leave and the quality of the bureaucracy to go 
down. On the other hand, because the officials are paid less 
than their human capital input and the worth of the work they 
contribute, they will certainly seek illegal means of income to 
obtain new self-compensation. All kinds of practices to "make 
extra money by official means," with or without disguise, are a 
form of legally acceptable compensation; while seeking personal 
gain by abuse of power is another form of compensation, which is 
illegal. There is no essential difference between the two and 
both practices give officials a strong rent-seeking incentive 
[xun zu ji li 1416 4436 3423 0536]. Some scholars believe that 
being in a relative state of pauperism has left the social 
status of party and government cadres in a polarized state and 
the highest political status and lowest economic status 
necessarily induce the impulse of party and government cadres to 
compare their incomes with others and pursue high income for the 
sake of a mental equilibrium. Therefore, one can say that low 
salaries necessarily arouse party and government officials' 
impulse for corruption. What needs elucidation here is that, at 
the moment, officials are under the low salary system on the one 
hand and, on the other, are enjoying "hidden incomes," such as 
invisible housing subsidies and entitlement to transport in 
exclusive cars and aircraft. With the ill-defined public and 
private incomes and ambiguous rules and regulations, many 
officials have learned to "hitchhike." The openness of the 
administration [shi zheng 1395 2398], the clarity of the regime, 
and the well-defined demarcation between the public and the 
private will reduce the incidence of "hitchhikes" and to some 
extent check corruption among officials. For this purpose, we 
offer the following suggestions: 
  --We should introduce a high salary system for bureaucrats 
and significantly raise the average pay scale for cadres in 
government organs, so that it is higher than the average wage 
level for workers in the whole country and reaches or exceeds 
the middle income level. The average pay scale for cadres in the 
central government organs should be even higher. The pay scale 
for cadres at and above the level of ministers should be 
equivalent to the high income scale and should be decided and 
announced by the National People's Congress Standing Committee 
on a yearly basis. 
  --All kinds of invisible subsidies granted to officials, 
such 
as housing subsidy, car subsidy, and medical and medicine 
subsidy, should be scrapped and directly included in their 
salaries. All the special supply avenues and special services 
at preferential rates or free gratis should be removed. 
  The incomes and properties of officials should be made 
transparent. They should collect all income by producing their 
ID cards. The incomes collected should be transferred, paid, 
recorded, and monitored by the bank, step by step. In the 
meantime, they should deliver personal income tax and property 
tax according to law. When necessary, the incomes, properties, 
and tax payments of leaders can be publicized from time to time. 
The judicial and tax authorities are entitled to verify and 
examine them. 
  --It is necessary to reduce the number of levels of 
government administration and the size of staff, which should be 
cut by at least one-third. The administrative organs at the 
prefectural level should be removed. All industrial ministries 
and their subordinate regional industrial bureaus should be 
replaced with trade societies. The trade societies, whose role 
it is to strengthen the ties between enterprises in specific 
trades and the government, constitute a third control mechanism 
besides the market mechanism and state intervention. While they 
represent the interests of their own trades and influence the 
government policymaking and legislation, they also bear the 
responsibility to support the government's formulation of 
macropolicies. 
  Party and government organs should be strictly prohibited 
from engaging in business and running any kind of company. All 
existing companies should be disconnected from their parent 
organs. Activities for "making extra money" organized by 
government organs and various kinds of nonprofit institutions in 
all sorts of names should not be encouraged. 
  --Cadres at and above the level of provincial or ministry 
leaders cannot assume full- or part-time positions in any type 
of companies after retiring from their official positions or 
their work. 
  --The children of high-ranking cadres should be firmly 
prohibited from engaging in business. The decision made by the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council on 28 July 1989 
should be reiterated, that is: The spouses, children, and 
children's spouses of the members of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and Secretariat and of the members of the State 
Council standing conferences [chang wu hui yi 1603 0523 2585 
6231] may not engage in business activities in the circulation 
field and may not take up full- or part-time posts in companies 
in the circulation field. This stipulation should apply to the 
spouses, children, and children's spouses of retired CPC Central 
Committee and State Council leaders. 
  What needs to be explained here is that, even with the 
introduction of the high salary system for bureaucrats, a small 
number of officials may still become corrupt and they will not 
be satisfied with just 80,000 yuan or 100,000 yuan. They must 
be punished and sternly handled according to law. 
  5. The Army should be strictly forbidden to engage in 
business and it is necessary to "maintain the Army with regular 
revenue." 
  Whether the Army should feed on the revenue or "engage in 
business" is not a question for debate in a modern country. But 
it has been a controversial point in China. 
  We believe the Army should only feed on the revenue and 
should never "engage in business." It is necessary to "maintain 
the Army with regular revenue." National defense belongs to 
public goods that cannot be divided up or sold on the market. 
It must be provided by the government (mainly the central 
government). In a modern country, the government should provide 
public goods, especially national defense expenditures, through 
public spending with compulsory taxation. "Maintaining the Army 
with regular revenue" is an international practice. The 
international experience indicates that to allow the Army to 
engage in business means giving the "green light" to corruption 
in the Army. 
  Since the beginning of the 1980's, the Chinese Army has been 
deeply involved in large-scale business activities. It has gone 
so far that at present, all the three armed services, the 
General Staff Headquarters, the General Political Department, 
the General Logistics Department, all field armies, and all 
provincial military districts are, without exception, involved 
in running companies and making extra money to compensate for 
the serious shortages in the military budget. As a result, the 
commercialization, localization, and corruption of the armed 
forces has accelerated. Cadres in the Army have been quite 
critical of this but the central financial power is very low. 
Though China's GNP has more than doubled since 1978, it is 
still incapable of feeding an army of 3 million. The central 
government, unable to do anything about it, keeps asking the 
Army to hold out and allows it to engage in business and find 
unofficial sources of income. This is a sign of serious neglect 
of duty on the part of the central government and a very 
shortsighted measure that could destroy the Great Wall and sow a 
seed of turbulence and unrest for the future China. Some 
leaders became aware of the severity of this problem a long time 
ago and do not agree with these practices. In view of this, we 
would like to offer the following suggestions: 
  --The army should be strictly forbidden to engage in 
business. All kinds of companies owned or co-owned by the army, 
including the army's own farms, should all be removed and their 
assets transferred or auctioned off. The Army should not take 
part in any kind of profitmaking economic activities of 
localities and the troops stationed in a place may not accept 
any kind of donations, contributions, or living subsidies from 
local authorities. 
  --It is necessary to raise military expenditure by a big 
margin and "maintain the Army with regular revenue." The 
ability of the central treasury to absorb revenue must be 
energetically improved to feed the Army, then the police, and 
finally, officials and professors. All military expenditure 
should come from allocations by the government treasury which 
should cover the spending on routine army operations in 
peacetime, i.e., ensuring that the growth rate of the actual 
income of army personnel is slightly higher than that of the 
average income of the residents in the whole country; ensuring 
the maintenance of weaponry and equipment; accelerating 
depreciation compensation; updating equipment; covering the 
expenses of combat training; and making up for the shortages in 
military funds by way of special withdrawals during wartime. 
  The measure of "maintaining the Army with regular revenue" 
can be implemented in two stages. The first stage is 
"maintaining the regular army with regular revenue," i.e., 
strictly banning business activities in field armies and navy 
and air force combat units, which should be maintained with 
central government funding. The second stage is a strict ban on 
business activities in the whole army, which can be called 
"maintaining the whole army with regular revenue." In our 
opinion, even if it means having to invest in fewer big projects 
and cut several hundred development zones, we should still 
maintain the Army. In fact, the phenomenon of "relaxation" in 
China's taxation system is serious and a large amount of tax is 
uncollected. In 1992, the percentage of revenue in the GNP of 
Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces was, shockingly, only 8.3 percent 
and 9 percent respectively. Taxation is like squeezing a sponge 
and the water (money) can be squeezed out by strict tax 
collection to compensate the serious shortage of military 
expenditure. 
  --Some of the national defense public goods can be produced 
by the market. As one of the most important public goods, 
national defense must be provided by the central government. 
However, some of the national defense public goods, such as 
army provisions and foodstuffs, medicines and medical apparatus, 
military uniforms and military supplies, airports, roads, some 
buildings, equipment and instruments can be produced by the 
market and manufacturers. The military can place orders for 
competitive bidding and the manufacturers produce the requested 
products, so the Army does not have to be "self-sufficient" and 
take care of everything it needs. The General Logistics 
Department is just a big buyer and decides what to buy from the 
market, rather than what to produce, except for facilities and 
equipment which involve military secrets. It is most effective 
to let the market produce some national defense goods and it 
will also save a considerable amount of management spending and 
national defense expenditure. 
  --Most of the ordnance industry enterprises should be 
separated from the system of the regular armed forces to reduce 
the size of the noncombatant elements of the army. Only an 
extremely small number of core enterprises in the ordnance 
industry having high security ratings can be kept. The 
scientific research units in the ordnance industry should follow 
suit. A ministry of ordnance industry should be formed on the 
basis of the State Commission of Science, Technology, and 
Industry for National Defense, reporting to the State Council. 
It should specialize in the development and production of 
weapons and equipment and enter into a buyer-seller relationship 
with the military. The new mode in the context of the market 
economy in future is that the central government provides money 
to maintain the Army, the military places orders for goods, and 
the ministry of ordnance industry produces the goods. As to 
equipment other than weaponry, the military can invite bidding 
from society at large and place orders with the winner. 
  --The tasks of the Army should be redefined and nonmilitary 
expenditures which pose a burden on the Army should be cut down. 
In the revolutionary period, the Army played multiple roles and 
had to perform various functions. The army was not only a 
combat force but also a production force. Under the objective 
circumstances of that time, the Army would not have been able to 
survive if they had not "used their own hands and supplied 
themselves with ample food and clothing." But, in modern 
society, it is inappropriate to give the Army too many 
functions, too much responsibility, and too heavy a burden. Its 
important function is protection of national defense. It is a 
combat force but not a production force. An army is an army. 
It is not an industrial army nor the main body of economic 
operations. It should not take part in any market economic 
activities, such as market-oriented productive activities and 
operations, let alone activities that make staggering profits or 
illegal activities, such as smuggling cars, reselling arms and 
ammunitions at a profit, running deluxe hotels, and speculating 
in real estate. It should not participate in local economic 
construction as unpaid or cheap labor, which poses additional 
financial burden on the Army and undermines the Army's spending 
on military training. It should not undertake social service 
functions, such as running nurseries, primary and middle schools 
(except on islands and military bases), shops, post offices, and 
community compounds. Naturally, however, helping with rescue 
operations and relief provisions during natural calamities is 
one of the functions of the Army and this is true with the armed 
forces of all countries. This is one public service that the 
Army renders to the society on behalf of the government. This 
service does not cost the society anything but the government 
must give the Army appropriate compensation out of disaster 
relief expenditure. 
  Of the abovementioned five major reform measures, the last 
two demand the consumption of large amounts of government 
resources and the premise to them is to enhance the state's 
ability to absorb revenue, i.e., raising the percentage of the 
government revenue in the GNP and raising the percentage of the 
central government's income in the total treasury revenue. The 
second and third recommendations for the structural reforms do 
not require the consumption of large amounts of government 
resources and will only cause a certain reduction in the tariff 
revenue. But, because they will stimulate technical importation 
and promote the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, greater 
benefits can be obtained. By breaking trade monopolies and 
ensuring fair competition, the social transaction costs can be 
greatly lowered. The first reform measure will bring 
considerable returns. When the credit interest rate is closing 
ranks with the market interest rate and bringing huge profits 
for commercial banks, the government can obtain a rather large 
amount of resources through such avenues as profit and tax 
collection. 
  Whether or not we can put an end to corruption is a 
yardstick 
of whether or not a political system is institutionalized and 
efficient. We believe that eradication of corruption by 
creating new systems depends not only on the progress of the 
economic structural reform but also on the progress of the 
political structural reform and the development of socialist 
democracy and politics. In view of the fact that China's 
political development is lagging behind economic development and 
the political structural reform is lagging behind the economic 
structural reform, carrying out the political structural reform 
in a vigorous and steady manner should be the key point in the 
design of reform proposals for the next stage. This will 
involve other major reform measures, such as the division and 
balance of political power; the division and definition of 
political functions (including those of the central government 
and local governments); the streamlining and reorganization of 
government organs; introduction of the civil service system and 
improvement in the quality of officials; strengthening of the 
supervision system and formulating "dogmas"; strengthening of 
the judicial system and its independence; improvement of the 
legal system and related rules and regulations; and 
materialization of the role of media supervision. 
<H5>  Postscript </H5>
  What is most worrying is that corruption has become the 
greatest social pollutant in today's China. It is the most 
likely element which can ruin all the achievements made so far 
in China's reform and opening up, terminate China's economic 
takeoff, and delay China's modernization process. This is the 
ultimate reason why we wrote this report. This report is not 
commissioned or sponsored by any organization and is purely a 
product of the conscience of Chinese intellectuals and their 
concern for the long-term interests of the Chinese nation. 
  Obviously, the legitimacy of the third-generation leadership 
lies in whether or not they have the courage to combat 
corruption, whether or not they show efficiency in combating 
corruption, and whether or not they will truly honor their 
promise to a population of over 1 billion. The people are 
watching! The people are waiting! The people are making a 
choice! 
  This report sets forth an important approach to the 
eradication of corruption by way of creating new systems and a 
tentative package of five major measures for making innovations 
in the systems. We are fully aware that each of these major 
measures directly touches some special interest groups and will 
bring adjustments to the existing interest pattern. Regarding 
special interest groups, we should recognize them, restrict 
them, and standardize them. Naturally, however, the 
anticorruption operation, be it an institutional one or an 
ethical one, is bound to encounter opposition and obstruction 
from various quarters. Nevertheless, the anticorruption 
operation is now like a "boat sailing against the current which 
must forge ahead or it will be driven back." 
  To think about what others are unwilling to think about and 
to say what others dare not say is one of the signs of maturity 
of the new generation of Chinese intellectuals. In this report 
on the national conditions, we look at the worst possibility and 
sound a warning about the worst possible result: If we fail to 
check the ever-deteriorating corruption tendencies, the 
Communist Party may break down, not because of external factors, 
but because of an internal factor, namely, institutional 
corruption, thus once again terminating China's modernization 
process. As China's scientists, we do not wish to become 
successful prophets and are willing to make unremitting and 
painstaking efforts to stop this worst possibility from coming 
true. 
  We wrote this report with heavy hearts. Being concerned 
about the country and the people is the nature of Chinese 
intellectuals. As early as over 2,000 years ago, Confucius said: 
"Scholars are bent on the Great Way." His disciple Zeng Can 
developed and enhanced this idea of his, saying: "A scholar 
cannot be without breadth of vision and vigorous endurance. His 
burden is heavy and his course long. Perfect virtue is the 
burden which he considers it is his to sustain -- is it not 
heavy?! Only with death does his course stop -- is it not 
long?!" We are fully aware of the arduousness of our mission 
and the length of our course but, we have no choice! The 
challenge facing the Chinese nation is extremely grim and the 
development opportunity we have is almost the last one and there 
is only one way out left for us. Seeking development through 
reforms and ensuring the success of reforms by combating 
corruption is the road that China must take in its effort to 
become a strong nation in the world.

<F P=106> ["Cover Story" by Chen Chia-yao (7115 0857 5069): </F>
"Supergroup Produces Pirated Laser Discs"-- first five 
paragraphs are YI CHOU KAN introduction] 
  [Text] The famous Xianke [0341 4430] Group in Shenzhen has 
very powerful backing and was once given a lot of support by Li 
Peng. It is the only manufacturer of laser discs in the whole 
country. 
  Ye Huaming [0673 5478 2494], chairman of the board of the 
company, is the son of Ye Ting [0673 2185], an early-day CPC 
leader. He worked in the national defense sector for many years. 
  According to the findings of YI CHOU KAN, Xianke uses its 
sophisticated equipment to produce laser discs without copyright 
for Hong Kong manufacturers, provided that the Hong Kong 
manufacturer produces a document claiming that it holds the 
copyright. Xianke can also undertake commissioned sales through 
its massive distribution network. 
  A staff member of the factory said: Because Xianke "has a 
backer in the central government," it is not afraid to do this! 
  However, at a formal interview with this reporter, Xianke's 
general manager denied it. 
  The car comes to a crossroads and the buildings of Xianke 
Laser Group can be seen from a distance. Making the company 
worthy of its reputation, the building is tall and imposing, 
with a chic exterior design. A huge triangular logo on the wall 
gives the air of a large sophisticated factory. 
  This factory has very powerful backing. Ye Huaming, chairman 
of the board, is the son of Ye Ting, one of the early-day CPC 
leaders, and a foster son of CPC Marshal Nie Rongzhen. He has 
been like a "brother" with Li Peng and the two of them played 
together until they grew up. His real brother, Ye Zhengda [0673 
2973 1129], holds a high position in the Commission of Science, 
Technology, and Industry for National Defense, an organization 
with a mysterious background. 
  At the moment, there is only one company in the whole of 
China capable of producing laser discs and that is Xianke. This 
is why Deng Xiaoping also inspected this factory during his tour 
of southern China in 1992. 
  But recently there has been some information claiming that 
Xianke is producing laser discs that have no official copyright 
for foreign firms and is also distributing them on a commission 
basis. 
<H5>  We Cannot Make Pirated Copies </H5>
  To verify this matter this reporter, in the name of a 
company, went to Xianke's operation department and, without 
beating about the bush, told them that he wanted to have a batch 
of laser discs "without copyright" produced. 
  "We are a newly founded company in Hong Kong. We want to 
have some laser discs made for sale in Southeast Asia but we do 
not have the copyright for these laser discs. We want to have 
them pirated. Is it possible?" 
  "This is impossible. We cannot do this!" he shook his head 
and said. Then quickly he added: "We have a big name (company 
reputation). We cannot do these things. We cannot take the 
responsibility!" The person who received this reporter was a 
Mr. Zhu [2612], manager of the operations department of Xianke 
Company. 
  He sat down and took a good puff at his cigarette. He slowly 
blew the smoke out and his tone changed. "But, as long as you 
have a proof of copyright, we do not care (about the rest of the 
matter)." 
  "We want to copy laser discs but we just do not have any 
copyright proof." 
<H3>  There Are Over-the-Table and Under-the-Table Copyright 
Proofs </H3>
  "This can be done either on the table or under the table. On 
the table, our company cannot do this kind of business. But 
under the table, we can pretend we know nothing about it and 
process products with imported materials to order," he 
whispered, his hand covering half of his mouth. 
  "What I am saying is, though we know it is pirating, we will 
not take the responsibility. Do you get the point?" 
  He then added: "We know nothing about your company and 
probably cannot find out where you are at all. We also do not 
know if your company exists or not. But we do not care about 
this. As long as you give us a written claim to copyright, 
stamped with your company seal, it is okay." 
  "Is it really okay, even if we do not hold the copyright of 
the laser discs?" this reporter asked again. 
  "Of course it is okay. Our company does not care whether or 
not you really hold the copyright of the programs on the master 
discs. We are only responsible for processing imported materials 
and do not worry about anything else," he emphasized. 
  "If you write a proof of copyright, stamped with your seal, 
sign a contract with us, and pay a 50 percent down payment, we 
will deliver the goods at the agreed time." 
<H5>  Taking Care of Everything Concerning the Job </H5>
  It takes only around two weeks from placing an order to the 
delivery of goods, he said. As business is good at the moment, 
the order books are full till March. For this reason, an order 
must be placed as quickly as possible. 
  He patiently explained to this reporter the calculations for 
every section. An order for at least 3,000 copies should be 
placed each time because the production cost for each piece is 
128 yuan. The price is negotiable for mass production and could 
be 120 yuan for an order of 5,000 copies. 
  "Can a disc purchased from a shop be reproduced?" 
  "Sure, so long as the laser disc is original, of good 
quality, and not a reproduction. We can find someone to make a 
master copy." 
  "Where can it be made?" 
  "You don't have to bother about that. We can find some 
friends locally or figures from high-tech companies in other 
provinces. A master tape can be made in a week or so at the 
price of HK$40,000 to HK$50,000 (Hong Kong dollars)." 
  "What about the cover and package?" 
  "We can make the covers for five yuan each. The 
reproduction, which includes the trade mark such as Polygram, 
Fitto, and patterns, will be exactly the same as the original." 
He explained with a smile: "If the reproduced copies are sold 
with the original ones, no one will be able to distinguish the 
original from the reproduced ones." 
  He also proposed reproducing from Fitto rather than Polygram 
because management of the latter was stricter than the former. 
Our request to reproduce songs from different discs could also 
be met. 
<H5>  Willing to Sell 1,000 Copies for Us </H5>
  "An order for Karaoke discs is generally 3,000 copies. We 
can sell 1,000 for you in the domestic market." 
  "Where would you sell them." 
  "You do not have to worry about that. We have connections 
with a number of provinces, including Karaoke boxes, commercial 
arcades, and shops." 
  He said that production of a film disc is the same as that 
of 
a Karaoke disc. As the market for film discs is limited, they 
usually receive orders for 1,000 each. 
<H5>  Delivery of Goods is Safer in Macao </H5>
  "When the discs are reproduced, where will they be 
delivered?" 
  "The goods are delivered in Shenzhen. You have to go through 
the customs and that is not our responsibility." He said, after 
some hesitation: "It will probably be rather difficult to go 
through the Hong Kong customs. The companies which have placed 
orders in the past have usually left from Macao because the 
customs there can be easily passed without trouble. When the 
goods arrive in Macao, they can be shipped directly to Southeast 
Asia, bypassing Hong Kong customs." 
  "Upon your request, we can deliver the goods to Zhuhai but 
you will still have to go through customs in Macao." 
<H5>  More Pirated Laser Discs Are Finding Their Way into Hong Kong </H5>
  The number of pirated karaoke laser discs impounded by 
Hong Kong Customs has been rising. Early this month 6,000 laser 
discs worth $3 million were seized; 10,000 were seized late last 
year. 
  Pun Yeung-kong, Custom's Bureau of Copyright and Trademark 
Investigation chief, said these laser discs came from Southeast 
Asia, Taiwan, and South Korea. There were no indications of 
massive inflows of pirated mainland discs into Hong Kong, 
although he could not rule out the possibility that crafty 
merchants sold pirated discs overseas via Macao before they were 
imported into Hong Kong, trying to divert attention through this 
tortuous route. 
  He said Hong Kong Customs has obtained some information on 
illegal laser and compact disc copying by mainland factories and 
has provided such information to mainland customs. But it is 
not for the Hong Kong Customs to decide how this matter should 
be handled. 
<H3>  Matters Are Made Easier with Connections Within Beijing's 
Officialdom </H3>
  By this time the manager was obviously in high spirits. This 
reporter asked him: "You must have invested quite a lot for 
such an operation?" 
  "We sank about 7 to 8 billion yuan into it!" said the 
manager, taking a company manual from a cabinet. "We are the 
only one capable of making laser discs and laser disc players in 
the mainland. Look! Deng Xiaoping visited us on his southern 
inspection tour... Li Peng, Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Zou 
Jiahua -- all of them have visited us." 
  He said with glee: "Our president is Mr Ye Huaming, Ye 
Ting's son." 
  "Has being in this business ever worried you?" 
  "No, we have connections in Beijing. Matters are made easier 
with connections within Beijing officialdom!" Then he lowered 
his voice whispered: "Hurry up if you want to place an order. 
We've heard that the central authorities are going to hit hard 
on copyright piracy. Things might not be as good then and we 
may have to stand watching the money flow passing us by." 
  He said Xianke has high productive forces, annually 
churning out 5 million compact discs and possibly 1.5 million 
laser discs. The output is quite astounding. 
  During this reporter's "business conversation" with the 
manager, he screened a Hong Kong production "Moonlight in Tsim 
Sa Tsui East" for the reporter, saying his company owned the 
copyright of this movie. But according to the producer of this 
movie, Cheung Kuen, the movie had never been distributed in the 
mainland, much less selling the copyright to Xianke. 
  Investigations show that Ye Huaming is closely connected 
with 
the National Defense Ministry. He himself worked in its Fifth 
Research Department for many years. The research department was 
founded by his foster father, Nie Rongzhen. 
<H5>  Hailed By the National Defense Sector </H5>
  Ye Huaming's brother, Ye Zhengda, has also worked in the 
national defense sector for many years. He is now deputy 
director of the Science and Technology Committee of the 
Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National 
Defense. 
  Ye Huaming and Li Peng are both descendants of revolutionary 
martyrs but were adopted by "heavyweights" of different ranks 
(Li Peng's foster father is Zhou Enlai). They knew each other 
as boys, grew up together, and are very nice to each other. 
These "sons of Heaven" who emerged powerful at about the same 
time have formed a tight relationship network. 
<H5>  Vigorous Support From the Leadership </H5>
  For this reason, Ye Huaming has had vigorous support in the 
few years during which he has tried to make Xianke Corporation a 
success. For instance, when the corporation found the 
expenditure of importing a Phillips production line exceeded the 
budget, Ye went to Beijing to talk with Li Peng. As a result 
Xianke obtained appropriations from Beijing for its production 
line purchase. 
  Li Peng also personally attended the ribbon-cutting and 
inscription opening ceremony for Xianke. 
  There have been visits in the past few years from high level 
leaders such as Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Liu 
Huaqing, greatly enhancing its goodwill. 
<H5>  "We Will Never Be Involved in Copyright Piracy!" </H5>
  In an interview with this reporter, Tang Shaokai, Xianke 
Corporation general manager, firmly maintained that they would 
never be involved in copyright piracy and hoped to join hands 
with Hong Kong in cracking down on it. 
  "Is there truth in references overseas that your company 
accepts orders for making pirated laser discs?" 
  "We offer processing and assembly services. But we always 
demand proof of copyright, that is effective certification, 
before we accept orders. We will not accept any without such 
proof." 
  "What is effective certification?" 
  "That is the copyright has been purchased; or you have 
signed 
a copyright contract. That is, for example, this movie is a 
production of a certain film distributor. We cannot take 
manufacturing orders without such proof." 
  "If we produce a sheet of paper stating, say, we own the 
copyright of this laser disc. Will that do?" 
  "In principle, no," Tang Shaokai replied swiftly. "Why? 
Because a statement written by you cannot prove that you have 
the copyright." 
  "Does your company closely monitor processing and 
copyright?" 
  "It should be so. In general it is pretty tight," he replied 
quickly. 
  "What are your feelings and response to claims by some Hong 
Kong and overseas companies in the same industry that your 
company is taking orders to make pirated copies? 
  "Well, right now I don't quite know how to make a response. 
Under individual circumstances, it is possible that such a thing 
has happened. It is possible that the copyright proof was fake 
and we did not discover it. We only have a few people who are 
knowledgeable in this area so such a thing may have happened. 
But we will never deliberately involve ourselves in copyright 
piracy," Tang Shaokai replied. 
  He also said agitatedly: "As an entertainment company, we 
hope that the publishing firms in Hong Kong and the mainland can 
join forces. Because copyright piracy has also given us great 
pressure and made an impact. We hope that the two sides can 
come together and talk about this problem." 
<H3>  Ye Huaming Has Worked For the Ministry of National Defense 
for 20 Years </H3>
  As a child of a revolutionary martyr, Ye Huaming has 
always enjoyed special considerations ever since his early 
childhood. He was sent to study in a military aeronautical 
institute in the Soviet Union in 1953 and has worked in 
scientific research organs under the Ministry of National 
Defense for over 20 years. He came south to Shenzhen and worked 
as director of the city's Scientific Committee as early as 1983 
when Shenzhen began practicing the open-door policy. 
  Not long after he came to Shenzhen, however, Ye Huaming gave 
up his official career with the government and engaged himself 
in the enterprise sector by setting up Xianke Laser Limited. 
  An open-minded man as he is, Ye Huaming used to fiercely 
criticize the bureaucratic structure of the Shenzhen Government; 
he also believes that Shenzhen can "change" politically by 
further carrying out the political reform. 
<H5>  Hong Kong's Film Producers Suffer Heavy Losses </H5>
  A great many small-scale video-producing factories on the 
mainland are engaged in illegally reprinting large numbers of 
films produced in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's film industry is been 
very concerned about the current situation and has estimated the 
losses already incurred through piracy at hundreds of millions 
of Hong Kong dollars. Ma Feng-kuo, deputy director of the Hong 
Kong Film Industry Association, recently revealeed the 
seriousness of the matter to the Chinese authorities during his 
trip to Beijing with a delegation. 
  He said: "We have disclosed our opinions to the Ministry of 
Culture and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, telling 
them that many small factories on the mainland have been 
involved in the illegal production of video tapes and laser 
discs of Hong Kong- produced films. However, since most of 
these factories are shielded by local governments, the central 
authorities have not, till this day, been able to find effective 
measures to check such a situation." 
<H5>  Films With False Copyrights Run Rampant in Mainland China </H5>
  Holding a pile of video tape covers of pirated films, Ma 
Feng-kuo shook his head: "We have in our hands reprinted video 
tapes of at least several dozen Hong Kong-produced films, yet 
all of them have obtained both licenses and projection permits 
issued by the Ministry of Culture or by the Ministry of Radio, 
Film, and Television. However, since none of the the copyrights 
of any of these films has ever been sold to the mainland, we can 
say for sure that the copyright certificates held by the 
manufacturers of such video tapes are all false." 
  He indicated that illegally reprinted video tapes and laser 
discs of Hong Kong-produced films are circulating on the 
mainland through two channels. One is to apply for licenses 
with the Ministry of Culture or other organs by using 
counterfeit certificates of copyright so that the issuance and 
projection of pirated video tapes and discs can be "legalized," 
while the other is to illegally reproduce films in large numbers 
and then circulate them through underground channels. 
<H3>  Hong Kong Film Producers Are Faced With Losses of Hundreds 
of Millions of Hong Kong Dollars </H3>
  This huge illegal market has caused heavy losses to Hong 
Kong 
film producers. "There are tens of thousands of small-scale 
cinemas in China with moviegoers totaling hundreds of millions. 
The total sum would be enormous if one paid only 50 fen a time. 
Judging by the total number of moviegoers on the mainland, Hong 
Kong film producers are faced with losses of hundreds of 
millions of Hong Kong dollars incurred by illegal reproduction." 
  He said that, because the legal system on the mainland is 
not 
perfect and piracy is not considered a crime but a civil 
disobedience, it is very difficult to strike really severe blows 
at illegal reproduction. "It is of no use to only impose 
disciplinary sanctions. The leadership has still failed to give 
sufficient support to struggles against illegally reproduced 
films. 
  "Reproduction of films is something similar to the illegal 
reprint of banknotes. It is a pity, however, that many 
mainlanders nowadays do not consider it as being a crime." 
<H5>  Large-Scale Piracy of Karaoke Discs </H5>
  Mr. Yang, who is in charge of Polygram Records Limited 
Karaoke Discs Department, indicated that illegally reproduced 
Karaoke discs have indeed been found on the mainland. With all 
the audio and visual effects of the original versions, pirated 
discs are either intact copies or selections of original discs. 
One can find pirated discs on the mainland only three to four 
weeks after the original discs are put on sale in Hong Kong and 
the former are usually over 100 yuan cheaper than the latter. 
Things are similarly alarming on Hong Kong streets. 
  A sales department spokesman for Fitto Entertainment Company 
Limited noted that no pirated versions of discs produced by his 
company are found on the mainland and Fitto has not yet begun 
formal issuing of its discs on the mainland.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on crime, investigations, trials, sentencings, and other 
judicial- related activities in the PRC monitored by Hong Kong 
Bureau during the period 15-28 February 1994. The source and 
mode of processing are given in parentheses at the end of each 
entry. Certain reports deemed more significant may have been 
filed separately, in which case the summary will include the 
serial number of the separately filed item. 
  As evidenced by the stories listed below, during the month 
PRC crime reportage focused on corruption and common criminal 
activity. 
<H6>  INTERNATIONAL </H6>
  A German woman went on trial on 28 February in Tianjin on 
charges of trafficking nearly five kg of marijuana. Doris 
Wunsch, 37, was reportedly caught trying to board a ship to 
Japan from Tianjin on 19 July 1993 with 4.84 kg of marijuana 
concealed in a double-bottomed suitcase. 
  At the time of her arrest, Wunsch had, according to Chinese 
press reports, admitted being met in Beijing by an Austrian man 
who handed her the double-bottomed suitcase, telling her it 
contained contraband. The man, later found to be Australian, 
asked her to carry the suitcase to Japan and gave her an address 
for a second rendezvous upon arrival. The Australian reportedly 
left Beijing on 18 July. (Summary) (Hong Kong AFP in English 
0457 GMT 28 Feb 94) 
  The Guangdong Department of Public Security broke up a large 
drug-trafficking ring composed of criminals from Hong Kong, 
Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi through arrests over the last two 
months of 1993. Police arrested a total of 26 suspects, 
including three from Hong Kong, and seized 17.4 kg of heroin and 
1.2 million yuan in cash. 
  Police in Zhaoqing ran an undercover operation on 2 November 
and arrested drug traffickers from Hong Kong, as well as a local 
drug- dealer. The police recovered 16.2 kg of heroin and 
620,000 yuan in cash. Later the same day, two accomplices were 
arrested in Shenzhen and two hideouts in Zhaoqing were smashed. 
  Further raids were carried out in Yunnan, Guangxi, and 
Luoding in Guangdong, capturing the ringleader. The drug ring

the drugs were first brought in from Yunnan and transported to 
Zhaoqing in Guangdong via Guangxi for later shipment to Hong 
Kong drug dealers. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in

  A national network of over 3,000 courts protecting the 
rights 
of children under the age of 16 has been set up since the Law 
for the Protection of Minors was issued on 1 January 1992. The 
legislation seeks to abolish school dropouts, child labor, 
kidnapping, and corporal punishment. 
  Priority has been given to child kidnapping cases and the 
pornography trade. More than 8,000 infringements have been 
reported to the 24 provincial Communist Youth Leagues which have 
established child protection branches. Over 1,000 of these 
cases have been handled. 
  Li Lin, a six-year-old boy from Tianjin, sued his father and 
stepmother for beating him last August. The local child 
protection commission took up the case and three months later 
his parents were found guilty. His father was given two years 
in prison and his stepmother was sentenced to one year. 
  However, the law lacks specific rules on its implementation, 
according to Kang Suhua, professor of law at Beijing University. 
He says controversies are likely to occur. He states that some 
of the law's provisions are hard to implement in the absence of 
an established child legal system. He recommends the drafting 
of laws on handling juvenile cases and on juvenile courts as 
quickly as possible. (Summary) (Beijing CHINA DAILY in English

considered major, and the number of thefts involving property 
worth more than 2,000 yuan ($230) rose 20.2 percent over 1992.

Hebei 
  A major bribery case involving 225,000 yuan was recently 
cracked in Xingtai, Hebei Province. More than 10 criminals were 
brought to justice. 
  From November 1990 to June 1992, Guo Qingmei, director of 
the 
power workshop of the Xingtai City Silk Plant, colluded with a 
self-employed transportation businessman from Xige Village, 
Shahe City, and issued forged invoices for a total of more than 
1,700 tonnes of coal, which amounted to 220,000 yuan. When the 
auditing department discovered that the amount of coal in stock 
did not match the amount recorded in the account book, it 
contacted the procuratorial organ at once. A thorough 
investigation of their crimes were carried out. 
  The criminals confessed that they bribed the plant director, 
the deputy plant director in charge of the purchase of coal, the 
director and the deputy director of the supply section, the 
director of the finance section, the person in charge of 
weighing coal, and the coal inspector to keep their mouths shut

<F P=106> ["Deepen Reform, Accelerate Development, Score Further </F>
Achievements -- Governor Fu Xishou's Spring Festival Greetings"] 
  [Text] Comrades, friends: 
  As spring returns to the earth and news of victory 
continually pours in, we usher in the 1994 Spring Festival with 
triumphant fervor. At the jubilant moment for millions of 
households, I extend, on behalf of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, Spring Festival 
greetings to people of all nationalities, commanders and 
fighters of Liberation Army units, armed police officers and 
men, and public security cadres and policemen in Anhui; warm 
regards to comrades staying fast at their posts during the 
festival; and deep appreciation to all comrades and friends who 
have contributed to Anhui's development. 
  The past year was one in which Anhui witnessed the fastest 
and most efficient growth of its economy since the introduction 
of reform and opening up. The gross provincial product totaled 
94 billion yuan, an increase of 22 percent. We reaped a bumper 
agricultural harvest and pushed village and town enterprises to 
a new stage of development. As a result, the annual per capita 
peasant income increased 150 yuan to reach 724 yuan. Industry 
grew at a rapid pace, and high-tech and high value-added 
products increased by a big margin. Anhui's ranking of 
industries at and above the township level rose from 14th to 
12th in the country. A number of energy, transport, postal and 
telecommunications, and water conservancy projects were 
successively completed and put into operation, thereby building 
up strength for further development of the provincial economy. 
We were especially gratified with a breakthrough in enterprise 
reform. The instant success of the Maanshan Iron and Steel 
Company, the Anhui Energy Corporation, and the Meiling 
Enterprise in issuing and listing their stocks on markets 
resulted not only in the raising of over 7 billion yuan in funds 
for construction, but also the accumulation of invaluable 
experiences for establishing modern enterprises. While the 
economy was developing rapidly, we also made advances in the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization and various social 
undertakings to further consolidate political stability and 
unity. Scenes of vigorous economic growth were seen everywhere 
on both sides of the Chang Jiang and along the Huai He. Facts 
have once again borne testimony to Anhui's conditions for 
developing faster and more efficiently and to its people's 
capablility of tiding over any difficulty in their course of 
advance and of continuously pushing forward the great cause of 
rejuvenating the province. 
  This year will be very crucial for us in advancing on the 
crest of victory to deepen reform and accelerate development. 
In the coming year, we shall comprehensively implement the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and, focusing 
on the center of economic construction, pay close attention to 
three major tasks. First, we should go all out to carry out 
reform, expedite the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system, energetically promote reform of the fiscal and taxation, 
banking, investment, and foreign trade systems, and open Anhui 
wider to the outside world so as to further stimulate economic 
growth with breakthroughs in reform and opening up. Second, we 
should bring into play the spirit of tenacious struggle; push on 
in the flush of victory; exert every muscle to maintain the 
momentum of sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; 
and meticulously organize forces to accomplish the current 
provincial government's goal of "achieving vigorous growth in 
three years and scale a new height in five years" so as to scale 
a new height in Anhui's comprehensive strength. Third, we 
should implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's principle of grasping 
two links at the same time, intensifying the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization, and continually consolidating 
and developing political stability and unity so as to create a 
favorable environment for reform and construction. 
  The people's interests and happiness are the starting point 
of our work in all fields. In the course of deepening reform 
and accelerating development, party committees and governments 
at all levels should carry forward the fine traditions of 
forging close ties with the masses, paying attention to work 
methods, and improving work style so as to harness the 
enthusiasm of the masses in reform and construction. It is 
necessary to always bear in mind the immediate interests of the 
masses, protect their interests, and do everything possible to 
solve their practical problems, especially the practical 
problems of poor areas. I am convinced that, guided by the 
party's basic line and through the common effort by the people 
throughout Anhui, our cause will be invincible. 
  Looking to our bright future, the people of Anhui shoulder a

  [Text] Hefei, March 2 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province received 153,000 visitors from both at home and abroad 
last year. 
  Tourism is now one of Anhui's major industries. Most tourist 
attractions are located in the southern part of the province, 
where Huangshan and Jiuhuashan Mountains and Taiping Lake are 
located. 
  In recent years Anhui's tourism has been developing at a 
high 
speed, with more tourist spots such as crocodile ponds, and 
monkey and deer islands opened, hotels built and cableways put 
into operation. 
  In 1993 Anhui successfully held several tourism festivals, 
which were also designed for business promotion and to attract 
investment. Foreign diplomats were also invited to visit the 
tourism sites.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
biggest city, has created an industrial park especially for 
returned students to set up their own companies. 
  A spokesman for the Shanghai government said that nearly 400 
returned students have signed up investment contracts or 
tentative agreements with the Shanghai Xinxin Investment Ltd, 
which oversees the park, located at Songjiang County near 
Shanghai. 
  He said that returned students can enjoy preferential 
treatment on a range of aspects -- from paying tax to import of 
raw materials to use of land. 
  The charge on use of land is less than half that of other 
development zones, he said. 
  Currently, more returned students from Western Europe, Japan 
and the United States have expressed strong interest in 
investment here, he said.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 1 (XINHUA) -- China's most populous 
city of Shanghai is expanding its vegetable-growing areas to 
meet the increasing demand of local consumers. 
  The city's 13.49 million long-term residents consume about 
2,000 tons of vegetables a day. 
  According to Meng Jianzhu, deputy mayor of the city, 
Shanghai 
will increase the area of farmland under vegetables by 2,530 ha 
[hectares] this year, to bring the total vegetable-growing area 
to 10,000 ha. 
  According to Meng, the city plans to build a chain of 
vegetable and nonstaple-food markets and fairs, and encourage 
farmers to directly sell their products in urban areas. 
  A survey shows that the rapid expansion of urban industry 
has 
resulted in serious encroachment on farmland in recent years, 
causing shortages of vegetables in the local markets.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- In 1993, China 
witnessed a rapid growth in its foreign trade, the State 
Statistics Bureau said here today. 
  According to the bureau, the volume of exports in 1993 rose 
to 91.8 billion U.S. dollars, up 8 percent over 1992, while that 
of imports increased to 104 billion U.S. dollars, up 29 percent. 
  China had a trade surplus of 4.6 billion U.S. dollars in 
1993, if transactions of imports and exports that involved no 
payment in foreign exchange were excluded. 
  It said that the import-export structure was further 
improved 
in 1993. The share of mechanical and electronic exports rose 
while that of traditional primary products dropped. 
  There was a significant increase in the import of raw 
materials, machinery and transportation equipment, which were in 
short supply on the domestic market, it said. 
  High growth was achieved in the utilization of foreign 
capital in 1993, it said. 
  In 1993, China signed contracts involving 122.7 billion U.S. 
dollars in foreign capital, and actually used 36.77 billion U.S. 
dollars, up 76.7 percent and 91.5 percent respectively over 1992. 
  By the end of 1993, some 167,500 foreign-funded enterprises 
had registered in China, it said. 
  Furthermore, China promoted economic and technical 
cooperation with foreign countries last year. 
  Construction and labor projects contracted in 1993 totaled 
6.77 billion U.S. dollars, up 2.8 percent over 1992. The 
accomplished operational revenue reached 4.52 billion U.S. 
dollars, up 48.2 percent. 
  Meanwhile, China received 41.53 million tourists from 
abroad. 
Income in foreign exchange from tourism amounted to 4.68 billion 
U.S. dollars, up 18.7 percent over the previous year.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China's 1993 
economic and social development contains a host of figures 
showing the progress made by China in science, education, 
culture, public and sports. 
  According to the State Statistics Bureau today, in 1993 some 
246,000 contracts on technological transfers were signed, 
involving transactions valued at 20.76 billion yuan, up 4.4 and 
37.4 percent over the corresponding figures of 1992. 
  Establishment and development of technological markets 
constitute a major target China strives to attain as part of its 
economic reform program. This aims at instituting a mechanism 
for competition, protecting intellectual property, and 
commercializing scientific research results. 
  China's scientific and technological force grew in size last 
year. Financial input into scientific and technical activities 
was on the rise. The country gained 33,000 key research results 
including 781 which received state prizes. 
  Patent offices in China received 77,000 domestic and foreign 
patent applications. By the end of 1993, the state had approved 
establishment of 52 state high- and new-tech industrial 
development zones and 14,000 high- and new-tech enterprises. 
  In 1993, four more state laboratories of importance were 
completed, the bureau said. 
  1993 was also marked by expanded general high education and 
secondary vocational and technical education. 
  Progress was reported in implementing the country's 
nine-year 
compulsory education program. The enrollment rate of primary 
school-age children (seven to eleven) was 97.7 percent. 
  Adult education also experienced good development. Some 
5.482 million adults completed basic literacy courses in 1993. 
  In 1993, 154 films were made, and the number of art troupes 
reached 2,723. There were 2.795 million hospital beds and 4.117 
million full-time medical workers throughout China, including 
1.832 million doctors. 
  In 1993, Chinese athletes won 103 world champions and broke 
57 world records in major domestic and international sports 
events.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China has enjoyed 
the fruits in building a market economy: in 1993, the domestic 
market of consumer goods flourished, the market for the means of 
production was brisk and reform in the price system was deepened. 
  Information from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) showed 
that the retail sales of consumer goods last year was 1,223.7 
billion yuan, up 26.1 percent (or a real growth of 11.6 percent 
if increase in price is excluded). 
  Of this total, sales in urban markets were 717.6 billion 
yuan, up 31.2 percent, while sales in rural areas were 506.1 
billion yuan, up 19.5 percent. 
  Analyzing by categories of consumer goods, it was found that 
there were ups and downs among different food items. Among 
clothing items, the sales of cotton cloth remained unchanged 
from the previous year, the sales of garments went up 16.1 
percent, while sales of woolen piecegoods and silk and satin 
textiles went down. 
  Growth by various margins was scored in the sale of all 
durable consumer goods, except for electric fans, 
black-and-white TV sets and bicycles. 
  The total purchase of means of production by materials 
supply 
and marketing departments at and above the county level was 
742.3 billion yuan in 1993, up 34.6 percent, while their sales 
were 779.6 billion yuan, up 32.3 percent. 
  However, the sales of means of agricultural production 
suffered a fall of 7.8 percent if change in price is excluded. 
  In 1993, the government strengthened price reform through a 
series of policies, including freeing the producer's prices for 
most rolled steel products, cement and coal of state-owned coal 
mines, raising the prices of crude oil, electricity and railway 
freight transportation, and further freeing the purchasing and 
selling prices of grain. 
  The SSB said that these policies played an important role in 
adjusting the relatively low prices of basic products and 
infrastructural facilities and in promoting the establishment of 
the market mechanism. 
  However, the overall increase in market prices was rather 
high, particularly in large and medium cities, and the momentum 
of increase in the prices of services remained strong.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China's industrial 
production continued its rapid growth in 1993, said Zhang Sai, 
director of the State Statistics Bureau (SSB), here today. 
  According to Zhang, China's industrial value-added returns 
amounted to 1,414 billion yuan in 1993, up 21.1 percent over 
1992. Of this total, the growth achieved by state enterprises 
was 6.4 percent, and that of collective enterprises was 28.6 
percent, and of joint ventures, contracted cooperative and 
foreign enterprises, 46.2 percent. Large and medium-sized 
enterprises maintained their momentum of steady development, 
with a growth of 14.1 percent. 
  In 1993, a balanced growth was registered between light 
industry and heavy industry, said Zhang. The value-added 
returns of light industry was 669 billion yuan, up 19.9 percent 
over the previous year, and that of heavy industry was 745 
billion, up by 22.2 percent. 
  Statistics released by the SSB today showed that the 
economic 
efficiency of China's industrial enterprises improved. In 1993, 
the composite efficiency index of industrial enterprises rose 
from 89.5 in 1992 to 96.6. The sales ratio of industrial 
products went up from 95.5 percent to 96.4 percent, the ratio 
between circulating capital and profits-taxes rose from 10.1 
percent to 10.6 percent, the ratio between cost and profits rose 
from 4.2 percent to 4.7 percent, and the overall labor 
productivity was up by 19.8 percent. 
  However, the industrial value-added rate was down by 0.6 
percentage points as compared with the previous year, and the 
proportion of loss-suffering state enterprises expanded from 
26.4 percent to 30.3 percent, with their losses increasing, 
according to the statistics. 
  The construction industry continued to develop rapidly, said 
Zhang. In 1993, the value-added returns from this sector 
totalled 210.5 billion yuan, up 15 percent over 1992. The total 
floor space of buildings under construction by state-owned 
construction enterprises was 305 million square meters, an 
increase of 17.8 percent, with over 100 million square meters 
completed during the year. The overall labor productivity was 
8.5 percent higher than the previous year, and the profits and 
taxes per capita showed a 4 percent rise to reach 900 yuan. 
  New results were also achieved in geological prospecting. 
Statistics showed that 166 mineral deposits were discovered or 
proved through geological surveys, and major progress was 
reported in the survey of 90 mineral areas. Reserves for thirty 
minerals were found to have increased, including rises to 763 
million tons of coal, 145 million tons of iron ore, 2.58 million 
tons of copper ore, and 75.86 million tons of aluminum ore. A 
total of 7.5 million meters of drilling was completed by the 
geological surveying industry.

  [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- China's private 
firms grew at a record rate last year, with their total number 
increasing to 238,000, 70 percent more than in the previous year. 
  According to the latest national sample survey on private 
enterprises, the total number of employers and employees in such 
firms reached 3.72 million last year, an increase of 60 percent 
over 1992. 
  The survey, which was conducted by China's Academy of Social 
Sciences (CASS) and a research office of the All-China 
Federation of Industry and Commerce, is designed to look at the 
development of the much-talked-about private firms. 
  Researchers said that questionnaires were answered by owners 
of 1,432 private firms. 
  The survey said that these firms' registered capital totaled 
68 billion yuan last year, twice as much as the previous figure. 
Registered capital per firm also increased by 80 percent to 
268,000 yuan. 
  The results show that the private firms are expanding in 
terms of financial strength and business scale. 
  The survey also found that about 40 percent of private firms 
are very profitable, 20 percent are fairly profitable, and 30 
percent could make ends meet, while 10 percent are operating in 
the red. 
  By last June, private firms each with assets exceeding one 
million [as received] numbered 4,072, compared with only 885 in 
1992. In some areas, the total value of assets in individual 
private firms exceeds 10 million yuan or even 100 million yuan 
each. 
  The survey, headed by CASS senior researcher Zhang Houyi, 
also concluded that by last June, limited companies had 
increased by nearly four times over the same period of the 
previous year, and firms engaging in service trade had increased 
drastically.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China achieved a 
good harvest in agriculture and a sustained growth in crop 
cultivation, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries in 1993. 
  According to Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistics 
Bureau (SSB), the value-added returns from the agricultural 
sector for the whole year amounted to 665 billion yuan, up 4 
percent over the previous year. 
  Statistics released by the SSB here today showed that among 
yields of major farm products, the output of grain and 
oil-bearing crops recorded an all-time high. A notable increase 
was also made in the production of vegetables and fruits. 
However, the output of cotton and sugar crops declined. 
  The output of grain was 456.44 million tons in 1993, a 3.1 
percent increase over the figure for 1992. The output of oil- 
bearing seeds was 17.61 million tons, up 7.3 percent compared 
with 1992. 
  According to Zhang, new progress was made in forestry. The 
new afforested area in 1993 was 5.89 million hectares, with 
improved quality. The state key forestry projects made 
noticeable headway, and measures against forest fires and forest 
diseases were reinforced. Both the forest area and forest stock 
increased, resulting in a continued rise in the forest coverage 
rate. 
  Animal husbandry developed steadily, and the production of 
meat, poultry, eggs and milk and the number of livestock 
continued to grow, Zhang said. The output of meat was 37.8 
million tons in 1993, up 10.2 percent compared with the figure 
for 1992. 
  Further improvement was made in the conditions for 
agricultural production, according to Zhang. By the end of 
1993, the aggregate power of the country's farm machinery 
reached 318 million kilowatts, a growth of 4.8 percent over the 
figure at the end of the previous year. 
  Rural consumption of electricity in 1993 was 125.3 billion 
kilowatt-hours, up 13.2 percent compared with that of 1992. 
Meanwhile, irrigation and water conservancy facilities in rural 
areas were further reinforced, with a newly added acreage of 
924,670 hectares of farmland under effective irrigation systems. 
  However, Zhang said, the unauthorized use of cultivated land 
for other purposes still prevails, thus posing a threat to the 
stable growth of agricultural production.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "134 Mineral Sites Discovered or Confirmed </F>
in '93] 
  [Text] To meet its rapidly growing needs, China 
intensified the exploration of energy reserves, minerals and 
groundwater in 1993. 
  As a result, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources 
reported 134 sites where industrial deposits of minerals were 
discovered or confirmed. 
  The raw materials are oil, natural gas, uranium, coal, gold, 
lead and zinc, copper and bauxite. 
  In the meantime, a major breakthrough was made in 
prospecting 
for 56 known deposits of gold, copper, lead and zinc, tin, 
silver, uranium, oil and natural gas. 
  An official with the ministry's geological exploration 
department disclosed big increases in the proven reserves of 31 
kinds of minerals. 
  Last year's oil and gas prospecting plan was fulfilled. 
Also, 800 million tons of coal reserves were verified, 150 
million tons of iron ore, 20 million tons of manganese ore, 2.5 
million tons of copper, 76 million tons of bauxite and 20,000 
tons of antimony. 
  The results of the oil and gas survey sharpened China's 
picture of its energy resources, the official said. 
  The prospecting teams evaluated a legion of oil traps in the 
remote Tarim and Junggar basins in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous 
Region where many wells are highly productive. 
  In the East China Sea, offshore oil departments drilled a 
high- yield well that can extract 646 cubic metres of crude oil 
and 226,600 cubic metres of natural gas a day. 
  A 30-kilometre-long copper belt was uncovered in Yunnan 
Province in Southwestern China while a batch of gold mines was 
found in Northeast and Northwest China. 
  In addition, geological workers have prospected eight 
groundwater sources in Tianjin, Shandong, Guangxi, Sichuan and 
Shaanxi with total explorable reserves of 600,000 tons. 
  And the discovery of huge water sources in coal-rich Shanxi 
Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also 
allayed acute water shortages in these energy bases and 
permitted further development. 
  In the Tibet Autonomous Region, a 262-centigrade geothermal 
well was dug to a depth of 2,006 metres. The well, the hottest 
of China's high-temperature geothermal wells, lays a solid 
foundation for installation of lO,OOO-kilowatt electricity 
generators.

<F P=106> ["China's Unified Foreign Exchange Market To Go Into </F>
Operation"--ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--An 
authoritative source from the China Foreign Exchange 
Consultative Service Company has said that the authorities are 
planning to put China's unified foreign exchange trading market 
system into operation by early March, at which time Beijing, 
Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen will become the first 
group of cities to launch pilot projects. 
  In recent years, various provinces and cities have set up 
their own foreign exchange swap centers. However, the scope of 
operation of all these swap centers has been confined to local 
transactions, thus resulting in a separation between different 
areas and hindering the rational redistribution of foreign 
exchange resources. This being the case, the central bank can 
hardly carry out macroscopic regulation and control of the 
separated foreign exchange markets with a view to stabilizing 
foreign exchange rates. 
  One of the measures stemming from the reform of the foreign 
exchange management system that was initiated this year is to 
build an inter-bank foreign exchange transaction market. In the 
unified foreign exchange transaction market that is to be put 
into operation this March, those banks authorized as foreign 
exchange dealers will be qualified to conduct transactions. 
Offers from these banks will be entered into a computer, their 
bids will be processed in a centralized manner, and the 
transaction center will act as a go- between to accomplish 
transactions based on the principle of each transaction going to 
the one who has offered the highest price and who has come 
first. The People's Bank of China is to announce the reference 
exchange rate of renminbi to the U.S. dollar every business day 
according the previous day's closing transaction rate on the 
foreign exchange market. The renminbi's exchange rate for other 
major foreign currencies will be calculated based on this 
reference rate. All other authorized foreign exchange dealer 
banks are to conduct foreign exchange transactions on their own 
within a fixed floating foreign exchange rate range pegged to 
this reference rate. Foreign-funded enterprises can sell their 
foreign exchange balances through authorized foreign exchange 
dealer banks on the foreign exchange market. 
  For the time being, only the above-mentioned five cities 
will 
be included in the unified transaction network. After the 
system has been initiated, another 20 cities will join it sooner 
or later and will gradually adopt the universally accepted price 
enquiry and quoting practice for foreign exchange transactions. 
The central bank will be ready to intervene in the market at 
any time to maintain a supply-demand balance and to stabilize 
foreign exchange rates on the market by buying or selling 
foreign exchange. The spot exchange rate for the dollar at 
present is approximately $1 to 8.7 yuan, and it is expected that 
the renminbi exchange rate will remain stable in the first half 
of the year.

<F P=106> [News conference by Zhang Sai, director of the State </F>
Statistics Bureau, with Chinese and foreign correspondents, on 
"the PRC State Statistics Bureau Communique on Statistics of 
Economic and Social Development in 1993," at the State Council 
Information Office on 28 February] 
  [Text] [Video shows close-ups of a male official reading 
from prepared notes, cutting occasionally to show group shots of 
Chinese and foreign journalists taking notes and photographers 
taking pictures] Zhang Sai said: China made new strides in 
reform, opening up, and modernization in 1993. The national 
economy continued to grow, and the people's living standards 
continued to improve. The major improvements can be observed in 
the following: 
  First, gross domestic product [GDP] exceeded three trillion 
yuan, topping the figure from the preceding year by 736 billion 
yuan. On a constant price basis, the growth rate was 13.4 
percent higher than that of 1992 and was the highest since 1985. 
  Zhang said: [Begin Zhang recording] The output of major 
industrial and agricultural goods set record highs, the 
infrastructure became stronger, the scientific and technological 
progress was greater, and the state's foreign exchange reserves 
increased. All this was favorable for achieving sustained 
national economic growth. 
  Second, the people's living standards continued to improve, 
and their incomes continued to grow. In 1993, urban and rural 
dwellers' incomes grew by 10.2 and 3.2 percent, respectively. 
The scope of their consumption continued to broaden; and the 
standards of their clothing, food, spending ability, housing, 
and transportion continued to rise. 
  Third, the nation's reforms continued to deepen. The various 
reform programs carried out around the main goal -- namely 
building a socialist market economic system -- continued to 
deepen during the past year. New progress was made in reforms 
carried out in rural areas and state-owned enterprises and in 
reforms relevant to wages, social security, housing system, 
macroscopic regulation and control, and prices. Fairly 
significant breakthroughs were made in two areas: 1) The 
efforts made to rationalize prices through correcting the 
perennially low prices for primary goods and infrastructure 
services have played an important role in forming market 
mechanisms. 2) While exercising macroscopic regulation and 
control, the nation did away with conventions and achieved 
positive results and gain valuable experiences from conducting 
experiments in introducing new measures at the right time and 
adjusting the degree of intensity. 
  Fourth, the nation's opening up programs continued to 
broaden. In 1993 China's opening up programs continued to deepen 
in all sectors and in all directions. Import and export volumes 
continued to expand, and the mix of import and export goods 
continued to improve. The use of foreign capital grew 
substantially. New records were set both in the number of new 
accords signed on the use of foreign capital and in the actual 
amounts of foreign capital used. Fairly substantial progress 
was also made in developing economic and technical cooperation 
with foreign countries and in promoting international tourism. 
  The key economic problems were: The decline of actual 
incomes of some people owing to rising commodity prices in the 
market; excessive investment in building fixed assets; and 
incompatibility between the development of basic industries and 
infrastructure on the one hand and rapid national economic 
growth on the other. On the whole, however, the economic 
situation in 1993 was satisfactory. The new changes appearing in 
various sectors are favorable for the nation to seize the 
opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, 
promote development, and mantain stability in 1994. In 1994, we 
must continue to implement the guidelines laid down by the 14th 
national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee; always pay attention to properly 
handling the relationships among reform, development, and 
stability; and continue to intensify and improve macroscopic 
regulation and control. Priority will be given to appropriately 
controlling investment in fixed assets and the growth of the 
money supply and guarding against serious inflation so that the 
targets set for reform and development this year can be

  Answering a question on commodity prices, Zhang Sai said: 
The substantial increase in commodity prices is primarily 
triggered by demand, especially the high demand for resources 
needed for investment in fixed assets. Second, it is due to 
rising costs. This is particularly noticeable as result of the 
readjustment of the prices of primary goods. Moreover, price 
increases were also caused by consumers' anticipation that 
commodity prices would rise, as well as by unwarranted and 
covert price rises and speculations. Thus, during the 
transition toward a market economy, it has become increasingly 
noticeable that market prices have been affected by the law of 
supply and demand. During 1994, price controls, as an important 
macroscopic regulatory measure, will still be useful for 
controlling price rises at a level consumers can tolerate. 
  In respond to a question about China's economic growth rates 
in 1994, Zhang Sai pointed out: Seen from the law governing 
economic cycles, we still can expect a fairly high economic 
growth rate this year, but the rate will not be as high as those 
of 1992 and 1993. This is because of the increasingly obvious 
restrictions from basic industries. The utilization ratios of 
basic industries are already vary high, ranging from 80 to 100 
percent in most cases, and communications and transport services 
can only satisfy 60 percent of the needs. Because of the 
restrictions from these bottlenecks, China's economic growth 
will decline somewhat this year. We must stress, however, that 
what is important is not high growth, but high economic returns. 
Continual readjustments will be made until the best point has 
been found for both growth and returns. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified male reporter] I am 
reporter from [words indistinct], I want to ask Director Zhang a 
question. Some people used to think that statistical figures 
were inflated. This being the case, what positive efforts has 
the State Statistics Bureau taken or will take to make the 
figures more accurate? Can you [words indistinct] differences 
of major figures can be controlled so that they can more 
credible? 
  [Zhang] It is a common occurrence for statistics to be 
confronted with skepticism in varying degrees in all countries. 
If we observe specific facts, people more often than not 
approach statistics with skepticism. Macroscopically speaking, 
however, statistics can basically reflect facts because of the 
development of statistical sciences. Today when we are moving 
toward building a market economy, we have accomplished much in 
the way of reforming our method of processing statistics, and we 
have adopted some major measures for controlling the accuracy of 
statistics. Generally, these reforms and measures are based on 
1) science and technology; and 2) laws. 
  Regarding science and technology, we have, first of all, 
established a scientific system for processing statistics. This 
is a scientific, three-in-one system for processing social, 
economic, and scientific and technical information. This system 
has functions for controlling and verifying statistics according 
to requirements. Second, we have a system for assessing the 
national economic development. This system can process all 
types of statistics in a way similar to assembling a large 
machine. If a certain figure does not seem to fit, this figure 
is considered to be incorrect and must be checked and verified. 
Third, we have a scientific way to compile statistics. This 
way is based on a number of methods, but primarily on surveys 
and samplings. Fourth, we depend extensively on computers which 
can distinguish correct from incorrect figures. Fifty, we have a 
scientific management system which can reject interference from 
various sectors when information is being processed. Because of 
the development of modern science and technology, we can be sure 
that our statistics are basically in line with objective facts. 
In China, where statistical science has not been popularized, 
it is understandable that people are skeptical of it. Even 
people in developed countries often express doubts over 
statistics. I think this is a normal phenomenon. 
  Then we have to count on laws. In addition to the PRC Law 
for Statistics, all provinces and municipalities have their own 
local statistics regulations, by which those who do not report 
statistics according to state regulations or those who obstruct 
statisticians from collecting statistics will be punished. So I 
think you can be confident with our statistics. This is 
particularly true for statisticians like ourselves. A Chinese 
saying goes that a melon seller will certainly brag about the 
melons he sells, but I think our statisticians can take pride in 
their work of ensuring the accuracy of our statistics. [end

  [Text] Hefei, March 1 (XINHUA) -- A leading Chinese expert 
said here today that the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system in China will reinforce the status of public ownership as 
the mainstay of the economy. 
  Sun Shangqing, a noted economist and director of an economic 
research center directly under the State Council, said the 
Chinese Government will transform some existing large and 
medium-sized enterprises into joint-stock companies within three 
to five years. 
  As for small state-owned enterprises, the management can be 
contracted out, leased or auctioned, he said. 
  He said the current reform drive will push these enterprises 
into the market to become more competitive and to grow into 
independent legal entities which should have sole responsibility 
for gains and losses. 
  He held that the country will maintain macro-control over 
the 
joint-stock companies and it can convert income from leasing and 
selling into investment to launch new state-run enterprises.

<F P=106> [By GUANGYE BAO (Mining Industry Paper) reporter Li Hongbing </F>
(2621 3163 0393) and XINHUA reporter Li Guangru (2621 0342 5423)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to the second 
executive meeting of the first council of the Mining Industry 
Association held in Beijing on 25 February, China's mining 
industry is seeking new development by deepening reform and is 
advancing toward international markets. 
  The mining industry is a basic industry in China's national 
economy, including undertakings in coal, the chemical industry, 
nonferrous metals, construction materials, the metallurgical 
industry, and geology and mineral resources. China has abundant 
natural resources and can be considered a major producer of 
mineral resources. At present, the number of minerals that have 
been surveyed as being abundant is 151. China ranks third in 
the world both in terms of the potential value of its mineral 
resources and as a producer of mineral ores. In recent years, 
it has considerably raised the output of raw and semifinished 
materials which depend on mineral products for their raw 
materials. China's output of coal ores, cement, and glass has 
been the largest in the world, and its output of steel and 
nonferrous metals, crude oil, and gold has been, respectively, 
the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-largest in the world. Economists 
made the following comment on the issue: The development of the 
mining industry has enormously increased China's comprehensive 
national strength and has laid a material foundation for 
realizing the second-step strategic objective. 
  While deepening reform and gearing up toward the market, 
China's mining industry has been actively seeking international 
markets. It has been learned that cooperation in marine oil 
exploration, which is generally concerned with international 
joint ventures, has continually expanded. The China National 
Offshore Oil Corporation has signed agreements with 50 companies 
from 13 countries and regions to open up 560,000 square km of 
the ocean's area, and foreign companies have accumulatively 
invested $3.68 billion of funds. China has made various types 
of progress in joint ventures to develop mineral resources with 
Brazil, Mongolia, and South Africa. China has jointly launched 
more than 30 geological exploration undertakings and surveying 
projects for mineral resources with 17 countries and regions. 
More than 20 Chinese mineral surveying teams have entered the 
international market, and these have contracts for more than 100 
projects. China's new nuclear power and nuclear fuel industry 
has also begun to enter the international market. A Pakistani 
nuclear power project, which was the first nuclear power plant 
exported by China, is progressing smoothly. 
  According to the leaders of relevant departments and 
commissions and mining industry representatives attending the 
meeting, even though China has made attention-catching 
accomplishments in developing its mining industry, it is still 
facing an arduous situation with many problems and restraining 
factors obstructing its path of progress. Therefore, they 
proposed: It is necessary to deepen reform in the mining 
industry's structure, particularly to enhance reform in 
enterprise and investment, mining rights, and social security 
systems.

  [Text] Moscow, March 1 (XINHUA) -- The trial of August 19, 
1991 event leaders was declared over today, following the 
release of the opposition leaders arrested in the October 
bloodshed in Moscow in 1993. 
  On the basis of the amnesty decision adopted by the State 
Duma (lower house of parliament), the court ruled to drop 
criminal processings against former top Soviet officials who 
were involved in the August 19, 1991 event, which has been 
called an "abortive Soviet coup" by Russian authorities. 
  The amnesty covers the organizers of the August 19 event of 
1991 and the May Day demonstration of 1993, and opposition 
leaders arrested in the tank attack on the parliament building 
in Moscow last October. 
  Among the freed were former Russian parliament speaker 
Ruslan 
Khasbulatov and former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 KYODO -- Japan called Tuesday [1 
March] for greater openness or "transparency" by China 
concerning military matters at a bilateral security meeting in 
Beijing, a Japanese official said. 
  Military officials from the two countries met for the first 
time to exchange views on defense policies of the two countries 
as well as the military situation in the Asia-Pacific region, 
said Ken Sato, a defense councilor of Japan's Defense Agency. 
  Zhan Maohai, deputy director of China's Ministry of National 
Defense Foreign Affairs Bureau, represented the Chinese side. 
  The Japanese side indirectly expressed concern over China's 
military buildup and urged that China make military information 
public in such forms as a defense white paper, noting that 
China's neighbors have an increased interest in Chinese defense 
matters, according to Sato. 
  The Chinese side reportedly said that the increase of its 
defense budget was partly due to inflation and that China's 
military is for defensive purposes only.

  [Text] Taipei, March 1 (CNA) -- Taiwan has done a good 
job of cracking down on intellectual property rights violators, 
Board of Foreign Trade Deputy Director General Lin Yi-fu claimed 
Tuesday [1 March] during the second day of talks between the 
Republic of China [ROC] and the United States on intellectual 
property rights (IPR) protection. 
  Taiwan is currently negotiating with US officials to have 
its 
name removed from the special 301 priority watch list, which 
targets countries breaching IPR laws. Those countries failing 
to improve their IPR protection records may be hit with trade 
sanctions by the United States. 
  Lin cited US customs statistics in defense of Taiwan's 
efforts, saying that Taiwan has gone from having the most 
exports of any country seized for IPR violations by US customs 
agents in 1991, to improving to fourth position in 1993, 
trailing Mainland China, an unidentified country, and Hong Kong. 
  Mainland Chinese goods worth US$19 million were confiscated 
by US customs for IPR violations last year, accounting for 43 
percent of the total value of goods seized by the United States. 
Taiwan accounted for about 5 percent of the total value of 
goods confiscated, or US$2.2 million. 
  In terms of the number of shipments of goods seized by the 
US 
customs for violating IPR laws, Taiwan ranked fifth. 
  During the day's negotiations, Lin asked the United States 
to 
provide Taiwan with information concerning Taiwan's IPR 
violators so that the government can more effectively police the 
(renegade) trade. 
  The US side, (?alternatively), expressed its dissatisfaction 
over Taiwan's having reduced the maximum jail term for violators 
of the trademark law to three years from five years.

Criticizes the British Side for Lacking Sincerity"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen, 1 Mar--In Shenzhen today, while attending 
the 29th anniversary of the diversion of the Dong Jiang's waters 
to Hong Kong, Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office, said that from the material about the 
truth of the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's electoral 
arrangements published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry 
yesterday, everyone can see that the British side had no 
sincerity from the very beginning of the talks, while the 
Chinese side had made the greatest efforts. He added that the 
Chinese side was quite disappointed and regretful about what the 
British side had done to undermine the talks. 
  When answering reporters' questions today, Lu Ping said: 
From the material published by the Foreign Ministry, everyone 
can see that the Chinese Government was really sincere and 
honest in the talks and that the Chinese side made the greatest 
efforts to reach an agreement with the British side. From the 
materials, everyone can see that the British side had no 
sincerity since the beginning of the talks. The Chinese side 
was willing to talk with the British side on the 1994/95 
electoral arrangements because it hoped that China and Britain 
could cooperate on the question of a steady transition and bring 
about a steady transition in 1997. This was the "through train" 
concept. 
  Lu Ping criticized the British side lack of sincerity and 
for 
causing the talks to break down. Therefore, the Chinese side is 
quite disappointed and regretful about this. He stressed that 
under this situation--a situation in which the British side is 
not cooperating--the Chinese side will make efforts to carry out 
Hong Kong's steady transition in 1997, adding that this was also 
the Chinese side's objective in its future work.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016) and Zhang Yinshu </F>
(1728 6892 2562)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- The sixth meeting of the 
Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee 
opened at the Great Hall of the People this morning. 
  Chairman Qiao Shi presided over the meeting in the morning. 
  First of all, the 126 Standing Committee members who were 
present at the meeting approved the meeting agenda proposed by 
the chairmanship meeting. 
  Then, Xiang Chunyi and Wang Shuwen, vice chairmen of the NPC 
Law Committee, made reports on results of the committee's 
examination of the draft supplementary regulations governing 
severe punishment for criminals who organize and transport 
others to cross the border (boundary) illegally and of the draft 
law on protecting Taiwan compatriots' investment respectively. 
The Law Committee proposed that the Standing Committee 
deliberate and approve these two draft laws at the current 
meeting. 
  State Council Premier Li Peng submitted a motion to the 
meeting, requesting the deliberation of a draft labor law. 
Labor Minister Li Boyong explained the draft law at the morning 
session of the meeting. 
  Entrusted by the State Council, Communications Minister 
Huang 
Zhendong gave an explanation requesting the Standing Committee's 
deliberation of a decision on China's participation in the 
International Convention on Unifying Certain Laws and 
Regulations on Ship Collision, the 1974 Athens Convention on 
Transportation of Passengers and Their Luggage on Seas, and the 
Decision on the 1974 Athens Convention on Transportation of 
Passengers and Their Luggage on Seas. Vice Foreign Minister Liu 
Huaqiu explained the PRC-Thai extradition treaty and the 
PRC-Kyrgyz consular. 
  Based on the motions submitted by Cheng Xu and 31 other 
deputies and by Yuan Qitong and 36 other deputies in 1989 and 
1993 respectively, and taking into consideration the development 
needs of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone [SEZ], the NPC Law 
Committee suggested today that the NPC Standing Committee 
request the deliberation and adoption of a decision by the 
Second Session of the Eighth NPC to empower the Xiamen City 
People's Congress and its Standing Committee, and the Xiamen 
City People's Government to enact laws, rules, and regulations 
respectively for implementation in the Xiamen SEZ. Copies of 
the draft decision and explanation prepared by the Law Committee 
were distributed to members for deliberation today. 
  Distributed to members for deliberation were also copies of

observe the Second Session of the Eighth NPC. 
  Li Xuezhi, vice chairman of the Credentials Committee of the 
Eighth NPC Standing Committee, made a report on credentials of 
the additional deputies elected through by-elections. He said: 
Recently local people's congress Standing Committees elected 
nine additional deputies to the NPC through by-elections. After 
examination, their credentials were confirmed as valid and were 
submitted to the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation. 
  Copies of a report on Chairman Qiao Shi's visit to Germany, 
Switzerland, and Australia were also distributed at the meeting. 
  Vice Chairmen Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, 
Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, Li Ximing, Wang 
Mingqian, Wang Guangying, Chen Siyuan, Lu Jiaxi, Buhe, Li 
Peiyao, and Wu Jieping; and Secretary General Cao Zhi attended 
the meeting. 
  State Councillor Luo Gan, President Ren Jianxin of the 
Supreme People's Court, and Procurator General Zhang Siqing of 
the Supreme People's Procuratorate observed the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- As a last preparation 
for the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC) to be staged shortly, the sixth meeting of the NPC 
Standing Committee opened here this morning. 
  The four-day meeting will be presided over by Qiao Shi, 
chairman of the Standing Committee. 
  Xiang Chunyi and Wang Shuwen, vice-chairmen of the NPC Law 
Committee, delivered a report on the considerations of the 
supplementary regulation on severely punishing illegal border 
crossings and emigration, and a report on the considerations of 
the law on the protection of investments of Taiwan patriots. 
They advised the meeting to consider the two draft laws. 
  Entrusted by the State Council, Li Boyong, minister of 
labor, 
explained the draft labor law at the meeting. He said that the 
law serves to protect legal rights and benefits of laborers and 
safeguard stable and harmonious labor relations between the 
employees and employers. 
  Based on motions proposed by the NPC delegates, and 
considering the development of Xiamen Special Economic Zone, the 
Law Committee suggested to give rights to the Xiamen City

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Gao Dezhan, Tianjin Municipal CPC </F>
Committee Secretary, made at the Second (Enlarged) Plenary 
Session of the Sixth Municipal Party Committee on 24 December] 
  [Text] The main tasks of the Second (Enlarged) Plenary 
Session of the Sixth Municipal Party Committee are: Consider 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as a guide; comprehensively implement 
the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee; study and arrange 
the 1994 municipal work; discuss and approve the "1994 work 
priorities of the Tianjin Municipal CPC Committee"; and mobilize 
the vast number of party members, cadres, and people to grasp 
favorable opportunities to quicken the pace of reform, opening 
up, and modernization in the new year. 
<H5>  1. Brief Review of 1993 Work </H5>
  In 1993, all fronts in the municipality deeply implemented 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks and the guidelines of 
the 14th party congress, conscientiously implemented the tasks 
as set forth at the sixth municipal party congress and the First 
Session of the 12th Municipal People's Congress, unified 
thinking, quickened the pace of advance, made new headway in 
various aspects on the basis of the previous achievements, and 
made noticeable achievements. 
  The national economy developed in a sustained, fast, and 
sound manner. The main economic targets could be overfulfilled 
and the economic growth rate was higher than that in the 
previous year. Some of them reached peak levels when compared 
with those in the previous years. Positive achievements were 
made in macroeconomic regulation and control. The gross 
national product was expected to surpass 50 billion yuan, an 
increase of about 12 percent over the previous year and the 
second fastest growth year since the implementation of the 
reform and opening up policy. The total industrial output value 
was expected to surpass 120 billion yuan, an increase of about 
24 percent. The municipality made achievements in halting 
deficits and increasing profits. The rural economy developed in 
a sustained manner. After combating the serious droughts, we 
reaped bumper grain harvests for 10 consecutive years. The total 
output value of town and township enterprises was expected to 
reach 54 billion yuan, an increase of 36 percent. Markets were 
brisk and there were ample supplies of commodities. The total 
volume of retail sales of commodities was expected to increase 
by 17 percent over the previous year. The 1993 urban and rural 
capital construction tasks were better fulfilled when compared 
with the previous years. A group of infrastructural facilities 
were completed and began operation ahead of schedule. A total 
of 2.4 million square meters of new residential houses were 
built, an increase of more than 600,000 square meters over the 
previous year. The investment in fixed assets was expected to 
increase by 32.4 percent. The investment structure was further 
optimized. The revenues increased by about 20 percent and the 
revenue growth rate was higher than that in the previous 10 
years or so. The urban and rural people's livelihood was 
further improved. 
  Bigger strides were made in reform and opening up. 
Enterprise reform was being deepened. The experiments with 
various reforms were quickened. Approval was made in 54 
shareholding enterprises. The small-sized state-owned 
enterprises positively carried out the system characterized by 
state ownership, civilian management, amalgamation, and 
shareholding cooperation. The trend of setting up markets was 
good. There were 11 state- and regional-level wholesale markets 
in the province. The reform of the land utilization system and 
the housing system was steadily carried out. The social 
security system started to be carried out. The trend of opening 
to the outside world was good. A total of 3,500 items on using 
foreign capital and the relevant agreements involving $3.5 
billion in investment were signed, including $2.25 billion worth 
of foreign capital, respectively increasing by 100 percent, 82 
percent, and 84.6 percent over the previous year. The 
municipality made noticeable achievements again on the basis of 
the achievements made in 1992 when the amount of foreign capital 
used during the year surpassed the total volume of the previous 
13 years. The developmental zones tended to develop forcefully. 
The major economic targets of the development zones ranked the 
municipality among the best in the whole country. Bonded areas 
made noticeable achievements in the introduction of businessmen, 
development, and construction. The new technology industrial 
park zones developed in a sustained and faster manner. The 
twelve small development zones made a good start in development. 
  Situations in the social and political fields of the entire 
municipality were also very good. The municipality, as well as 
various districts and counties, smoothly completed the 
end-of-term reshuffle of their leading bodies. Party committees 
and governments at all levels adhered to the principle of 
"attending to two tasks simultaneously and achieving competence 
in both" and won notable results in building the spiritual 
civilization, improving democracy and the legal system, and 
strengthening party building. Tianjin continued to be one of the 
areas with the best public security in the country. The 
anticorruption struggle produced remarkable achievements. Party 
committees and governments at all levels established the system 
to complete work within a definite time and the system for 
various departments to coordinate in work. Education, science 
and technology, culture and art, public health and sports, 
family planning, and environmental protection all made new 
headway, and an important breakthrough was achieved in producing 
movies and television programs. 
  After the publication of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, in particular, the vast number of cadres and the 
masses conducted earnest study of it in line with their thinking 
and work reality. A new upsurge in the study was created very 
quickly throughout the municipality, and an encouraging 
situation in theoretical study unseen for many years emerged. 
  There were also problems and deficiencies in the work of 
1993. Our economic development still lagged behind others, with 
the growth of gross national product lower than national average 
and economic efficiency not good enough. Some weak links still 
existed in economic development and the economic structure had 
yet to be adjusted more rapidly. Work proceeded in an uneven 
manner, and some units lacked the sense of urgency and 
responsibility. On the whole, our gap lies mainly in our 
inadequacy in the depth in the emancipation of the mind, in the 
extent of reform and opening up, and in the degree of economic 
development. 
<H3>  2. Unifying Thinking With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Theory as 
the Foundation for Successful Work </H3>
  The year 1994 will be a very crucial year for Tianjin. To 
win success in the work for 1994 and achieve a significant 
breakthrough and development, the most important thing is to use 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to unify our thinking and guide our 
action. The theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics that Comrade Deng Xiaoping established inherits, 
enriches, and develops Mao Zedong Thought, is the Marxism of 
contemporary China, and is the basic guarantee for achieving 
success in work and promoting reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive. We should conscientiously study Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the 
"decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee in line with the reality of the current reform 
and development and further enhance our understanding and unify 
our thinking concerning the following issues. 
  A. We should profoundly understand the important idea that 
"development is the essential criterion" and be more conscious 
and steadfast in implementing the party's basic line. Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping emphasized that development is the essential 
criterion, and that "poverty is not socialism, nor is sluggish 
development." We should fully understand that, as far as 
Tianjin is concerned, if our development is slow and economy not 
promoted in the next few years, the development in various 
social undertakings will be out of the question, the existing 
contradictions and problems will become increasingly 
conspicuous, and people's living standard cannot be duly 
improved. This is indeed a major issue concerning the future 
and destiny of Tianjin and the basic interests of the 9 million 
people of the municipality and also an urgent and acute issue 
for the entire municipality. We should embrace a strong sense 
of development, enhance our sense of urgency and responsibility, 
and persistently take economic construction as the central task 
without wavering. Faster development depends on the hard work 
of everyone. All the people have the responsibility and should 
feel the pressure, and all departments and individuals should 
take the initiative in serving this public interest and channel 
their work to the track of faster development of the 
municipality. 
  B. We should profoundly understand the importance of 
"seizing the opportunity" and become more urgent in accelerating 
development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out on many 
occasions: "Do not miss the opportunity." For China, there are 
not many opportunities for effecting a large-scale development." 
We must foster a strong sense of opportunity. We should 
profoundly understand that whether we are good at seizing the 
opportunity is the key question to decide whether we can gain 
the initiative in accelerating development. The year 1994 
provides a hard-won opportunity for Tianjin. When viewed from 
the current situation at home and abroad and from the situation 
of Tianjin, there are many favorable conditions for accelerating 
development, but there are also many difficulties. When viewed 
from the overall situation, however, we are indeed faced with 
the historical opportunity of effecting a large-scale 
development. All comrades must approach this issue from an 
overall and strategic point of view. Lacking the sense of 
urgency in seizing the opportunity and in accelerating 
development means lacking the sense of responsibility for our 
undertakings. Being unable to seize the opportunity and to 
accelerate development means bungling major matters and means, 
so far as leading cadres are concerned, dereliction of duties 
and irresponsibility for the party's cause and the people. We 
must seize the opportunity without any delay and slackness so as 
to bring forth a new vigorous situation of racing against time 
to accelerate Tianjin's reform, opening up, and economic 
development. 
  C. We should profoundly understand the "quintessence" of 
"emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts" and should 
conscientiously break away with all sorts of ideas that hamper 
the rapid development of the economy. When making an inspection 
tour of Tianjin in 1986, Comrade Deng Xiaoping demanded us to 
"take bolder steps and effect a faster development." He also 
pointed out: "Without the pioneering spirit, we cannot break a 
good path and a new path and cannot pioneer a new cause." 
Leading cadres at all levels must even more consciously persist 
in the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking 
truth from fact and must further emancipate the mind. On the 
premise of conforming to the standard of "being conducive to 
developing socialist productive forces, to building up the 
comprehensive strength of the socialist country, and to 
improving the people's living standards," we should dare to 
reform the conventions that are detrimental to developing the 
socialist market economy, dare to pioneer the new path for 
emancipating and developing the socialist productive forces, 
dare to promote reform and development, and dare to overcome the 
ideas of sticking to conventions and being content with the 
existing state of affairs. We should foster lofty ideals, aim 
high, dare to create a new situation, and resolutely overcome 
the ideas of blaming god and men and attempting and 
accomplishing nothing. We should be more urgent in accelerating 
the development of Tianjin, be more brave in doing pioneering 
work, be more enthusiastic in dedicating ourselves to the state. 
We should enhance our morale and work energetically to achieve 
self-respect, self-improvement, and self-confidence. We should 
arouse ourselves for vigorous efforts to make the country 
prosperous, should be bold in making innovations, and should 
work hard to pioneer new undertakings so as to restore the 
magnificent view of Tianjin. We should truly achieve 
dialectical integration in the fields of emancipating the mind 
and seeking truth from facts. Now that we are doing our best to 
accelerate economic development, we should accelerate it as fast 
as possible and act according to our capability in order to 
avoid losses, serious losses in particular. 
  D. We should profoundly understand the principle of "taking 
a two-handed approach and being touch with both hands" and 
actually build well the spiritual civilization in order to 
create favorable conditions for accelerating economic 
development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out on many 
occasions that we should "take a two-handed approach and being 
tough with both hands." Under the new situation, we should 
truly have the sense of urgency in two aspects and embark on new 
stages in two aspects, that is, we should enhance the sense of 
urgency and the sense of responsibility not only in accelerating 
economic development but also in building spiritual civilization 
and should push both economic construction and spiritual 
civilization construction onto new stages. Leaders at all 
levels should keep sober-minded, enhance consciousness, 
strengthen initiative, and strive for attaining new levels in 
order to ensure the smooth progress of Tianjin's reform, opening 
up, and modernization drive. 
<H3>  3. The Major Tasks of 1994 in Reform, Opening Up, and in 
Economic and Social Development </H3>
  The general demands of the municipal work in 1994 are to 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress and of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line, seize the opportunity to accelerate the 
pace of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, 
maintain a sustained, speedy, and sound development, strengthen 
the building of spiritual civilization, promote comprehensive 
social progress, and achieve breakthroughs and major development 
in expediting the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure and prefulfilling the second-step development 
objectives. 
  In 1994, party committees and governments at all levels must 
concentrate greater energy on accelerating reform and expediting 
development. They must propose ideas for realizing the work 
objective of deepening reform, expanding opening up, and 
accelerating economic and social development, and further 
deepening the emancipation of the mind; expand the degree of 
reform and opening up, and adopt major measures; achieve great 
breakthroughs in all undertakings by making earnest efforts to 
do practical work and firmly implementing measures; and attain 
the goal of seizing the opportunity and realizing great 
development. In work guidance, we must pay attention to 
grasping five principles well. 
  First, we should attend to the relationship between the 
quantity and quality of economic development. We should always 
persist in taking economic construction as the central task, and 
concentrate efforts on pushing economic construction forward. In 
developing the economy, we must have new ideas and realistically 
channel our ideas to the path of taking enhancement of economic 
efficiency as the central task. Regarding all economic targets, 
we must adopt measures to fulfill them with earnest efforts, 
continue to attend to the work of ending deficits and increasing 
profits, and through raising economic efficiency, enable 
financial departments at all levels to collect more revenue, 
enterprises to earn more profits (money-losing enterprises to 
further reduce deficits), and the broad masses of workers to 
increase more income in an effort to unceasingly raise the 
living standards of the Tianjin people. In developing the 
economy, we should pay attention to the increase in total supply 
and demands, raise the quality, exert efforts to readjust the 
structure, strengthen management, achieve technological 
progress, and raise efficiency in an effort to combine rate with 
economic returns. 
  Second, we should attend to the relations of reform, 
development and stability. Since development is our aim and 
reform is the motivation and fundamental way of development, we 
should cultivate the idea of relying on reform to accelerate 
development. In addition, we should fully understand that only 
under the condition of maintaining social stability can reform, 
opening up, and economic development be smoothly carried out. 
We should accelerate economic development by deepening reform 
and expanding opening up. In making arrangements for economic 
work, we should pay attention to creating a fairly relaxed 
environment for reform. In 1994, the whole country will make 
big strides in reform and issue many measures which will involve 
the readjustment of some patterns of interests. We must do 
in-depth and meticulous work to prepare for the issuance of 
measures, properly handle all contradictions and problems, 
maintain a stable political and social environment, and create 
good conditions for smoothly promote reform and development. 
  Third, we should attend to the relationship between 
advancing 
the work in an all-round manner and making breakthroughs in 
some major aspects. The municipality as a whole should make big 
strides in all fields of work, seek improvements, achieve major 
progress, and comprehensively promote the work. meanwhile, we 
should firmly grasp the major work and important aspects that 
affect the overall situation, and never lose opportunity to seek 
breakthroughs in some major aspects. In the work objective, 
the increase of major economic targets, such as the GNP, and all 
major work should be better than that of 1993; great 
breakthroughs should be made in major work and some weak 
aspects; and efforts should be made to maintain a certain level 
in some aspects and to strive to march towards the front rank of 
the country. 
  Fourth, we should handle well the relationship between 
faster economic development and comprehensive social progress. 
While accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development, 
we should attach great importance to the development of various 
social undertakings, conscientiously strengthen the spiritual 
civilization, democracy, legal system, and comprehensive 
management of public security, safeguard political and social 
stability, maintain coordinated economic and social development, 
and promote comprehensive social progress. 
  Fifth, we should handle well the relationship between 
consolidation and improvement on the one hand and innovation and 
development on the other. We should greatly value, earnestly 
persist in, and continuously improve and upgrade the good work 
foundation, traditions, experiences, and methods that have taken 
shape in Tianjin over the past many years. We should also 
continuously achieve innovation and development to comply with 
the new situation. Regarding the major issues concerning the 
overall situation and the existing weak links, in particular, we 
should all the more adopt major measures and open up a new 
situation. 
  To meet the general requirements of Tianjin's work for 1994, 
we should pay attention to the following 15 tasks. 
  A. We should deepen enterprise reform, transform the 
operating mechanism, and gradually establish a modern enterprise 
system. 
  Accelerating enterprise reform is the most important task 
for 
deepening reform. All enterprises in the municipality, 
especially state-owned large and medium-sized ones, should 
achieve a breakthrough in transforming the operating mechanism. 
First, we should continue to thoroughly enforce the "enterprise 
law" and the "regulations" and delegate to enterprises all the 
powers and responsibilities they should hold. Second, we should 
accelerate the reform of the organizational, managerial, 
financial, and accounting systems of enterprises. Enterprises' 
inner accounting units should be made smaller based on the 
actual conditions, and a market mechanism should be established 
within enterprises. We should streamline enterprises' inner 
managerial levels and personnel and comprehensively facilitate 
and further deepen their reform of the labor, personnel, and 
wage systems. Third, relevant government departments should 
change their functions, make less interventions, and provide 
more service so that enterprise can have a free hand in 
management. More than 80 percent of Tianjin's state-owned 
enterprises should meet the requirements on transformation of 
the operating mechanism by 1994. 
  We should conduct reform of enterprises' property right 
system in an active and prudent manner. State-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises with sole investor may be reorganized 
into sole-invested companies when conditions permit; and those 
with multiple investors may be reorganized into limited 
liability companies or limited liability stock companies whose 
stocks are issued to definite units. Some should make active 
efforts to win state approval for reorganizing themselves into 
limited liability stock companies which issue stocks publicly to 
society, including foreign countries; others may cooperate with 
foreign firms to establish limited liability companies or 
limited liability stock companies; and still others may 
institute the cooperative shareholding system. New or expanded 
enterprises should adopt the new mechanism and enforce the 
company system. We should actively develop the enterprise 
groups linked mainly by property right and should expand the 
merge and cooperation between enterprises. These types of 
reform should be conducted in the 100 budgetary state-owned 
large and medium-sized industrial enterprises that we have 
arranged. Regarding small state-owned enterprises, their 
management should be actively contracted or leased out to people 
while their state-owned status remaining unchanged, or they may 
adopt the cooperative shareholding system to them. Some of them 
may be sold to collectives or individuals. Small state-owned 
commercial enterprises should actively conduct these types of 
reform, and 90 percent of them should do so in 1994. Proceeding 
from reality, urban and rural collective enterprises may be 
reorganized into shareholding enterprises or cooperative 
shareholding enterprises when conditions permit. We should 
implement the "regulations on the supervision and management of 
the property of state-owned enterprises" in an orderly manner; 
make an inventory and check of the property, define property 
right, and clarify debts receivable and debts payable; and 
achieve success in the experimental work to reduce enterprises' 
burden of debts, to increase the proportion of enterprises' own 
circulating funds, and to authorize property management right. 
Thirty enterprises should be selected to experiment with the 
modern enterprise system. 
  It is necessary to further quicken the readjustment of the 
enterprise organizational structure and the industrial 
structure. The assets should be reorganized and the reasonable 
distribution of production factors should be pressed forward in 
line with the measures of amalgamation, transfer, auctioning, 
and bankruptcy. The enterprises that suffer long-term losses 
due to poor management should be closed down, suspended, merge 
with others, or shift their lines of production. 
Simultaneously, these enterprises can use their existing areas, 
workshops, and infrastructural facilities to positively develop 
the diversified economy. The small number of state-owned 
enterprises that are hopeless to halt deficits and have no ways 
for shifting their lines of production should settle their 
accounts and declare bankruptcy according to laws. 
  Proceeding from reality, enterprises are allowed to select 
the reform methods suitable to themselves. On the premise of 
paying taxes according to laws and guaranteeing and adding the 
value of state-owned assets, we should try every possible means 
to enliven enterprises. 
  B. It is necessary to quicken the reform in the circulation 
sphere and cultivate and develop the market system. 
  We should foster the awareness of developing large-scale 
commerce and trade, cultivating large markets, and enlivening 
the circulation sphere on a large scale; be determined to 
quicken the pace of cultivating and developing the market 
system; and strive to build the municipality into a commercial 
and trade commercial center in north China. 
  We should exert great efforts to well run the existing 
markets. The established national and regional markets for 
capital goods and the markets for various commodities should 
strive to build themselves into the first-grade markets in the 
country and enhance their influential power and attractiveness. 
Wholesale markets should be set up for bulk agriculture 
produce, industrially produced consumer goods, and capital 
goods. A group of large-scale and high- quality commodity 
markets should newly be built and reconstructed. Several 
large-sized goods purchasing centers should be set up. Another 
group of specialized wholesale markets and overall trade fairs 
should be developed in the areas linking the urban areas with 
the rural ones. Various categories of markets should be sure 
that business is brisk so as to expand and enliven their 
business. The total commodity purchasing and marketing volume 
and the total volume of retail sales of commodities should 
increase by a big margin. It is necessary to quicken the 
development of the markets for various production factors. 
Emphasis should be placed on setting up labor markets, skilled 
persons exchange and service centers, technology markets, 
information markets, real estate markets, construction markets, 
and markets for transfer of enterprise property rights. It is 
necessary to firmly grasp the construction of a state-level 
technological trading market in north China. Particularly, we 
should vigorously develop banking markets and positively open 
stock exchange centers and gold trading centers in Tianjin. We 
should positively develop such self-disciplined organizations as 
professional intermediate organizations of market, trade 
associations, and chambers of commerce. By dividing duties, all 
departments should positively support the setup of markets, 
abolish "unnecessary outposts," enthusiastically offer service, 
and try all possible means to bring in more skilled persons, 
goods, and capital. 
  C. We should conscientiously implement the state 
macroeconomic reform measures and positively achieve the reform 
of the income distribution, social security, land utilization, 
and housing systems. 
  In 1994, the country as a whole should make bigger strides 
in 
reforming the financial, tax revenue, financial, investment, 
foreign trade, and planning systems. Resolutely in line with 
the unified arrangements of the central authorities, we should 
proceed from the overall situation, make a unified arrangement, 
and carefully organize forces for implementation. We should 
conscientiously work out and implement plans, positively and 
steadily coordinate with various fronts, actively suit various 
reform requirements, and further improve and strengthen the 
macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  It is necessary to set up a reasonable individual income 
distribution system. On the premise that the increase rate of 
the wage bills of the staff and workers is lower than the 
enterprise economic efficiency growth rate and the enterprise 
labor productivity growth rate, the state-owned enterprises 
should decontrol the management of their wages. That is, 
enterprises have the right to deciding their wage levels and 
internal distribution forms. We should conscientiously reform 
the wage system of organs and institutions. The administrative 
organs should carry out the state functionary system and the 
state functionary wage system. The institutions with conditions 
are able to carry out the enterprise wage system. 
  We should establish a multi-layered social security system, 
and take active and reliable steps to accelerate reform of the 
old-age pension, unemployment, and medical insurance systems for 
workers. It is necessary to actively promote reform of the land 
utilization system, give full play to our municipality's 
advantages of land resources, adopt flexible forms, speed up the 
pace to invite business and investments, and achieve great 
breakthroughs in the scale of transferring land-use rights and 
in introducing foreign capital. We should further expedite the 
pace of reforming the housing system in cities and towns, give 
simultaneous attention to selling, renting and building houses 
while giving due emphasis to selling publicly owned houses, 
adopt supporting policies to form a market so as to accelerate 
the commercialization and socialization of houses. 
  D. We should realistically change government functions and 
actively carry out organizational reform. 
  In line with the central plans and the principle of 
separating government functions from enterprise management, 
streamlining organs, adopting unified plans, and paying 
attention to efficacy, we conscientiously conduct reform of the 
administrative management system and organizational reform, 
promote the public servant system, and achieve breakthrough 
progress in changing the government functions. Governments 
should not manage enterprise affairs or directly interfere with 
their production and management activities, and should decontrol 
their operation. As for macroeconomic activities which must be 
managed, the governments should reduce and simplify procedures 
and raise the working efficiency; they should realistically 
shift the emphasis of work to working out overall plans, 
attending to policies, using information guidance, organizing 
and coordinating the work, providing service, and inspecting and 
supervising the work. In short, we should strive not to 
interfere with the work of enterprise, give less interference, 
give more services, help the grass roots and enterprises 
eliminate misgivings and difficulties, and do more practical 
things for them. 
  E. We should further expand opening up to all directions, 
both domestically and internationally, and accelerate the pace 
of using foreign capital. 
  We should open the municipality to all directions, to the 
higher layer, a broader sphere, and in a comprehensive manner, 
and regard using foreign capital of a larger scale as a 
prominent task. In 1994, the whole municipality should strive 
to reach agreements in directly using a total of more than $5 
billion in foreign capital, of which, more than $3.5 billion 
should be investments from foreign businessmen. All trades and 
professions should be bold and given a free hand in using 
foreign capital. It is necessary to make major breakthroughs in 
building infrastructure facilities, carrying out major 
industrial items, conducting grafting and transformation in old 
enterprises, and attracting big financial groups and 
trans-country companies to build large projects, develop real 
estate, and develop the tertiary industry. In addition to 
grasping major items, we should not neglect small ones. Through 
two years of efforts, we should strive to make 50 percent of 
industrial enterprises, of which, two-thirds of budgetary 
industrial enterprises, use foreign capital. We should attend 
to the signed foreign capital items and speed up their 
construction and operation as quickly as possible. All 
committees, offices, and bureaus, and all districts and counties 
should realistically strengthen leadership, encourage the top 
leaders to grasp this work personally, assign one leading 
comrade to manage it specifically, and establish special organs 
or work groups to take charge of the work. We should regard 
using foreign capital as an essential task, share the targets to 
all departments and localities, and conduct evaluation in line 
with the demand of the "six ratios." Personnel who contribute to 
introducing foreign capital should be awarded. 
  We should make strenuous efforts to improve the investment 
environment. It is necessary to uphold and improve the system of 
completing the examination and approval procedures in "one 
place," giving "integrated" service, and jointly handling 
official work, actively create conditions for running the 
existing foreign-funded enterprises well, improve the relevant 
policies, laws, and regulations, do a good job in conducting 
external propaganda, strive to build our municipality into one 
of the areas with the best investment environment in our 
province, enable the domestic and foreign businessmen feel an 
ease of mind in making investments and convenient in doing 
things in Tianjin, and that they can earn money from production 
and operation, and can be guaranteed in their legal rights and 
interests. 
  Economic and technological zone, free trade zone, and the 
new-tech industrial park are the showcases and a dragon head of 
Tianjin in opening to the outside world. During this year, we 
must have new ideas, adopt new measures, accelerate the pace of 
development and construction, and strive to take the lead in all 
fields of work in the whole country. 
  A large-scale increase should be made in foreign export 
trade. We should further rationalize the foreign trade 
management system, transform the mechanism of foreign trade 
enterprises, and guide foreign trade enterprises to take the 
road of integration, industrialization, and 
internationalization. Non-foreign trade enterprises should be 
encouraged to deal in exports independently and strengthen their 
ability of dealing in export and earning foreign exchange. 
  An even greater steps should be taken in the opening to the 
domestic areas. Tianjin should be opened wider to other places, 
and service should be improved in order to promote integrations 
through good service and promote development through 
integrations. Central departments and the places other than 
Tianjin should be attracted to make investment actively in 
Tianjin. The important role of their agencies stationed in 
Tianjin should be brought into full play. Emphasis should be 
placed on the integrations and coordination among Beijing, 
Tianjin, and Hebei in order to commonly build the "large 
Beijing-Tianjin economic circle" in line with the principles of 
being integrated to make the best possible use of advantages and 
to make up for the deficiency, making overall plans, and 
effecting a common development. Great efforts should be made to 
strengthen the economic integrations and coordination with the 
areas in north, northeast, and northwest China, and, in 
particular, with various fraternal provinces and municipalities 
in the areas around Bohai Bay. 
  F. We should accelerate the pace of readjustment and 
optimize economic structure. 
  The acceleration of economic development must be based on 
optimization of structure and improvement of economic returns. 
  Great efforts should be made to readjust product mix. All 
categories of enterprises in the municipality should fix their 
eyes on the market and try every possible means to readjust 
their product mix. They should renew old products and develop 
new products in a timely manner to make their products more 
competitive and marketable. Through the endeavor of one to two 
years, we should turn out a large number of new fine-quality, 
brand-name, or competitive products in order to restore the 
magnificent appearance of Tianjin's industry. 
  We should further attend to the readjustment of industrial 
structure. In this aspect, emphasis should be placed on 
developing energy resources, communications and 
telecommunications, and basic raw materials industries and on 
turning out the products that coordinate the production of 
pillar industries and key foreign-invested enterprises of three 
types. Positive support should be given to light industrial and 
textile industrial enterprises to open up new paths and change 
mechanism. Construction of water, power, gas, and heat supply 
facilities and construction of roads and other infrastructure 
facilities should be accelerated to enhance cities' functions as 
the carrier. Great efforts should be put in accelerating the 
building of ports. Great efforts should also be made in 
developing commercial trade, storage of goods, financial 
insurance, transportation and communications, service to 
residents, information consultation, labor export, and all sorts 
of professional intermediate service trades. Development of 
tourism with Tianjin's characteristics should be expedited. 
Real estate trade should be developed rapidly on a priority 
basis. Domestic and foreign investment should be absorbed from 
a wide range to form a pattern of developing the tertiary 
industry in diverse forms, through diverse channels, and at 
diverse levels. 
  Attention should be paid to readjusting investment 
structure, 
with emphasis on improving economic returns. Capital 
construction projects and technological transformation projects 
should be arranged in line with the principles of conforming to 
industrial policies, having good markets, and having good 
economic returns in order to spend the money on where they are 
needed most. 
  G. We should actually strengthen management work and ask for 
good economic returns, efficiency, and levels from management. 
  First, we should pay attention to management of enterprises. 
We should vigorously grasp the management of basic projects and 
special-purpose projects, strictly enforce rules of operation 
and various regulations and systems, strictly enforce labor 
discipline, straighten out production order, and achieve results 
in cutting production cost and improving quality. Second, we 
should grasp management of work. All departments and units 
should conscientiously perform various regulations and systems 
and strictly enforce work discipline in order to establish a 
good work order and constantly improve work efficiency and 
expertise. Third, we should grasp the management of trades. 
The emphasis of this work is to strengthen the overall, 
coordination, guidance, and service work. Fourth, we should 
grasp the management of safety. The system of assuming 
responsibility for the safety in production should be carried 
out conscientiously and the various safety control system should 
be executed strictly so as to eliminate all sorts of hidden 
peril, prevent the emergence of accidents of all kinds, and 
ensure the safety of state property and of the people. Fifth, we 
should pay attention to the management of investment. The 
project owner responsibility system should be applied to 
construction projects, and the progress of construction should 
be guaranteed, the quality of the projects upgraded, and the 
efficiency of investment improved. Sixth, we should pay 
attention to social management. we should strengthen the 
management of the overall plan of the city and establish and 
improve the scientific and strict managerial methods. We should 
strengthen management of the city appearance, municipal 
administration, environmental protection, and environmental 
sanitation and improve the management and service of the units 
and departments that serve as "windows" so that Tianjin can 
become a city with a beautiful environment, a good order, and 
quality service. All departments and units should bear in mind 
Tianjin's status as the municipality under the direct 
jurisdiction of the central government when considering all 
their work, exert great efforts to strengthen management, and 
ensure high standards and strict requirements so that all work 
will have good efficiency and high level. 
  H. We should make great efforts to cultivate and develop new 
growing points of the economy. 
  We should make great efforts to cultivate and develop more 
new growing points of the economy to maintain the vigorous 
economic growth, promote faster economic development, and 
enhance the capacity for long-term development. First, we 
should have more courage to develop township enterprises and 
foreign-invested enterprises, increase their number, expand 
their scale, raise their level, and improve their efficiency. 
We should relax policies and actively develop the individual 
and private economies. We should develop the neighborhood 
economy more rapidly in line with specific local conditions. We 
should adopt effective measures to speed up the 
industrialization of high and new technology. Second, from 
large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, we should develop 
a number of backbone enterprises and a number of highly 
competitive products which can exert a great influence, make 
great contributions, reflect advanced domestic and world levels, 
serve as models in reform and management, and pay large amounts 
of taxes and profits. We should carry out the "222 project." 
That is, we should make a success of the two key enterprises -- 
the Auto Industrial General Company and the Steep Tube Company, 
make a success of the 20 municipal-level key enterprises, and 
make a success of the 200 key enterprises of various bureaus, 
districts, and counties. Third, we should speed up the 
construction of the ethylene, the polyester, and other key 
capital construction and technical transformation projects and 
make the investment yield returns as soon as possible. Fourth, 
we should learn from the opening up and development of 
Shanghai's Pudong New Area to accelerate the opening up and 
development of Tianjin's coastal new area and strive to build it 
into an area with coordinated development of finance, commerce, 
foreign trade, and other trades of the tertiary industry, which 
is centering on the harbor, the development zone, and the bonded 
zone, guided by new and export-oriented industries, and based on 
several pillar industries in about 10 years. We should organize 
forces from all quarters to step up formulation of specific 
plans and definite targets and put them into practice as soon as 
possible. 
  I. We should conscientiously strengthen agriculture and 
rural work. 
  We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 
national rural work conference, attach great importance to 
agriculture and rural work, further strengthen the fundamental 
position of agriculture, persist in the integrated and common 
development of urban and rural areas, and speed up Tianjin's 
agricultural modernization. The general requirements are to 
actively develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient 
agriculture; to achieve faster development of township 
enterprises; to greatly promote the spiritual civilization in 
rural areas; and to substantially increase peasants' income. 
  We should continue to stabilize and improve the 
responsibility system with household-based and output-related 
contracts as the major form and the dual management system 
combining unified operation with independent operation. 
Operations adaptable to scaled economy may be adopted based on 
the voluntary participation of the masses. We should improve 
the rural socialized service system, greatly develop the 
integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture and 
the coordinated operation of production, processing, and 
marketing, and actively cultivate the rural market system. We 
should increase the investment in agriculture through various 
channels and intensify construction of the basic facilities for 
agriculture to enhance the capacity to resist floods and other 
natural disasters. We should pay great attention to developing 
agriculture with science and technology and increase the 
investment in science and technology. On the premise that a 
steady increase in grain production is guaranteed and the 
"shopping basket" project is made successful, we should actively 
adjust the structure of agriculture and the production setup of 
rural areas and expand the diversified economy. We should 
continue to successfully reduce the burdens on peasants and 
enterprises. 
  Town and township enterprises should further accelerate the 
pace of development and develop as quickly as possible. We 
should firmly attend to implementing the "project for rising to 
a new height in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period." We should 
positively carry out the share holding system, develop 
enterprise associations, boldly use foreign capital to conduct 
technological transformation, develop joint ventures, and 
further enhance enterprise vitality. We should pay attention to 
technological transformation and strive to expand the scale and 
to improve quality. It is necessary to develop increasingly 
more townships, villages, enterprises, and enterprise 
associations that each generates over 100 million yuan or 1 
billion yuan of output value annually. 
  J. We should rely on science, technology, and education to 
rejuvenate the economy of Tianjin. 
  It is necessary to further implement the principle of 
relying 
on science and technology to rejuvenate the municipality and 
increase the proportion of scientific and technological progress 
in economic development. We should organize scientific and 
technological forces to tackle major technological problems 
cropping up in the course of production and construction while 
assimilating imported technologies and blazing new trails in 
importing technologies. We should pay attention to bringing 
into play the roles of the central scientific research 
organizations stationed in Tianjin. The existing scientific and 
technological findings should be popularized and applied as soon 
as possible. It is also necessary to set up a system for 
tracing and assessing the popularization and application of 
scientific and technological findings. It is necessary to speed 
up the construction of new technology park zones and to firmly 
work out and begin implementation of the plan for building a 
corridor of science and technology along the 
Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway. Applied research, development 
research, and scientific and technological service organizations 
should gradually carry out enterprise management. From now on, 
we should link the allocation of funds to scientific research 
units engaged in applied research according to efficiency gained 
from popularizing and applying scientific research findings. 
Civilian-run scientific research organizations should be 
developed positively. 
  Education is the foundation for rejuvenating the 
municipality 
with science and technology. We should conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of the municipal educational work 
conference; quicken the pace of reforming the educational system 
and developing education; exert efforts to grasp the fulfillment 
of the work tasks; ensure that thinking, work arrangements, and 
guarantee measures are put in place; and make noticeable headway 
in deepening the reform of the educational system, enhancing 
vitality in running schools, upgrading the quality of education 
and the efficiency from running schools, and serving economic 
construction. 
  We should further form a strong social practice of 
respecting 
knowledge and skilled persons, pay high attention to and 
realistically achieve work toward intellectuals, and mobilize 
and encourage the broad masses of intellectuals to make more 
contributions to the municipality's reform and development. 
  K. The eighteen districts and counties should bring their 
roles into full play. 
  We should exert great efforts to enliven districts and 
counties, delegate power to districts and counties, and bring 
their different functions into better play. In line with the 
principle of integrating responsibility with rights and profits 
alongside human, financial, and material resources, we should 
balance the relationship between the municipality and districts 
and counties. On the basis of clearly dividing the affairs and 
rights of the governments at these two different levels, we 
should reasonably define the scale and base figures of revenues 
and expenditures and enable districts and counties to retain 
more when their revenues increase. The affairs relating to 
regions and suitable to management by districts and counties 
should be managed by districts and counties. The departments 
concerned should work out specific plans, implement them as soon 
as possible, and ensure that rights should be delegated in a 
coordinated manner. 
  In line with the requirements for changing government 
functions, districts and counties should quicken reform of the 
self-management system, appropriately simplify administrative 
procedures and delegate powers to lower levels, and better 
handle affairs originally managed and assigned by the 
municipality. 
  L. We should do our best to seek benefits for the masses and 
do real deeds for the people. 
  The leading cadres at various levels should ensure that they 
keep the masses in mind, do things for the masses, and rely on 
the masses to do their work; and continue to persistently do 20 
good deeds for the urban and rural dwellers in line with the 10 
requirements as defined by the municipal party committee. In 
1994, we should improve the work of doing concrete deeds for the 
people and pay particular attention to work in the following 
three aspects: First, we should exert efforts to promote the 
economy, ceaselessly increase the income of the urban and rural 
people, create more real benefits for the people, and also pay 
attention to solving the problems for staff members and workers 
with living difficulties. Second, we should grasp the 
management of markets and goods prices and control price hikes. 
Third, in line with the implementation of the "project of 
living in peace," we should exert efforts to grasp the housing 
construction and the reconstruction of dangerous and shabby one- 
story houses, and set historical records in the areas where 
houses are built and completed. 
  M. We should further strengthen the building of the 
spiritual civilization. 
  In propaganda and ideological work, we should greatly 
advocate the major melody and persist in the unity between the 
major melody and diverse work to raise people's spirit and boost 
their morale. We should intensify the ideological and moral 
education with patriotism, collectivism, and socialism as the 
major content, advocate the pioneering spirit of the new era, 
guide the people, especially young people, to develop the 
traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, and train the new 
people who have lofty ideals and moral characters and are better 
educated and self-disciplined. We should strengthen ideological 
and political work, oppose money worship, ultra-individualism, 
and the influence of corrupt styles of life with a clear-cut 
stand, and resist the erosion of capitalist and feudal ideas. 
In press and publication work, we should persist in the correct 
guidance of the media. In cultural and art work, we should make 
active efforts to create healthy and progressive intellectual 
products. We should also achieve success in science and 
technology, education, public health, sports, afforestation, 
environmental protection, and family planning to promote 
comprehensive social progress. 
  Seizing the opportunity of hosting the 12th Asian Table 
Tennis Games and the 43d World Table Tennis Games, we should 
launch large-scale activities to "build a civilized city and 
become civilized citizens." We should widely publicize the 
theme of the games -- "peace, friendship, prosperity, 
development." Focusing on the trades that serve as "windows," 
we should extensively launch the emulation activities to "make 
people satisfied in Tianjin" and to "create good quality and 
attain targets," strive for first-rate service, first-rate 
quality, and first-rate efficiency, display Tianjin's outlook, 
and win honor for Tianjin and for the state. 
  N. We should strengthen socialist democratic politics and 
the legal system. 
  Aiming at accelerating Tianjin's reform, opening up, and 
economic development, people's congresses at all levels and 
their standing committees should exercise the power entrusted by 
the Constitution and laws, give full play to the role of 
people's deputies, speed up local legislation, and strengthen 
legal supervision. We should fully develop the role of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committees at 
all levels in political consultation and democratic supervision. 
We should strengthen the consultation with democratic parties 
to develop the advantages of all quarters. Trade unions, the 
Communist Youth League, women's federations, and other mass 
organizations should play their role still better as the bridges 
and channels for the party to establish ties with the masses. 
We should conscientiously implement the party's policies on 
nationalities, religions, and overseas Chinese affairs and 
strengthen the work directed toward Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, 
and Overseas Chinese. 
  We should conscientiously enforce the laws, administrative 
regulations, and local regulations issued by the state. We 
should step up the legal system and further establish and 
improve local regulations. We should strengthen and improve the 
law-enforcement by judicial and administrative departments and 
the supervision over law-enforcement. We should intensify the 
"Second Five-Year Plan" for the education to disseminate laws to 
enhance all the people's sense of respect for laws and the legal 
system. 
  O. We should step up efforts to comprehensively manage 
public 
security to safeguard social stability. 
  Leaders at all levels should regard the work to safeguard 
Tianjin's political and social stability as a major task to 
accomplish. They should conscientiously enforce the 
"regulations of Tianjin municipality on comprehensive management 
of public security." Following the principle that "those in 
charge hold responsibility," they should pool the efforts of 
different departments and different areas, with the focus on the 
latter, and establish a strict responsibility system for 
attaining the work targets of comprehensive management of public 
security. We should continue to adhere to the principle of 
meting out prompt and strict punishment according to law, 
sternly crack down on criminal offenses that seriously endanger 
public security and serious economic offenses, and continue the 
activities to "wipe out pornography" and eliminate the "six 
vices" to purify the social environment. Public security, 
procuratorial, and judicial departments should achieve success 
in their own reform, improve their work systems, upgrade their 
work levels, and ensure strict law-enforcement. 
<H3>  4. We Should Strengthen Leadership, Implement 
Responsibilities, Unite as One, Make Earnest Efforts To Do 
Practical Work, and Guarantee the Fulfillment of All Tasks in 
1994 </H3>
  A. We should further strengthen the building of the party 
and the party's leadership. 
  Strenuous efforts should be made to strengthen the building 
of leading bodies. We should build leading bodies at all levels 
into strong collectives that are firm in politics, and have 
courage to reform, do practical things, blaze new trials, work 
in unity and coordination, perform their administrative work 
honestly, maintain close relations with the masses of people, 
and comprehensively implement the party's basic line. We should 
conscientiously implement the principle of building ranks of 
cadres of "political integrity who are young, better educated 
and professional competent", the principle of choosing cadres 
with both ability and political integrity, and the principle of 
attending to political achievements and selecting the best 
through competition while building the leading bodies, make 
bigger strides in selecting outstanding young cadres, and do a 
better job in the exchange and readjustment of cadres. We 
should entrust cadres with outstanding achievements, good 
ideology and work style, and who enjoy mass support, 
particularly outstanding young cadres, with heavy tasks and 
boldly use them. 
  We should continue to attend to the building of grass-roots 
party organizations and enhance the cohesion and fighting 
strength of the party organizations. We should further 
strengthen the building of enterprise party organizations in 
line with the guiding principle of "giving full play to the core 
political role of enterprise party organizations, upholding and 
improving the plant director responsibility system, and 
wholeheartedly relying on the working class." 
  We should strengthen the building of party style and 
administrative honesty and continue to deepen anticorruption 
struggle in a down-to-earth manner. Leading cadres at all 
levels should be clean and self-diciplined, do their 
administrative work honestly, and serve as good examples. It is 
necessary to concentrate efforts on investigating and handling 
major and appalling cases and continue to conscientiously check 
the unhealthy trends which the masses show strong reaction. We 
should persist in unswervingly conducting education on party 
style, party discipline and clean politics, pay attention to 
building and improving the mechanism of supervision and 
restraint, and perfect the responsibility system in building 
party style and administrative honesty. 
  B. We should actively strengthen study and training and 
raise 
the quality of cadres and the worker contingents. 
  The realization of Tianjin's grand objective of reform and 
development is chiefly determined by the quality of the ranks of 
cadres and workers. Grasping study and training well is not 
only an urgent task but also a long-term plan. We should form a 
study atmosphere in the whole municipality and conduct various 
froms of study and training activities. While attending to the 
study of theories, Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, and the "decision of the CPC central Committee on 
some issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure," we should strive to gain knowledge, and 
study science, technology and professional knowledge, as well as 
foreign languages in line with the requirements of our work. We 
should arrange for the training content in line with the 
principle of "learning the most useful," study what we do not 
know and make up for the lessons we miss. It is necessary to 
conscientiously formulate study and training plans and to 
establish necessary systems. 
  Leading cadres at and above the district, county, and bureau 
level should do a good job in training as well as in leading the 
study. It is necessary to create conditions for cadres and 
workers to study and to undergo training, prepare training 
funds, and guarantee them time for study. We should extensively 
conduct a municipality-wide activity on "comparing with one 
another in the achievements of study, professional skills, and 
contributions." Relevant departments and mass organizations 
should play a positive role in promoting this municipality-wide 
study and training activity. 
  C. We should comprehensively promote the work target 
responsibility system, improve work style, raise efficiency, and 
firmly carry out this system. 
  We should comprehensively carry out this system in all party 
and government organs and departments, and enable them to meet 
high standards and set strict demands, and standardize and 
institutionalize this system. We should share the 
municipality's major economic and social development targets and 
tasks to all levels and urge them to implement them. Those that 
can be measured should be measured for evaluation, and those 
which cannot be evaluated with measurements should be given 
criteria for evaluation of work. Both economic departments and 
non-economic departments and various regions and departments 
should all be assigned with specific targets and tasks so that 
everyone has pressures and targets on their shoulders. In 
fixing targets, we should manifest the spirit of accelerating 
development and should set specific demands on time limits, 
progress rate, quantity, and quality. Some important items of 
work should be defined with the signing of letters of 
responsibility at each level. In carrying out the system 
concerning public service, we should consider the fulfillment of 
the assigned targets as an important content to assess official 
performance of leading bodies and leading cadres. In this 
aspect, each level should assume responsibility for its own work 
and supervise the work of the next lower level. Leading organs 
at higher levels should give good guidance to the work and 
supervise and examine the work of lower levels in order to truly 
yield results in this aspect. 
  We should effect a big change in work style. Subjectivism, 
bureaucratism, and formalism should be overcome. We should tell 
the truth, do tangible things, and strive for practical results, 
rather than indulging in boasting, exaggeration, and 
fraudulence. Great efforts should be made to reduce the number 
of meetings and ordinary activities. Leading cadres at or above 
the district and county levels should use at least one third of 
the year to delve deeply into the realities of life to conduct 
investigation and study. We should continue to persist in and 
perfect the good methods of "jointly handling affairs" and 
"handling affairs within a set time" that will help improve work 
efficiency. Leading organs should pay high attention to 
coordinating work well. 
  D. We should depend on the broad masses of the people and 
mobilize all positive factors to accomplish 1994's tasks. 
  We should further persist in the idea of doing everything 
for 
the people and relying on the people to do everything. The 
channels to contact with the masses should be broadened, and the 
opinions, voice, and demands of the masses should be listened to 
in a timely manner. Importance should be attached to the work 
concerning the letters and complaints of the masses. In 
fulfilling various tasks, we should always mobilize the 
initiative of the masses, depend on the masses, and strengthen 
the ideological and political work. All reform plans and all 
major work measures should garner the comprehension and support 
of the masses. Full play should be given to the role of the 
working class as the main force to carry out reform and 
construction. Old cadres should be respected and taken note of 
by bringing their role into full play and efforts should be 
given to solve the problems in the livelihood of retired veteran 
cadres and workers. "Double-support" activities should be 
carried out continuously to strengthen the unity between the 
army and the people and between the army and the government. On 
the whole, we should further strengthen the mass unity 
throughout the municipality, mobilize all positive factors, and 
pool the will and wisdom of all the people in Tianjin to attain 
the common goal of accelerating development and invigorating 
Tianjin. 
  The year 1994 is key to Tianjin's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive. The municipal party committee called on 
the vast numbers of party members, cadres, and the masses in the 
municipality to even more closely unite as one to implement the 
guidelines of the 14th party congress and of the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the leadership 
of the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its 
nucleus, and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They 
are also expected to work hard and to make bold innovations to 
fulfill all tasks and to seize the opportunity to accelerate 
reform, opening up, and modernization in Tianjin.

XINHUA Headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
"would very much like to have more trade with China", said 
Jeffrey E. Garten, visiting deputy U.S. Secretary of Commerce, 
here this morning at a press conference upon conclusion of his 
Beijing visit. 
  Garten, together with a delegation of officials from the 
U.S. 
Department of Commerce and State Department, came to Beijing as 
a part of his Asian trip aimed at boosting U.S. export-promotion 
efforts to the "big emerging markets", including China and 
Indonesia. 
  Garten said he had discussed current trade issues with 
officials of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Co-Operation (MOFTEC). 
  "The talks have been cordial, business-like and productive," 
he said. The United States and China have agreed on the agenda 
for the upcoming meeting of the bilateral Joint Committee of 
Commerce and Trade (JCCT) in mid-April in Washington. 
  "We would like to turn it into a major form of co-operation 
with China," Garten said. 
  He noted that during the meeting both sides will talk about 
trade and investment; individual industries, including 
information, energy, environmental technologies and chemicals; 
and economic reforms. 
  He said that exchanges of opinions on each other's economic 
reforms will enhance mutual understandings of differences. 
  Garten said one of the purposes of his present trip was to 
demonstrate the increasing U.S. commitment to Asia. And no 
matter what happens, he added, the U.S. and China, two of the 
world's major economies, will continue to engage in the global 
economy.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Goldman Sachs, a 
U.S. international investment bank, opened an office in Beijing 
today. 
  It is the firm's first office in China, and the 63rd 
overseas 
investment bank in Beijing. 
  Set up in 1869, the firm is a New York-based private 
partnership and it is a leading, full-service international 
investment banking and securities firm. 
  Goldman Sachs has 148 partners and about 8,200 employees 
located in offices in 30 major cities worldwide. 
  Henry Paulson, a partner of Goldman and member of the firm's 
management committee, said that one of the focuses of the 
business is on Asia. 
  He said that the reason why his firm invested great sums in 
China was its belief that China's economy and its financial 
market will be one of the important parts of the global economy. 
  Peter Wheeler, the firm's Beijing chief representative, said 
that in 1993, Goldman Sachs acted as lead or co-lead manager in 
11 bond issues for Chinese companies, totalling 2 billion U.S. 
dollars in Europe, the United States and Asia. 
  Early this year, the firm was a co-lead manager for China's 
global bond offering of 1 billion U.S. dollars. 
  With the improvement of the investment environment in China, 
more overseas banks have entered China's market. 
  Now about 100 overseas banks from more than 20 countries 
have 
set up branches or offices in China.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "The Incident of Double-Faced Spy Struck the </F>
United States"] 
  [Text] On 22 February, the U.S. Department of Justice 
announced that the FBI, after conducting an investigation for 
two years, had detected a serious spy incident and arrested a 
high-level official of the CIA and his wife who have been 
involved in espionage activities for the former Soviet Union and 
Russia for a long time. 
  Aldrich Ames, 52, who was in charge of Russian affairs in 
the 
antiespionage organization of the CIA, and his wife, 41, have 
been prosecuted for committing espionage activities. 
  On 21 February, the FBI arrested Ames on his way to the 
office and his wife at home. Ames was employed by the CIA for 
31 years. He engaged in espionage activities for the former 
Soviet Union and Russia for a long time. 
  This high-ranking U.S. intelligence official was revealed to 
be a double spy who sold out U.S. secrets to the former Soviet 
Union, and after it was dissolved, to Russia from 1985. 
  Maria, Ames' wife who was studying at a college until she 
was 
arrested, was born in Colombia and worked as an agent for the 
CIA until she moved to the United States. 
  The U.S. Department of Justice noted that this is one of the 
largest spy incidents in history, and the volume and sensitivity 
of intelligence gathered by this spy couple are very rare. 
  U.S. social circles were surprised by the announcement of 
the 
Ames spy incident. President Clinton stated that this is a very 
serious incident and that the United States will immediately 
lodge a protest with the Russian Government. 
  According to Justice Department officials, the FBI began 
investigation of Ames based on material from an intelligence 
official of the State Security Bureau of the former Soviet Union 
who defected to the United States two years ago. 
  The FBI tapped a telephone, collected typewriter ribbons 
used 
by the Ames, examined trash and copying materials they threw 
away and documents saved in their computers. The FBI also 
conducted investigation of their income and expenditures. As a 
result, the FBI finally obtained sufficient evidence and 
indicted the Ames couple on suspicion of espionage activities. 
The FBI then arrested them and is now investigating the case. 
  According to the document of indictment, which consisted of 
39 pages filed, the FBI has seized a large number of material 
proving that Ames engaged in spy activities. 
  The FBI announced that over the past 10 years, the Ames 
couple offered top secret material to the former Soviet Union 
and Russia pertaining to activities of intelligence officials 
and agents of the former Soviet Union and Russia who cooperated 
with the United States and the CIA. They received at least $1.5 
million in return. 
  The revelation of the spy incident involving the Ames couple 
gravely embarrassed the Clinton government. The press report 
noted that Clinton has already offered $4.1 billion in 
assistance to Moscow in order to help Yeltsin establish 
democratic systems and push ahead with economic reform. 
Nevertheless, Russian spies are still maneuvering to steal 
secret intelligence from the United States and even skillfully 
infiltrated the CIA. The press urged Washington to reexamine 
relations with Moscow.

  [Text] Washington, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
Administration spent an estimated 575,000 U.S. dollars last week 
to help American military industry promote its products at a 
major air show in Singapore, it was reported here today. 
  The Defense Department sent 75 U.S. military personnel and 
20 
top-of-the line fighters, bombers and other military aircraft to 
Asian Aerospace '94, a five-day international aircraft 
exhibition that ended yesterday, according to THE WASHINGTON 
POST. 
  The aircraft the Pentagon dispatched to Singapore included 
the three F/A-18s, an Air Force F-15C strike plane and four U.S. 
Army helicopters, totalling 13 types of fighter planes. 
  The industry officials consider the strong U.S. military 
presence at the Singapore exhibition as a major boost the their 
[as received] sales efforts in Asian arms market. 
  An official from the industry described the participation of 
U.S. flight crews as an invaluable promotional tool because it 
showed to foreign governments that in buying U.S. aircraft they 
also were engaging in a relationship with the United States 
military. 
  The U.S. participation in the exhibition is a sign that 
Clinton government may reverse previous administration practice 
of tighter controls on U.S. weapons exports, the newspaper said. 
  U.S. arms control officials said the Clinton administration 
wants to boost American arms exports to make up for declining 
production at home. 
  The result is that the Clinton administration is undermining 
its own efforts to curb weapons exports, the U.S. Arms Control 
Association said in a statement. 
  "In publicly reversing its own policy, the administration 
sends the wrong signal to other suppliers and undercuts the 
prospects for controlling weapons proliferation," the 
association said. 
  "This is another indication that the administration is 
giving 
a higher priority to economic concerns than security concerns," 
it added. 
  THE WASHINGTON POST pointed out that the United States 
already sells for more weapons abroad than any other nations. 
  U.S. defense firms secured 32.4 billion dollars in overseas 
sales agreements during fiscal 1993, according to figures 
compiled by arms control groups. 
  U.S. arms exports in 1992 accounted for nearly half of all 
arms sales worldwide by all countries combined, the newspaper 
said.

  [Text] Moscow, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian 
Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov today described as a 
"blasphemous deed" the release of opposition leaders including 
former Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov and former Vice President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy from prison. 
  The spokesman stressed in a statement, as the first official 
reaction from the presidential side, that "the State Duma (the 
lower house of the parliament) becomes a participant in 
lawlessness." 
  "The responsibility for this act of moral violence fully 
rests on the State Duma, primarily the parties that initiated 
and supported the blasphemous deed for the first time in the 
history of world parliamentarianism," Kostikov said. 
  Khasbulatov and Rutskoy as well as four other opposition 
leaders, who were arrested in the bloody attack on the 
parliament building, or White House, in early October last year, 
left Moscow's Lefortovo Prison Saturday afternoon, in accordance 
with an amnesty decision adopted by the State Duma last 
Wednesday. 
  The presidential spokesman said that "it is an outrage upon 
justice and a rejection of public opinion and the opinion of the 
president elected by popular vote." 
  "Haste and insistence with which the State Duma worked to 
achieve the immediate implementation of its resolution, and 
actually to conceal the evil done to Russia, testify to its 
encouragement of political extremism instead of striving for 
civil peace and accord," he added. 
  Kostikov stressed that "the Russian president reserves the 
right to act in accordance with his constitutional powers in the 
illegal situation which has shaped up."

  [Text] Moscow, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Russia plans to cut 
its armed forces but keep dozens of military bases in other 
former Soviet republics, Colonel General Mikhail Koleshikov, 
chief of staff of Russian armed forces, said today. 
  In an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency, Koleshikov 
stressed, "all kinds of the Russian armed forces without 
exception will be reorganized in the near future for the purpose 
of the reduction of the Army." 
  However, he continued, so far the Defense Ministry is not 
prepared "to switch over to a different structural system," he 
believed that any reorganization inevitably entails the 
destruction of the command system which cannot be allowed. 
  The colonel-general also said Russia plans to have about 
thirty military bases in other former Soviet republics, some of 
the bases would be created from the existing Russian divisions 
deployed in some of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) 
republics, such as the 201th Division in Tajikistan. 
  In other places, as for instance in Azerbaijan, the base 
would be created around anti-missile warning systems, Koleshikov 
said. 
  He said Russia plans no military bases in Ukraine, where the 
Black Sea Fleet will have its special status, he did not exclude 
that Russia's 14th Army in Moldova's breakaway Dniester region 
will also be reorganized into a military base, but added that it 
well could be pulled out. 
  According to the chief of General Staff, almost all the 
republics of the former Soviet Union have themselves expressed 
willingness to have Russian military bases on their territory. 
  The three Baltic states are an exception, the 
colonel-general 
pointed out.

  [Text] Moscow, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Russia will establish 30 
military bases in all the members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) except Ukraine, the chief of staff of 
the Russian armed forces, Mikhail Kolesnikov, said today. 
  The INTERFAX news service quoted Kolesnikov as saying that 
the military bases will be set up on the sites inherited from 
the former Soviet troops. 
  Russia will sign relevant agreements with the countries 
concerned so as to legalize the process of establishing those 
bases. 
  Armenia has already signed such an agreement with Russia. 
  Some CIS countries called for the withdrawal of Russian 
troops following the break-up of the Soviet Union. But due to 
difficulties in establishing their own army, these countries 
have changed their mind in order to have an army to maintain 
order and security. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced for the first time 
Russia's desire to establish military bases in CIS countries 
when he was visiting Georgia in January. 
  CIS defense ministers also held a meeting in late February 
in 
Moscow on military cooperations.

  [Text] Geneva, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Following is an 
extracted version of a speech by Jin Yongjian, head of the 
Chinese delegation at the 50th session of the [UN] Commission on 
Human Rights, in Geneva today: 
  The Chinese Government always attaches great importance to 
the promotion and protection of human rights, and has endeavored 
to guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all 
its citizens through legislative, judicial and other measures. 
Chinese Constitution clearly stipulates that all the power of 
the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. According 
to the Constitution, the Chinese citizens enjoy extensive 
political, economic, cultural and social rights. They also 
enjoy various kinds of freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, 
press, assembly, demonstration and religious believes, etc. 
  The Constitution provides for the equality of all the 56 
nationalities in the country irrespective of their population 
sizes and prohibits oppression of and discrimination against any 
nationality. In the light of its own specific conditions in the 
country, the Chinese Government is stepping up efforts to build 
up democracy and legal system with the view to further promoting 
social development and upholding the people's rights and 
interests. 
  Like many other countries, in contemporary history China was 
subjected to aggression and plundering by foreign powers. 
Before 1949, the Chinese people were for a long time victims to 
the enslavement and oppression in the hands of imperialists, 
feudalists and bureaucratic-capitalists. They lived in dire 
misery without any human right or fundamental freedom at all. 
Since the founding of New China, the Chinese Government has 
been working to uphold national independence, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, and attaches great importance to 
safeguarding the rights of the Chinese people to subsistence and 
to development. Over the past four decades, China has scored 
widely-acknowledged successes in its economic construction. 
Particularly since the adoption of the policy of reform and 
opening-up to the outside world in the late 1970s, China has 
been developing its economy at a fast pace, making a steady 
improvement in the people's living standard. Chinese citizens 
today enjoy much more human rights and fundamental freedoms than 
anytime in the past. This fact has been acknowledged by all 
unbiased persons. 
  China is a developing country with a huge population. In 
spite of the significant progress made in all field through 
decades of efforts, we are still faced with many problems. 
Because of disparities of development level among regions, some 
regions in the country are falling far behind others. The 
country has a net population growth of about fifteen to sixteen 
millions per year. Overpopulation has reduced the ratio of 
resources for each person. Bearing in mind those hard facts, the 
Chinese Government has always accorded primary importance to the 
development of its national economy and the improvement of the 
people's living standard. 
  The development of economy and the improvement of the 
people's living conditions is a basic guarantee for greater 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Political 
reform must conform to the country's specific conditions, ensure 
social stability and promote smooth economic development. At 
present, the Chinese people are focusing their energy on 
economic development, meanwhile endeavoring to strengthen 
democracy and legal system and carrying out political reform. 
In view of different historical and cultural backgrounds and 
different stages of development of different countries, we hold 
that all people have the right to choose the social systems and 
development paths suitable to the conditions of their own 
countries. No country should impose on others its own ideology 
and development pattern. 
  In the field of human rights, we believe that in the spirit 
of international cooperation and equal consultations as 
underlined in the Vienna Declaration and programme of action, 
all countries should strive for greater understanding and 
broader cooperation by means of dialogue on the basis of equal 
footing and mutual respect. We are strongly opposed to any 
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state or the 
exertion of political pressures under the pretext of human 
rights. Some Western countries, in repeatedly concocting a 
draft resolution on the so called human rights situation in 
China, are deliberately turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to 
China's progress and development and to the fact that the 
Chinese people are enjoying a broad range of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. This is a typical example of politicizing 
human rights issues and of applying pressures on China under the 
pretext of human rights. The Chinese Government is firmly 
opposed to such attempt.

China is firmly opposed to interference in the internal affairs 
of a sovereign state or the exertion of political pressures

have the right to choose the social systems and development 
paths suitable to the conditions of their own countries. No 
country should impose on others its own ideology and pattern of 
development. 
  In conclusion, Jin Yongjian said: China is consistently 
devoted to upholding the purposes and principles of the "U.N. 
Charter," and it supports the positive efforts of the 
international community to protect and promote human rights. 
The Chinese Government has acceded to eight international human 
rights conventions and has been fulfilling its obligations 
strictly in accordance with those conventions. China has been 
playing a positive and constructive role in international human 
rights affairs. In the days to come, the Chinese Government 
will, as always, continue to contribute to the protection and 
promotion of human rights.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Qianli (1728 0578 6849)] </F>
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- The State Physical 
Culture and Sports Commission held a tea party this afternoon at 
Beijing's Shoudu Stadium to warmly welcome the Chinese sports 
delegation which participated in the 17th Winter Olympic Games. 
On behalf of the State Council, Li Tieying, state councilor and 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, attended the tea 
party and congratulated the skillful Chinese winter sports 
athletes who achieved good results at the games. [passage 
omitted] 
  Speaking at the meeting, Comrade Li Tieying pointed out: 
China's winter sports started relatively late. It only 
developed and made great progress during the 15 years since 
reform and opening up. Reluctant to be left behind, coaches and 
athletes have continued to forward new goals as well as strived 
to achieve them. These are exactly the characteristics in New 
China's sports: work hard, keep forging ahead, and vie for the 
nation's glory. [passage omitted] 
  He pointed out: It was not easy for the Chinese delegation 
to obtain such results from a field of strong competitors at the 
Winter Olympic Games. The spirit of unity and arduous struggle 
they demonstrated was even more valuable. The unfair practice 
[bu gong zheng zuo fa 0008 0361 2973 0254 3127] of obvious and 
intentional shielding [ming xian di you yi tan hu 2494 7359 4104 
2589 1942 5917 6233] of one side while accusing [ze nan 6307 
7181] the other occurred in the short-track speed skating 
competition. It aroused the righteous indignation [yi fen 5030 
2001] of all fair-minded people while toughened and tested the 
Chinese team. Zhang Yanmei overcame difficulty, triumphed over 
disturbances, did well from start to finish to complete her 
competition, and won a silver medal, winning praises from public 
opinion. 
  Finally, Li Tieying expressed hope that China's winter 
sports 
athletes would earnestly sum up their experiences and lessons to 
find out where they lag behind others, and address existing 
problems. They should emancipate their minds; deepen reform; 
boldly explore and innovate; draw on the experiences of nations 
strong in winter sports and combine them with China's own 
characteristics; seize opportunities; determine their 
directions; implement outlined measures; and strive for progress 
so as to achieve "zero" breakthrough in their quest for gold 
medals in the next Winter Olympic Games. 
  Wu Shaozu, minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports 
Commission, as well as He Zhenliang, Yuan Weimin, Xu Yinsheng, 
and Liu Ji, vice ministers of the commission, also attended the 
tea party and affirmed the Chinese delegation's achievements. 
They pointed out the athletes' inadequacies and encouraged them 
to strive for greater improvement and for the country's glory in 
the future.

  [Text] Washington, March 2 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton has decided to sign an executive order reviving his 
broad legal authority to impose trade sanctions against Japan, 
it was reported here today. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES quoted senior U.S. officials as saying 
the 
President had accepted the recommendation from his economic 
advisers that he reinstate by executive order the "Super 301" 
trade retaliation mechanism. 
  Since the U.S.-Japan summit meeting failed to reach a trade 
agreement two weeks ago, the U.S. Administration has been 
considering measures to compel Japan to open markets for U.S. 
products. 
  "Super 301", passed by Congress in 1988, requires the U.S. 
trade representatives to identify the countries that maintain 
the most egregious trade barriers and to use the legislation to 
eliminate those barriers. 
  If an offending country refuses to eliminate the specific 
barriers, the U.S. president has the authority to retaliate by 
blocking an equivalent amount of that country's exports to the 
United States. 
  These officials said the President still intended to move 
cautiously and simply signing the executive order did not mean 
that he would use it against Japan immediately. 
  But some analysts argued that putting such a powerful weapon 
into place could mark a dangerous increase in U.S.-Japan trade 
tensions. 
  Reacting to THE NEW YORK TIME's report, a spokesman of 
Japanese Government said today that such a move would be 
"counterproductive" and urged the United States to use a 
"sensible" approach to the trade question.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Parliamentarians, 
experts and scholars from 14 Asian countries arrived here today 
on separate occasions to attend the 10th Asian parliamentarians' 
meeting on population and development, scheduled to open 
tomorrow. 
  The participants including representatives of the United 
Nations and other international organizations will also take 
part in the second session of the fourth executive committee of 
the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and 
Development (AFPPD). 
  The 10th Asian parliamentarians' meeting on population and 
development will be held according to a proposal made by the 
executive committee of the AFPPD at its fourth meeting held in 
Kuala Lumpur, capital of Malaysia, last October. 
  This is also the first meeting to be held in China sponsored 
by the Asian Population and Development Association (APDA). 
  The meeting is aimed at further enhancing exchanges and 
cooperation on population among parliamentarians of these 
countries. 
  The main topics of the two-day meeting are about the issue 
of 
population and development and women in the 21st century -- 
strategy for prosperity and peace. 
  Zhao Dongwan, leader of the delegation of China's National 
People's Congress (NPC) and chairman of the NPC Education, 
Science, Culture and Public Health Committee, will address the 
meeting at the opening ceremony. 
  Since its founding in 1982, the APDA has provided financial 
aid to meetings of the AFPPD. It also sponsored nine Asian 
parliamentarians' meetings on population and development, all of 
which were attended by delegations from the NPC.

<F P=106> ["People's Forum" by Mi Bohua (4717 0590 5478): "Is It </F>
Possible To Check the Advance?"] 
  [Text] The prejudice of a few foreigners against the 
Chinese people is quite deep-rooted. This is how we often feel. 
The causes may be quite complicated, but they contain traces of 
colonial ideas. As many Chinese residing abroad put it, behind a 
gentle and cultured appearance is a kind of coldness and 
contempt. For example, during a short-distance speed-skating 
race at the Winter Olympics, all the spectators saw that an 
athlete of a certain country used her arm to block Chinese 
athlete Zhang Yanmei to gain an unfair advantage. However, when 
the Chinese team leader lodged a protest, some went as far as to 
say: "It is already pretty good that you won second place." 
(See page 1 of the 26 February issue of ZHONGGUO TIYU BAO 
[CHINA SPORTS NEWSPAPER]) It seems that the rules of 
competition did not really matter, that the person already had a 
pretty good idea of which country's athlete would be in which 
place, and therefore, the enforcement of the rules differed with 
different people. 
  We do not intend to comment on whether or not the foreign 
athlete concerned harbored any motive in violating the rule. 
The right and wrong are self-evident since there are rules, and 
their were feelings expressed by the spectators. Nor do we want 
to overly criticize the referees. It is understandable that, in 
a hotly contested athletic competition, mistakes in judgment are 
sometimes unavoidable. However, it would be quite wrong to say 
that, because she was Chinese, even she was first in skill, she 
could only win the second- or third-place medals and that she 
had to thank the judge for his favor. 
  Such incidents have occurred more than once and are not 
confined to athletic competition. However, that person had, 
perhaps, talked recklessly and let the truth slip out. When you 
cannot win a medal, people laugh at you and hold you up to 
ridicule, and when you win a medal, they try to find fault with 
you, and belittle and hurt you in an enigmatic manner. In their 
minds, achievements and glory -- and gold medals -- should not 
belong to the Chinese. However, things are going contrary to 
their wishes. The Chinese have not been obstructed by hidden 
obstacles, but have become champions again and again. It is 
similar to the poem: "The wall cannot conceal the spring within 
a garden, and a branch of red apricot flowers is stretching over 
the wall." The branch of red apricot flowers that is China will 
remain beautiful and fragrant. 
  The so-called "It is already pretty good that you won second 
place" is a strange idea not worthy of refutation. However, it 
is excellent material for teaching with negative examples. It 
helps us see clearly the true color of the overbearing and 
imperious nature of some people in the international family. 
  In the eyes of some people, China is poor, backward, 
uncivilized, and not worth being mentioned at all. The Chinese 
people are still the "rural flocks" who are physically weak and 
have a wretched appearance. This is not strange. Since the 
middle of the last century, the "great Westerners" have resorted 
to beating and killing when dealing with China, signed many 
unequal treaties which humiliated the Chinese people, and took 
almost anything they wanted. Although this page of history is 
now turned, that sense of racial superiority is hard to discard. 
"When I eat the steamed bun, it is right and proper; when you 
eat the steamed bread of corn, you should content yourself with 
it." In the big international family, the Chinese people could 
only be the henchmen, and henchmen ought to be included by the 
great gentlemen. Of course, the great gentlemen are not willing 
to face the progress made by China. Perhaps they will continue 
to cling to their prejudice; or maybe they will become jealous 
when they see that they can do nothing about it, and conclude 
that they are unhappy anyway. This is not strange, for the rise 
of a nation as big as China means the fall of hegemony. If we 
link this historical background to "it is already pretty good 
that you won second place," it is not difficult to see the 
thoughts, ideas, and worries of some people. 
  The Chinese people can still remember, though not very well, 
the Paris Conference 70 years ago. Concession did not win any 
understanding and sympathy, but invited endless bullying. When 
we look back, we can still see the storms and rains of this 
century. There can be only one conclusion: Not relying on 
heaven, and not relying on earth, the Chinese people can only 
rely on themselves, and only a strong, stable, and prosperous 
China can win the respect of the people of the world. We will 
not beg the people who hold prejudices against China to change 
their views, but we must stand up courageously in the face of 
humiliation, work hard to become strong, make earnest efforts to 
invigorate the country, and prove by our real strength that 
China is great and strong and that the Chinese nation is an 
excellent nation. Facts are most convincing. 
  The whole world can see that the Chinese people are heading 
toward prosperity and rushing to a bright 21st century, and no 
one can stop the trend, whether they like it or not. The 
Chinese people have already broken their "zero" record of 
Olympic medals, have won some gold medals, and will win more 
gold medals as well. The page of the old history is turned. 
"It is already pretty good that you won second place" is only 
an outdated elegy of the old colonialism. The Chinese people, 
who have already stood up, will surely be able to compile a most 
beautiful and grandiose chapter. If you do not believe, wait 
and see!

  [Text] Washington, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Relations between 
the United States and China entered a new phase last September, 
according to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who said 
President Clinton had directed him to develop a broader set of 
relationships with China. 
  The U.S. secretary of state made the remarks this afternoon 
in the U.S. State Department during an interview with Chinese, 
Japanese, Australian and South Korean reporters, on the eve of 
his departure for a 10-day trip to Australia, Japan and China 
which begins March 4. 
  "That new relationship is symbolized most importantly by 
President Clinton's meeting with China's President Jiang Zemin 
in Seattle last November," Christopher stressed. 
  He said that he met with China's foreign minister last 
September in New York following Clinton's directive and the two 
countries agreed to develop a broader set of relationships. 
  That resulted in U.S. Secretary of Finance Lloyd Bentsen, 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and U.S. Secretary of 
Agriculture Mike Espy meeting with or having contact with 
high-level officials from China. 
  "At the same time we sought to deepen our relations as we 
are 
two prominent and great nations with tremendous resources," 
added Christopher. "It's important we have more communications 
so that we understand each other's viewpoints and problems." 
  He said that he is looking forward to meeting with Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian and discussing a full range of topics 
which would include security, political and international 
issues, trade, non-proliferation and human rights. 
  At the end of his fourth 10-day Asian trip Christopher will 
proceed to Vladivostok to meet with Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev to discuss developments in the Balkans as well as 
the tension created over the arrest of a CIA official who 
allegedly spied for Russia. 
  Christopher also answered reporters' questions concerning 
U.S.-Japan trade and the situation on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Fukuoka, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- Japan's Fukuoka 
Prefectural government, the Fukuoka Prefectural Sino-Japanese 
Friendship Association, and the Kyushu Yamaguchi Economic 
Association held a grand banquet at the New Otani Hotel in 
Hakata this evening to warmly welcome Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji and his party on their arrival in Fukuoka. 
  Fukuoka Prefecture Governor Hachiji Okuda gave a welcome 
speech at the banquet. He said: Fukuoka is an important port 
in the 2,000-year history of exchanges between Japan and China. 
It has established friendly relations with China's Jiangsu 
Province. In addition, four cities in the prefecture have 
established friendship ties with Chinese cities. The Fukuoka 
people are ready to take further steps to help develop 
friendship and cooperation between Japan and China. 
  In his speech, Zhu Rongji praised Fukuoka Prefecture for its 
relentless efforts to develop Sino-Japanese friendship not only 
in the past but also at the present. Zhu Rongji said: 
Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations have developed 
rapidly in recent years. However, Fukuoka still has great 
potential for developing economic relations with China. I hope 
the two sides will work hard to continue to expand cooperation 
between Fukuoka and China. 
  Before concluding their visit to Osaka, Zhu Rongji and his 
party also visited Okayama Prefecture, where they visited the 
Seto Ohashi Bridge. Zhu Rongji praised the ocean bridge for its 
magnificent construction and attractive layout. He also 
inquired about the economic benefits obtained from the bridge's 
construction.

  [Excerpts] Kitakyushu (Japan), 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his party, who are on a tour of 
Japan's Fukuoka Prefecture, visited the Yasukawa Electric 
Machinery Company in Kitakyushu city this afternoon. They were 
accorded a warm welcome. 
  On display in the company's reception hall, where Zhu Rongji 
and the other Chinese guests entered, was a horizontal board 
inscribed with four big characters: "Peace in the World." It 
was given to Mr. Keiichro Yasukawa, founder of the electric 
machinery company, by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of 
China's democratic revolution. [passage omitted] 
  Zhu Rongji told Mr. Yasukawa with deep feeling: "The 
Yasukawa family's support and assistance to Dr. Sun Yat-sen 
contributed to China's revolution, and to friendship between the 
Chinese and Japanese people. I feel it is particularly 
meaningful to visit your company today. I come for friendship 
between the Chinese and Japanese people that will last from this 
generation to future generations." 
  Yasukawa Electric Machinery Company manufactured the world's 
first electric-powered industrial robots in 1970, and since then 
it has been a leading industrial robots manufacturer in the 
world. As Zhu Rongji and his party entered the company's 
workshop amidst applause, a pair of robots danced to welcome the 
Chinese guests. One robot, accompanied by a lady, presented a 
bouquet of beautiful fresh flowers to Zhu Rongji. The vice 
premier and his entourage viewed the demonstration of different 
robots with great interest. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Chairman Qiao Shi of 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) 
had a warm and friendly conversation on furthering China-Belau 
[Palau] ties here today with a congressional delegation from 
this island country in West Pacific. 
  Qiao expressed the hope that Belau, a trustee of the United 
States, will win full independence at an early date in 
accordance with its people's desire. 
  Describing the delegation's visit as a good beginning for 
promoting Sino-Belau relations, Qiao hoped for more exchanges 
between the two sides after Belau's independence. 
  Qiao also reaffirmed China's consistent position that 
countries, big or small, strong or weak, should be equals and 
all countries must respect each other and have the right to go 
their own ways in the light of different conditions. 
  The visitors, led by Yutaka Gibbons, who is the chief 
Aibedul, arrived here yesterday. 
  Gibbons thanked the hosts for their hospitality and 
expressed 
the hope that Belau and China will have more contacts. 
  Present at the meeting was NPC Vice-Chairman Li Peiyao. 
After the meeting, Li hosted a dinner in honor of the visitors.

  [Text] Any attempt by China to punish British firms in its 
row over political reform in Hong Kong would be "completely 
unacceptable" to Europe, Sir Leon Brittan, European Trade 
Commissioner, said yesterday. 
  In a sharp exchange with Wu Yi, China's Foreign Trade 
Minister, during a press conference in Beijing, Sir Leon said: 
"Any action that discriminated against one member state on 
political grounds would be a very serious matter -- not just for 
that country, but for the European Union as a whole. 
  "I want to make quite clear that the foundation of the 
relationship between the European Union as a whole and China is 
one of non-discrimination." 
  When Wu jokingly suggested that Sir Leon had issued his 
warning because he was a Briton, he replied this had "nothing to 
do with it. 
  "I speak as the commissioner whose task it is to represent 
the interests of the European Union as a whole. And if Madame 
Wu doesn't fully appreciate that, I'm glad to make it clear now." 
  He did not say how Brussels might react to any 
discrimination. But Community officials have hinted they could 
take retaliatory action against China, which runs a big trade 
surplus with Europe. 
  Sir Leon, visiting Beijing to discuss various trade issues, 
was responding to remarks by Wu that suggested the row over 
democratic reform plans in Hong Kong would inevitably affect 
Sino-British trade. British businessmen have been concerned by 
China's threats to exclude firms from lucrative contracts.

Financial Arrangements Must Keep Expenditures Within the Limits

Could Honor Its Repeated Promise of Keeping More Reserves For

  [Text] Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the Hong Kong 
branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said yesterday: We have just 
received the Hong Kong Government's financial budget proposal 
but have not yet been able to study it. However, he stated: 
Financial arrangements must uphold the principle of "keeping 
expenditures within the limits of revenue." 
  He said: Financial arrangements should be given a long-term 
consideration and are not something that can be accomplished in 
a year. The Hong Kong Government must give consideration to its 
operations for the next several years. Should anything 
unexpected happen, it must have fully adequate financial 
reserves to cope with the situation. Moreover, the Hong Kong 
Government must also consider that, after the reversion of 
sovereignty, there must be a basic convergence financially as 
well as a sizable amount of reserves to enable the Hong Kong 
economy to continue to expand. 
  Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong Kong Branch of 
the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said: Yesterday afternoon, we received 
the Hong Kong Government's financial budget proposal for the new 
financial year. This is represents a change the previous 
practice of giving the document to the agency only after the 
financial budget proposal was made public. He stated: If the 
Hong Kong Government has a financial surplus and is willing to 
leave it to the SAR Government, we will suggest that the 
government sign something to show its commitment. He said: 
Every year the Hong Kong Government remarks that it is leaving 
large quantities of reserves. He expressed the hope that the 
Hong Kong Government could effectively implement its statements. 
  Moreover, he said: It is hoped that the Hong Kong Government 
will leave 25 billion [no currency specified] in financial 
reserves to the SAR Government in accordance with the Memorandum 
of Understanding on the new airport.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 2 (XINHUA) -- The first group of 43 
Hong Kong people from all walks of life, who have just finished 
a two-year term as Hong Kong affairs advisers, will continue 
their service with an invitation renewal ceremony held here 
today. 
  Presenting the certificates for the renewal to the advisers 
including Fok Ying-tung were Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, and Zhou Nan, 
director of XINHUA news agency Hong Kong branch. 
  At the ceremony, Lu Ping spoke highly of the valuable 
opinions and suggestions the advisers made over the past two 
years for Hong Kong's transition and the transfer of government 
in 1997. 
  "This shows your sense of responsibility for realizing the 
'one country, two systems' concept, achieving the smooth 
transition, and maintaining prosperity and stability in Hong 
Kong," Lu said. 
  Analyzing the current situation in Hong Kong, he said that a 
series of unilateral actions the Hong Kong British authorities 
took recently demonstrated their determination to continue the 
policy of confrontation with China in three years odds [as 
received] before 1997. 
  This will help all kindhearted people have a clearer 
knowledge about the British side, cast away the illusion for 
"cooperation", a lip service by the British side, and strengthen 
"our resolve to guarantee Hong Kong's smooth transition together 
with our Hong Kong compatriots," Lu said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 28 February (XINHUA)--Zhu Yucheng, 
deputy director of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA News 
Agency, criticized the British Hong Kong Government for changing 
the Airport Authority into an airport corporation, with an aim 
to shifting the debts for the construction of the new airport to 
the future special administration government. 
  When attending a soiree yesterday, Zhu Yucheng said: On the 
new airport issue, the Chinese side has all along acted in 
accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on the new 
airport, but the British side has delayed for a long time before 
advancing its fourth financial proposal. There is still a big 
problem with the proposal, that is, who will actually bear the 
debt amounting to 23 billion Hong Kong dollars or so? The 
British Hong Kong Government intends to turn the Airport 
Authority into a so-called "corporation," saying that the debts 
will be shifted to the "corporation" in the future. However, the 
behind-the-scenes backer of the "corporation" is the Hong Kong 
Government. Like the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, the 
corporation is fully funded by the Hong Kong Government. 
Therefore, superficially, the new airport's debts are shifted to 
the "corporation" but at the end, they will be borne by the 
future special administrative region government and will be all 
shifted to the compatriots in Hong Kong. 
  Zhu Yucheng pointed out: The objective of the Britons before 
quitting Hong Kong is very clear. Economically, grabbing the 
maximum benefits and politically, making arrangements for their 
group [ban zi 3803 1311], in an attempt to compel the special 
administrative region government to accept it and thus exercise 
British rule without the Britons. He hoped that the Hong Kong 
people would cast away illusions and no longer expect that a 
colonialist official could leave anything good for them. 
British officials can only grab the maximum benefits for the 
British side.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "How Should the Breakdown of Sino-British Talks </F>
Be Viewed?"] 
  [Text] After the British Government unilaterally made 
public the proceedings in the Sino-British talks on the issue of 
Hong Kong's political structure in the form of a White Paper, 
yesterday, Chris Patten gazetted the remaining part of his 
"constitutional reform package." Thus, cooperation between 
China and Britain on the Hong Kong issue became completely 
impossible, and the door to reopening the talks was tightly 
closed by the British side. The Chinese side solemnly stated 
that the three-tiered political structure formed according to 
the legislation of the British Hong Kong authorities under the 
condition of no agreement being reached by the Chinese side and 
the British side would not be extended beyond 30 June 1997. At 
that time, the Chinese side would reorganize the three-tiered 
political structure according to the Basic Law and the Joint 
Declaration in order to realize the political ideal of "one 
country, two systems" and Hong Kong people's exercise of 
administration in Hong Kong. 
  Yesterday, at the party to celebrate the coming of the new 
spring held by the Preliminary Work Committee for the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administration 
Region, State Council Premier Li Peng made an explicit 
statement. He said that, henceforth, the Preliminary Work 
Committee would shoulder heavier duties and play a more 
important role. This indicated that the transitional period in 
Hong Kong had entered a new stage. 
  Yesterday, Wang Fengchao, deputy director of the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, also announced in 
Beijing that, because the British side deviated from cooperation 
with the Chinese side, the Chinese side had no other option but 
to "build another kitchen" according to the provisions of the 
Basic Law and the Joint Declaration. 
  That is to say, before China resumes sovereignty over Hong 
Kong on 1 July 1997, each of the two sides may go its own way 
and do what it likes in shaping Hong Kong's political structure 
in the remaining transitional period of some three years. The 
British Hong Kong Government will adopt Patten's original 
package, while the Chinese side will rely on the Preliminary 
Work Committee and other institutions to unite the vast majority 
of Hong Kong compatriots to make preparations in all fields for 
Hong Kong's return to China strictly in accordance with the 
spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. 
It is expected that the work in this period will be arduous and 
difficult, but it is also a sacred task of which we are proud. 
  In the fierce dispute between the Chinese side and the 
British side, the Hong Kong compatriots have gradually come to 
clearly see the fact that Britain has never been willing to 
honestly return sovereignty over Hong Kong to China. After the 
4 June incident in 1989, the British Government changed its 
policy and appointed Patten the last British governor of Hong 
Kong. Patten then dished out his constitutional reform package 
and had no scruples about taking the out-and-out "three 
violations" path in an attempt to plant pro-British forces in 
the political structure at all levels beyond 1997 and thus 
influence the administration of the Special Administrative 
Region [SAR] so that the future SAR Government might become an 
extension of the British Hong Kong Government. This was only a 
pipe dream of the old colonialists, and it was certain to fall 
through. 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration has been in force for 
over 
eight years. In theory, the signing of the Joint Declaration 
indicated the beginning of the transitional period of Hong 
Kong's return to China. As long as China and Britain acted 
according to the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the 
Basic Law, they would certainly be able to harmoniously 
cooperate and jointly maintain Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity, thus effecting a smooth transition. By doing this, 
Britain would also be able to wash away its dirty name of being 
the last colonialist in the world; moreover, this would be the 
beginning of a new stage of long-term friendly cooperation 
between China and Britain. The British authorities did not want 
to act in this manner, however. Being represented by Patten, 
they retrogressed from their cooperative position across the 
board and obstructed China's efforts to resume sovereignty over 
Hong Kong. Patten even traveled to Europe, America, and Oceania 
to encourage the Western powers to interfere in Hong Kong 
affairs in order to politically internationalize Hong Kong's 
position. This further laid bare the British authorities' 
unwillingness to return Hong Kong to China. 
  If the so-called "democrats" who are loyal to the British 
Empire enter the Legislative Council and even take the "through 
train" to enter the SAR Legislative Council after 1997 according 
to the arrangements of Patten's reform package, then there will 
be no tranquility whatsoever in Hong Kong's politics, and the 
political unrest will also shake the economic base and the 
social order. Then, the stability of the mainland may also be 
disrupted by pro- British politicians in Hong Kong. Didn't the 
activities of some pro-Western politicians, who claimed to be 
"champions of democracy," at the time of the 4 June incident 
provide evidence for this? 
  The Chinese side has now decided to build another kitchen, 
and it was forced to do this by Patten's thorough "three 
violations." In order to ensure the implementation of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and to 
guarantee the realization of "one country, two systems" and Hong 
Kong people's administration in Hong Kong after 1997, more Hong 
Kong people have seen through the nature of Patten's "three 
violation" constitutional reform farce, which is not only 
unfavorable to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability but also 
directly undermines this prosperity and stability. 
  Thanks to China's economic growth, Hong Kong's future has 
become increasingly intertwined with China. China's reform and 
opening have been welcomed by the whole world. Over a short 
period of only three years, Patten is still trying to further 
his perverse acts and push his reactionary policy. No wonder he 
has caused concern and condemnations among British people at 
home. We believe that certain changes will occur within the 
British Parliament, and more and more people of insight will 
oppose Patten's practices and protect Sino- British friendship. 
  How should we approach the breakdown of the talks on Hong 
Kong's political structure? The Hong Kong people are full of 
confidence. As Premier Li Peng said, no matter what happens with 
the Hong Kong issue, China is no longer in the year 1840 but is 
in 1994. The wheel of history is rolling on, and no one will 
obstruct it!

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Where Lie the Differences?"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the British side violated the principle 
of keeping the talks confidential and unilaterally published a 
White Paper entitled "Hong Kong's Representative Government." 
This was a remarkable piece of writing and a very good negative 
example which may serve as a lesson. The fourth part of the 
White Paper, "Conclusion and the Way Forward," says: "Many of 
the individual issues covered in the talks were, in themselves, 
technical. But the fundamental difference between the two sides 
was simple." This remark is quite true; however, the British 
side's description of the "fundamental difference" was 
absolutely absurd. According to its White Paper, the difference 
was that the British side's proposal on the political structure 
was prodemocratic, but the Chinese side's proposal was 
antidemocratic. Here, facts were simply stood on their head, 
and things were turned completely upside down. 
  The differences between the Chinese and British sides were 
absolutely not about whether there should be democracy or how 
much democracy should be adopted. What Britain is now 
practicing is a system of constitutional monarchy, and the 
British people themselves may judge whether such a system is 
good or bad. Britain, however, has no right to impose its 
system on other countries. Hong Kong is a place that belongs to 
China, and China will soon resume sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
It is a matter of course that Britain has no right to demand 
that China also adopt its system in Hong Kong. The appointment 
of a failed politician by the British ruling authorities to be 
governor in a territory forcefully occupied by Britain was 
itself not an event representative of democracy at all, and this 
is self-evident. When Chris Patten took office as governor of 
Hong Kong, he decided to play tricks like he did in the British 
political circles and stir up trouble in Hong Kong. The 
so-called democratic political reform was just a fig leaf. 
Proceeding from some Westerners' prejudices, he blamed China 
for not practicing democracy and not allowing Hong Kong to 
practice democracy. Using the Western mass media to spread this 
point of view was Patten's primary method for deceiving the Hong 
Kong people. However, British Foreign Secretary Hurd said in 
the preface for the White Paper: "The Sino-British Joint 
Declaration of 1984 and China's Basic Law for Hong Kong, which 
will come into force as of 1 July 1997, between them set the 
pace for democratic development in Hong Kong. There is no 
argument about that." Here, Hurd slapped his own face as well 
as Patten's. Since the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law have 
already set the pace of democracy in Hong Kong, why did the 
British not adopt a constitutional package which converges with 
the Basic Law, and why did the British authorities abet the 
Legislative Council members they had appointed to attack such 
convergence by saying that "the theory of convergence is our 
enemy"? Obviously, the British side had another intention, and 
what they actually hoped was to extend colonial rule under the 
pretense of seeking "democracy." 
  People have often pointed out that the fundamental 
differences between the Chinese side and the British side lay in 
whether one should keep one's promise in international 
relations. Hurd admitted that the Joint Declaration and the 
Basic Law already set the pace of democracy in Hong Kong, but 
the British authorities still perversely went against the Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law. The consultation mechanism 
specified by the Joint Declaration was also cast aside by the 
British authorities. Hurd avoided mentioning the seven letters 
he exchanged with the Chinese foreign minister in early 1990 on 
the election arrangements in Hong Kong and the agreements and 
understandings reached by these letters. The White Paper even 
said that the seven diplomatic letters "did not reach any 
agreement (on the 1995 election arrangements)." What Patten did 
in the first 18 months after he took office in Hong Kong showed 
that the British completely disregarded the basic norm of acting 
in good faith in international relations, and moved as far as 
shamelessly denying that the process of democracy in Hong Kong 
had been specified by the Joint Declaration and the seven 
diplomatic letters and insisting that Patten's "three violation" 
package be arbitrarily enforced in the last months of British 
colonial rule. Britain is a major power, but it still can 
behave so shamelessly as ignoring diplomatic documents which it 
had already signed. What international credibility will such a 
country maintain? The behavior of the British authorities since 
Patten become governor of Hong Kong only recorded their perfidy. 
This time, they violated the principle of keeping the talks 
confidential and unilaterally published the White Paper. This 
just added one more page to the record of their dishonor. Will 
they still be able to really bring any democracy to Hong Kong in 
the last 40 months of their rule? By contrast, the Chinese 
Government always faithfully honors its international 
commitments, and this is a fact admitted by the international 
community. 
  The British side behaved perfidiously under the pretense of 
"democracy." What was their real intention? Patten's package 
and the political structure that the British side tried to 
impose on Hong Kong beyond 1997 as revealed by the White Paper 
showed that they were unwilling to give up the territory that 
they had occupied for over 150 years. That is to say, London 
was trying by every possible means to extend its rule in Hong 
Kong. The British authorities have been attempting to simply 
return Hong Kong to China in a formalistic way and continue 
their de facto control over Hong Kong. This was self-evident. 
Approximately 10 years ago, Mrs Thatcher tried to impede China 
from resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and 
she inevitably ran into snags. Deng Xiaoping made it clear to 
her: "Sovereignty is not a question which is open for 
discussion." In July 1984, when meeting with then British 
Foreign Secretary Howe, Deng Xiaoping showed his foresight and 
pointed out: "We hope that the British Hong Kong Government 
will not set up a body in order to impose it on the government 
of the Special Administrative Region." Patten's constitutional 
package was precisely a plan for unilaterally setting up a body 
in the transitional period in an attempt to impose it on the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This represented a 
serious challenge to China's sovereign power. Sovereignty is 
the crucial issue and the essence of the fundamental nature of 
the Sino-British fundamental differences over Hong Kong's 
political structure. On this issue, the British side was unable 
to advance further arguments and justify itself and had no 
strength to confront itself with China. Patten and his ilk were 
as ridiculous as an ant trying to topple a giant tree.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Tung Sen (4547 2773): "Chris Patten's </F>
Insolence and Arrogance"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong citizens have been able to enjoy a few 
days of tranquility during the 1994 Spring Festival when Chris 
Patten went to amuse himself in Australia. Before the fifth day 
of the first moon was over, however, his clamorous voice once 
again was heard from the southern hemisphere. It seems that 
Patten has not been satisfied with his unbearable arrogance 
toward the Hong Kong people and with his wanton disruption of 
Sino-British cooperation. Now, he has gone so far as to issue 
orders to all of Asia and has brazenly criticized the leaders of 
Asian countries for committing mistakes and adopting a conceited 
attitude. In fact, it is precisely Chris Patten himself who is 
extremely insolent and arrogant. 
<H3>  Being Extremely Dishonest for Criticizing Others Without Any 
Reason </H3>
  The speeches that Patten made in Australia were the same old 
ones he made in the Hong Kong Legislative Council and the 
British parliamentary hearing, and people once again can 
perceive his dishonest character. He played with words, set up 
targets for himself, made groundless criticisms, and then 
extended the meanings by himself in order to refute others' 
views. In his speeches, he criticized Asian countries for not 
advocating democracy, and condemned this approach as "not only 
erroneous, but bearing the color of pride and racial 
discrimination." May we ask Mr. Patten: Which country in Asia 
does not openly favor developing democracy? Is it India, the 
Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Thailand, Japan, or 
Singapore? 
  As a political system, the democratic system emerged in a 
certain historical period and developed along with the advance 
of society. Moreover, even in countries practicing a democratic 
system, it can be different in forms. Take the Western 
countries as an example. Up to now, the UK remains a 
constitutional monarchy, under which the royal family not only 
wields power in name, but in material life still enjoys 
considerable privileges and is still supported by the taxpayers. 
The United States, however, practices a presidential system. 
As far as the presidential system is concerned, the one in 
France is different from that in the United States, as there is 
a prime minister in the French cabinet, while there is no prime 
minister in the United States. With regard to the parliament, 
both the UK and the United States have two houses, but the U.S. 
Senate and the House of Representatives are different from the 
UK's upper and lower houses in the composition of members and 
possession of powers. The House of Lords in the UK, a so-called 
democratic state, practices an appointment system, and only 
those with titles of nobility can be appointed. Therefore, some 
Asian countries' leaders -- such as Mr. Lee Kuan Yew of 
Singapore and Mr. Mahathir of Malaysia -- all stressed the 
different conditions in different countries, and the necessity 
of practicing a democratic system that is suited to their own 
countries. What mistake have they made? There are a great 
variety of nationalities in the world, so differences in 
politics, economics, culture, languages, and lifestyles exist 
objectively among them. No one can deny this fact. What racial 
discrimination is there if various countries practice the 
political systems that are suitable to themselves in light of 
their actual national situations? What right has Patten to make 
such irresponsible remarks and unfounded charges concerning 
other countries? 
  In his speeches in Australia, Patten once again played the 
part of a human rights guardian. By quoting the remarks of 
someone of his kind, Patten defended the Western countries' 
interference in the internal affairs of other countries under 
the cover of human rights issues. He said that "he would 
recognize the sovereignty of every country," but "also would 
worry about whether or not the rights human beings should enjoy 
have been confirmed and respected." As the concept on human 
rights is one relating to historical development, there are 
varying concepts on human rights in different countries. With 
regard to the concept on human rights in which people in the 
West universally believe, it was founded in the "Manifesto of 
Human and Civil Rights" adopted by the French Constitutional 
Conference in 1789. The manifesto declares that all men are 
born equal in terms of rights, which include freedom, possession 
of personal property, security, freedom from oppression, and so 
on. So we would like to ask Mr. Patten: Has your homeland ever 
respected such rights in the past and does it do so at present? 
It is not necessary to mention ancient times. Since 1789, how 
many overseas colonies has Britain founded? What rights of 
freedom, security, and freedom from oppression could the people 
enjoy in these regions under the British colonial rule? What 
were the human rights given by your ancestors, who traded in 
slaves and opium? How many people did your ancestors kill in 
India in the surging national independent movements in the 20th 
century? How many Indians and Pakistanis were slaughtered when 
you practiced "divide and rule" in India and Pakistan? 
  How many people have you killed in Cyprus? Will Mr. Patten 
please go to have a look at the bronze statue of the independent 
warrior in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia! He will complain to 
you about the price the Cypriots have had to pay in striving for 
independence, freedom, and human rights! Please go to visit 
their museum, built in memory of their national independence! 
There you can see the gallows used by the Britons to suppress 
the fighters who resisted colonial rule in the name of national 
independence. Please go to see Beijing's Yuanming Garden. It 
will condemn the plunder caused to the most magnificent garden 
in China!.... These are the human rights you have been talking 
about! If you still want to argue that those were done by your 
forefathers rather than by yourselves, then please see how your 
own country is now treating the people of Northern Ireland who 
call for the reunification of north and south. When the people 
of your country took to the streets to protest the introduction 
of the poll tax, how did your mounted police dash into the 
crowds to trample on the masses? Again, by what virtue did you 
come to Hong Kong to take up the high position, issue orders, 
and receive an annual salary of several million Hong Kong 
dollars, yet without paying a cent in taxes? When Patten's pet 
dog was lost, he even asked the Hong Kong Police to look for it. 
Now he has gone to Australia with the money of Hong Kong 
taxpayers to talk a lot of nonsense! Are these what he calls 
rights of equality? 
  Patten's dishonesty also is shown in repeatedly claiming 
himself to be a guardian of Hong Kong people's interests and a 
defender of their rights and freedoms. The ridiculousness of 
this really is beyond description! Obviously, he is the highest 
representative of colonial rule, yet he poses as a civil servant 
of the people! He is obviously a dictator who concentrates all 
powers in himself, (in this regard, even Martin Lee Chu-ming, 
who always gives himself the airs of a democratic fighter, also 
admitted this when he recently pointed out that if the political 
reform package adopted by the Legislative Council fails to suit 
Patten's taste, he will refuse to sign his approval and will 
dissolve the Legislative Council). Patten also pretends to be a 
benefactor and defender of democracy! In fact, Mr. Patten had 
better give up his tricks! We need not enumerate the facts one 
by one, but just read the memoir written by Mr. Graham, former 
governor of Hong Kong between 1947 and 1957, in which he wrote: 
"I know the officials in the Colonial Office were working 
sincerely, but it was just their work. When they handled the 
business of this colony, they did not feel they belonged to the 
place and were in no mood for being loyal to the local people. 
Although they tried their best to do their work, naturally, they 
still pledged allegiance to Britain. Should a conflict of 
interest arise in the critical juncture, they would sacrifice 
the interests of the colony." The disclosure was made by Mr. 
Graham because he was opposed to the governorship in Hong Kong 
being put under the jurisdiction of the British Colonial Office. 
However, no matter which office it belongs to, it is the 
interests of the British empire that a Hong Kong governor will 
represent. Is this not a distinctive fact? 
  Asia is the largest continent in the world; its land area 
accounts for 28.4 percent of the land on earth, and its 
population accounts for approximately 58 percent of world 
population. It is the origin of the world's ancient civilized 
countries (including China, India, Babylon, and Assyria). The 
Asian people have made tremendous contributions to world 
development and the progress of history. Now, Asia is also the 
region where the economy is growing most rapidly in the world. 
The governments and people of various countries in Asia are 
completely capable of handling their own affairs, and they do 
not need any of Patten's lectures. Patten's ideas are those of 
the 17th or 18th centuries, as he even openly called on other 
countries to join him in interfering in the internal affairs of 
Asian countries, repeatedly sowed dissent among Asian countries 
and countries in Europe, Latin America, and Africa. His 
insolence, arrogance, and ignorance are, indeed, seldom seen in 
the world! In fact, when Patten went to Europe in the winter of 
1992 to seek support from the European countries, a leader of a 
certain country said that Patten was a low-grade politician and 
did not merit people's support. So what is the use of his 
sowing dissent among these countries! 
<H3>  Throwing Dirty Words on Others Only To Betray His Own 
Ugliness </H3>
  Patten admitted that he did not come to Australia by 
invitation. Then why did he go and talk a lot in Australia at 
this time? Apart from his usual practice of talking glibly to 
mislead public opinion and persisting in his political stand of 
confronting China, it is because he has been widely criticized 
by Australia's public opinion recently. In particular, Mr. 
Malcolm Fraser, former Australian prime minister, hating to see 
him impervious to reason, has written three articles, one after 
another, to criticize him. Having resented Fraser's criticism, 
he not only refuted Fraser by contributing articles to 
Australia's newspapers in the form of "letters from readers," 
but also made an excuse of "evading the Chinese New Year" and 
went personally to Australia to throw dirty words on others. 
This did not bring any honor to him except for betraying his 
baseness. 
  He was not officially invited to visit Australia, but 
requested a meeting with the Australian prime minister. Later, 
he begged for support for his so-called political reform 
package. When his demand was rejected, he said he had not 
cherished the wish for the people's support, and that he was, 
therefore, not disappointed. Such "spirit of Ah Q" is really 
ridiculous [reference to Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," 
about a peasant who interprets his defeats as moral victories]. 
Of course, as Patten knows nothing about Chinese literature, he 
has no idea of what the "spirit of Ah Q" means. 
  In order to call Fraser names, Patten had no alternative but 
to make use of the media in Australia. In this way, he accepted 
an interview one moment and made a speech the next. However, 
none of the Australians seemed to express appreciation for him. 
The press also gave him the cold shoulder, and some 
publications even successively criticized and sneered at him. 
He was supported only by a handful of his bosom friends and the 
like. It is all the more ridiculous that Patten went so far as 
to attack China's investment environment in an attempt to stop 
Australian businessmen from investing in China. Indeed, Patten 
has resorted to every conceivable means to confront China. 
Nonetheless, the entire world is very clear about the 
investment environment and the market potential in China. Can 
this be played down by these remarks of Patten's? As everyone 
knows, the economy of Hong Kong is almost merged with that on 
the mainland. Hong Kong has made considerable contributions to 
the mainland's reform, opening up, and economic construction, 
and in turn, the rapid economic development on the mainland has 
given impetus to Hong Kong's economic growth. Thanks to this 
China factor, Hong Kong's economy has been able to maintain 
powerful development momentum, given the economic slowdown in 
the West over the past two years. Not only is Hong Kong 
optimistic about China's prospects, but the industrial and 
commercial circles in the United States, Japan, and Europe -- 
including France, Germany, and even Britain itself -- all 
express optimism about mainland China. Patten's intention of 
relying on his glib tongue to defame and disrupt China's 
economic construction can show only his ignorance and arrogance. 
His disruption of Sino-British cooperation and his infringement 
on the interests of the British industrial and commercial 
circles have been condemned by people in these sectors. That is 
why Patten took this opportunity to vent his anger by defaming 
the economic construction in China.

  [Text] Economic Minister P. K. Chiang stated on Tuesday [2 
March], when answering questions from lawmakers in the 
Legislative Yuan, that to ensure economic development, raise 
industrial competitiveness, and lower production costs, the 
Economic Ministry is clear about the state of relations between 
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and will keep the ties more 
or less at the present level. However, Chiang said that serious 
discussions must be carried out on point-to-point direct 
navigation links and even in an across-the-board opening of 
navigation and aviation links in the future. However, Chiang 
stressed that since the opening of navigation links between the 
two sides is covered in the medium- term-part of the national 
unification guideline, any research done on this issue and the 
results coming from them should be forwarded to the Mainland 
Affairs Council for reference. He said that the result will be 
help to policy makers when the time comes for further opening up 
of ties between the two sides.

  [Text] Taipei, March 3 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang said that Taiwan's intellectual property rights 
(IPR) protection efforts should help avert possible trade 
sanctions from the United States. 
  Chiang made the remark late Wednesday [2 March] following 
the 
conclusion of three days of IPR talks between Taiwan and the 
United States. 
  Taiwan attached great importance to the negotiations as 
results of the meeting will help determine whether Taiwan will 
be removed from the "Special 301 Priority Watch List" and no 
longer be targeted by the United States for trade retaliation. 
  The US will make a final decision on the issue in late 
April. 
  The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said in a statement 
that the US side "will conduct a review as soon as possible to 
assess Taiwan's progress in providing adequate and effective 
protection of IPR." 
  The statement noted that the US delegation "recognized the 
considerable accomplishments of the Executive and Legislative 
Yuans, especially in the passage of the very important cable TV 
law, approval and signing of the bilateral copyright agreement 
and the passage of the amendments to the patent and trademark 
laws." 
  AIT represents American interests in Taiwan in the absence 
of 
diplomatic ties between the two countries. 
  During the talks, both sides agreed to enter into a 
reciprocal patent protection agreement, which will ensure better 
protection for inventions by people of the two countries. 
  The United States will be the first country to sign such a 
reciprocity accord with Taiwan, details of which will be worked 
out later in the year. 
  In addition, Taiwan pledged to work for an integrated 
circuit 
display protection law and to make rules on industrial design 
part of the amended patent law by the end of July. Taiwan, 
however, has yet to decide whether to enact a law to protect 
business secrets. 
  American delegates, who had expressed deep concern about the 
reduction of jail terms for violations of the trademark law from 
five to three years, reluctantly accepted the provision after 
Taiwan's explanations that the prison sentence will not be 
convertible to fines. 
  The US side also accepted Taiwan's current ban on foreign 
investment in the domestic cable television business and the 20 
percent ceiling on foreign stakes in cable TV programs, while 
Taiwan agreed to the US request that broadcast of foreign 
satellite programs without authorization would be considered an 
IPR violation. 
  Taiwan's computer software export inspection system will 
remain in place after repeated US demands, although Taiwan hopes 
to end the inspection soon because of its expense and 
inconvenience. 
  Meanwhile, US negotiators said they were satisfied with 
Taiwan's protective measures for patented pharmaceuticals and 
copyrights, saying Taiwan has done a good job in this regard.

  [Text] The government will limit trade and transportation 
relations with Hong Kong if the British colony fails to remain 
highly autonomous politically or maintain a free market economy 
after 1997, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) decided yesterday. 
  The decision will serve as the government's policy in 
positioning itself in relation to Hong Kong and Macao after they 
become special administrative zones of mainland China in 1997 
and 1999, respectively. 
  The MAC made the decision when screening the draft statute 
governing Taipei's future ties with Hong Kong and Macao. The 
statute was newly worked out by domestic scholars. 
  Under the statute, the MAC will authorize relevant 
government 
units to work out concrete and detailed measures for countering 
whatever possible changes in the political and economic climates 
of the two colonies after 1997 and 1999, MAC officials said. 
  Basically, the officials said, the statute for governing 
people-to-people ties across the Taiwan Strait can't be applied 
to regulate ties between Taiwan and Hong Kong or Macao. 
  Informed sources said that the government here hopes to 
maintain direct trade and aviation ties with Hong Kong after 
1997 on a reciprocal basis. But there exist some variables that 
might cause the hope to evaporate. These include whether the 
National Unification Guidelines are still at their initial 
implementation stage, and whether direct trade, transportation 
and mail are allowed. 
  The statute for governing ties with Hong Kong and Macao is 
expected to be fully enacted by the end of 1996.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- The third plenary 
session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of 
the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) issued a communique here 
today, calling for unremitting efforts to combat and root out 
corruption. 
  The anticorruption campaign must be firmly and more 
effectively carried out, so as to maintain social stability and 
guarantee the progress of reforms, opening up and economic 
growth, said the communique, issued at the end of the six-day 
session. 
  "The anticorruption drive is long, arduous and urgent and it 
is necessary to carry out a protracted struggle against 
corruption and to score successes in different periods," the 
communique pointed out. 
  While affirming the achievements already made in the 
anticorruption campaign, the communique noted that negative and 
corrupt phenomena still persist and in some cases are quite 
serious. No efforts should be spared in the crackdown on 
corruption, it urged. 
  The communique said that the decision by the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council on launching the anticorruption 
struggle is correct and has guaranteed the smooth progress of 
the fight against corruption. 
  Marked results have been achieved in the anticorruption 
campaign since the convening of the second plenary session of 
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) last 
August, with the dwindling of some corruptive phenomena, the 
communique said. 
  During the session, 103 members of CCDI carefully studied an 
important speech made by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the 
CPC Central Committee, on renewed efforts against corruption. 
  The speech, which called for the investigation and severe 
punishment of serious cases, is of great significance in guiding 
the anticorruption drive in the new situation and is a clear 
indication of the determination of the CPC to wipe out 
corruption, the communique said. 
  At the session, which was presided over by CCDI Secretary 
Wei 
Jianxing, five new requirements were set for leading officials 
to maintain clarity and honesty in performing their duties. 
  The communique also called on leading cadres to take a lead 
in fighting corruption.

Commission for Discipline Inspection"] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- The party-wide 
anticorruption struggle completed one of its stages as we bid 
farewell to the year 1993. How do we evaluate this struggle? 
How will the future anticorruption work be conducted? 
  Bringing along reflections on these issues as well as the 
high expectations of the people, responsible persons from the 
discipline inspection departments of various party and 
government organs at the central as well as local levels 
gathered in Beijing to discuss the situation and problems. 
People have a consensus that the anticorruption struggle must 
be deepened to serve reform, development, and stability.

<H5>  New Attempt, New Review </H5>
  Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection 
[CCDI] Wei Jianxing said at the opening ceremony of its third 
plenary session: "This anticorruption struggle is not only a 
tempering for party and government cadres at all levels and the 
vast contingent of cadres of our discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs, but also a new attempt to combat negative 
and corrupt phenomena under the new circumstances." 
  At the meeting, comrades in charge of discipline inspection 
and supervision from relevant departments in 16 provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as organs under 
the party Central Committee and the central government gave 
briefings on their measures in unfolding the anticorruption 
struggle. Through these measures, experiences were accumulated 
for waging a deep-going anticorruption struggle in the next 
stage. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  A Deep-Going, Sustained, and Effective Way Holds the Key </H5>
  How do we carry out anti-corruption work in 1994, a year in 
which the most reform measures yet will be formulated? This is 
the issue most frequently pondered by discipline inspection and 
supervisory cadres. 
  CCDI Secretary Wei Jianxing pointed out clearly that under 
the new circumstances, discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs should unswervingly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
strategic principle of "fostering both material as well as 
cultural and ideological progress, attaching equal importance to 
both," resolutely combat corruption in a down-to-earth manner, 
and strengthen the building of party work style and clean 
administration to provide conditions and guarantee the proper 
implementation of various reform measures; the sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 
4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of economic construction; as 
well as political and social stability. 
  Over the last few days, the 103 CCDI members attending the 
plenary session earnestly discussed General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin's important speech and Comrade Wei Jianxing's work report 
to the meeting, holding that General Secretary Jiang Zemin's 
speech and the work report given by Comrade Wei Jianxing on the 
CCDI Standing Committee's behalf conformed to reality and would 
serve as a guide for waging a deep-going, sustained, and 
effective anticorruption struggle in the next stage. 
  During their discussion, CCDI Deputy Secretary Hou Zongbin 
pointed out: To conduct the anticorruption struggle in a 
deep-going, sustained, and effective manner, first, we should 
consolidate the achievements of struggle in the previous stage 
and keep up the good work until the end; second, earnestly carry 
out the various work arranged at this meeting in a down-to-earth 
manner; and, third, persist in fighting corruption throughout 
the entire process of reform, opening up to the outside world, 
and economic construction. In addition, he pointed out: In 
taking charge of the anticorruption struggle, it is necessary to 
heedfully guard against two one-sided understandings: one being 
the belief that "the anticorruption campaign has already been 
carried out quite adequately", which leads to complacency about 
the achievements in the previous stage; the other being the 
attitude of focusing excessive expectations and efforts on a 
single operation so much so that interim objectives and 
achievements are neglected. [passage omitted] 
  The establishment and improvement of an effective mechanism 
for supervision and restriction is a hot topic discussed by many 
delegates. CCDI Secretary Wei Jianxing stressed: In waging an 
anticorruption struggle, we must effect a permanent cure besides 
taking stopgap measures, and should strengthen regular education 
on party work style and clean administration among party members 
and cadres to gradually form a system. It is necessary to 
accelerate legislation for rectifying party work style and 
strengthening the building of a clean administration and to 
gradually establish and improve a code of conduct for party 
workers and state functionaries. It is especially necessary to 
establish a mechanism of supervision and restriction at law 
enforcement departments and positions directly in charge of 
personnel, property, and material to guard against the abuse of 
official power for personal gain. CCDI Standing Committee 
member Fu Jie believes that it is necessary to persistently 
bring the interim results into line with the protracted nature 
of the anticorruption struggle to effect a permanent cure while 
solving its current problems, as the struggle is a long-term 
task. In effecting a permanent cure, we would have to rely on 
rule by law and education.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of 
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), today called for 
the CPC to enhance development of theory. 
  At an opening ceremony of a new session of the central party 
school, Hu said that the Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is the Marxism of 
contemporary China, and it serves as the scientific guide for 
the progress of China. 
  This session of the party school has enlisted more than 
2,600 
officials and army officers, including officials at minister and 
provincial governor level. 
  He noted that there will inevitably be some complicated 
problems and difficulties in the process of socialist 
construction, especially in the process of accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure. 
  He said that the real understanding of the theory of 
building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics will help unify the 
thinking of party members, correctly handle the relations 
between the reforms, development and stability, and overcome 
various social contradictions. 
  He also urged the attendants to the party school to study 
the 
theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy so as 
to raise their capabilities in work on the socialist market 
economic sector.

<F P=106> [Report by Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 0251): "The Fight Against </F>
Corruption Is Not Over Yet"] 
  [Text] The period from the second plenary meeting of the 
Central Military Commission in August last year to the almost- 
concluded third plenary meeting has been permeated by the main 
line of carrying out an in-depth struggle against corruption to 
cope with the development of reform and opening up. 
  The comrades present at the meeting pointed out: The fight 
against corruption over the past six months has been smooth; its 
development has been healthy; phased achievements have been 
made; and the expected requirements have basically been met. 
But vigilance in the fight against corruption should not be 
lowered, because negative and corrupt practices are likely to 
recur: As soon as you relax, they will come back. In the fight 
against corruption, no achievement can be made with one battle. 
  Some participants pointed out: We are losing some of the 
achievements that we made in the previous period of fighting 
against corruption; in the next period, we should consolidate 
and develop the achievements we have made and should formulate 
the relevant laws and regulations to fundamentally resolve 
problems. 
  This year the fight against corruption will face a heavy 
task 
and severe test. Comrades attending the meeting analyzed this 
issue from the following aspects: 
  --This year is a year of reform, in which many major reform 
measures will be introduced. How should we increase the impetus 
of reform, promote development and stability, maintain the 
impetus of the combat against corruption, and produce better 
results? This is a serious subject and test which cannot be 
evaded. Comrades present at the meeting said: The process of 
deepening reform is a process of adjusting the relations of 
rights and responsibilities between the state, localities, 
enterprises, and laborers; this will inevitably involve 
interests in all areas and cause certain contradictions. 
Because the impetus of reform is becoming stronger and the 
formulation of behavior standards is falling behind, there will 
be an increase in violations of laws, regulations, policies, and 
systems. All levels of party and government leading 
institutions and leading cadres should devote more efforts to 
reform; if they cannot properly "do two types of work 
simultaneously," a situation will arise in which "one type of 
work is stressed to the neglect of the other." This will have a 
direct impact on the fight against corruption and will add to 
its difficulties. We are facing a prominent practical problem: 
Deepening reform and extensively adjusting the relations of 
interests will enhance the vitality of life in society, but will 
also cause new contradictions and bring about many sensitive 
problems. This point should be taken into account in the fight 
against corruption. 
  --The next period of fighting against corruption will 
develop 
in a more in-depth way. Will there be a further breakthrough in 
it? This is also a test. The comrades present at the meeting 
pointed out: In the previous period of the fight against 
corruption, comparatively speaking, many achievements were made 
in looking into the symptoms of problems and in easy areas, but 
this year's work will involve more obstacles and difficulties as 
well as an in-depth and fundamental reform of the structure and 
system. We should make greater efforts. 
  --In this new year, how should we maintain and develop a 
positive trend in the fight against corruption, preserve the 
masses' enthusiasm for this fight, and transform their worries 
into peace of mind and confidence? This is another test for us. 
The comrades attending the meeting said: The masses' feelings 
about the fight against corruption can be summed up this way: 
Their confidence is increasing, but they are still worried. On 
the one hand, they are happy to see the achievements in the 
fight against corruption; on the other, they are worried about 
whether this combat will weaken, cool down, and stop. The 
masses want the combat against corruption to be continued; they 
want to see new achievements in it and are unwilling to see a 
decline after a period of time. If a decline happens, this will 
seriously damage their initiative against corruption, will turn 
their hope into disappointment, and will even cause resentment 
among them. Without the masses' trust, support, or 
participation, it will be difficult to carry out the fight 
against corruption. 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech and Comrade Wei 
Jianxing's report have explicitly arranged this year's work. 
The comrades present at the meeting pointed out that their task 
is to ensure the implementation of the speech and report and to 
work to the satisfaction of the party and masses.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- Xiamen City, in which 
one of China's first special economic zones [SEZ's] was set up, 
is expected to be empowered with greater legislative rights by 
the National People's Congress [NPC]. 
  In a draft document submitted to the Sixth Session of the 
Eighth NPC Standing Committee for examination and deliberation 
today, it was suggested that the NPC empower the Xiamen City 
People's Congress, its standing committee, and the Xiamen City 
People's Government to respectively formulate laws, regulations, 
and rules to be enforced in the Xiamen SEZ. 
  It was learned that a group of 32 NPC deputies, including 
Cheng Xu, and another group of 36 NPC deputies, including Yuan 
Qitong -- both groups were from Fujian -- had submitted motions 
to the Second Session of the Seventh NPC in 1989 and the First 
Session of the Eighth NPC in 1993, respectively, demanding that 
the NPC or its standing committee empower the Xiamen City 
People's Congress, its standing committee, and the Xiamen City 
People's Government to respectively formulate laws, regulations, 
and rules that will be enforced in the Xiamen SEZ. With the 
approval of the 10th Session of the Seventh NPC Standing 
Committee in October 1989 and the Fifth Session of the Eighth 
NPC Standing Committee in December 1993, respectively, the two 
motions have been placed on the agenda of the NPC Standing 
Committee's session. 
  The NPC Law Committee has drafted a decision and explanation 
concerning the authorization of power. Members to the Law 
Committee maintained: The Xiamen SEZ is one of China's earliest 
SEZ's. As China opens wider to the outside world, and 
particularly as the two sides of the Taiwan Straits increase 
their contacts, the Xiamen SEZ has become an important window in 
developing economic and trade relations with Taiwan and foreign 
countries. In its explanation, the NPC Law Committee noted: In 
consideration of the needs for Xiamen SEZ's development, we 
propose that the NPC Standing Committee make a decision 
requesting the Second Session of the NPC to examine, deliberate, 
and decide on the issue on empowering the Xiamen City People's 
Congress and its standing committee to formulate laws and 
regulations in accordance with the specific situation and actual 
needs of the SEZ and in compliance with the basic principles as 
stipulated in the constitution, laws, and administrative rules; 
enact them in the Xiamen SEZ; and report them to the NPC 
Standing Committee, the State Council, and the Fujian Provincial 
People's Congress Standing Committee for the record. We also 
propose that the Xiamen City People's Government be empowered to 
formulate rules and organize their enforcement in the Xiamen SEZ.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- Xiang Chunyi and Wang 
Shuwen, vice chairmen of the National People's Congress [NPC] 
Law Committee, presented reports on the results of the 
committee's examination of two draft laws to the Sixth Meeting 
of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee today. The two draft laws 
are: the draft supplementary regulations governing severe 
punishment of criminals who organize and transport others across 
the border (boundary) illegally; and the draft law on the 
protection of investments of Taiwan compatriots. 
  In the reports, Xiang Chunyi and Wang Shuwen said: Following 
the preliminary examination of these two draft laws by the fifth 
meeting of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, the Law Committee 
and the Legislative Affairs Commission distributed copies of the 
draft laws to the relevant provinces and autonomous regions as 
well as the central departments concerned, and invited the 
central relevant departments and legal experts to forums to 
further solicit their views. Based on the views of the Standing 
Committee members and relevant NPC special committees after 
deliberation, as well as the opinions of local governments, 
departments, and experts, the Law Committee examined the draft 
laws and deemed it necessary to enact the supplementary 
regulations and the law on protection of the investments of 
Taiwan compatriots. The committee holds that the draft laws are 
basically feasible; and after revisions, the committee proposes 
that the NPC Standing Committee deliberate and approve the draft 
laws. 
  On the supplementary regulations, Xiang Chunyi said: Some 
members and local governments suggested that in order to 
severely punish criminals who organize and transport others 
across the border (boundary) illegally, the regulations should 
clearly stipulate the death penalty for such criminals who have 
committed other serious offenses. Therefore, the Law Committee 
proposes that the draft regulations be revised as follows: 
"Offenders who also commit the crimes of killing, injuring, or 
raping illegal emigrants, or who also commit the crimes of 
killing or injuring law enforcement personnel, may be sentenced 
to death pursuant to the law." Meanwhile, similar revisions were 
suggested regarding the regulations governing penalties for 
criminals who transport others across the border (boundary) 
illegally. 
  Some members suggested a harsher penalty for state 
functionaries whose violation of the regulations constitutes a 
crime. Hence, the Law Committee proposes that the draft 
regulations be revised as follows: "State functionaries in 
charge of issuing passports, visas, and other entry and exit 
documents, who knowingly issue exit or entry documents to 
illegal crossings of the border (boundary); and border defense, 
customs, and other law enforcement personnel, who knowingly let 
illegal emigrants cross the border (boundary), shall be 
sentenced to not more than three years of fixed-term 
imprisonment, criminal detention, or control; in serious cases, 
the sentence shall be not less than three years and not more 
than 10 years of fixed-term imprisonment." 
  On the law on the protection of the investments of Taiwan 
compatriots, Wang Shuwen said: Based on the suggestions of some 
members, local governments, and departments, the Law Committee 
proposes that the law be revised as follows: "This law is 
formulated with a view to protecting and encouraging investments 
by companies, enterprises, and other economic organizations, as 
well as individuals, from the Taiwan region in other provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities, and to promoting the 
economic development on both sides of the Taiwan Strait." Some 
members and departments suggested that this law should provide a 
clear definition of the investments of Taiwan compatriots, and 
it should only apply to the investment activities of Taiwan 
compatriots. Therefore, the committee proposes that the law 
contain the following provisions: "This law applies to the 
investments of Taiwan compatriots; in circumstances where the 
law does not provide a stipulation, they shall be enforced 
according to other relevant state laws and administrative rules 
governing the investments of Taiwan compatriots." "The 
investments of Taiwan compatriots referred to in this law are 
investments by companies, enterprises, and other economic 
organizations from the Taiwan region in other provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities." 
  Wang Shuwen said: Some departments suggested that in 
addition to protecting the investments and investment returns of 
Taiwan compatriots in the mainland, it is also necessary to 
protect the personal safety of the investors. Hence, the 
committee proposes that the draft law be revised as the follows: 
"The state, by law, protects the personal safety, investments, 
investment returns, and other lawful rights and interests of 
investors." Some members suggested that we should encourage 
Taiwan compatriot-investors to use their investment returns to 
make new investments, which should not be limited to convertible 
currency. Therefore, the committee proposes that the draft law 
be revised as follows: "Taiwan compatriots-investors may use 
convertible currency; machinery, equipment, or other material 
goods; industrial property rights; and nonpatented technology as 
investments." "Taiwan compatriot- investors may use their 
investment returns to make new investments. 
  He added: According to provisions of the draft law, 
"enterprises funded and set up by Taiwan compatriot-investors in 
the mainland should comply with the state's national economic 
and social development plans and industrial policy." At the 
suggestion of some members, the committee proposes that the 
provisions be revised as follows: "Enterprises set up with the 
investments of Taiwan compatriots should comply with the state's 
industrial policy and should be beneficial to national economic 
development."

<F P=106> [Article by "special commentator" from the "News and Press </F>
Review" program: "From Lei Feng to Xu Honggang"] 
  [Text] With the approach of spring, a resounding name is 
read with admiration by people on the land of China. This name 
is Xu Honggang, a squad leader of a certain unit under the Jinan 
Military Region and a young hero who is ready to take up the 
cudgels for a just cause. 
  On the eve of the Spring Festival, General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin issued a call for learning from Xu Honggang. Thus, an 
upsurge of learning from a hero of the times and promoting 
healthy tendencies in society has been rapidly started in areas 
both north and south of the Chang Jiang. 
  This reminds us of the radiant and enchanting spring 31 
years 
ago when Comrade Mao Zedong issued a call for learning from 
Comrade Lei Feng. Lei Feng's noble ideas, character, morals, 
and charisma have influenced millions of people and encouraged 
them to pursue their lofty ideals in life over the past 31 
years. Xu Honggang is an outstanding representative of those 
people. 
  Why can the deeds of Lei Feng and Xu Honggang, two young 
soldiers of different times, excite people in the depth of their 
hearts? When we review these heroes' noble ideas and their 
processes of growth, it is not so difficult for us to find a 
common characteristic among them -- Both Lei Feng and Xu 
Honggang have been models in realizing our party's purpose of 
serving the people wholeheartedly. In his life and career, Lei 
Feng cherished and loved the people so much. He did numerous 
good turns for the masses all his life, which is a vivid 
portrayal of his devoting his limited life to the unlimited 
cause of serving the people. 
  In an emergency, Xu Honggang expressed his loyalty and 
devotion to the people at lightning speed by waging a 
life-and-death struggle against a ruffian with a knife to 
protect people's property and lives. From Lei Feng to Xu 
Honggang, heroic deeds are not quite the same, but they radiate 
with the glory of the concept of serving the people and reflect 
the mental attitude of communists and contemporary youths. 
  When many old people hear the term of serving the people, a 
historical picture presents itself before their eyes: Fifty 
years ago, shortly after a fighter by the name of Zhang Side 
laid down his life, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered his famous 
speech "Serve the People." This term of serving the people has 
encouraged generation after generation of communists and youths 
of noble aspirations to fight bloody battle for the interests of 
the nation, with one stepping into the breach as another fell, 
and to be the first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy 
comforts. Emerging on battlefields were Dong Chengrui, who laid 
down his life under a hail of bullets while flinging a grenade 
into an enemy pillbox, and Huang Jiguang, who blocked an enemy 
embrasure with his own body. Coming to the fore in the 
peacetime of construction was Jiao Yulu, a good cadre who spared 
no effort in the performance of his duty for the people, and 
Major Shu Ning of the Artillery Corps who sacrificed himself for 
the life of a soldier. 
  Our great motherland has numerous heroes. Although they are 
engaged in different trades or professions, what they are 
spiritually nurtured and the great vigor they display can find 
their sources from the term of serving the people. Serving the 
people is precisely the basic purpose of the CPC. Let each of 
us communists realize this purpose as Lei Feng and Xu Honggang 
did, and perform our duties in an outstanding manner at our 
respective posts! 
  Xu Honggang is a contemporary hero who has come to the fore 
in the new situation in which our country is developing a 
socialist market economy. In our society, some people 
misunderstand the market economy and set the principle of 
material benefits against the concept of serving the people. 
For some time, the concept of serving the people has become 
diluted in or has even disappeared from the minds of some 
people. This is why the following phenomena have occurred: an 
old man over 80 and a pregnant woman jumped into the water to 
rescue those being drowned, while strong, young people looked on 
coldly; people forgot their integrity under the temptation of 
personal gain or saw someone in mortal danger without lifting a 
finger to save him. 
  The market economy we want to establish and develop is a 
socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. It is 
aimed at accelerating the development of the productive forces 
and achieving the four modernizations to satisfy the increasing 
material and cultural needs of the people. To develop a high 
degree of material civilization is a component of the socialist 
market economy, and to develop a high degree of spiritual 
civilization is also one of its components. This determines 
that while establishing a socialist market economic structure, 
we must attain a lofty realm of thought, develop the spirit of 
selfless devotion, and always bear in mind the basic purpose of 
serving the people wholeheartedly. 
  Fifty years have elapsed from Zhang Side to Lei Feng and to 
Xu Honggang. During these years, earthshaking changes have 
taken place in our motherland. The purpose of serving the 
people set by our party has been inherited and pursued by one 
generation of people after another. General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin pointed out: Xu Hongang's deeds embody the tradition of 
the Red Army, the People's Liberation Army, and the Communist 
Party. Practice once again shows us that when the tradition of 
the party and the spirit of the times are integrated, it will 
nurture millions of new heroes and models. Let us hold high the 
torch of serving the people and greatly push forward the four 
modernization of the great motherland!

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing said here today that to study, publicize and put into 
practice the educational thoughts of Deng Xiaoping are important 
tasks for China's educational and theoretical communities. 
  Li, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee 
of the Chinese Communist Party, made the remark at today's 
opening of a symposium on the educational thoughts of Deng 
Xiaoping. 
  He said that the study, publicizing and implementing of the 
educational thoughts of Deng Xiaoping are also main conditions 
for party and government leaders at all levels to enhance their 
competence to exercise leadership over China's modernization 
drive. 
  The symposium, which was sponsored by the Research Center of 
Educational Development of the State Education Commission, has 
the purpose of studying and understanding the educational 
thoughts of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and discussing how to 
implement "outlines of educational reform and development in 
China". 
  In his speech, Vice-Premier Li said that education made up 
an 
important part of Deng Xiaoping's theory. In probing into ways 
for solidifying, developing and building socialism, Deng 
Xiaoping had treated education as one of strategic issues which 
will be of vital importance to the overall situation of China's 
socialist construction and the historical fate of socialism. 
  He had carried out concentrated investigations into it, and 
had formed educational theories with Chinese characteristics, 
which had developed into a scientific theoretical basis and 
powerful ideological weapon for guiding China's educational 
reform and development. 
  Deng held in his educational theories that we would rather 
exercise patience on other aspects, or even sacrifice some 
speed, in order to make a success of educational work. In his 
theory, he also pays great attention to solving input in 
education, improving treatment of intellectuals and helping 
solve practical problems faced by teachers. 
  He added that for an economically underdeveloped country 
like 
China, a down-to-earth and unswerving manner should be adopted 
to solve practical problems and to achieve a fast and healthy 
development of the country's education.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- People in Beijing are 
widely interested in the broad spectrum of reforms which the 
government is instituting this year. 
  People are trying to learn details of the reforms from all 
aspects which will influence almost everyone's interests and 
daily life. 
  Some of the reforms are already in full operation, such as 
the overhaul of the taxation system and unification of the 
two-tiered exchange rates. Other reforms are still in the 
blueprint stage, or just in the process of being carried out, 
like the overall wages increase for government employees. 
  The influence of the reforms can be felt in street chats and 
in marketplaces all over the city. 
  In the Dongdan Vegetable Market in east Beijing, Wang Lin, a 
30- year-old man working in a government institute, said that 
his monthly wage has gone up by one-third after his work unit 
carried out a payment reform in January. 
  "I can spend more now," he said. "But I am concerned that if 
all government employees receive wage rises, prices will go up 
and bite into the raised incomes." 
  Though many people have the same concern as Wang, Beijing 
City government's surveys show that the purchasing power of the 
citizens is on a steady increase, while the city's retail market 
has been booming since January 1. 
  The city government is planning to raise by 30 percent the 
pensions of retired workers, who will benefit the least from the 
wages reform. 
  Yun Fengqi, a car driver in his 50s, said that his standard 
of life is better than a decade ago. "We have many more choices 
on the shelves in stores now than in the late 1970s," he said. 
  He cited the example of his own family, who were able to 
afford a color TV set now costing several thousand yuan, but had 
to hesitate when they spent several hundred yuan to buy a 
nine-inch black-and- white TV set in 1979. 
  "We cannot be like some rich people who buy extremely 
expensive things, but we live a rather comfortable life," Yun 
said. 
  According to a survey by the Beijing Psychological Research 
Institute, over 90 percent of citizens believe that prices rise 
fast. But in the meantime, they support the economic reform 
because it means better opportunities to make more money. The 
widely held belief is that people have to rely on themselves to 
earn a higher income. 
  Entrepreneurs from all sectors are keenly interested in the 
reforms of exchange rates and taxation. 
  Li Wuquan, general manager of the state-run Beijing 
Machinery 
Import and Export Corporation, said that the unification of 
exchange rates is good for Chinese enterprises to enter 
international markets. He said that the adoption of a single 
exchange rate facilitates his company's operations by 
accelerating circulation of funds. 
  "In the past, we had to wait one or two months before we 
could sell foreign exchange at the swap market for renminbi 
currency needed to purchase export goods. But now we can get 
the money back immediately from bank," he said. 
  But Li said that since China abandoned the government-set 
exchange rate and adopted a higher market rate of around 8.7 
yuan for one dollar, machinery companies can no longer buy 
foreign exchange from the state bank at the former rate of 5.7 
yuan. It has put the cost up and cut the edge of sophisticated 
products over other products in exports, he said. 
  China has aimed the reforms to benefit the majority of the 
people. But of course, not everyone benefits simultaneously 
from the present reforms. 
  Sun Jian, owner of a private photocopy workshop in 
Zhongguancun, in northwest Beijing, complained that his profits 
suffered as a new system of receipts hampered his business with 
large state-run institutes. 
  A manager of a publicly-owned technological joint venture 
said that the tax reforms have put all enterprises on the same 
footing for competition -- more opportunities, more risk and 
more challenge. He pointed out that the rise in wages for 
employees in government institutes had narrowed the salary 
advantages offered by non-government-run enterprises, 
intensifying the competition for skills and talents between 
enterprises. 
  But the manager said that he is fully confident of the 
future, because the reforms conform with the principle of equal 
competition. 
  Chen Dehua, professor of economics at Beijing University, 
described this year's reforms as "drastic". 
  The most prominent point of the reforms is that they get rid 
of the egalitarianism still remaining in people's minds. But 
the preparation work for the reforms is inadequate, enabling 
some people to take the chance to raise prices, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- China's fiscal reforms 
will enable the central government to have more financial 
resources to fund its ambitious plan to wipe out abject poverty 
by the year 2000, top economic officials said here today. 
  Speaking at a national conference on poverty reduction, Chen 
Yaobang, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, said 
that a sustained, healthy and rapid economic growth, together 
with the fiscal reform, will gradually increase the central 
government's financial ability to support poverty-reduction 
efforts. 
  There are enormous difficulties involved in abolishing 
poverty by raising the living standards of the 80 million 
Chinese residents who do not have enough food to eat or clothes 
to wear, the minister told several hundred officials from about 
20 ministries and local governments. 
  However, a growing economy and increasing awareness of the 
whole society of the importance of alleviating poverty and 
expanding international co-operation will contribute to the 
efforts, he said. 
  Vice Minister of Finance Li Yanling said that the fiscal 
reform is mainly designed by the central government to gradually 
increase its revenues, thus uplifting its ability for macro 
economic control. 
  To narrow the gap between the booming coastal regions and 
the 
central and western areas, from now on the central government 
will take the lion's share of the increased local revenues and 
give a considerable part of its share to poor areas, in the 
central and western regions and areas inhabited by minority 
nationalities, Li said. 
  He urged financial departments to increase their investment 
to the best of their ability in poverty-alleviation efforts. 
  The ministry has provided a total of 27 billion yuan for the 
nationwide poverty-reduction drive during the past 14 years.

<F P=106> [By Chen Chieh-hung (7115 3381 1738): "Chen Yun Stresses </F>
Steadiness and Prudence in Economic Construction"] 
  [Text] Sources said: In recent years, Chen Yun has been 
basically living in a place beside Xi Hu in Hangzhou for 
recuperation, but he is very concerned about the orientation of 
economic development and reform. He has expressed his views on 
many occasions since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee held in last November. 
  The sources also said: Wan Li, former chairman of the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee, specially pointed 
out when chatting with retired veteran cadres in Beijing that 
once the Gang of Four collapsed, Chen Yun had resolutely asked 
for permission to let Comrade Xiaoping resume his post. Later, 
he gave his support to Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. As far as party life is 
concerned, it is normal to have different views on certain 
concrete policies and measures, which should not be considered 
as factional infighting. 
<H3>  The Scale of Construction Must Be in Line With Our National 
Strength </H3>
  The sources added: On the eve of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Chen Yun wrote a letter 
entitled "My Several Views" to the Central Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee. He spoke of five points in his 
letter: 
  1. The leading body of the CPC Central Committee with 
Comrade 
Jiang Zemin at the core is strong and capable, it has done a 
good job. 
  2. We must enhance party building and heighten the ideology 
of building a clean government on the people's behalf and treat 
it as our party's long-term task. 
  3. We must educate the whole party and, in particular, 
cadres 
at the provincial (ministerial), prefecture, and city levels, 
and resolutely get rid of localism, departmental selfishness, 
and sectarianism. 
  4. It is true that speed is a major consideration in 
economic 
construction, but benefits are of paramount importance. It is 
true that economic construction should procede on a large scale, 
but it must be in line with our national strength. This is 
precisely a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. 
  5. Reform must be founded on self-reliance and the principle 
of building China well. Only when we build China well can we 
become independent and autonomous, vigorously develop China, and 
be in an invincible position. 
<H3>  Do Not Alter the Principle of Treating the Publicly Owned 
Economic Sector as the Mainstay </H3>
  Chen Yun stressed on many occasions since last January that 
in reform, the principle of treating the publicly owned economic 
sector as the mainstay cannot be altered because it concerns the 
overall system of the state. He said: I fully support the 
principles and policies set by the central authorities. That 
is, key state enterprises and large and medium enterprises which 
have a bearing on our national economy and the people's 
livelihood can only be strengthened, rather than weakened, in 
reform. We must watch out for losing and doing damage to 
state-owned assets. He pointed out: We must try to find out 
what is meant by a socialist market economy. We can never 
indiscriminately copy others' experience, but can only practice 
it in a selective and partial manner. Whether or not the system 
is good should be proved in practice, and never should we rush 
headlong into mass action. 
  Chen Yun also said: I agreed with what is said by some 
comrades. That is, we cannot allow foreign businessmen to run 
airports, ports, highways, railways, mines, and other important 
strategic resources. We must be far-sighted and cannot be in a 
passive position. We cannot say foreign businessmen can invest 
in whatever they wish. The United States, Canada, European 
countries, Japan, and South Korea also place restrictions on 
foreign investment in accordance with their national conditions. 
  Chen Yun stressed: There are three things which serve as the 
key to the development, progress, and stability of the whole 
country, that is, the CPC's own building, rural development and 
utilization of rural labor force, and an urban inflation rate 
which can be sustained by most citizens. If we fail to solve 
and handle well any of these over quite a long period, troubles 
will come. 
  Chen Yun suggested that the central authorities should 
focus, 
in a planned way, on the development of a number of impoverished 
provinces and regions. He said: We have implemented reform for 
15 years, we should place this problem on our agenda and try to 
solve it. We can never neglect it, and we can no longer wait.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- The 10th Asian 
Parliamentarians' Meeting on Population and Development (APPD), 
whose purpose is to strengthen and promote cooperation among 
parliamentarians of some Asian countries, opened here today. 
  A message of congratulation from Chinese Premier Li Peng was 
read out at the opening ceremony. 
  Noting that Asia is the most populous region and also widely 
held to be the region with the most dynamic economic growth, Li 
said "To study and address the population problem of Asia will 
contribute significantly not only to Asia's prosperity and 
stability, but also to global peace and development." 
  The question of population is, in essence, a question of 
development, Li said. Only when the interaction between socio- 
economic development and population control is given thorough 
and balanced consideration can the problem of population be 
tackled at its root. 
  Li said that given the fact that countries vary considerably 
in their national conditions such as the level of economic 
development, natural resources, traditions, culture and 
religious practice, it is necessary for each country to 
formulate effective population and development policies in the 
light of its economic and social development and its other 
specific conditions and to strengthen international cooperation 
on this basis. 
  He said that women are an important force for promoting 
human 
progress and social development. An enhanced role and improved 
status of women will surely facilitate a rational resolution to 
the population problem. 
  Li noted that the Chinese Government has always attached 
great importance to the question of population and development 
and made family planning a basic state policy. 
  While vigorously promoting socio-economic development, he 
said, China has implemented family planning to bring congruity 
between population growth and socio-economic development so as 
to ensure prosperity for the country and a better life for its 
people. 
  Li said that China is ready to continuously strengthen its 
exchanges and cooperation with other countries and international 
organizations and work unremittingly for the stabilization of 
population and for prosperity and peace in Asia and the world. 
  Among those present were Zhao Dongwan, leader of the 
delegation of China's National People's Congress (NPC) and 
chairman of the NPC Education, Science, Culture and Public 
Health Committee; Fukusaburo Maeda, chairman of the Asian 
Population and Development Association; Shin Sakurai and Prasop 
Ratanakorn, chairman and secretary general of the AFPPD 
respectively; Hirofumi Ando, deputy executive director of the 
U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) [acronym as received]; and 
parliamentarians, scholars and experts from 15 countries 
including China, representatives of international organizations, 
and some Beijing-based diplomatic envoys. 
  In his speech, Zhao Dongwan spoke highly of the many Asian 
countries which have made progress in birth control and 
population quality over the past decade. 
  Reviewing the remarkable achievements made by China in 
economic growth and population control, he said that although 
the fertility rate in China has dropped noticeably, the annual 
net population increase is still estimated at around 16 million. 
  Therefore, he said, China must strictly enforce family 
planning to control population growth, while developing its 
economy. 
  Zhao said that realizing sustainable and harmonious 
development is considered a long and arduous task but the only 
alternative for China over a long period of time. 
  He said that China, like many other developing countries in 
Asia, is facing an incompatibility between population growth and 
socio- economic development. China attaches great importance to 
friendly cooperation with Asian countries. 
  Zhao said he hoped the meeting would deliberate on 
population 
and development issues, particularly the status of women. 
  The Chinese delegates are willing to make the meeting a 
success along with other participants and to contribute to the 
International Conference on Population and Development to be 
held in Cairo in September this year, he said. 
  Fukusaburo Maeda said the significance of the meeting is 
underlined by the fact that it is being held in China, "which 
has the greatest population of all countries in the world and 
which, moreover, has achieved an unmatched success in population 
policy while proceeding with rapid economic growth." 
  He described China's extraordinary growth of the economy and 
the population growth control as "clear proof that population 
and development are closely related." 
  Shin Sakurai and Hirofumi Ando also delivered speeches at 
the 
meeting.

  [Text] Accompanied by some provincial leaders concerned, 
Wang Bingqian, National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee vice chairman, inspected more than 10 cities and 
prefectures, four development zones, two townships, as well as 
seven enterprises in Fujian from 4-24 February. 
  On the morning of 24 February, Vice Chairman Wang Bingqian 
held talks with the provincial leaders concerned and discussed 
with them issues like economic development, enterprise 
ownership, narrowing economic gaps between areas, social 
undertaking development, agricultural development, financial 
work, people's congress work, and so on. Wang said: Fujian has 
successfully quadrupled its gross national product seven years 
ahead of schedule, this being a great achievement. It is now 
seven years away from the end of this century. So long as all 
the comrades continue to work hard, Fujian is bound to stand a 
very good chance of success in respect of realizing a 
comparatively well-off livelihood. 
  Wang Bingqian expressed the hope that leaders at all levels 
in Fujian will be able to remain sober-minded, correctly analyze 
domestic and global economic situations, study and work out 
relevant countermeasures, enhance confidence, take the 
initiative, improve overall planning, formulate feasible 
development policies, focus on such key aspects as water supply, 
electric energy production, and so on, readjust the fixed assets 
investment scale, successfully build all types of development 
zones, develop an export-oriented economy, expand economic and 
trade exchanges with foreign countries and regions, successfully 
carry out the Taiwan affairs work, unite with people at home and 
abroad, and work hard to bring about healthy and rapid economic 
growth in Fujian. 
  Wang Bingqian stated: In building a socialist market 
economic structure, it is imperative to attach great importance 
to the guiding role of the state-owned economy and mobilize all 
forces to develop individually run enterprises, privately run 
enterprises, and enterprises run with three types of capital, 
namely, foreign capital, overseas Chinese capital, and both 
Chinese and foreign capital. 
  Vice Chairman Wang Bingqian fully affirmed Fujian's 
achievements in providing helpful assistance to poverty-stricken 
areas, eradicating poverty, achieving prosperity, developing 
education undertakings, developing science and technology, and 
embarking on the road toward common prosperity. In the 
meantime, he suggested that Fujian pay more attention to both 
environmental and resources protection. To this end, he said, 
leaders at all levels in Fujian should personally take charge of 
work in this connection and try to enhance a sense of 
environment among all people. 
  Wang Bingqian went on: It is imperative to increase 
agricultural input, protect arable land, and integrate the urban 
economy with the rural economy. 
  Vice Chairman Wang Bingqian also gave important instructions 
concerning Fujian's financial work and people's congress work 
and urged Fujian comrades to make great strides and forge ahead 
in order to build a socialist market economic structure.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- To implement 
comprehensively and correctly the party's policy concerning the 
freedom of religious belief and to effectively enforce the newly 
promulgated laws on religion, the State Council Bureau of 
Religious Affairs and FAZHI BAO [LEGAL NEWS DAILY] cosponsored a 
forum on the "Provisions on Managing Foreign Nationals' 
Religious Activities Within the Boundaries of the PRC" and 
"Regulations on Managing places of Religious Activities" in 
Beijing today. 
  In their speeches, the forum's participants expressed 
unanimous support for the two religion-related laws promulgated 
by the State Council, hailing the promulgation as a major step 
in enacting laws on religious work and codifying the management 
of religious affairs. Under the circumstances of reform and 
opening up, more and more religious affairs related to 
foreigners have cropped up in China. The "provisions" are 
promulgated precisely to meet the pressing demand for revising 
the legislation. The "provisions," which fully reflect the 
Chinese Government's policy of respecting the freedom of 
religious belief of foreign nationals in China, protect foreign 
nationals' participation in normal religious activities as well 
as their friendly contacts and cultural and academic exchanges 
with religious circles in China. Meanwhile, the "provisions" 
also effectively safeguard the Chinese Constitution's principle 
that "religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to 
any foreign domination." The promulgation of the "regulations," 
which provide clear stipulations for protecting normal religious 
activities and the lawful rights and interests of religious 
places of religious activities, is a long-awaited event of 
religious circles and is of great significance for conducting 
various concrete religious activities in China. The forum 
participants also offered many concrete suggestions and opinions 
for implementing these two laws.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Comprehensively and Correctly </F>
Implement the Policy of Freedom of Religious Belief"] 
  [Text] State Council Premier Li Peng signed and issued the 
"Provisions on the Management of Religious Activities of Foreign 
Nationals Within the Boundaries of the People's Republic of 
China" (hereinafter called the "Provisions") and the 
"Regulations on the Management of Places of Religious 
Activities" (hereinafter called the "Regulations") on 31 
January 1994. They are two important administrative regulations 
of the Chinese Government for the management of religious 
affairs. The promulgation of these two regulations is an 
important measure for China to comprehensively and correctly 
implement the policy of freedom of religious belief, strengthen 
the management of religious affairs according to law, and keep 
religion in line with socialist society. It is also an 
important step taken in the building of the legal system 
concerning religious affairs in China. 
  The Chinese Government has always pursued a policy of 
freedom 
of religious belief. As early as in the period of the 
democratic revolution, the CPC, in accordance with the principle 
of freedom of religious belief, formed an extensive 
anti-imperialist patriotic united front with the religious 
masses of people of various nationalities which became an 
important guarantee for uniting people throughout the country to 
score victory in the democratic revolution. Since the founding 
of the republic, the situation of religion in China, following a 
thorough transformation of the socialist system and important 
reform of the religious system, has undergone a historic and 
fundamental change, and the party's policy of freedom of 
religious belief has been implemented further. Practice has 
proved that the policy of freedom of religious belief conforms 
with the national conditions of China and is supported by the 
broad religious masses and the people of various nationalities. 
These two regulations on religion have been formulated precisely 
in accordance with the Constitution of China and the consistent 
policy of freedom of religious belief. The "Provisions" have 
given full expression to the fixed principles of the Chinese 
Government's respect for foreigners' freedom of religious belief 
within the boundaries of China, protection for their normal 
religious activities, and protection for their friendly 
exchanges and cultural and academic exchange activities with 
religious circles of China. At the same time, the "Provisions" 
also have given expression to the principle that "religious 
bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign 
domination," which is set out in the Constitution of China, and 
have explicitly stated that foreigners should observe the laws 
of China, should not damage the public interests of Chinese 
society, and should not in any way interfere in the internal 
affairs of religion in China. In this way, foreigners are 
provided with legal protection for exercising their right to 
freedom of religious belief within the boundaries of China, for 
taking part in normal religious activities, and for carrying out 
friendly exchanges and cultural and academic exchange activities 
with the religious circles of China. 
  The "Regulations" have fully stipulated the legitimate 
rights 
and interests of places for religious activities and how to 
safeguard these rights and interests. The "Regulations" also 
have stipulated the legal responsibility for acts of 
encroachment on the legitimate rights and interests of places 
for religious activities. At the same time, the "Regulations" 
have stipulated the duties and obligations of places of 
religious activities to the state and society. These are 
mainly: "Religious activities conducted in places of religious 
activities are to abide by laws and regulations. No individual 
is permitted to make use of places of religious activities to 
carry out activities that undermine national unity, nationality 
solidarity, and social stability; that harm the health of 
citizens; or that hinder the country's education system." The 
"Regulations" also have stipulated that places of religious 
activities are to be registered and registered places of 
religious activities are to be protected by law. 
  The promulgation and implementation of the two religious 
regulations meet the needs in managing religious affairs 
according to law and in comprehensively and correctly 
implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief. 
Managing religious affairs according to law means that the 
government will carry out administrative management and 
supervision of the implementation of relevant religions laws, 
decrees, and policies. Managing religious affairs according to 
law does not contradict the policy of freedom of religious 
belief, and the purpose of such management is to better 
implement the policy. Managing according to law includes two 
aspects: One is to protect citizens' right to freedom of 
religious belief, normal religious activities, and the 
legitimate rights and interests of religious circles. The other 
aspect is to restrict and crack down on criminal activities that 
make use of religion. They are two aspects of one issue and are 
dialectically unified. They can neither be set against one 
another, nor be separated. This kind of management is to 
include religious activities and religious affairs into the 
Constitution and laws. It is not meant to interfere with the 
normal religious activities or the internal affairs of religious 
bodies and places of religious activities, nor is it meant to 
interfere with citizens' freedom of religious belief. Government 
functionaries, various units, and individuals should seriously 
abide by the "Regulations" and should not willfully infringe on 
the legitimate rights and interests of religious circles. 
  The promulgation of these two regulations is a good 
beginning 
for legislation concerning religious affairs in China. Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "To protect the people's 
democracy, we must strengthen the legal system. We must set up 
systems and formulate laws on democracy, and must ensure that 
these systems and laws will not change with the change of 
leaders and will not change with changes in the leaders' views 
and attention." With the implementation of these two 
regulations, the building of the legal system concerning 
religious affairs will be constantly improved and strengthened, 
the legal system concerning religious affairs gradually will be 
set up in China, and the Chinese Government's management of 
religious affairs will be placed truly within the orbit of the 
legal system. At present, we should lay stress on properly 
implementing the two administrative regulations on religion, and 
should make sure they are observed and strictly enforced, and 
that violations of the regulations are punished so that these 
two regulations are really implemented. We believe that the 
implementation of these two regulations will have an important 
impact on comprehensively and correctly implementing the policy 
of freedom of religious belief in our country, strengthening the 
management of religious affairs, enhancing unity between 
religious and non-religious citizens, maintaining social 
stability, conducting international friendly religious 
exchanges, promoting the Chinese people's understanding and 
friendship with the people of all countries in the world, and 
speeding up the building of socialist modernization.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "Deng and Chen </F>
Factions Differ on Propaganda Work"] 
  [Text] While Deng and Wan focus propaganda and 
ideological work on reform, opening up, and construction, Chen 
and Song insist on outdated preaching as the first priority for 
propaganda and ideological work. Can such a contradiction be 
reconciled? 
<H3>  "One Country, Three Statesmen" Pulls Propaganda Work in All 
Directions </H3>
  One belated item of news: The CPC called a national 
conference on propaganda and ideology from 24 to 29 January. 
  One item of news which was not late: This conference 
highlighted the predicament of CPC propaganda work. 
  The greatest predicament is: Senior statesmen above the 
Political Bureau leaders have their own ideas, versions, and 
lines of thinking for policies, which is confusing to propaganda 
workers under them who do not know who to obey with "one 
country, three statesmen." 
  What is the situation with "one country, three statesmen?" 
  From internal sources this reporter obtained documents 
circulated at the conference, such as conference speeches by 
Deng and Chen and other senior statements and cables and letters 
of congratulation, which are excerpted as follows: 
<H3>  Differences and Agreements Between Deng and Wan, and Chen 
and Song Over the Focus of Propaganda </H3>
  Deng Xiaoping: The conference was called just at the right 
time. In work on propaganda and ideology, we must coordinate 
closely with the party's general policies and central tasks so 
that work on propaganda and ideology adapts to and promotes the 
demands of socialist modernization. 
  Chen Yun: The party's propaganda and ideological work must 
be clear-cut and must propagate, educate, and guide the whole 
party and people of the whole country to love their country and 
socialist society. Propaganda work should serve socialist 
society and the party's basic line and inherit the will of 
revolutionaries of the former generation, with selective 
emphasis on the construction of socialist thought, morality, and 
spiritual civilization. 
  Wan Li believes: Propaganda and ideological work must uphold 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; must continue to do away with frameworks and 
shackles unfit for work in the new era; must avoid doctrinaire 
and bookish preaching; must reflect the people's demands, views, 
and voice promptly, correctly, and comprehensively and solve 
practical problems; and must share the same goal and task in 
concerted efforts to achieve the four modernizations. 
  Song Renqiong said: The first task for the party's 
propaganda work is to uphold Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought 
and insist on propagating the party's basic line and the 
philosophic viewpoint of proletarian dialectical materialism. 
The present urgent task is to rectify and strengthen the 
party's propaganda work. Another important task for the party's 
propaganda work is to expose and oppose bourgeois liberalization 
and criticize various anti-Marxist tendencies and ideological 
currents and activities. 
  A look at the views of Deng Xiaoping and Wan Li and those of 
Chen Yun and Song Renqiong will readily show differences between 
Deng and Wan, and Chen and Song. In short, Deng and Wan are 
focusing propaganda and ideological work on reform, opening up, 
and construction, while Chen and Song are taking outdated 
preaching as the first priority for propaganda and ideological 
work. 
  Can this contradiction be reconciled? 
  Of course not. 
  This is not a problem of general outlook, or different 
points 
of view on a problem, but a problem of direction and fundamental 
difference. Deng Liqun assembled a number of "leftist" marshals 
to sign jointly a statement about "righting the direction of 
propaganda work," betraying their belief that past propaganda 
work was wrong in its direction. 
<H3>  Sixteen "Leftist" Marshals Demand Righting of the Direction 
of Propaganda Work </H3>
  On 26 January, the CPC Central Committee General Office 
newsletter ran a letter addressed to the national conference on 
propaganda and ideology by 16 people such as Deng Liqun, Wang 
Dongxing, He Jingzhi, Gao Di, Yang Rudai, Wang Renzhi, Chen 
Yeping, Li Ximing, and Xu Weicheng, demanding the righting of 
the direction of propaganda work, propagating unashamedly 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and upholding the party 
constitution. 
  A cadre with the Central Propaganda Department thought that 
the problem of direction alleged by Deng Liqun was about 
doctrinairism and bookism. But they made a big mistake in 
labeling opposition to doctrinairism and bookism as a 
directional mistake. 
<H3>  Those Who Give Commands in the CPC Have Lost All Authority 
[subhead] </H3>
  But this reporter believes that in fact CPC propaganda work 
has done little to shatter the shackles and yoke of doctrine. 
The truth is that even that leaves the conservatives 
dissatisfied. 
  Of course, compared with the past, the CPC has made progress 
in propaganda work. For instance, the 24 January RENMIN RIBAO 
ran a reader's article in its "People's Forum" the day following 
the opening of the national conference on propaganda and 
ideology entitled "Recover the Power to 'Ban,'" a move hardly 
permissible in the days of the Cultural Revolution. The article 
was highly critical of the corrupt phenomenon in which "bans are 
flagrantly defied." "If you have doubts, consider this: The 
state issued an instruction forbidding people to eat and drink 
lavishly. But obviously it could not stop some people from 
continuing the practice." The article was critical because it 
named the cause as "lacking the power to ban," which is another 
way of saying that those who give commands in the CPC have lost 
all authority. Is this not a sign of the CPC's impending 
decline? Did Deng Liqun and company not make a big mistake in 
seeing this well-intentioned warning to the party as a piece of 
"bourgeois liberalization" propaganda? 
<H5>  A Ship Which Sank 36 Years Ago Suddenly Becomes Big News </H5>
  The front page of the same edition of RENMIN RIBAO gave 
coverage to "Chinese shipbuilding," running articles and 
pictures on reports of 36 years ago on the "launching ceremony 
for the first 10,000-tonne ship." The propaganda material 
reportedly caused controversy and questions both before and 
after it was published. 
  "The 10,000-tonne cargo ship "Great Leap Forward" vanished a 
long time ago. How can it be as used propaganda material?" 
  "Is it not better to hide our faults than to make a show of 
them. In any case why should we expose our seamy side?" 
  "If this is not totally lying to the people, it is certainly 
a grand deception!" 
  Back then, with his own eyes, this writer saw the "Great 
Leap 
Forward" at Dalian. It was really huge and made a spectacular 
sight. There was a large audience at the launching ceremony. 
But it quickly dropped out of sight and news stories about it 
stopped. People were not puzzled and the party mouthpiece was 
silent about it. Later this writer learned that the "Great Leap 
Forward" had "leaped" to the bottom of the Huang Hai. For 36 
years there has been no official explanation about it, leaving 
only a big question mark among the people about the 10,000-tonne 
vessel. Now, suddenly, "non-news" became "news" again, and the 
"Great Leap Forward," which had vanished for 36 years, suddenly 
"leaped" out of the water and onto the front page. Such a 
practice may suit quite well the taste of Deng Liqun and 
company. If the word "liberalization" has to be used, then this 
is typical "proletarian liberalization," reporting only good 
news and not bad news. 
<H3>  The Conference on Propaganda and Ideology States 10 Big 
Problems </H3>
  Due to differences and gaps, the national conference showed 
that workers were confused in their thinking. A pile of 
problems and opinions were raised during group discussions, 
which can be summed up into 10 points: 
  --Is there a contradiction between Marxism and Mao Zedong 
Thought and the current party line, principles, and policies? 
  --What should propaganda and ideological work focus on: 
Party theory or the demands of socialist construction? 
  --With which are propaganda workers getting out of touch: 
The party's theoretical foundation or the central tasks in the 
new era? 
  --How do propaganda principles and policies match with 
socialist construction, reform and opening up, and the pursuit 
of a socialist market economic system? 
  --Do propaganda departments give orders and inculcate 
thoughts and theories, or educate people's thinking with 
respect, understanding, and care? 
  --Which should be the criterion for propaganda: The party's 
line, principles, and policies, or state laws? 
  --Should propaganda enforce the democratic principle and 
allow differing voices on the basis of law? 
  --Are propaganda departments state administrative organs, or 
are they part of the party organization? 
  --Should propaganda departments allow nonparty and 
democratic 
party personnel a certain proportion of posts to reflect 
solidarity among circles and strata? 
  --Should propaganda work observe a distinction between the 
party and things outside the party? Or between party ideology 
and the state Constitution and laws? 
  As the ideology is not unified, conference participants said 
propaganda work is difficult. They have "four worries": A 
wrong understanding of the "central spirit" and making mistakes; 
being accused of violating the "four cardinal principles" and 
pursuing bourgeois liberalization; worry that propaganda will be 
rejected by society; and being caught up in controversy. 
<H3>  Close to a Hundred Propaganda Cadres of Provincial Rank Ask 
for Transfers </H3>
  The conference revealed that in 1993 close to a hundred 
propaganda cadres of provincial rank asked for post transfers or 
transfers out of their departments. The posts of propaganda 
department head and deputies in some provinces have been left 
vacant and are temporarily filled by party secretaries or deputy 
party secretaries. 
  After the new round of elections of members of party 
committees of departments, committees, and offices of the CPC 
Central Committee and ministries, commissions, and offices of 
the State Council, there are still some 20 propaganda member 
posts left vacant in ministries, commissions, and offices. 
  In a way, the national conference on propaganda and ideology 
reflected differences within the party over ideological and 
organizational matters. "Leftist" marshals and generals' 
insistence on combining doctrinairism and bookism reflected 
their sectarian spirit.

"With Approval of CPC Central Committee, RENMIN RIBO To Publish 
East China Edition in Shanghai as of 1 January 1995; Wu Bangguo, 
Huang Ju Voice Vigorous Support"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 24 February (RENMIN RIBAO)--Shao Huaze, 
director of RENMIN RIBAO, announced at the Lunar New Year get- 
together and forum held by RENMIN RIBAO in Shanghai that with 
the approval of the CPC Central Committee, RENMIN RIBAO would 
start publishing local editions step by step and that the RENMIN 
RIBAO East China edition would first be published in Shanghai as 
of 1 January 1995. 
  The Central Party Committee has set great store by 
strengthening the work of RENMIN RIBAO and created good 
conditions to make a breakthrough in the work of RENMIN RIBAO 
after the 14th Party Congress was held. General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin and other members of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau gave a lot of important instructions to RENMIN 
RIBAO on propaganda work and newspaper office construction and 
set very high demands on the RENMIN RIBAO. At the forum, Shao 
Huaze conveyed to participants important instructions and 
guidelines given by key leading comrades of the Central Party 
Committee not long ago after they had listened to the work 
report of the RENMIN RIBAO as well as the work plan on 
publishing local editions and further running RENMIN RIBAO well. 
Shao Huaze said: In order to more specifically publicize the 
party line, principles, and policies in a more timely fashion, 
and to more effectively provide comprehensive information for 
local economic construction and social development, the Central 
Party Committee has consented to RENMIN RIBAO's proposal of 
publishing local editions. On 1 January, the RENMIN RIBAO East 
China edition will be first published in Shanghai, which is an 
important step in reforming the official party newspaper. Shao 
Huaze said: Preparations for publishing the RENMIN RIBAO East 
China edition have just begun, time presses, the tasks are 
arduous, there are a lot of difficulties, and we need strong 
support and help from leaders and the broad masses of Shanghai 
Municipality and of various provinces in East China. Shao Huaze 
extended heartfelt thanks to party committees, governments, and 
concerned departments of Shanghai Municipality and of various 
provinces in East China for their enthusiastic support of RENMIN 
RIBAO over the years. 
  Gong Xinhan, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the 
Central Party Committee, attended the forum and delivered a 
speech. He said: RENMIN RIBAO has done a good job after the 
14th Party Congress was held, and leading comrades of the 
Central Party Committee fully affirm the work of RENMIN RIBAO. 
The fact that RENMIN RIBAO is going to publish an East China 
edition in Shanghai can more closely link up guidelines laid 
down by the Central Party Committee with real conditions of East 
China, thus helping the propaganda of RENMIN RIBAO draw closer 
to reality, to the masses, and to life. This is a 
ground-breaking measure which propaganda departments of Shanghai 
Municipality and of various provinces should fully support. 
  Chen Zhili, deputy secretary of Shanghai Municipal Party 
Committee, also made ebullient remarks at the forum. 
  Zhou Ruijin, deputy editor-in-chief of RENMIN RIBAO, 
presided 
over the forum, which was attended by over 100 people in 
Shanghai Municipality, including leading party and government 
comrades, leaders of concerned commissions, offices, bureaus, 
prefectures, and counties, leaders of key news and propaganda 
units, and leaders of some noted enterprises. 
  In addition, on the afternoon of 24 February, Wu Bangguo, 
member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and 
secretary of Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Huang Ju, 
mayor off Shanghai, met Shao Huaze, director of RENMIN RIBAO, 
and his party, and supported and welcomed the Central Party 
Committee's approval of the publication of a RENMIN RIBAO East 
China edition in Shanghai, saying that they would vigorously 
give all kinds of support. 
  Chen Zhili, deputy secretary of Shanghai Municipal Party 
Committee; Gong Xinhan, deputy head of the Propaganda Department 
of the Central Party Committee; Jin Binghua, member of the 
Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee and head 
of the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Department; Ding Ximan, 
editor in chief of JIEFANG RIBAO; and others were also present 
at the meeting.

<F P=106> [By Amy Liu] </F>
  [Text] China has shown a videotape of four prominent 
dissidents celebrating the Lunar New Year in an apparent move to 
refute Western speculation of their poor health and having been 
abused. 
  Meanwhile, police in central Xian city released another 
dissident four days ago. The release coincided with the arrival 
of United States Assistant Secretary for Human Rights John 
Shattuck in Beijing. 
  Mr Shattuck was expected to remind leaders that China is in 
danger of losing its most-favoured-nation trading status this 
year because it has so far failed to show a significant 
improvement in its human rights practices, as called for by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. 
  The prisoners shown on the videotape were all imprisoned for 
their role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement and 
have been top of case lists for various human rights groups. 
  The screening was arranged by the State Council, China's 
cabinet, for five American reporters. 
  The tape showed Chen Ziming and Ren Wanding celebrating 
Lunar 
New Year in prison last month with their families. It also 
showed Wang Juntao in his hospital room with his family, and Liu 
Gang celebrating his birthday with cellmates. 
  In the past two years, China has periodically released 
footage or photographs of these and other well-known dissidents 
in an effort to refute reports that they are in poor health or 
have been abused. 
  Family members have said the videotapes were staged and did 
not show how the prisoners were usually treated. 
  The tape was less than 10 minutes long and showed the dates 
the segments were shot on the screen. The dialogue was 
unintelligible. 
  Mr Chen was shown at a large round table laden with food. 
  Mr Chen's family says he is suffering from a skin ailment 
and 
stomach problems, and has not been allowed to bathe in a year. 
  Mr Wang's family says he is suffering from chronic hepatitis 
B and coronary disease. 
  In the videotape, he was shown sitting on his hospital bed 
in 
a private room eating a tangerine and chatting with his family. 
  Both are serving 13-year jail terms. 
  Mr Ren, a veteran political activist serving a seven-year 
jail term, was shown with his wife and daughter in a small 
prison room with a bed and a table. They ate a simple meal that 
included dumplings, a traditional New Year dish. 
  Mr Ren's wife says he is not receiving treatment for 
cataracts in his left eye that have reduced his vision, and that 
he also suffers from haemorrhoids, digestive problems, back 
strain and other ailments. 
  Mr Liu, sentenced to six years, was shown cutting a large 
birthday cake and talking to people. Later, he was shown 
playing at a pool table, smoking and playing cards with three 
other people. However he did not seem to know how to play either 
game. 
  Mr Liu's family was barred from visiting him for a year, 
apparently to punish them for drawing international attention to 
his case. 
  Last year, they smuggled out a 16-page letter from Mr Liu 
which described beatings, torture and denial of food rations. 
  Meanwhile, Xian police are still holding Ma Shaohua, who was 
arrested with Zheng Yuguang on 27 November after they tried to 
contact the founders of the banned group Peace Charter. 
  Mr Ma could be held longer as authorities were angered by a 
book he wrote last year on the fall of communism in Eastern 
Europe, Peace Charter members in Beijing said.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Hsu Chen (1776 4176): "The Truth of </F>
the `Henan Incident'"] 
  [Text] Recently seven Hong Kong Christians headed by an 
(American) "pastor" named Balcombe were handled according to law 
by a mainland public security department for engaging in illegal 
activities in Henan. After their return to Hong Kong, they 
provided television stations with videotapes on the one hand and 
held a press conference on the other to distort the facts and 
make trouble. 
  An informed source disclosed that the seven Hong Kong 
Christians were "charismatic" extremists with a U.S. background. 
Balcombe had been to the mainland many times, during which he 
conducted activities in violation of Chinese law. After 
repeated education and warnings, he still showed no sign of 
repentance. From 9 February to the early morning of 11 
February, the seven people including Balcombe organized more 
than 80 people for overnight gatherings inside and outside a 
citizen's house in Fangcheng County, Henan Province. They 
preached the Bible among the local people, taught them to sing 
religious songs, prayed, and disseminated religious material 
they had illegally carried into the mainland. They yelled 
recklessly, made audio and video recordings, and took pictures, 
seriously disturbing the people in the surrounding areas and 
undermining social order. They conducted activities 
incompatible with their status, thus violating the relevant 
mainland law. The Henan Provincial Public Security Department 
summoned the seven people for investigation, during which no 
compulsory measures were taken against them, nor was any of them 
beaten up. The Public Security Department confiscated the 
things (including religious material totaling 40 kg) five of 
them used for illegal activities; Balcombe's stay in China was 
shortened and the other six were given a warning. Balcombe et 
al. admitted that they had violated Chinese law, and promised 
not to engage in such activities any longer. 
  This incident was purely a political incident deliberately 
created by some people by means of religion. After their 
arrival in Henan, Balcombe et al. videotaped the scenes of 
people participating in religious activities and arranged 
someone to carry the tapes back to Hong Kong before they left 
Henan. Subsequently they intentionally waited for public 
security personnel to appear for intervention. After their 
return to Hong Kong, they provided the videotapes for television 
stations on the one hand and held a press conference on the 
other to distort the facts. Their purpose was, first, to use 
religion for political activities to expand their influence. 
Honest Christians in Hong Kong call this "bringing disgrace on 
religion." Second, they wanted to collaborate with foreign 
human rights organizations, use religious issues to create 
incidents, and link religious issues to the human rights issue 
and the most favored nation status to exert pressure on China. 
The U.S. Department of State immediately commented on this. 
What a fast response. What does this indicate!? 
  Most Christians in Hong Kong were indignant about their 
behavior. They said that the illegal behavior of Balcombe et al. 
has undermined normal and friendly exchanges between Hong Kong 
and mainland Christians; more seriously, Balcombe et al. have 
used this incident to attack China; this is utterly wrong. 
Honest Christians should not make friends with "brothers" like 
Balcombe. It was right for the Chinese public security 
department to detain Balcombe and the others.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has earmarked more than three billion yuan 
(HK$2.66 billion) for wages owed to state employees in an effort 
to head off a series of debilitating strikes and demonstrations. 
  Anti-riot police and the para-military People's Armed Police 
(PAP) have been deployed to help restore order to cities and 
towns badly hit by industrial incidents. 
  A news blackout has been imposed on the number and severity 
of strikes in the past year, but sources said the authorities 
were concerned enough to release emergency funds in spite of the 
worsening budget deficit. 
  The sources said the hardest hit sector was the depressed 
coal industry, with many mines and factories owing labourers 
months of salaries. 
  Just before Lunar New Year, the State Council set aside 1.6 
billion yuan to help miners and other staff in the coal industry. 
  One of the worst industrial incidents took place in the 
mining town of Jixi near the Russian border in northeast 
Heilongjiang province, when nearly 10,000 miners took part in a 
strike in January. 
  The action was called off when the authorities paid workers 
enough money to take home for the Lunar New Year. 
  It is understood state coal-producing companies had been 
crippled by competition from private mines which offered coal 
for a third of the state company price. Transport shortages 
caused stockpiling. 
  Sources familiar with Chinese industry said a depressed 
market and restructuring of state units had forced at least half 
of government-run enterprises to lay off workers or delay paying 
wages and bonuses in the past year. 
  They said the managers of 88 large-scale state enterprises 
recently petitioned the State Council for special relief funds 
so that they could pay their workers up to 75 percent of regular 
wages. 
  The sources said that instead of paying salaries, many state 
factories had from last year issued workers goods from 
storehouses, which employees sold on the streets. 
  Such practices sparked many demonstrations, even in 
relatively prosperous Tianjin and Shanghai. 
  Human resources experts have admitted that the labour 
problem 
has been compounded by inflation, which is approaching 25 per 
cent in urban areas. 
  An internal report last month said the livelihood of more 
than 20 percent of employees in urban state firms had been 
"significantly affected" by hyperinflation. 
  Analysts said the spectre of strikes, demonstrations and 
urban unrest had already forced the leadership to scale down 
plans to modernise state businesses by transforming them into 
Western-style shareholding or stock companies. 
  Internal estimates said at least 30 percent of the state 
sector's 100 million-strong workforce was superfluous. Laying 
the workers off was the only way to improve efficiency. 
  Meanwhile, security sources said Beijing's police, 
paramilitary police, and state-security agents had been 
instructed to keep a close watch on "trouble-makers" in 
factories. 
  Those to be watched included underground trade-unionists and 
labour organisers who in several instances had established 
contact with dissident intellectuals and those involved in the 
1989 pro- democracy movement. 
  The sources said for the first time since the Tiananmen 
Square crackdown, security agents were closely watching workers 
during the politically sensitive period that runs from the 
beginning of the National People's Congress to the anniversary 
of the June 4 crackdown. 
  Sources said the frequency with which various police and 
paramilitary units had been mobilised to handle industrial 
unrest had increased in 1993. 
  Tianjin sources said two PAP platoons were deployed last 
month to help defuse a strike that involved 4,000 workers. 
  Last December, the Ministry of Public Security set up 
China's 
first patrol police force. 
  A dispatch by the semiofficial China News Service said last 
night that 88 cities had set up patrol police squadrons. Patrol 
police numbers had reached more than 15,000 officers. 
  While the aim of the new police unit was to fight crime, 
analysts said it would also be used to handle urban crises 
including industrial action. 
  An official report last month said there were 250,000 labour 
disputes, including strikes, from 1988 to the end of last year.

1311): "Rights, Interests, and Dignity Brook No Infringement-- 
Worries About Protection in `Foreign-Invested' Enterprises (Part 
One)"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: Foreign-funded enterprises have 
imbued China's economy with vitality and efficiency. However, 
the boom in foreign-funded enterprises has also given rise to 
some problems that must never be treated lightly. 
  This article, based on a massive survey, reveals some 
shocking facts which will give the reader much food for thought. 
[end editor's note] 
  Foreign-funded enterprises have been emerging dramatically 
on 
China's horizon, giving an impetus to the economic development 
and modernization of the country. However, the development 
process is not always smooth. It is true that some 
foreign-funded enterprises, especially medium and small ones 
running processing businesses with supplied material, drawings, 
and samples; assembling with supplied parts; and compensation 
trade, have disregarded China's labor laws and ordinances, or 
simply ignored workers' safety, wantonly infringing upon the 
workers' legitimate rights and interests. As a result, many 
serious cases have occurred. We can never turn a blind eye to 
this phenomenon. 
<H5>  Seriously Biased Employment Relationship </H5>
  In June 1993, a letter of complaint signed by "37 workers at 
Asia Woolen Knitwear Company Limited, Shenzhen," was sent to the 
office of the Shenzhen City Labor Bureau's Employment Monitoring 
Group. The letter complained about improper labor management of 
the company and also raised five other issues. As one of the 
five issues mentioned, the letter disclosed that "so far the 
company has not signed any employment contracts with its 
employees." 
  The labor contract is the legal document to confirm and 
regulate the employment relationship between the enterprise and 
the workers. Properly signing and implementing the employment 
contract is the precondition and basis for maintaining 
harmonious employment relations and safeguarding the legitimate 
rights and interests of both the management and labor. However, 
a curious but rather common practice among foreign-funded 
enterprises, is that many employers do not sign contracts with 
their employees. In Xiamen, over 90 percent of Taiwan-funded 
enterprises and other enterprises wholly owned by foreign 
investors have never signed employment contracts with their 
workers. A general inspection of the implementation of the 
"Labor Law" in Shenzhen City in 1992 showed that 19.5 percent of 
the 280,000 staff and workers working in the 2,055 sampled 
enterprises were employed without fulfilling any recruitment 
formalities. The number of enterprises which have not signed 
employment contracts with their workers respectively account for 
70 and 90 percent of all the foreign-funded enterprises in the 
Shantou Special Economic Zone [SEZ] and Zhuhai City respectively. 
  The absence of a binding employment contract has resulted in 
a seriously biased employment relationship between 
foreign-funded enterprise owners on the one hand and their staff 
and workers on the other. An employee's behavior, whether it 
has violated labor laws and ordinances or not, will be regarded 
as wrong so long as the boss believes it is wrong. The worker's 
only obligation is to work and he is entitled to no legitimate 
rights. Some foreign-funded enterprises have even imposed 
restrictions on their staff and workers' personal freedom. A 
joint venture in Shanghai has made it a rule that no employee 
can spend more than five minutes in the rest room per visit and 
no one will use the rest room more than once each working day; 
and no worker "is allowed to date any boy or girl within three 
years after her or his employment by the company." A Taiwan 
factory owner warned newly employed workers: This factory is 
mine, so I am the boss. That means you have to do whatever I 
tell you to do and you have to work as long as I tell you to 
work. Whoever does not work conscientiously will be fired. 
There are plenty of job seekers everywhere now and I can easily 
hire as many workers as I want to.... 
  A noteworthy phenomenon is that all the foreign-funded 
enterprises which have failed to properly sign and implement 
employment contracts are, without exception, very vigorously and 
strictly enforcing the company discipline, rules, and 
regulations which they have established on their own. Very 
often they replace the contracts with their own company rules 
and regulations. Their company rules and regulations even 
contain articles which apparently run counter to the state's 
current labor laws and ordinances and violate the workers' 
rights and interests. As a result, the employment contract has 
been rendered an "agreement" which merely safeguards the 
management's rights and interests and gives the management all 
the say. Last March, Zhuhai City Labor Bureau received a copy 
of the "employee's letter of intent committing themselves to 
abide by the factory regulations in Chengfa Garment Factory." 
This self-contradictory document under a heading which bore 
both the terms "letter of intent" and "factory regulations," 
contains 14 articles. All the articles, from Article 1 through 
Article 14, are rules which employees are obliged to strictly 
observe, whereas none of them mentions terms of pay, social 
security, fringe benefits, or legal holidays. What is more, 
some foreign-funded enterprises have undisguisedly declared in 
their factory regulations: "Where any other rules and 
regulations contradict these company regulations, the latter 
will override the former." In so doing they have wantonly 
ignored China's labor laws and ordinances. The relationship 
between management and labor is one between an employer and 
employee, in which the two sides act on an equal footing either 
in terms of law or personality. 
  However, some foreign investors have persisted in acting 
their own way, interpreting this relationship rather as one 
between the master and the slave than as an equal relationship. 
In consequence, the employment relations have become too tense 
and complicated, disputes between management and labor have 
gradually increased, and collective industrial action and 
strikes have taken place in some foreign-funded enterprises. 
All these are related to infringements upon the staff and 
workers' legitimate rights and interests. 
<H5>  Pay Is Not That High </H5>
  When the first foreign-funded enterprises were founded in 
China, many people were very eager to work in them. The main 
reasons were because foreign-funded enterprises offered higher 
pay. However, things were not as beautiful as people expected. 
In many foreign- funded enterprises, the pay for employees, in 
fact, is not in direct proportion to the work they do. Much 
exciting hearsay has turned out to be merely beautiful legends. 
  The Wang sisters came from a small mountain village in 
Shaoyang, Hunan. Like millions of migrant laborers, they were 
extremely excited when they first set foot on Guangdong, a land 
of which they had long dreamed. However, soon after they began 
work in a Huizhou toy plant wholly owned by a Hong Kong firm, 
they found they were earning bitter feelings and many annoyances 
as well as a humble living and they realized that the world 
outside was not so attractive as they had expected. Although 
they had to work for over 10 hours a day on average and seven 
days a week, their total income was barely over 300 yuan a 
month. With payments for meals and other expenses deducted, the 
amount of money they could take home was less than 3,000 yuan a 
year. 
  In fact, compared with many other more unfortunate wage 
earners, the Wang sisters are earning quite a handsome income. 
According to a Sichuan girl working in Dongguan, Guangdong, her 
boss not only extends the working hours but deprives her of the 
benefit of legal public holidays. What is more, her employer 
insists on paying the workers for overtime work at the normal 
rate. Several migrant workers in a Taiwan-funded enterprise in 
Panyu, Guangdong, lodged a complaint with the Guangdong People's 
Broadcast Station, revealing that, although they were working 14 
hours a day, the management still refused to pay them wages 
under the pretext that the factory's products were unmarketable. 
Furthermore, the management also forced them to pay for their 
board and lodging, or their identity cards would be confiscated 
by the management. 
  According to the labor department, complaints with regard to 
wages being lodged by staff and workers in foreign-funded 
enterprises are gradually increasing. In 1992, Baoan District 
in Shenzhen City received and accepted a total of 3,607 
complaints against foreign-funded enterprises; of these cases, 
1,114 were related to wages. Of the cases of complaint lodged 
by foreign- funded enterprise staff and workers over the years, 
nearly 60 percent have been related to wages and the percentage 
is on the increase. The complaints focused on low pay, because 
the wage range in most labor-intensive enterprises is only 
between 200 and 300 yuan a month. This is not only much lower 
than the wage level for workers doing the same type of jobs 
abroad but also slightly lower than the wage level for many 
state-owned enterprises at home. 
  What should be pointed out is that some foreign-funded 
enterprises have very often failed to pay even such meager wages 
to their workers in due course and what the workers finally 
receive is an amount with various deductions. 
  Many foreign-funded enterprises have very rigid factory 
regulations. They are ruled by penalty, fines can be imposed on 
workers under various pretexts, and the slightest lowering of 
vigilance in work on the part of a worker may cost him a fine of 
a certain amount. Those who take sick leave must pay an amount 
as a fine, those who take casual leave must pay an amount as a 
fine, and those who refuse to work overtime must pay an amount 
as a fine too. A certain factory has made it a rule that any 
worker who talks while working is liable to a fine of one yuan 
for each offense; anyone who talks loudly is liable to a fine of 
two yuan for each offense and, what is still more shocking, is 
that workers will have two yuan deducted from their pay for each 
time they use the rest room. The Taiwan-funded Yongqi Company 
in Fuzhou City has made it a rule that anyone who takes one hour 
sick leave must pay two yuan; coming to work more than one hour 
late is counted as a one-day absence, causing the deduction of 
three days' wages and 30 yuan of full- attendance bonus from the 
monthly pay. In the case of a Chinese staff member working with 
a foreign-funded enterprise in Fujian, he earned nearly 300 yuan 
a month but the cumulative amount of fines deducted from his pay 
for a certain month was as high as 150 yuan or more. A woman 
worker in a foreign-funded enterprise in Qingdao manufacturing 
corduroy, received a monthly earning statement for last February 
showing a balance of only 16 yuan after all fines had been 
deducted. She was extremely shocked when she received the sum 
of 16 yuan as her income for the month and she quit the job in 
grief. 
  Intensive labor equals low wage minus fines. This annoying 
equation has been disturbing so many wage earners working with 
foreign-funded enterprises! 
<H5>  Endless Overtime Work </H5>
  To workers in some foreign-funded enterprises, endless 
overtime work is a nuisance indeed. 
  Generally, wages in China mean the income an employee earns 
for his work during the normal working hours (8 hours a day). 
However, nowadays, almost all foreign-funded enterprises count 
overtime pay as a part of the worker's normal monthly wages. If 
a worker does not work overtime, then he will not be able to 
earn a barely acceptable amount of wages. The remuneration 
package offered by many foreign-funded enterprises look pretty 
high but one immediately finds out it is actually rather low if 
one considers the extremely long working hours in these 
enterprises. 
  The Guangdong Provincial Labor Bureau once conducted a 
questionnaire survey among the more than 14,000 staff and 
workers of 17 foreign-funded enterprises. The survey findings 
showed that, in most enterprises, workers had to work 10 to 12 
hours a day and seven days a week. The workers of Shift B in 
the assembly workshop of a toy company in Zhuhai, once worked 
overtime up to 170-192 hours each per month and the highest 
cumulative overtime work record was 214 hours that month, 
amounting to about 26 working days! An electronics company in 
Qingdao has kept its workers on overtime of up to 100 hours a 
month each on average over the past more than a year since its 
opening. A certain knitwear company once forced its workers to 
work three days and three nights nonstop and, as a result, many 
workers passed out at their posts! 
  Back in 1919, the International Labor Organization had 
already set the rule: "Eight-hour working day and 48-hour 
working week for industrial enterprises." However, a small 
number of foreign-funded enterprises are violating this 
"eight-hour working day system." 
  China's labor department has formulated a policy on overtime 
work, which stipulates that each worker's accumulative monthly 
overtime work shall not exceed 48 hours. However, the fact is 
that in numerous foreign-funded enterprises, workers work much 
more overtime than this. 
  Let us now review the reward workers gain from overtime 
work. 
China's labor policy clearly provides that pay for overtime 
work, either calculated on a piece or time rate basis, will be 
1.5 times the normal rate and work on legal public holidays 
shall be paid for as double the normal pay. However, in most 
foreign-funded enterprises, workers do not get their due pay for 
extraordinarily long overtime work. 
  The practice of extended working hours and overtime work is 
mostly related to labor-intensive enterprises dealing in the 
processing business with supplied material, drawings, and 
samples, assembling supplied parts, and the compensation trade. 
Operation of these enterprises generally is subject to 
restriction by the amount of orders on hand. In order to force 
their workers to work overtime so that they can meet the 
deadline for delivery, many factory owners usually set the pay 
standard for overtime work according to the amount of orders and 
the delivery deadlines. They do not follow any fixed 
remuneration scale, just paying arbitrarily. Hardly any 
factories have paid for overtime work in accordance with the 
overtime pay rate as set by the Ministry of Labor but most 
enterprises pay for overtime work at the same rate as the 
ordinary working hour rate. So, there is no actual "overtime 
pay rate." The workers get no extra compensation for extended 
working hours. 
  Why then is the practice of working overtime still so 
common? 
Are workers willing to work overtime? In fact, most wage 
earners do not want to work overtime but, rather, they are 
forced to do so. The Shenzhen Asia Woolen Knitwear Company 
Limited has set a rule: "Anyone who refuses to work overtime is 
liable to a fine of 25 yuan." So, if a worker refuses to work 
overtime, he will lose three days' wages. Therefore, workers 
dare not resist the management's order to work overtime although 
they have a lot of grievances and complaints. 
  Some enterprises induce workers to work overtime with 
bonuses. With overtime work and bonuses linked together, the 
management can now rest assured that the workers will not refuse 
to work overtime. A Hong Kong-funded hardware factory in 
Shenzhen has incorporated the following practice as part of its 
written regulations: Seventy hours overtime work is the 
criterion to qualify a worker as a recipient of full-attendance 
bonus and is the minimum amount of overtime workload for every 
worker. This factory simply ignores the Guangdong provincial 
authorities' regulation that no worker shall work overtime of 
more than 48 hours a month. 
  Some other plant owners do not set any minimum requirement 
regarding overtime work but resort to another tricky practice: 
They arbitrarily set piecework limits on their own. In the 
workshop, manufacturing second hands for a joint-venture 
timepiece plant in Zhuhai, the piecework requirement for each 
worker per duty shift is 4,000 pieces, whereas the requirement 
for a worker of the same category in Japan is only 2,500 pieces 
per shift. More than 200 workers in the sewing machine workshop 
of an enterprise in Tianjin, wholly owned by ROK interests, 
lodged a complaint to the labor department that the workload 
requirement was too high for them to fulfill in an eight-hour 
working day. To meet the requirement they could do nothing else 
but work overtime and if any worker still could not fulfill the 
requirement after having worked overtime, then it would mean 
that worker would get no pay for the day. Given the 
unreasonably high workload, the workers in that plant often have 
to work until 2000 or 2100 or even later before they can go home. 
<H5>  Personality Without Dignity </H5>
  No Chinese could ever forget the plaque hung on the gate of 
Hongkou Park in Shanghai in old China which bore the words: "No 
Admittance to Chinese or Dogs." This plaque aroused the 
national indignation of the several generations of Chinese. It 
is shocking indeed that an absurd incident, in which a human was 
kept in a cage together with dogs, happened in a Taiwan-funded 
enterprise in Fuzhou, China, today in the 1990's. 
  On the evening of 7 November 1993, Yu, a woman worker from 
Jiangxi Province, were caught when she tried to take away two 
pairs of shoes from Yongqi Company. Managerial personnel from 
Taiwan, Chang, Chen, and several other men immediately tied the 
woman worker up. They beat her up and then hung the shoes 
around her neck in front of other workers. As the woman worker 
tried to struggle away, Chang and Chen locked her up in a dog 
cage. Two big dogs barked at the worker fiercely. She was 
frightened and trembling, calling loudly for help. Having kept 
her in the cage for more than two hours, Chang and his 
assistants took the worker to another dog cage. 
  The company owner Chen spoke to more than 600 woman workers 
the next day: "I have treated you as humans in the past but now 
I am going to treat you as dogs." 
  This company owner was really swollen with arrogance and 
his remark was disgusting! He himself is a Chinese but he is 
without the least national sentiment! 
  It is noteworthy that cases like this in which laborers' 
personalities are insulted and their dignity is trampled on are 
not unusual in some foreign-funded enterprises. An enterprise 
wholly owned by a ROK firm has assigned a "foreman" to every 
workshop. These foremen walk around the workshops holding a big 
stick in their hands. When they find any worker being slow at 
work, they will beat him or her with the stick. One day, a 
foreign "foreman" found several woman workers slow at work, he 
ordered them to prostrate themselves in a line with their hands 
on their heads. As the woman workers refused to follow his 
order, he kicked their legs to force them to prostrate 
themselves. 
  A male worker at Fenghan Company in Tianjin once 
accidentally 
hit a foreign managerial officer when unloading a truck. The 
latter, without looking into the cause of the accident, 
immediately climbed up into the container and kicked the worker 
out of it, thus injuring him. 
  Workers at a certain chemical fiber company in Qingdao City 
are ordered to run round the plant or to stand facing a wall as 
a penalty for coming to work late. Foremen at a shoe factory in 
Guangdong often scold and beat workers and the workers "are not 
allowed to refute or resist," otherwise they will be fired. A 
Taiwan-funded enterprise in Guangdong even practices the system 
of "collective penalty," by which a whole work team comprised of 
dozens of members, has to prostrate itself if any one member has 
committed a mistake. A shoe company in Putian, Fujian Province 
has invented some peculiar penalties: Workers are ordered to be 
drenched by rain, to be exposed to the sun, and to jump like 
frogs. 
  A young female worker in a ROK-run enterprise in Tianjin, 
who 
once violated labor discipline, was forced by the foreign 
managerial personnel to eat seven cakes (100 grams each) and 
seven eggs and drink two glasses of water on one occasion before 
she was allowed to go home. The management's behavior was 
really inhumane! 
  Body searches are a violation of human rights which is not 
allowed by Chinese law. The cases of illegal body searches in 
the nude, as happened in the JAL-Longpo Hotel in Shanghai, have 
aroused strong reaction. However, cases like this are still 
taking place from time to time in a few foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
  A toy factory in Qingdao has had male security guards 
searching female workers with a view to preventing the workers 
from taking away goods when they leave the factory for home. 
Woman workers at a private enterprise wholly owned by a foreign 
firm in Tianjin complained that they had often experienced 
insulting body searches upon their leaving the factory for home. 
A survey conducted by the Guangdong Provincial Federation of 
Trade Unions among 20 foreign- funded enterprises in 10 cities 
reveals that 17.6 percent of the workers in these enterprises 
had been searched or had seen their colleagues being searched by 
managerial personnel. 
  To be sure, China is not a wealthy country. But insulting 
the personality is by no means tolerable by the law! 
<H5>  The Price of Blood and Life </H5>
  More than 60 years ago, Xia Yan, in his report "Indentured 
Laborers," depicted the miserable life and terrible working 
conditions of a worker nicknamed "Thin Wood Stick." His 
description shocked the readers. Since liberation, the Chinese 
working classes have become the masters of the country and the 
working conditions and environment for workers have been 
improved remarkably. However, the situations in a small number 
of foreign-funded enterprises are awakening reminiscences of the 
past. 
  Let us hear the complaint of a group of female workers at a 
foreign-funded enterprise in Tianjin: We, 30 people in total, 
live in a room 20 square meters in area. There are no beds and 
we have to sleep on the floor. It is easy to step on others 
when walking through the room to go to the toilet at night. The 
working conditions are very poor in the factory--the workshop is 
simple in structure and it becomes as hot as a food steamer on 
hot days. The rest room is built within the workshop and there 
are a lot of flies in there. All the windows are sealed by 
welding and the window glass is painted over. The workshop is 
not air conditioned so we workers often suffer heatstroke. The 
iron gate of the workshop is always locked during working hours. 
We simply think we are working in "hell." 
  There are still more horrible things. Industrial accidents 
and occupational diseases are a pair of swords hung over the 
workers, the former being the hard and overt one and the other 
being the soft and covert one. They are constantly threatening 
the workers' lives and impairing their health. 
  Fire is the greatest and most direct threat against foreign- 
funded enterprises. The fire that took place in Shenzhen on 19 
November and the one in Fuzhou on 13 December, both covered by 
the newspapers, killed a total of more than 140 Chinese workers. 
Many foreign-funded enterprises do not have enough fire 
prevention facilities and, what is worse, the management does 
not have a sense of fire prevention. 
  Industrial accidents seem to be very common in some 
enterprises running businesses processing with supplied 
material, drawings, and samples, assembling supplied parts, and 
the compensation trade. According to the Shenzhen City Labor 
Department, quite a few workers are electrocuted each year in 
the city and cases of fingers being cut off by machines, such as 
punching machines, metal cutting machine tools, and injection 
molders in particular, which have no safety protection casing, 
have happened from time to time. A metal component part 
manufacturing plant run by a Hong Kong investor in Xili 
Industrial Zone, Shenzhen City, once experienced five hand- 
cutting accidents in a single week. The management of the plant 
did not report these industrial accidents to the authorities, 
nor did they take any precautionary measures afterward. In 
consequence, two more cases of arm cutting happened later. A 
Taiwan-funded enterprise in Xiamen City has experienced 43 cases 
of severed arms and fingers and other injuries, in which the 
worker victims lost a total of 38 fingers! A survey conducted 
among five township and town clinics in Baoan District, Shenzhen 
City, shows that they received a total of 11,679 in-patients 
during the survey period, 1,033 of them or 8.84 percent were 
workers from foreign-funded enterprises who had been injured in 
industrial accidents. 
  Workers in foreign-funded enterprises are facing another 
more dangerous threat--occupational nuisances. 
  Exporting pollution to underdeveloped areas is a usual 
practice by some investors from developed areas. An 
international environmental protection expert has pointed out: 
The present trend is that overseas business interests are 
exporting some "sunset industries" to China in a planned way. 
In 1993, Zhuhai City Public Health Department conducted a 
sample survey in seven Taiwan-funded enterprises. The findings 
indicated that the percentages of benzene, toluene, and xylenol 
in the air were all eight to 10 times higher than the respective 
international standards, the problem being particularly serious 
in such industries as toy making, plastics, shoemaking, fabric 
printing and dyeing, and chemicals. Incidents of poisoning had 
taken place in three foreign-funded toy manufacturing plants, 
causing 81 casualties of whom four died and eight were 
irremediably handicapped. 
  A poisoning case which took place in a garment factory in 
Dalian City causing 42 casualties was due to the poisonous gas 
released by the fabric supplied by an overseas customer for 
processing. In Qinhuangdao City, 12 workers in a Sino-foreign 
joint venture were poisoned the first day the plant started 
operations. As revealed by the findings from a monitoring 
operation conducted by the Dalian City Occupational Disease 
Research Institute at the workshops of 34 currently operating 
foreign-funded enterprises generating occupational nuisances, 
only six enterprises met the public health standards. Shenzhen 
City has conducted an air pollution survey in 547 enterprises 
wholly or partly run by foreign interests, and it found that 
only 29.6 percent of the imported equipment installed at these 
enterprises have antipollution devices and only 26 percent of 
the machines in these enterprises have gone through pollution 
tests before being put into operation. 
  Occupational diseases have already impaired the health of 
the 
staff and workers of some foreign-funded enterprises. In 
Shenzhen, a health examination focusing on occupational diseases 
conducted among 1,100 staff and workers in two shoe factories 
with serious occupational nuisance problems and another arts and 
crafts workshop, revealed that many workers experienced a 
remarkable decrease in the quantity of white blood cells only a 
few months after they joined the plants, which meant that their 
health was under serious threat. Meanwhile, however, a survey 
conducted among 101 enterprises running paint spraying and 
coating businesses in the city showed that hardly any 
enterprises provided their workers with antipollution gauze 
masks, gas masks, or gloves. Some enterprises have only 
provided their workers with cotton gloves which are of little 
use in labor protection, while workers in most enterprises are 
left to be exposed to industrial pollution. 
  In Guangdong Province, 70 percent of the currently operating 
foreign-funded enterprises have not carried out pre-employment 
health checks on their staff and workers according to the 
relevant state regulations and 80 percent have not introduced 
any regular physical examination system for workers engaged in 
polluting operations. 
  Our wage earners who have mortgaged their lives and health 
to 
their employers are paying a very high price!

<F P=106> [By Liu Jinghuai (0491 2417 2037) and Zeng Mingzi (2581 2494 </F>
1311): "Rights, Interests, and Dignity Brook No Infringement-- 
Worries About Protection in `Foreign-invested' Enterprises 
(Second and Last Part)"] 
  [Text] The serious problem of infringing the rights and 
interests of employees in foreign-invested enterprises has 
caused a sharp contradiction between the enterprises' "bosses" 
and the "employees." In some cases, it has caused serious 
consequences in the economic, social, and other aspects of 
endeavor. We must pay close attention to the problem. 
<H5>  Where Does the Root of the Problem Lie? </H5>
  The cases of infringing the rights and interests of 
employees 
in foreign-invested enterprises are emerging one after another. 
In the final analysis, where does the root of the matter lie? 
Our survey shows that there are both institutional defects and 
manmade factors behind the problem. 
  First, in examining and approving foreign-invested 
enterprises, the "green light" is being given at random. 
According to the stipulations of China's labor laws and 
regulations, when carrying out production projects, an 
enterprise is required to report to the labor and public health 
departments, and the trade union organization, for a joint 
examination and approval so that safety and health facilities 
and the principal parts of the projects are designed, 
constructed, and put into operation simultaneously. This is 
called the principle of "undertaking three things 
simultaneously." However, to accelerate the absorption of 
foreign capital some local governments and departments, taking a 
one-sided approach toward the building of investment environment 
and worried that setting strict demands on safety and health 
would frighten away foreign investors, would lopsidedly stress 
simplifying the examination and approval procedures of projects 
and give "the green light" to the projects at random. 
Consequently, labor protection for the enterprises' employees 
and fire prevention facilities were "simplified" to almost 
nothing; the soundness of safety and health work was not 
ensured; and foreign-invested enterprises suffered an inherent 
shortage in such areas as labor, safety, and health. 
  Some enterprises engaged in "processing with supplied 
materials or samples, assembling with supplied parts, and 
compensation trade" with simple and crude equipment, backward 
technology and management, poor protection facilities, and even 
without any protection facilities, started their operations 
hastily. Therefore, once problems cropped up, it was already 
too late for them to remedy and they could neither stop 
production nor close down even if they wished to, thus causing 
great problems for the management. 
  Second, labor laws and regulations are imperfect. China's 
existing labor protection laws and regulations were enacted 
mostly for domestic enterprises. The "Regulations Concerning 
Labor Protection" ["Regulations"], currently in force, were 
enacted in 1951 and revised in 1953. They were the outcome of 
the planned economic structure. As enterprises have become 
market-oriented, some of the contents of the "Regulations" have 
not kept abreast of the changing situation. Nevertheless, 
township and town enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises 
have been implementing the "Regulations" in terms of labor 
protection, thus making labor protection legislation even more 
imperfect and undefined. 
  China has promulgated the "PRC Law on Foreign-Funded 
Enterprises," the "PRC Law on Cooperative Ventures," and the 
"PRC Law on Joint Ventures Using Chinese and Foreign 
Investment," three special laws applicable to foreign-invested 
enterprises but they all lack specific stipulations on labor 
protection, safety, and health work in foreign-invested 
enterprises. Therefore, some foreign- invested enterprises, in 
particular fully foreign-owned enterprises, when availing 
themselves of legal loopholes, were not abiding by China's laws 
and the "Regulations" concerning enterprise labor protection and 
health work other than those in the three laws mentioned above. 
By availing themselves of the loopholes whereby in China there 
are no stipulations on minimum wage and maximum working hours, 
some foreign businessmen deliberately prolonged working hours 
and deducted part of the pay of the Chinese employees. 
  Third, government management and labor supervision are not 
effective. All enterprises which are set up in China, including 
foreign-invested enterprises, must strictly abide by China's 
laws. However, when the employees of some foreign-invested 
enterprises lodged complaints or took action to share legitimate 
rights and interests, some government officials one-sidedly 
stressed absorption of foreign capital and let the bosses of the 
foreign side have the final say on everything, thus giving 
unprincipled protection to the foreign side in foreign-invested 
enterprises for their failure to abide by labor laws and 
statutes. Some local governments went so far as to call out 
police to arrest the so-called "troublemakers' at the request of 
foreign businessmen and forcibly resolved labor- capital 
disputes. Moreover, labor departments in many localities have 
not yet established labor supervision institutions. Even though 
such institutions have been established in some localities, they 
find it difficult to effectively supervise the labor management 
of foreign-invested enterprises as there are no laws to follow. 
  Fourth, trade union organizations are not well formed and 
they are weak and flabby. The trade union undoubtedly plays an 
important role in safeguarding the employees' rights and 
interests. In foreign countries, the enterprise trade union is 
also very powerful. In China, there are trade union 
organizations in all state-owned and collective enterprises 
through which workers can exercise their rights as masters of 
the enterprises and effectively inspect and supervise their 
enterprises' safety in production and their employees' rights 
and interests. However, in many foreign-invested enterprises, 
there are no trade unions at all. Our survey shows that in 
1992, of Jilin Province's 76 foreign-invested enterprises, only 
10 percent had trade unions and, in Qingdao City, less than 30 
percent of the enterprises under operation had trade unions. 
Even where there were trade union organizations, more often 
than not they were looked after by the departments concerned, 
with their strength repeatedly weakened and their activities 
restricted. As a result, they could not bring their proper 
supervisory role into full play. 
  Fifth, the sense of legal system of some employees in 
foreign-invested enterprises' is becoming blunted and the 
quality of employees is low as a whole. In October 1993, in a 
certain locality during his inspection tour of his factory, a 
foreign businessman saw several young female workers chatting. 
He quickly rushed up to the worker who was speaking and slapped 
her face without saying anything. After the event, somebody 
told the boss that the factory was having the machines 
overhauled that day and the workers need not have come to work 
but the female workers were staying in the factory to see if 
they could offer any help. The next day, the foreign 
businessman called the slapped worker to his office, gave her an 
envelope, and let her go, also without saying anything. The 
worker opened the envelop and found 400 yuan in it and she was 
inwardly pleased. Instead of being roused to righteous 
indignation against the foreign businessman, the other female 
workers admired the slapped worker thinking that she had gained 
an extra advantage. Does this not show that the quality of some 
employees in foreign- invested enterprise is too low? 
<H5>  What Role Should the Government Play? </H5>
  The government is duty-bound to safeguard the legitimate 
rights and interests of employees in foreign-invested 
enterprises employees. In the final analysis, what role should 
the government play? 
  According to international practice, in handling 
employee-employer relations, the "three-party principle" should 
be followed. Put another way, the trade union acts on behalf of 
the employee and holds talks with the employer on the contents 
of employee-employer relations, labor interests, and enterprise 
interests, and the government plays the role of coordinator, its 
task being to supervise and rectify the behavior of the employee 
and the employer and protect both sides' legitimate rights and 
interests. 
  China has it own national conditions. The CPC leadership and 
the socialist system have guaranteed themselves the "three-party 
principle" and enabled the three parties to cooperate with one 
another. The problem now is that China's labor supervision has 
just begun; the relationship between supervision and 
rectification of the behavior of the employee and the employer 
has not yet been harmonized; there is a gap between the 
conceptions of some leaders and the legal system and they still 
cannot coordinate the two sides in a just and reasonable way, 
even showing excessive partiality to the foreign investors. 
  When the department concerned investigated the boss of a 
Taiwan- funded enterprise who traded foreign exchange in large 
quantities at a profit or illegally, a provincial leader urged 
the department not to do so instead of supporting their action. 
When the enterprise's Chinese manager reported to the 
department that the Taiwan businessman was importing shoddy car 
safety belts, engaging in the illegal procurement of foreign 
exchange, and evading customs duties and the manager had 
disputed this with the businessman, the leader gave a written 
instruction on the report submitted to him by the department, 
ordering the "arrest" of the manager and calling this act by the 
fine-sounding name of "improving the investment environment." 
Was this action not too excessive? 
  The government is now changing its functions in line with 
the 
requirements of the market economy. As far as foreign-invested 
enterprises are concerned, the government should genuinely 
coordinate its labor supervision; safeguard the relations, 
rights, and interests of the employee and employer; and act as a 
fair-minded "judge" and "law-enforcement officer." 
  Labor supervision should be carried out simultaneously 
regarding the employee and the employer. However, the current 
outstanding problems with foreign-invested enterprises, such as 
confusion in the relations between the employee and the employer 
and poor safety facilities and labor hygiene conditions, have 
repeatedly infringed upon the employees' rights and interests. 
This being the case, at present, attention should be paid to 
correcting the erroneous enterprise actions and promptly 
discover and handle the enterprises' violations of China's labor 
laws and "Regulations." When it comes to the inspection of 
labor recruitment in foreign-invested enterprises, it is 
necessary to: Inspect and supervise the signing of labor 
contracts between the enterprises and workers, examine and 
certify their labor contracts according to law, and put an end 
to the use of contracts based on factory "Regulations"; 
strengthen supervision over wages, working hours, social labor 
insurance, and employees' welfare in foreign-invested 
enterprises; and necessary to improve their working environment, 
supervise their working conditions, prevent safety incidents 
from endangering the employees, and ensure the safety of 
workers' lives and their health. 
  Some people worry that this will frighten away foreign 
businessmen. A person in charge of the newly established 
department of labor relations and supervision under the Ministry 
of Labor said: "In operating enterprises in China, foreign 
businessmen must abide by China's labor laws and "Regulations." 
This is common sense. Carrying out labor supervision is an 
international practice which foreign businessmen can also 
understand. What most worries them is the absence of 
corresponding laws or imperfect laws. Therefore, strengthening 
labor legislation and carrying out supervisory activities 
according to law is precisely conducive to the creation of a 
sound legal environment for foreign investment. 

<H3>    Trade Union--There Must be No Blank Space in 
Foreign-Invested Enterprises </H3>
  The special role of the trade union cannot be replaced by 
any 
individuals or organizations. This is particularly the case 
with foreign-invested enterprises. According to the survey of 
foreign- invested enterprises, people, be they enterprise 
workers, government officials, or far-sighted enterprise bosses, 
have increasingly realized the deep importance of trade union 
organizations. Making speedy preparations for the setting up of 
trade unions has become the consensus of more and more people. 
  The trade union is, in fact, not the invention of socialist 
countries. However, the role of the Chinese trade union as a 
bridge is unique. 
  There is no denying that some foreign bosses do not 
understand the nature, tasks, and work characteristics of the 
Chinese trade union, and many bosses of foreign-invested 
enterprises believe that: The main duty of the trade union is to 
represent staffers and workers to fight the bosses for better 
pay rather than organize the workers to strike. Therefore, they 
try every possible means to restrict trade-union activities and 
prohibit contacts among workers. They just let trade unions do 
such things as "beating drums, blowing trumpets, playing 
guitars, singing songs, playing ball games, and taking photos." 
Most enterprises are even afraid of organizing trade unions and 
find a variety of excuses to refuse to set them up. These bosses 
of foreign-invested enterprises have not genuinely realized the 
special role of the trade union as an "intermediary." 
  At an interview with reporters, Teng Yilong, vice president 
of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The guiding 
ideology of the trade unions in foreign-funded enterprises is 
very clear, that is, safeguarding the employees' legitimate 
rights and interests, cooperating and working together with the 
investors, and serving the employees, the promotion of reform 
and opening up to the outside world, and economic construction. 
The trade union will firmly support the foreign-invested 
enterprises's legal operations on the condition of not 
infringing upon the interests of the state and the broad masses 
of employees. No one, no matter what he is, is allowed to act 
by transcending the law. 
  In foreign-invested enterprises, the characteristics of the 
Chinese trade union determine that it has natural and 
inseparable ties with the masses of employees. First, it can 
teach the employees to abide by laws and observe discipline, at 
all times and everywhere, implement the enterprise leadership's 
decisions by appropriate means, or remove misunderstandings and 
mediate disputes when they occur between the employee and the 
employer. Second, as the spokesman for the employees, it can 
promptly report their wishes, demands, suggestions, and even 
dissatisfactions to the employer and supervise and urge the 
employer to abide by China's laws and protect the Chinese 
workers' legitimate rights and interests. In the development of 
foreign-invested enterprises in China in the last dozens of 
years, there is no lack of successful cases in this regard. In 
promoting earnest talks between the employees and the boss, the 
trade union organization in the Baowei Company in Beijing acted 
as the representative of the employees, thus enabling the 
foreign management personnel to have the opportunity for direct 
dialogue with the Chinese employees. The foreign management 
personnel issued circulars on a regular basis, informing the 
employees of the company's production and operations and the 
measures to be taken. The Chinese employees could express their 
opinions, demands, and suggestions directly to the company's 
management. Thanks to the mutual understanding and 
communication between labor and management, the company's 
economic efficiency shot up and its workers' pay and benefits 
continuously improved. Practice has shown that the relations 
between the employee and the employer in foreign-invested 
enterprises where trade unions are set up are relatively 
harmonious and many conflicts can be solved in the embryonic 
state. On the contrary, the contradiction between the employee 
and the employer is easy to intensify. In 1993, strikes 
occurred in more than 100 foreign-invested enterprises, of which 
90 percent were enterprises where trade union organizations did 
not play the role of mediator. After having seen the role of 
the trade union, a Japanese boss who was previously biased 
against the trade union said emotionally: "Foreign-invested 
enterprises cannot afford not to have any trade unions." 
  According to the stipulations in China's laws, all 
enterprises in the Chinese territory must organize trade unions. 
The 12th Congress of Trade Unions, which ended last year, also 
demanded: All enterprises which have started operation must 
organize trade unions according to law as soon as possible and 
newly established enterprises must make simultaneous 
preparations for the setting up of their trade unions. For 
foreign-invested enterprise to achieve a greater expansion in 
China, they must act according to law and also organize trade 
unions according to law. 
<H3>  Labor Laws and "Regulations" Must Be Perfected As Quickly As 
Possible </H3>
  The market economy is based on the legal system. In the 
process of China shifting to the market economy, 
foreign-invested enterprises must, all the more, be among the 
first in the legal system building. Only when the rights and 
interests of foreign- invested enterprises's employees are 
protected by relying on laws can they develop on a sound and 
orderly track. 
  While conducting this survey, these reporters were informed 
that: Of the total number of foreign-invested enterprises, 10 
percent have "sacked" their own bosses and this has become an 
upward trend. In 1992, a certain joint-venture enterprise in 
Zhuhai recruited a number of female workers from Jiangsu. 
Because they could not bear the excessive overtime and the 
delays in and embezzlement of wage payments, 99 percent of the 
workers either changed jobs or returned home within four months. 
People of insight believe: Only when foreign-invested 
enterprises act in strict accordance with the law and establish 
proper relations between the employee and the employer according 
to law can they and their employees benefit therefrom. A sound 
legal system is the only way for the healthy development of 
foreign-invested enterprises. 
  China still has a lot of work to do in this regard. On the 
one hand, it is necessary to speed up the pace of central 
legislation and the enactment of two major laws on state labor 
protection--the "Labor Law" and the "Law on Prevention and Cure 
of Occupational Diseases" and bring the labor protection of 
foreign-invested enterprises into the system of state 
legislation on labor protection as soon as possible, so that 
barriers between departments and regions at different levels 
will be removed and the unsound and uncoordinated state of 
legislation will be put to an end; there will be laws for 
foreign-invested enterprises to abide by in areas such as worker 
recruitment, wages, social insurance, labor protection, and 
professional sanitation, and a sound and harmonious labor 
relationship will be established. The bosses of 
foreign-invested enterprises must realize that as they do in 
other countries, they must take the path of legal system and 
manage their enterprises and safeguard their employees' rights 
and interests according to law. 
  On the other hand, it is necessary to expedite local 
legislation. Before the state's basic law on labor is 
promulgated, localities must make full use of their right to 
make laws, speed up the pace of legislation, and step up their 
efforts to enact and improve their own "Regulations" on labor 
protection in foreign-invested enterprises. Those localities 
which have not yet enacted any "Regulations" concerning the 
management of foreign-invested enterprises must speed up the 
pace of legislation in the light of their own conditions and by 
using the experiences of the localities which already have their 
own "Regulations" in this regard for reference. 
  The enactment of a law is just half of the process of social 
development according to law. To complete the other half of the 
task, it is necessary to enforce the law strictly. After the 
enactment of a law, the government law-enforcement departments, 
particularly the labor supervision departments, must enforce the 
law strictly, the bosses and employees of foreign-invested 
enterprises must observe discipline and abide by the laws, and 
the trade union must bring its role into play. On the other 
hand, at present, while the legal system is imperfect, the 
departments concerned must make use of the current central and 
local relevant laws and "Regulations" in accordance with the 
"three conducives [san ge you li 0005 0020 2589 0448]" 
principle, use the successful experiences of foreign enterprises 
as reference, and strengthen the inspection and supervision of 
the labor protection, safety, health, and welfare in 
foreign-invested enterprises. When examining and approving 
foreign-invested enterprises, it is necessary to strictly 
implement the examination and acceptance procedures of 
"undertaking three things simultaneously." If we discover any 
hidden accidents and job- related harmful things, we must boldly 
track, supervise, and correct them within a given time. We must 
deal with foreign-invested enterprises which cause serious 
injuries and death by using ideological education and economic 
and legal sanctions, investigate and hold those who violate the 
criminal law responsible for their crimes, and on no account 
must we be overly lenient toward their crimes and let them go 
unchecked. When discussing this issue, Zhu Jianzhen, vice 
minister of labor in charge of labor supervision work, stressed: 
Although the labor supervision department of the Chinese 
Government has just started its work, it will strictly enforce 
labor laws and "Regulations" and thus safeguard the legitimate 
rights and interests of both foreign-invested enterprises and 
their employees according to law. 
  In addition, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on 
better 
propaganda and education work and let foreign, Hong Kong, Macao, 
and Taiwan investors and the Chinese personnel in 
foreign-invested enterprises realize that the Chinese laws and 
"Regulations" should not be trampled upon. Multiple forms 
should be adopted to give wide publicity to China's laws and 
standards concerning labor safety and health work in 
foreign-invested enterprises to persuade them to improve labor 
conditions, abide by labor laws and "Regulations," and to 
respect the employees' dignity. At the same time, it is also 
necessary to teach the employees of foreign-invested enterprises 
to act according to law and boldly safeguard their own rights 
and interests and their enterprises' interests. 
  Foreign-invested enterprise have made important 
contributions 
to China's reform and opening up to the outside world and also 
to economic development. Nevertheless, the bosses of 
foreign-invested enterprises must also realize that the 
political status and economic rights and interests of their 
enterprises' employees, in particular, the Chinese personnel, 
are protected by China's "Institution" and laws. To safeguard 
China's national policy of reform and opening up to the outside 
world, and to enable foreign-invested enterprises to develop 
more healthily, please bear the following in mind: Acting 
according to law will benefit both the enterprises and the 
employees and infringing upon the latter's interests will 
ultimately infringe upon the former's own interests.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692): "China Has </F>
Achieved Initial Results in the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy 
and Ranks Among the World's Major Nuclear Technology Powers"] 
  [Text] A specialist in nuclear power from China has 
pointed out that the development of nuclear power is the best 
way to solve the problem of the long-standing power shortage in 
the coastal economically developed areas of China. China is 
planning to build a second nuclear power plant in Guangdong and 
to carry out the second phase in the construction of the Qinshan 
Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang. China's nuclear power 
departments are also planning to build several nuclear power 
plants in Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and other coastal 
areas. 
  During an interview with a MING PAO reporter yesterday, a 
person in charge of a certain design institute in China's 
nuclear industry said that his institute will help design a 
third nuclear power plant in Guangdong. (It has been reported 
that Lingao in the vicinity of Daya Bay has been selected as the 
plant site.) 
  The nuclear specialist said that the second nuclear power 
plant in Guangdong will use large generating units. There are 
currently two different plans and views regarding the installed 
capacity of Guangdong's third nuclear power plant (that is, the 
Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant). Some specialists want to 
install four 900,000 kw generating units, while others think 
that it is advisable to first install four 600,000 kw generating 
units. The specific plan for the Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant 
has not yet been determined. 
  He also said that the second phase of the construction of 
China's Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant includes the construction of 
two 600,000 kw generating units. Most of the equipment will be 
made in China, but some of it may be imported. Since it 
officially started generating electricity and sending 
electricity to the power grids many years ago, the 300,000 kw 
generating unit of the first phase construction of the Qinshan 
Nuclear Power Plant has been operating smoothly. The entire 
plant was designed by Chinese specialists. 
  He continued to say that, at present, the electricity 
supplied by thermal power plants accounts for more than 80 
percent of the total amount of electricity generated. 
Hydropower ranks second. The amount of electricity supplied by 
nuclear power plants accounts for only a very small portion. If 
the two 900,000 kw generating units of the Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Plant -- which will begin operating in June -- are 
included, China's total installed capacity of nuclear power 
plants is only 2.1 million kw. 
  Most of China's coal mines are distributed in areas north of 
the Huang He, and hydropower resources in the southwest and 
northwest. The eastern coastal areas, which account for more 
than two-thirds of the output value of China's national economy, 
have been suffering electricity shortages for quite some time. 
Transporting coal from the north to the south and transmitting 
electricity (hydropower) from the west to the east can only 
solve part of the problem. Therefore, the development of nuclear 
power is the best option; it is the most economical and causes 
less pollution. 
  An official from the State Nuclear Accident Emergency Office 
told MING PAO that stringent checks are carried out in the 
selection of the plant site and on the design when building a 
nuclear plant. He said that, since the first phase of the 
project of the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant was put into operation, 
the Hong Kong Royal Observatory and China's astronomical 
departments have not observed anything abnormal in their tests. 
  He said that, as compared with the successful experience of 
the west, China is at present one of several countries which 
have mastered nuclear technology. China has many talented 
people and it is only natural for it to develop nuclear power.

[New China] Machinery Plant Writes a New Chapter in China's 
History of Space Industry; Three Carrier Rockets -- The Long 
March 4, 2-J, and 3 Are Assembled Simultaneously"] 
  [Text] Shanghai's Xinzhonghua Machinery Plant, which has 
made illustrious contributions to China's Space undertakings, 
performed yet another miracle at the beginning of the new year 
-- three large carrier rockets of different models were 
assembled simultaneously at the plant, thereby setting a new 
record since the main workshop of the general rocket assembly 
plant was built 18 years ago. 
  Recently, our reporter visited the Xinzhonghua plant. Three 
large rockets --the "Long March 4, 2-J and 3 (Class I and II) 
carrier rockets, each measuring 30-40 meters in length, were 
seen lying alongside in the workshop of the general assembly 
plant which can be reached directly by train . These three 
rockets were assembled a year ago with great efforts by several 
thousand rocket experts and technical workers of the aerospace 
center in Shanghai, and they will be sent to a satellite launch 
center to shoulder heavy responsibilities. 
  The Xinzhonghua Machinery Plant is an aerospace base for 
assembling large-sized rockets in Shanghai. It has successively 
launched 16 man-made satellites on 12 occasions for the country. 
These included China's first meteorological satellite, first 
communications satellites, and first foreign satellite (China 
undertakes satellite launching task for foreign countries), and 
the first successful attempt to launch three satellites with one 
rocket. The 12 launches were all successfully executed, thus 
writing a glorious chapter in the history of China's space 
technology. 
  The Xinzhonghua Machinery Plant also pursues the policy of 
"making both military and civilian products" by manufacturing 
rockets as well as freezers. So far it has sold more than 1 
million freezer units for the space industry. Last year, the 
plant's total output value was approximately 300,000 million 
yuan, with annual profits exceeding 20 million yuan.

<F P=106> [Report: "Central Military Commission Decides To Maintain a </F>
Clean and Honest Army With High Salaries, Deal Blows to 
Corruption, and Reestablish the Army's Good Image"] 
  [Text] In order to stabilize the minds of soldiers and to 
check the intensifying corruption in the Army, Beijing's Central 
Military Commission has decided to greatly increase wages and 
allowances for the officers and men of the People's Liberation 
Army [PLA], so as to "maintain a clean and honest Army with high 
salaries." On the other Hand, Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, pointed out at a recent all-Army 
meeting on fighting corruption and advocating clean conduct that 
the Army's anticorruption drive must uphold high standards. 
  Since implementation in China of the polices of reform, 
opening up, and the market economy, the income gap between the 
Army and the local authorities has continuously widened, and the 
social status of soldiers has fallen. Some military units "are 
not content with lagging behind," so they try hard to make 
money. The Chinese Army already had the "tradition" of engaging 
in production and operation, so military units and soldiers have 
become increasingly active in business operations, to the extent 
that news has continued to arrive about the military using 
military equipment in smuggling activities. These phenomena not 
only lower the quality of the Army and hurt its image, but also 
shake the minds of soldiers. 
  According to informed sources, the Central Military 
Commission already has decided to "maintain a clean and honest 
Army with high salaries," so as to combat corruption and 
reestablish the good image of the Chinese military. According 
to information, wages for officers -- from the level of Central 
Military Commission chairman to the regiment, company, and 
platoon levels -- will be greatly adjusted, and their wages will 
be higher than those of government officials at the same level 
by several times. For example, an officer at the division level 
will earn more than 1,000 yuan, whereas a public servant at the 
corresponding department or bureau level in the government will 
not earn more than 700 yuan, according to the new wage system. 
According to information, the chairman of the Central Military 
Commission will make more than 3,000 yuan, which is much higher 
than that for the premier. 
  Informed sources said that the measure adopted by the Army 
is 
at least aimed at restoring the sense of honor and the 
relatively superior living standard and status of soldiers 
characteristic of the time shortly after the CPC came to power. 
In the 1950's and '60's, the pay of a soldier on the mainland 
was higher than that of a local government official at the 
corresponding level by two "administrative ranks" (about 30 
percent higher). 
  Some scholars in Beijing also have proposed that the Army 
should be strictly banned from doing business, that the Army 
must be maintained by revenues, and that the Chinese Army's 
traditional function of being a "production brigade" must be 
changed and that links between the Army and commercial 
activities must be completely severed. 
  On the other hand, Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing 
Committee of the Political Bureau and vice chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, stressed at a recent all-Army 
meeting on discipline inspection that the work to combat 
corruption and advocate clean conduct within the Army must 
uphold high standards. 
  XINHUA quoted Liu Huaqing as saying that under the new 
situation, the Army shoulders a great historic mission and must 
provide a strong and forceful security guarantee to the 
country's reform, opening up, and modernization construction. 
The Army certainly has to do better in the building of party 
work style and honesty, which is an important aspect of the 
spiritual civilization construction. Party committees and 
leaders at various levels must uphold high standards, meet 
strict demands, and further enhance their awareness and sense of 
responsibility for anticorruption work and honesty. 
  Liu Huaqing said that the senior cadres within the Army must 
have a sense of the overall situation and must strictly abide by 
political discipline. They must resolutely implement whatever 
things are decided by the CPC Central Committee and the Central 
Military Commission, refrain from doing whatever has been banned 
by orders, and honestly do whatever is stipulated by systems, so 
as to really toe the party line politically, mentally, and 
practically. Leading cadres, especially senior cadres, must have 
deeds conforming to words in being honest and self-disciplined, 
and earnestly practice what they advocate. They must strictly 
enforce the various systems and regulations in the area of party 
work style and clean government building that have been 
stipulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military 
Commission, and must be a model in serving the people 
wholeheartedly and in enforcing discipline.

<F P=106> [By Defense Minister Chi Haotian: "The Spirit of Pioneering </F>
an Enterprise Through Arduous Effort is Still Needed"] 
  [Text] The leading character in the book "The People of 
Xiadingjia" is Comrade Wang Yongxing, an old friend of mine. In 
him, we can find traces of heroic fighting during wartime, the 
quality of an exemplary worker, and a struggling and aggressive 
character. The stunning and moving achievements he made in 
leading the people of Xiadingjia through arduous efforts have 
long been widely known on the agricultural fronts all over the 
country. Not long ago, comrade Ai Qi, my old comrade-in-arms 
and an author, gathered material, despite his old age, in the 
mountainous areas of eastern Shandong and wrote down what he saw 
and heard there and completed the book. After reading it, I 
acclaim it and have mixed feelings. 
  Using detailed facts, the book illustrates how the 
protagonist killed his enemies, made achievements, and then 
vowed to pioneer a cause back home; how he bought a donkey for a 
generously high price and engaged in war in adverse conditions 
among the hills and rivers; how he made reforms and brought 
forth new ideas and led the masses in a struggle to get rich. 
This enables people to know the broad-mindedness and courage of 
this unyielding old soldier and this undaunted man. The book 
also tells with subtleness touching stories about him including 
how he did not hang on to his achievements but would rather 
become a peasant, how well he has strictly taught his children, 
how he has remained uncorrupted, and how he withdrew to the 
second front and how his remaining enthusiasm burned. This 
enables us to feel deeply how he has worked selflessly for the 
public interest and what lofty ideals he has by keeping his 
hands clean, and how he has closely integrated himself with the 
masses, and how he has harmoniously integrated his career and 
life. All this is usual and lofty, respectable and credible. 
  As an ideal, Comrade Wang Yongxing and the people of 
Xiadingjia reflect the spiritual outlook of China's 800 million 
peasants; that is, they ardently love the party, the country, 
the troops, and firm socialist beliefs; and that they have the 
heroic courage of pioneering a cause and struggling 
courageously, they have the aggressive spirit of being devoted 
to reform and bringing forth new ideas and the fine virtues of 
considering the situation as a whole and making a sacrifice 
sincerely.... This is the supremely lofty soul of the Chinese 
people and is the motivation rallying the people's support and 
invigorating China. 
  The PLA is a great army. Over the past 60 years or more, 
tens of thousands of youths with lofty ideas have been steeled 
in this revolutionary cauldron. They have made indelible 
contributions to the liberation of the Chinese people and to 
construction. Comrade Wang Yongxing is a good example of 
demobilized and handicapped servicemen and is a piece of good 
steel from the cauldron of the army. Countless people like Wang 
Yongxing have added glory to the army and have sacrificed for 
the country with unlimited loyalty to the party and full ardor 
and sincerity. One can see from them that our Army's glorious 
traditions are being carried forward on all fronts and have 
become a bright torch reflecting on the Great Wall of steel. 
  People who have been through the years of war deeply realize 
that in order to struggle for national liberation and national 
independence, it is necessary to endure countless dangers and 
difficulties and blood-and-fire tests and to pay the cost of 
sacrificing oneself and forgetting about death. Today, the 
great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
under the party's leadership presents extremely heavy and 
arduous tasks and still demands that we pioneer a cause 
arduously and struggle continuously. The publication of the 
book will offer people vivid teaching material so they can have 
a strong belief in the party's leadership, have strong trust in 
socialist beliefs, and carry forward the glorious traditions. 
From it, we can absorb political nutrients, cultivate our 
morals, arouse the revolutionary spirit, overcome all 
difficulties, and proceed from success to success with full 
confidence in our hearts. 
  What needs mentioning is that the author comrade Ai Qi was a 
former serviceman. Since retirement, he has devoted himself to 
the great tide of reform and construction by writing 
courageously and ardently. This persistent spirit is valuable 
and deserves praising. I sincerely congratulate the publication 
of the book and look forward to the publication of more new 
works by comrade Ai Qi.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Feb (XINHUA) -- Recently, the General 
Political Department [GPD] of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] 
and the Communist Youth League [CYL] Central Committee jointly 
issued a circular, calling on all the Army's officers and men 
and the broad masses of youths across the country to learn from 
Comrade Xu Honggang, to raise the banners of patriotism and 
socialism even higher, to adhere to the party's basic line, and 
to vigorously promote the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee 
and Central Military Commission [CMC] with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
as the nucleus. 
  The circular noted: Xu Honggang is the squad leader of a 
signal company of a certain regiment of the Jinan Military 
Region [JMR]. Born in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, in March 
1971, he joined the Army in December 1990 and the party in July 
1993. On 17 August 1993, he took a bus back to his unit after a 
home leave. When the bus was traveling through the territory of 
Junlian County, Sichuan Province, four criminals extorted money 
from a female passenger and resorted to wanton insults. Xu 
Honggang stepped forward bravely to her rescue. He received 14 
stab wounds in his chest, stomach, and arms in the courageous 
struggle against the criminals and over 50 centimeters of his 
intestines dangled out of a slit in his stomach. Holding the 
dangling intestines with his sleeveless sweater, he jumped from 
the bus out of the window to chase the criminals despite acute 
pain. He passed out on the road during the chase and, after 
all-out efforts by local people and hospital to save him, took a 
turn for the better and was out of danger. 
  Xu Honggang's deed of valor, which demonstrates a readiness 
to take up the cudgels for a just cause, has evoked strong 
repercussions in and outside the Army. Recently, party and 
state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, and Hu 
Jintao, plus CMC Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen, successively received 
and commended him. They praised him as a fine son of the people 
and a hero of the PLA and called on all the people across the 
country and all the Army's officers and men to learn from him. 
On 10 January 1994, the JMR conferred the title of honor 
"Combat Hero Who Readily Takes up the Cudgels for a Just Cause" 
on him. The CYL Central Committee named him a "Young Hero Who 
Readily Takes Up the Cudgels for a Just Cause" and conferred on 
him the title of "New Long March Shock Worker of the Nation" on 
1 February 1994. 
  The circular pointed out: The heroic feat of Comrade Xu 
Honggang's courageous struggle against criminals in defiance of 
brute force as well as the touching concern and deep love shown 
by the local party and government leadership and by the local 
people for him is an ode to an era in which we endeavor to build 
socialist spiritual civilization and a song in praise of 
righteousness sung by the Army together with the people under 
the conditions of establishing and developing a socialist market 
economy. It was not by accident that Xu Honggang became a 
combat hero. Born in Wumengshan, a mountainous area through 
which the Red Army traversed on its Long March, he was nurtured 
under the gradual, uplifting influence of the Red Army 
tradition. After his enlistment, he joined a unit of the "iron 
army" which has a glorious history. He carries out the behest 
of the martyrs and carries forward the fine tradition. In 
particular, the education conducted by the unit in outlook on 
life and value laid a solid foundation for his growing up in 
recent years. He was successively commended as a "pacesetter of 
military training," an "outstanding CYL member," and a 
"pacesetter of learing from Lei Feng," and received eight 
citations. He has proved himself to be a fine descendant of the 
Red Army, an excellent fighter of our Army, and an outstanding 
representative of the youth of our times. He is the pride of 
not only the Army, but also youth and all of society. 
  The circular points out: To encourage new healthy practices; 
to safeguard social stability; to strengthen the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization; to ensure the smooth progress 
of reform, opening up, and the establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure; and to facilitate a sustained, rapid, 
healthy growth of the national economy, the GPD and the CYL 
Central Committee have decided to energetically launch an 
emulation drive around Comrade Xu Honggang and to extensively 
publicize his heroic deeds and noble ideas among all PLA troops 
and youngsters at large across the country. They should emulate 
his outstanding political quality of devoting himself to the 
party, the motherland, the people, the Army, and the 
modernization drive; his spirit of carrying forward the fine 
traditions of the party and the Army, conscientiously 
implementing the objective of serving the people wholeheartedly, 
and willingly sacrificing everything for the sake of the 
people's interests; his profound sense of responsibility in 
striving to improve his military skills for the honor of the 
Army, scrupulously performing duties, and practicing new social 
mores and customs; and his heroism of readily taking up the 
cudgels for a just cause, facing danger fearlessly, and daring 
to make a sacrifice. All Army commanders and fighters should 
also emulate the touching deeds of the local party and 
government leaders as well as the masses in caring for and 
cherishing the people's soldiers, and should conscientiously 
learn from the masses and launch more extensively activities of 
supporting the government and cherishing the people, so as to 
further strengthen unity between the Army and the government and 
between militarymen and civilians. In the course of the 
emulation drive, it is necessary to teach officers and men as 
well as youngsters to arm their minds with the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to foster the 
correct ideals, faith, outlook on the life, and value concepts; 
to bring into play the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character poineering spirit" 
proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin; and to resist money worship, 
ultraindividualism, and the inroads of a decadent life-style. 
It is also necessary to foster a healthy atmosphere of admiring 
heroes, emulating the advanced, acting heroically, and finding 
it a pleasure to help others, so as to promote the Army's 
revolutionization, modernization, and regularization and to 
deepen the CYL's "cross-century project of youth civilization" 
and "cross-century project of young talents." Local CYL 
organizations should mobilize young volunteers to launch a 
campaign to serve heroes in order to create a lively situation 
of emulating and serving heroes.

<F P=106> [By reporters Jia Yong (6328 3057) and Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 </F>
2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- Since the beginning of 
the new year, a group of leading cadres of the large units under 
the People's Liberation Army [PLA] have been staying with 
selected grass-roots units to show the concern of their officers 
and men and to help solve practical problems. 
  Going down to grass-roots units to conduct investigations 
and 
studies is a regular task to which the Central Military 
Commission has asked all high-ranking military cadres to attach 
importance. High-ranking cadres of the Army have visited 
islands, companies, and border areas to discover problems, 
analyze problems, solve problems, attain a thorough 
understanding of construction at basic-level units, and guide 
reform and construction there under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and his thought on Army building in the new 
period. To meet the objective needs of establishing a socialist 
market economic structure and the objective needs of Army 
building in China, in the past year the leadership of the three 
general departments of the Army and the various services under 
the major military regions have begun to carry out systematic 
comprehensive investigations and studies aimed at increasing the 
Army's combat capability: The General Staff Department has 
focused on investigations in connection with the training reform 
and administration of the Army in the new period, the General 
Political Department has organized cadres to stay at selected 
units to conduct studies on how to improve ideological work and 
political work in organizational construction and military 
training under the conditions of a market economy, and the 
General Logistics Department has sent out seven investigation 
and study groups. They have traveled 75,000 km to carry out a 
thorough investigation of the basic living conditions and the 
planning and administration of budgets and materials in military 
units; the Air Force, the Navy, the Secondary Artillery Corps; 
the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry 
Commission, and the major military regions have carried out 
investigations into the conditions of special projects involving 
100 company leaders, 100 commanders, and soldiers who are only 
sons or daughters. Their investigation and study achievements 
have served as the basis for high-level, accurate, and 
scientific decision-making by Army authorities. Being approved 
by the Central Military Commission and revised by the three 
general departments, the "Outline for Army Building in 
Grass-Roots Units" was promulgated last year for trial 
implementation by the whole Army. This programmatic document 
for guiding grass-roots Army building for now and in the days to 
come was produced on the basis of extensive investigations and 
studies and of pooling the wisdom of the whole Army. 
  Taking the mass line, high-ranking cadres of the Army have 
listened to the suggestions of officers and men and have helped 
grass-roots units solve practical problems as if these were 
their own problems. The General Logistics Department has 
adopted measures such as giving preferential treatment to 
basic-level units, especially those in remote, frontier, and 
difficult areas; ensuring that their expenses are met and that 
they are provided with work guidance; and making overall plans 
and comprehensive efforts to focus on solving the problems of 
drinking water, housing, heating, electricity, and medical care 
for these areas. By the end of last year, more than 1 million 
officers and men of the Army had moved into new, modern 
barracks. Housing conditions for over 60 percent of the 
officers and men of basic-level military units have improved. 
From May to July last year, under the leadership of the General 
Logistics Department, a medical team was sent to Xinjiang to 
provide physical examinations to officers and men of companies 
guarding the first line of defense in the border areas. The 
Lanzhou and Jinan Military Regions have also sent office cadres 
to companies to ensure that basic-level cadres can take liberty 
on schedule. The Guangzhou Military Region has set up "military 
baby stations" and "military baby schools" in Haikou and Nanning 
to provide jobs for the children of cadres of units stationed on 
islands and in border areas. 
  By going down to basic-level units to carry out 
investigations and studies, high-ranking Army cadres have laid 
down the foundation for overcoming subjectivism in work, 
improving leadership style and office work style, and 
consolidating and strengthening the Army. To cope with the 
problems of too many emulation campaigns, registers, and forms 
for statistical reports in the Army, the General Staff, General 
Political, and General Logistics Departments recently issued a 
joint circular on further streamlining the number of activities, 
registers, and report forms in the Army. The circular clearly 
states that in the future, leading organs at all levels should 
not, in principle, convene on-the-spot meetings at military 
units and that leading organs must reduce to the minimum the 
number of forms for statistical reports used for the purpose of 
keeping track of the situation. When such report forms are 
needed, in general the basic- level units should not be required 
to fill in the form themselves.

"Roundup of All-Army Building of Party Style and Clean 
Administration"] 
  [Text] These reporters recently learned from the 
Discipline Inspection Commission under the Central Military 
Commission [CMC] that since the party Central Committee and the 
CMC made arrangements to combat corruption and build clean 
government in late August of last year, party committees and 
other organs of all major military units have made fairly great 
achievements in improving the party's work style and building 
clean and honest government by taking a firm grip of the work. 
  The party Central Committee and the CMC have been paying 
great attention to improving the party's work style and 
promoting ethical integrity in the Army. In line with the 
guidelines laid down by the 14th CPC National Congress, the CMC 
made a decision to carry forward the Army's fine tradition and 
intensify ethical construction. Leading comrades of the CMC have 
repeatedly stressed at a number of important meetings the need 
to regard the building of the party's work style and clean 
government as a major issue. They took a personal interest in 
cases, read reports on self-examination and self-rectification 
by party committee standing committees in major military units, 
giving instructions to them, and checked up on the work done by 
major military units. On the inspection tour, they made it 
their main task to investigate whether senior cadres had 
maintained high standards of ethical integrity, and, whenever 
they found anything wrong, they pointed it out in earnest and 
saw to it that the mistake was corrected. The CMC has resolved 
to straighten out Army production and operations and has called 
special meetings to set out the tasks. On the CMC's 
instructions, the General Political Department and the CMC 
Discipline Inspection Commission sent work groups to nine major 
military units to investigate the situation in building up the 
party's work style and clean government. All these measures 
have provided important guarantees for achieving the phased 
objectives set by the CMC. 
  Party committees and leading organs at regimental level and 
above throughout the Army have taken self-examination and self- 
rectification as a practical step to put into effect the call by 
the party Central Committee and the CMC to improve the party's 
work style and maintain ethical integrity. They have paid great 
attention to and meticulously organized the campaign. Leading 
cadres and staff members at all levels carried out 
self-examination and self-rectification in real earnest and 
received education in the campaign, thus promoting the building 
up of clean government. 
  In improving the party's work style and building clean 
government, leadership at all levels has focused on the problems 
affecting army building in line with actual conditions. Taking 
into account their professional characteristics, various organs 
instituted new rules and regulations to plug loopholes, uphold 
unified standards, rigorously enforce work procedures, and 
clearly define duties and powers. Many units took practical 
measures to cut down administrative expenditure, relinquished 
plans to refit their offices and expand their guest houses or 
reallocate or conceal cars bought without authorization, and 
rectified unhealthy tendencies, including indulging in 
ostentation and extravagance. Leaders at all levels have 
encouraged cadres to work industriously for the people through 
the campaign to build clean and honest government. They also 
reduced senior cadres' activities so that they could go down to 
grass-roots units to help solve practical problems. 
  To comprehensively carry out the tasks set by the party 
Central Committee and the CMC, party organizations at all levels 
throughout the Army have paid equal attention to education and 
to identifying and acting on violations of laws and discipline. 
They conscientiously studied the third volume of the "Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping" to arm party-member cadres' minds with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. They conducted in-depth education on 
the party and the Army's objectives, ideals, convictions, and 
fine traditions to increase cadres' ability to resist hedonism, 
extreme individualism, and the decadent way of life. Various 
units throughout the Army also gave publicity to and commended 
in many forms those units and individuals who acquitted 
themselves splendidly in improving the party's work style and 
building clean government in urging officers and men to preserve 
the true qualities of veteran Red Army men. 
  A responsible member of the CMC Discipline Inspection 
Commission said that though the Army had made fairly great 
achievement in building up the party's work style and clean 
government in the previous stage, it has a long way to go to 
meet the requirements of the party Central Committee and the CMC 
as well as the expectations of the people. It is a long-term 
task to improve the party's work style and build clean and 
honest government in the Army, so it is necessary to continue to 
keep sustained attention on the job, he added.

<F P=106> ["Commentator's article:" "Turn to Management for Combat </F>
Capability--First Discussion on Strengthening and Improving 
Troop Management"] 
  [Text] Since last year, the Central Military Commission 
and General Headquarters have repeatedly stressed that the armed 
forces should really attach importance to troop management work 
according to requirements of the new tasks under the new 
situation and actually achieve solid results by seeking good 
methods of managing troops and strictly enforcing discipline 
among the troops so that troop management may be markedly 
improved through the adoption of comprehensive measures in a 
period of two to three years and may make substantial progress 
and development. Such an important arrangement gave expression 
to regularity in the building of the armed forces in the new 
period and represented a major step toward enhancing the quality 
of our armed forces. 
  Why should troop management be placed in an important 
position in the building of the armed forces? This is because 
troop management is the foundation for all activities of the 
armed forces, and the existence and development of the armed 
forces cannot be maintained with rigorous and scientific troop 
management. In a broad sense, troop management refers to the 
organization, coordination, control, and regulation of the 
special working and living order and method, and to the 
subordinate personnel and equipment of the armed forces 
according to relevant regulations and rules. So we may say that 
troop management covers everything and has to be conducted at 
any time. It is the basic work in the military units, and must 
be conducted most frequently, intensively, and extensively. It 
constitutes the precondition and provides the guarantee for the 
rallying force, combat effectiveness, consolidation, and 
development of the military units, and is also closely linked 
with the revolutionization, modernization, and regularization of 
the armed forces. Without unified, rigorous, and scientific 
management of troops, there will be an undisciplined, loose, 
lax, and disorderly condition, and military units will become 
just a plate of loose sand and will lose their combat 
effectiveness. 
  At present, the building of the armed forces is situated in 
a 
new historical period, and the work of troop management is 
getting more and more important. Properly managing troops is 
also an important point in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas about 
building the armed forces in the new period. Along with the 
in-depth development of reform and opening and the development 
of the socialist market economy, profound changes have occurred 
in the overall social environment for the building of the armed 
forces. On the one hand, this will fundamentally lay a solid 
material foundation for the modernization of the armed forces, 
and will further encourage officers and men to update their 
mentality, seek more knowledge, and make achievements. This 
will thus give new vitality and dynamism to construction and 
reform in the armed forces. We should grasp the opportunity, 
give proper guidance according to the development of the 
situation, break new ground, make advances, and raise the work 
of troop management to a new level. On the other hand, we 
should also notice that in the course of transition from the old 
to new systems, we have encountered and will continue to 
encounter many new problems that we did not encounter before in 
troop management, and we are required to tell our cadres and 
soldiers what to do and how to react and give them timely and 
effective answers. Thus, we should find new concepts, means, 
and methods to adapt the work of troop management to the 
changing situation. 
  The armed forces are shouldering the military mission in the 
new period, and this also sets high requirements for the work of 
troop management. Local wars under modern conditions will not 
only be confrontations of high-tech weaponry and equipment, but 
will, more importantly, also be a trial of strength in the 
aspects of personnel quality and troop discipline. The more 
advanced the weaponry and equipment, the higher the requirements 
for the quality of troop management will become. Happenings in 
recent local wars in the contemporary world fully show that the 
high-tech war has made the time for the movement of troops to a 
stage of calculating minutes and seconds; so only with rigorous 
and scientific management can discipline and good combat style 
and effectiveness be brought about. 
  The Army has fine tradition and scientific theory for troop 
management. Substantial progress has also been made in this 
regard in recent years. However, we should also admit that the 
current condition of troop management is still unsuited to the 
needs in the development of the socialist market economy. 
Strengthening and improving troop management remains an 
extremely important and urgent task. All units in the Army must 
follow Chairman Jiang's instruction: "Being politically up to 
standard, militarily proficient, consistent in keeping the fine 
style of work, highly discipline, and effective and efficient in 
logistics guarantees." They should study the new conditions and 
resolve the new problems in troop management in the new period, 
lay a good foundation for the building of the armed forces, and 
enhance the quality, efficiency, and combat effectiveness 
through the improvement of troop management.

  [Text] Nanjing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Output of freshwater 
fish in east China's Jiangsu Province set the highest record in 
history last year, enabling the province to become the country's 
second with freshwater-fish production exceeding one million 
tons. 
  As a famous time-honored land of rice and fish, Jiangsu has 
rich aquatic resources with 1.7 million ha [hectares]. In total 
acreage of fresh water. 
  During the past decade, the provincial government has 
boosted 
the development of freshwater fish-farming as part of the 
efforts to readjust agricultural structure and increase farmers' 
income. 
  To meet the demand of markets, importance has been given to 
raising of rare and special species, and artificial cultivation 
of crabs, pearls, eels and soft-shelled turtles, which have 
become new pillars of local freshwater farming. 
  Based on the burgeoning of aquatic breeding, new economic 
entities combining cultivation, processing and export of aquatic 
products have come into being and effectively promoted the 
expansion of export-oriented fish-farming. 
  By now, annual exports of aquatic products from Jiangsu have 
reached 20,000 tons with total profits worth 100 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  Jiangsu has also stressed spread of technology in order to 
gain high quality, high efficiency and high output in aquatic 
breeding.

  [Text] On the morning of 1 March, while discussing the 
government work report at the groups of Zibo and Qingdao 
deputies, Jiang Chunyun, a deputy to the provincial people's 
congress and secretary of the provincial party committee, said: 
We should firmly control the overall situation of the work of 
the entire party this year and execute the major issues 
concerning reform, development, and stability with a view to 
again pushing all the work of the province onto a new stage. 
  At 0800 that morning, Jiang Chunyun travelled to the Zibo 
deputies' group to discuss the government work report made by 
Governor Zhao Zhihao. In his speech, Jiang Chunyun said: We 
must correctly understand and handle the dialectical relations 
among reform, development, and stability. Reform and 
development constitute the foundation of social stability, and 
stability constitutes the pre-conditions for reform and 
development. We should achieve the goal of grasping reform to 
promote development, grasping development to embark on a new 
stage, and grasping stability to ensure a good overall 
situation. Successfully grasping these three issues means 
successfully grasping crucial issues that will enable us to gain 
the initiative in leadership work. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: In carrying out reform, we should 
focus on reform packages, make breakthroughs in major aspects, 
and make a big step around the general objective of establishing 
a socialist market economic structure. At the same time, 
attention should be paid to reforms in the spheres of planning, 
finance and taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, 
enterprises, rural areas, and circulation. The pace of shifting 
to the socialist market economic structure should also be 
accelerated. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: Development is the last word. We 
should firmly grasp the central link of economic construction at 
any moment without the slightest degree of slackness or 
deviation so that we can ensure that the national economy will 
embark on a new stage every few years. In accelerating 
development, we should not only effect an increase in quantity 
but also effect an improvement in quality. We should go all out 
to readjust structures, strengthen management, effect 
technological progress, improve quality, and increase economic 
returns. Considering this to be a major guiding ideology for 
the province's economic work, this should be assigned to each 
level for implementation in order to ensure sustained, sound, 
and rapid development of the province's economy. 
  Jiang Chunyun also went to visit deputies of Qingdao and 
talked about his opinions on Qingdao city's reform and 
development.

  [Excerpts] The Second Session of the Eighth Shandong 
Provincial People's Congress, which is the focus of all the 
people of the province, ceremoniously opened at the Zhenzhuquan 
People's Assembly Hall of Jinan on the morning of 28 February. 
This session of extreme importance was held in a gratifying 
situation where all people of the province had the spirit of 
reform, adopted an all-new attitude, and closely focused on the 
grand goal of setting up the socialist market economic system in 
an effort to further accelerate reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. Entrusted with the heavy trust of some 86 million 
people throughout the province, the people's deputies from 
various localities and fronts of the province high-spiritedly, 
energetically, and confidently attended the session to jointly 
discuss great matters of reform, construction, and development. 
  Present at the session and also seated in the front row of 
the rostrum were executive chairmen, namely Jiang Chunyun, Li 
Zhen, Ma Zhongcai, Wang Shufang, Miao Fenglin, Guo Songnian, Xu 
Jianchun, Ma Shizhong, Guo Changcai, Yan Qingqing, Ma Xutao, and 
Xu Xuemeng. Comrade Li Zhen chaired the session. 
  [Begin recording] [Li Zhen] Fellow deputies and fellow 
comrades: The Eighth Shandong Provincial People's Congress has 
934 deputies. Thirty- eight deputies were absent on sick leave 
or compassionate leave. Eight hundred and ninety-six deputies 
are present for today's session. We have quorum. Now, I 
declare the Second Session of the Eighth Shandong Provincial 
People's Congress formally open. [applause] Please, stand for 
the playing of the national anthem. [Playing of the national 
anthem] We will now invite Comrade Zhao Zhihao, governor of the 
provincial government, to deliver the work report of the 
provincial people's government. [applause] 
  [Zhao Zhihao] Fellow deputies: On behalf of the provincial 
people's government, I will now present the government work 
report to the session for examination and discussion. 
Simultaneously, I ask the members of the provincial committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC] and other personnel attending the session as nonvoting 
delegates to give opinions. First, in 1993, the province 
realized the second economic doubling target ahead of schedule 
and laid a foundation for basically realizing modernization. 
The past year was one in which the province further accelerated 
the pace of reform, opening up, and modernization; and all 
undertakings developed vigorously. Under the leadership of the 
Shandong Provincial CPC Committee, governments at various levels 
united with and guided the people of the province to 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's important talks and the 14th party congress; 
resolutely implemented a series of policies and principles on 
deepening reform, accelerating development, and improving and 
strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control as set forth 
by the party Central Committee and the State Council; worked 
solidly; bravely did pioneering work; and successfully 
accomplished the 1993 work tasks as defined at the first session 
of the eighth provincial people's congress. A gratifying 
situation characterized by economic development, political 
stability, unity of the people, and social progress emerged in 
the province. [applause] Here, I was pleased to announce that 
through the arduous efforts made by all people of the province 
in the past 10 years or so, the province's GNP in 1993 was 4.3 
times that of 1980, fulfilling the doubling target seven years 
ahead of the schedule. The first-step development target of the 
province's three-step goal was successfully realized. This 
indicated our province's entrance into a period of (?successful) 
development of modernization. This is the best historical 
achievement of the people of the province. [applause] [end 
recording] 
  Governor Zhao Zhihao's government work report consists of 
five parts. First, in 1993, the province fulfilled the second 
economic doubling target ahead of schedule and laid a foundation 
for basically realizing modernization. Second, define the 1994 
economic and social development principles and tasks and elevate 
modernization to a new height. Third, further strengthen 
agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy, 
optimize structure, increase economic results, and promote 
faster and better development of the economy. Fourth, promote 
package reform with breakthroughs in key areas and accelerate 
the pace of setting up the socialist market economic system. 
Fifth, persist in the principle of taking a two-handed approach 
and ensure that both hands are tough so as to achieve spiritual 
civilization and the self-construction of the government. 
[passage omitted] 
  The members participating in the second session of the 
provincial CPPCC committee attended the session as nonvoting 
delegates.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 2 (XINHUA) -- This, China's largest 
economic center has vowed to boost foreign trade this year. 
  According to Huang Ju, mayor of the city, Shanghai plans to 
export 8.5 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods this year, an 
increase of 15.4 percent over last year and exceeding the growth 
of its gross domestic product. 
  Last year saw the city export 7.34 billion U.S. 
dollars-worth, keeping the same pace with the expansion of its 
GDP. 
  "However, Shanghai's leading position in economic 
development 
has required it to further develop its foreign trade," the mayor 
noted. 
  Huang called on foreign trade departments to strive to 
export 
at least 8.5 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods this year and 
goods valued at 10 billion U.S. dollars next year. 
  To accomplish the objective, the municipal government has 
decided to adjust its industrial structure and organize 
enterprise groups while adopting an investment policy to 
encourage foreign trade departments.

global counterparts of McDonnell Douglas [MD], the aircraft 
manufacturing giant in the United States, the Shanghai Aircraft 
Factory has now developed into its number one overseas spare 
parts supplier. 
  At present, it has sold 261 total sets of spare parts to MD, 
including both simple products like main landing-gear doors and 
advanced ones like electronic cabin doors and tailplanes which 
set more strict demands on technology and skills. 
  The Shanghai Aircraft Factory has played an important role 
in 
Sino-U.S. high-tech cooperations during recent years. 
  Apart from active competition on the world's spare parts 
markets, it has also introduced advanced technology and 
management experience from McDonnell Douglas to jointly 
manufacture MD-82 and MD-83 aircrafts.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 2 (XINHUA) -- 15 years ago two young 
men from east China's Zhejiang Province, both living by cotton 
teasing, saw a golden opportunity to become well-off as people 
rushed to buy buttons which they had picked up in a rubbish dump. 
  To date, Ye Kelin, one of the two men, has become a 
successful entrepreneur. His hometown, Qiaotou Town in Yongjia 
County has grown into China's biggest button market, with some 
200 button processing factories and 50,000 people engaging in 
the field. 
  Thanks to these small buttons, the town, once a poor and 
remote place, has taken on a new look, with high buildings 
cropping up and roads leading to over 20 provinces in the 
country. 
  The rise of Qiaotou Town and the success of the two young 
men 
is far from extraordinary in the province, which has set up 
4,127 markets of various kinds, with 1993's turnover amounting 
to 65.1 billion yuan. 
  Among them, some national markets, such as the Yiwu-based 
"small commodities town", the Wenlin-based aquatic products 
market and the pearl market at Zhiji, lead the country. 
  Ye said, "It is the markets that have lifted us out of 
poverty." 
  Stories about business success are heard everywhere in the 
province. 
  A shoemaker has become the boss of a sewing-machine factory, 
the output value of which surpasses 100 million yuan. 
  A young man has launched a company offering chartered 
airplane service to passengers on six domestic airlines. 
  A "beggar village" has achieved an average per capita income 
exceeding that of Hong Kong. 
  And a township enterprise has contracted with the police and 
military in the United States to supply badges. Every month it 
supplies 20,000 badges to the country. 
  Township enterprises grossed nearly 260 billion yuan in 
1993, 
accounting for two-thirds of the province's industrial total. 
Each farmer's yearly income has reached around 1,600 yuan, 
leading the country for eight years running. 
  Some attribute the success to the natives' innate business 
sense. 
  Famous township entrepreneur Lu Guanqiu, president of the 
Wanxiang Group in Hangzhou, said that without the reform 
campaign he and his countrymen would be nothing. 
  He said, "The market economy is an opportunity for 
Zhejiang's 
invigoration." 
  Located on east China's coast, the province has long 
suffered 
from violent typhoons and storms, forcing many local residents 
to leave home to make their living in other places before 
liberation. 
  As a result, Zhejiang natives seem more outgoing, active, 
enterprising and easily adapt to new environments, compared to 
people from other parts of China. 
  After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 
Zhejiang narrowed the gap with other provinces in economically 
strong east China. But a lack of raw materials and natural 
resources still hindered its development of modern industry. 
  When the government lifted some restrictions on central 
planning in the late 1970s and China's higher-learning 
institutions restored enrollment, some 10,000 farmers from 
Wenzhou City, which took the lead in experimenting with the 
market economy, went to colleges and universities to get orders 
for school badges. 
  All of them made their fortunes, encouraging others to 
follow 
suit. 
  Shaoxing County, in the forefront of China's 100 
economically 
powerful counties, saw over 100 farmers set up stalls along a 
street, buying textile raw materials from the north and selling 
the final products. 
  With turnover and profits snowballing, "a textile and light 
industry city" emerged there. It has now become the largest 
cloth distributing center in Asia. Last year the center 
registered a business volume of 3.5 billion yuan-worth. 
  Ji Gengli, secretary of the county's party committee, said 
that due to this center the output value of township and private 
enterprises here accounts for 90 percent of the county's 
industrial total. 
  So far, the province has 290 production materials markets, 
registering an annual business volume of 18.6 billion 
yuan-worth. Its over 50,000 township enterprises get over 60 
percent of their materials from these markets rather than 
through allocations from state planning. 
  So far, there are 29 such markets whose turnover surpasses a 
total of 100 million yuan each. 
  In recent years more and more Zhejiang natives have turned 
their sights to the labor and production factor markets. 
  Around 160,000 people in the province are engaged in fields 
such as information and the transfer of research findings. Each 
year, nearly 10,000 fruits from over 2,000 collective or private 
research institutes are turned into production through the 
markets. 
  More than 60,000 enterprises have connected farmers with the 
market, resulting in a big increase in farmers' incomes. 
  And people breeding aquatic products and involved in 
horticulture seem to earn more than others. 
  Zhang Aiping and his three partners, all farmers in Yuhuan 
County, invested over three million yuan, which they had made by 
planting fruit trees, into a river eel pond in 1993 and reaped 
more than one million yuan in profits that year. 
  To introduce advanced techniques, farmers in Cixi and Yuyao 
invited horticulturists from Japan and Taiwan. 
  According to preliminary statistics, the annual export 
volume 
of farm by-products has reached nearly 20 billion yuan-worth, 
earning over two billion U.S. dollars. 
  A new proverb has gained popularity in the province: "People 
who want to get rich should learn to swim in the market first." 
  Now, the second round of reform, featuring a shift to the 
shareholding system, is sweeping through the province. It has 
870 joint-stock companies.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 3 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang, 
one of China's few provinces which abound in fluorite ore, has 
over the past decade developed the country's top fluorination 
industrial base. 
  Official sources said that by the end of this century, an 
estimated output value of more than three billion yuan will be 
realized by the fluorination industry of the province. 
  At present, the fluorination industrial sector is capable of 
producing about ten types of products, including basic 
fluorination materials, elementary fluoride and fluo-medicine, 
according to official sources. 
  In the past decade, the province has invested a total of 
some 
470 million yuan to introduce advanced technology and equipment 
such as instruments for the production of anhydrous hydrofluoric 
acid and methane-chloride, in support of the technological 
development of its fluorination industry.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 20 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN 
SHE)--Guangzhou's January inflation rate exceeded 19 percent, 
exhibiting greater inflationary pressures than last year. 
  While he refrained from stating the specific inflation rate 
for January in an interview with a reporter yesterday, an 
authoritative official at the department concerned in the 
Guangzhou City government said: "It is certainly a little 
higher than last January's 19 percent." The precise figure is 
not known until it is released by the relevant government 
department, he said. 
  The official said that the Guangzhou market was relatively 
stable in the Spring Festival period. 
  But this official is concerned about preset price increases 
in Guangzhou. He said that pork recently went up by 23 or 24 or 
even 30 yuan per jin from an original price of less than 20, 
adding that such unreasonable rises are unacceptable to citizens. 
  The government's new task is to exercise effective price 
controls while freeing prices, he continued. [sentence as 
received] 
  Guangzhou's inflation rate in 1993 was as high as 25.1 
percent, ranking third among other areas across the country. 
  Guangzhou Deputy Mayor Chen Kaizhi stressed here two days 
ago 
that Guangzhou's inflation rate must be kept below 15 percent 
this year.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 3 (XINHUA) -- Shenzhen City, one of 
China's special economic zones, is to build an auto 
manufacturing center, according to local government sources. 
  The center will aim to put new life into the city's auto 
industry, and thus promote related industries. 
  In the government plan, by the year 2000 auto manufacturing 
will become one of the city's pillar industries, with an output 
of ten billion yuan, accounting for ten percent of Shenzhen's 
total industrial output that year. 
  In its preliminary efforts, the city government will invest 
150 million yuan (about 17.2 million U.S. dollars) in the 
construction of the center.

in the zone at the border with Hong Kong halted services in what 
was believed to be the first major strike by taxi drivers in 
China, residents, contacted by telephone, said. 
  The taxi drivers, though disorganised with no apparent 
leaders, were protesting against the issuing of 2,000 licences 
to operators of new taxis in the Shenzhen. There were about 
6,500 taxis in the zone run by more than 80 taxi companies, with 
over 10,000 drivers. 
  There was a "visible" increase in the number of armed police 
officers patrolling the streets, travellers returning from the 
zone said.

  [Text] Du Qinglin, chairman of the provincial people's 
congress standing committee and provincial party committee 
deputy secretary, met Mr. Hwang In-chong, president of the ROK 
Development Research Academy, at the China Hainan Reform and 
Development Research Academy yesterday afternoon. The two sides 
exchanged views on economic cooperation between Hainan and the 
ROK and some other issues. 
  When giving an account of Hainan's achievements over the 
past 
six years since the Hainan Special Economic Region was 
established, Chairman Du Qinglin noted: There are now more than 
5,000 foreign- funded enterprises in Hainan, 13 of which are 
ROK-funded enterprises, ranking 14th in numerical order among 
all the foreign investors in Hainan. Many ROK conglomerates 
have expressed an interest in investing in Hainan. We welcome 
all of them to come and invest here. 
  Mr. Hwang In-chong said: Though relatively backward with 
regards to its level of development, Hainan is more advanced in 
urban management in comparison to the ROK. The 100,000 
qualified personnel Hainan has invited from other Chinese 
provinces and regions have now become your biggest asset. I am 
convinced that Hainan's numerous preferential policies are bound 
to attract more investment from the ROK and other foreign 
countries.

  [Text] Haikou, March 2 (XINHUA) -- South China's Hainan 
Province has chosen the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system as a major breakthrough to be made in expanding China's 
reforms. 
  Hainan Island is the country's largest special economic 
zone. 
  The outline of reform was announced yesterday by Governor 
Ruan Chongwu to deputies attending the second session of the 
first provincial people's congress. 
  In his report of governmental work, the governor demanded 
that a manager responsibility system with a board of directors 
as the supreme authority should operate in all enterprises, and 
that all enterprises should be freed of subordination to 
administrative bodies. 
  While promising enterprises full freedom in employment 
matters, the governor also pledged that workers would be given 
more freedom in changing jobs between enterprises of different 
ownership or in different places. 
  In his report, the governor said the province would seek to 
reform its allocating method of import and export quotas and 
licences, hinting that a tendering system might be established. 
  The province will also seek to attract more overseas 
investment in improving its tourist and agricultural 
infrastructures, and in developing its rich tropical 
agricultural resources and ocean resources, the governor said. 
  According to the governor, the province will further develop 
its insurance service in pensions, industrial accidents, 
unemployment and medicine. 
  Besides employees of enterprises, the report said, such 
insurance networks would be extended this year to employees of 
government bodies and self-employed people. 
  In relatively rich villages, a medical insurance system that 
aims to cover farmers against risks of serious diseases would be 
established on an experiment scale, the report said. 
  Seeking to further improve the province's infrastructure in 
1994, Hainan will invest seven billion yuan (805 million U.S. 
dollars) in 24 key projects, including an international airport 
in Sanya city, an expressway running along the east side of the 
island, an airport for the provincial capital, and three power 
plants. 
  By all these means, the governor said, the province aims to 
produce a GDP [gross domestic product] value of 27 billion yuan 
(3.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1994, which would be 18 percent 
higher than in 1993.

  [Text] Wuhan, March 3 (XINHUA) -- Living conditions for 
rural residents in central China's Hubei Province have improved 
greatly over the past 15 years, according to a recent survey 
carried out in rural areas of the province. 
  The survey says that the per capita living space for rural 
residents increased from 11.8 sq m in 1978 to 25 sq m in 1993. 
Seventy percent of the newly-built houses are made of bricks and 
timber or bricks and concrete. 
  In Yunyang Prefecture of northwestern Hubei, more than 
14,000 
rural households have moved into newly-built houses from caves, 
shabby thatched shacks, or endangered houses. 
  The city government of Enshi, in southwestern Hubei, 
earmarked funds for helping to build new houses to move its last 
group of 400 rural households who used to live in caves. 
  Many new villages for fishermen, as well as a large number 
of 
house-boats made of cement, have been built in many of the 
province's lake areas, helping more and more fishermen settle 
down in fixed abodes.

<F P=106> [Report: "Criminals Involved in Xiji's Armed Gang Fights </F>
Punished"] 
  [Text] A case of armed gang fights in the Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Region's Xiji County was examined in open trial by 
the Guyuan Prefecture Intermediate People's Court, and court 
judgments were made in accordance with the law on 3 and 6 
February. During the legal time limit, the defendants did not 
appeal to the higher court, and the procuratorial organs did not 
disagree with the court's judgments. Accordingly, the verdicts 
became effective on 19 February. 
  Criminal Ma Liesun was the vice chairman of the Ningxia 
Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and a member of the Standing 
Committee of the CPPCC National Committee before he was 
arrested. Criminal Ma Fuli was an associate professor at the 
Ningxia Education College and criminal Ma Jie was a lecturer at 
the Northwest No 2 Nationalities Institute before their arrests. 
Criminal Ma Rucheng was a peasant in Xiazhai Township of Xiji 
County before he was arrested. Since May 1992, Ma Liesun, Ma 
Rucheng, Ma Fuli, Ma Jie, joined others in repeatedly organizing 
gang fights and revenge attacks in Xiji County of Ningxia 
despite repeated warnings from the party and government. They 
trampled upon state laws and ignored the safety of the people. 
As a result, 49 people died, two disappeared, and 30 were 
wounded. To prepare for the gang fights, they unlawfully 
manufactured and bought guns and ammunition. After the fights, 
a total of 5,442 guns (of which 2 were for military use), 7,362 
bullets of various kinds (of which 310 were for military use), 
21 privately made cannons, and 118 privately made shells and 
bombs were confiscated from the two sides involved in the 
dispute. 
  The evidence mentioned above was sufficient and proven, and 
the defendants pleaded guilty. 
  The acts of these criminals seriously violated Articles 137, 
132, and 112 of the "Criminal Law of the People's Republic of 
China," and constituted the crimes of murder with intent and the 
illegal manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition. To 
safeguard the authority of the law and to protect the safety of 
the people's lives and property, Ma Liesun was punished 
according to the law for murder with intent and the illegal 
manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition in plotting 
armed gang fights, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, and 
was deprived of his political rights for four years. Ma Fuli 
was punished for murder with intent and the illegal manufacture 
and purchase of guns and ammunition in plotting, organizing, and 
commanding armed gang fights, was sentenced to life 
imprisonment, and was deprived of his political rights for life. 
Ma Jie was punished for murder with intent and the illegal 
manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition in plotting, 
organizing, and commanding armed gang fights, was sentenced to 
20 years' imprisonment, and was deprived of his political rights 
for five years. Ma Rucheng was punished for murder with intent 
and the illegal manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition 
in plotting, organizing, and commanding armed gang fights, was 
sentenced to life imprisonment, and was deprived of his 
political rights for life. Of the 19 other criminals involved 
in the case, 18 were sentenced to three to 14 years behind bars, 
and one was not given criminal punishment.

  [Text] The second meeting of the second session of the 
Eighth Provincial People's Congress was convoked at the 
Provincial People's Government auditorium in the afternoon of 27 
February. The presidium executive chairman Ma Shiqing presided 
over the meeting. Sitting on the rostrum were executive chairmen 
Cai Dan, Ma Yuling, Ye Fei, Ji Jingde, Liu Rongqing, Gan 
Shouxiang, Feng Linggang, Caipei Doji, Fang Jie, Ye Fengnian, 
Zhang Jingshan, Ma Youqiang, Yang Yinkai, and Shi Huaizhen. Su 
Kun, director of the provincial commission for planning 
delivered a report on the conditions of implementing the 1993 
provincial plan for economic and social development and the 
draft 1994 plan. In the report he said the province scored 
substantial progress in economic restructuring and opening up in 
1993; the national economy rapidly developed; the pace of 
exploiting resources was stepped up; production, construction 
and circulation developed in a comprehensive way; new 
accomplishments were scored in all social undertakings including 
science, technology, education, culture, public health, and 
enterprises. On the basis of production development, the living 
standards of the urban and rural populace continued to improve 
somewhat; the GNP was 10.1 billion yuan, up by 9.5 percent from 
the previous year, exceeding the 8 percent growth rate in the 
national plan. The accomplishments evidenced the fact that all 
measures adopted by the provincial party committee and 
government centering around building the socialist market 
economic structure, accelerating the exploitation of resources, 
and pushing the province's economic development were very 
effective. 
  Entrusted by the provincial government, Xia Luodi, 
provincial 
finance department director, made a report on conditions of 
implementing the 1993 provincial financial budget and initial 
arrangements for 1994 financial revenues and expenditures. In 
the report, he said that in financial work in 1993, the 
provincial government earnestly implemented various central 
measures for macroeconomic regulation and control, organized 
revenue and controlled expenditure with great efforts. Year-end 
results in executing the plan were better than expected. The 
annual budgetary expenditure was 2.377 billion yuan, and 
financial revenue fulfilled was 1.135 billion yuan, being 130.5 
percent, or 319 million yuan more than, the annual revenue 
target of the yearly financial plan. Those items with increases 
in financial revenues were mainly industrial and commercial 
taxes, which enjoyed a 356 million yuan increase, in addition to 
agricultural and animal husbandry taxes as well as other income 
from special items. 
  In their reports, Su Kun and Xia Luodi separately explained 
the draft 1994 plan and initial arrangements for financial 
revenues and expenditures for the session's deliberation and for 
provincial CPPCC members attending the session as non-voting 
delegates to give their opinions.

  [Text] A recorded report on the ceremonious convocation of 
the second session of the Eighth Qinghai Provincial People' 
Congress in Xining by this service's reporters Chang Ying, and 
Zhang Erlong is as follows: 
  Yesterday morning, some 300 people's delegates representing 
the benefits of Qinghai's 4.5 million people of various 
nationalities entered the Provincial People's Auditorium with a 
strong sense of responsibility and mission to participate in the 
second session of Qinghai Provincial Eighth People's Congress 
and exercise their sacred duty of being masters of the country, 
participating in government and discussing state affairs. 
  The Provincial People's Auditorium took on a solemn but warm 
atmosphere. Up on the rostrum was hung a horizontal scroll of 
calligraphy in Han, Tibetan, and Mongolian languages, which 
read: Second Session of Eighth Provincial People's Congress. 
Under it at the center was a national emblem, which looked all 
the more sacred and splendid in the background of 10 red flags. 
  At 0900, Huanjue Cenam, executive chairman of the presidium 
announced the opening of the session. The solemn national 
anthem was played in the auditorium. Executive chairmen of the 
session including Yang Maojie, Sun Daoran, Ma Wending, Geshang 
Duojie, Ma Shiqing, Cai Dan, and Wang Yinke sat at the front row 
of the rostrum. Attending the session and also sitting on the 
rostrum were leading comrades of the Qinghai Provincial Party 
Committee, Provincial Government, Provincial CPPCC, and army 
units stationed in Qinghai; responsible persons of the 
provincial higher people's court, and provincial people's 
procuratorate; delegates to the National People's Congress in 
Qinghai; all members participating in the second session of the 
Seventh Provincial CPPCC; and responsible persons of all 
departments directly under the provincial party committee and 
government. Central units stationed in Qinghai, institutions at 
the provincial level, and mass organizations attended the 
session as nonvoting delegates. 
  Huanjue Cenam: Now, Governor Tian Chengping will deliver a 
report on the government work. 
  Tian Chengping: Delegates! On behalf of the provincial 
people's government, here I deliver the government work report 
to the congress; please deliberate it. At the same time, all 
provincial CPPCC members are invited to air their opinions. 
  In 1993, under the guidance of the 14th party congress 
spirit, people of all nationalities in the province earnestly 
implemented the spirit of Eighth Qinghai Provincial Party 
Congress and the first session of the Eighth Provincial People's 
Congress, emancipated minds, braced up, seized the opportunity, 
and blazed new trail to make progress. Consequently, new 
accomplishments were scored in the national economy and social 
undertakings in national construction, with new progress made in 
reform and opening up; macroeconomic regulation and control were 
augmented; the pace of exploitation of resources was 
accelerated; and production, construction, and circulation 
developed in a comprehensive way. The entire economy began to 
be included on the track of sustained, rapid, healthy 
development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 
6643 0256 1660 4099 1455]. Initial statistics show that the 
provincial GNP was 10.1 billion yuan, up by 9.5 percent from the 
previous year; gross industrial and agricultural output value 
was 10.2 billion yuan, up by 10.2 percent, with the goal set out 
by the first session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress 
realized. 
  Reporter: In his government work report, Governor Tian 
Zengping indicated that in 1993, the capital role of agriculture 
and animal husbandry in the province was continuously augmented. 
The province's output in grain and edible oil topped records. 
In the wake of overcoming serious flood, recovery in production 
of animal husbandry was far better than expected. The per 
capital net income of the rural populace was 672 yuan, up by 
11.5 percent from the previous year. With the joint efforts of 
cadres, workers and staffers, the province's industry was 
included on the track of high- rate growth in 1993. Industrial 
economic return was turning for the better. The index of 
comprehensive economic return calculated by the same criteria 
went up by 5 percentage points. The pace of reform was further 
stepped up, with new breakthroughs in opening up. All social 
undertakings made long-stride development. At the same time, 
the whole province from top down earnestly implemented the 
principle of doing two types of work simultaneously, attaching 
equal importance to both; strengthened the anti-corruption 
struggle and the creation of clean government; corrected 
unhealthy tendencies of trades; cracked down on all kinds of 
criminal offenses; augmented socialist spiritual construction; 
and further consolidated and developed the situation of 
stability and unity. 
  Dealing with the main tasks for 1994, Governor Tian 
Chengping 
said that governments at all levels must have command of a 
guiding concept, namely, adhering to promoting development with 
reform, continuously readjusting and optimizing structures, 
exerting efforts to realize and maintain a considerably high 
level of input, and persisting in the common development of 
diversified economic factors. Under this prerequisite, we 
should grasp the following work in a down-to-earth way: 
  First, with building the socialist market economic structure 
as the goal, we must meticulously organize implementation of 
reform tasks. 
  Second, we must do substantial work in real earnest to 
promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development [chi 
xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 
1455]. 
  Third, we must earnestly implement the principle of 
reinvigorating enterprises and institutions with science and 
education to steadily develop social undertakings. 
  Fourth, we must adhere to the principle of doing two types 
of 
work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both; 
prolonging and developing the political situation of social 
stability and nationality solidarity. 
  And fifth, we must strengthen building of clean government 
and make efforts to improve work style of government 
organizations. 
  In conclusion, Governor Tian Zhenping said: Delegates, the 
tasks of government work in 1994 are very heavy; however, we are 
full of confidence. Under the leadership of the Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the provincial party 
committee, we shall unite people of all nationalities across the 
province to work hard in concerted efforts to do a good job of 
continuously pushing forward the province's reform, opening up, 
and economic construction to score still greater victory.

  [Report: "Qinghai Provincial CPC Committee Standing 
Committee Holds Meeting, Calling for Stronger Leadership and 
Relying on the Masses To Maintain Political Stability"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 16 February, the Provincial Party 
Committee Standing Committee called a meeting to study the 
important instructions issued by the Central Commission of 
Politics and Law on paying attention to the work of maintaining 
political stability and to exchange views on the implementation 
of these instructions. Members of the Provincial Party Committee 
Standing Committee--Yin Kesheng, Cai Zhulin, Sang Jiejia, Tang 
Zhengren, Doba, Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng--attended the 
meeting. Leading cadres from the provincial people's congress, 
the provincial government, the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference provincial committee, the provincial 
military district, the provincial court, and the provincial 
procuratorate attended the meeting as nonvoting delegates. 
  At the meeting, everyone studied the important instructions 
issued by the Central Commission of Politics and Law on paying 
attention to the work of maintaining political stability and 
conscientiously exchanged views with one another. Comrade Yin 
Kesheng made an important speech. 
  According to the meeting, the current situation of our 
province is good, and we have achieved economic development, 
political stability, unity among nationalities, and social 
progress. Behind the positive situation, however, there are 
still some unstable elements. In particular, although a faction 
of evildoers who stirred up trouble were punished in accordance 
with the law last October, small numbers of evildoers are still 
carrying out acts of sabotage. They are fabricating rumors to 
confuse and poison people's minds and are using all sorts of 
dirty tricks in a vain attempt to sabotage the stable and united 
political situation, in which people of various nationalities 
throughout the province are engaged in a united struggle which 
is not easily won. Regarding these situations, leaders at all 
levels, the vast numbers of party members and cadres, and the 
broad masses must maintain sharp vigilance and have a clear 
understanding. We must firmly and decisively deal with all acts 
which disrupt stability. 
  The meeting stressed that we must uphold the working 
principle of following the mass line and must proceed in all 
cases from the interests of the people. We must have faith in 
the masses, must rely on them, and must arouse their enthusiasm, 
which is the basic guarantee for the success of our undertaking. 
We must educate the broad masses, enhance the awareness of 
maintaining political stability, and educate the public to make 
contributions to maintaining stability. Regarding the masses 
who were hoodwinked last year when a handful of evildoers 
stirred up trouble, we must unswervingly implement the policy of 
not laying blame on them, not discriminating against them, and 
not investigating or affixing responsibility for the trouble on 
them so as to unite the overwhelming majority of the masses. 
People of various nationalities must unite and cooperate with 
one another, live in harmony, and make joint efforts to maintain 
and develop the stable and united political situation, thus 
achieving joint development and progress for various 
nationalities. 
  As stressed by the meeting, the key to maintaining political 
stability lies in leadership. Leaders at all levels must 
further enhance their understanding of the important meaning of 
maintaining political stability, must try to reach a common 
understanding and pace, must firmly implement all kinds of work 
in a down-to-earth manner, and must make unremitting efforts to 
work for the perpetual stability of Xining and of the entire 
province and for the joint prosperity and progress of various 
nationalities.

  [Text] Xining, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Qinghai, a 
multinational province in northwest China, has worked out a 
series of preferential policies to promote education among the 
people of minority nationalities. 
  With 42 percent of its population being of the Tibetan, Hui, 
Tu, Salar and Mongolian nationalities, Qinghai has made much 
headway in education. 
  The province now has 1,598 schools for people of minority 
nationalities with a total enrollment of 250,000. 
  The enrollment of school-age children in the province has 
reached 85 percent, meeting the target set by the state Eighth 
Five-Year Plan (1991-95). 
  However, the pace of educational development still cannot 
meet the needs of local economic and social development, 
especially compared with the country's developed areas. 
  The provincial government has worked out an educational 
development program to boost education of people of minority 
nationalities. 
  The program includes concrete measures and policies mainly 
for solving existing problems such as low popularization rate of 
primary education, slow progress of technical training, 
illiteracy among peasants and nomadic herdsmen, poor school 
facilities and the lack of teachers. 
  Governments at several levels will make joint efforts to 
place priority on building six key senior middle schools, 30 key 
junior middle schools and 191 key primary schools in the 
province's six minority nationality autonomous prefectures. 
  Preferential treatment in funds, facilities and training 
teachers will be granted to the six prefectures. 
  Universities and teacher's schools in the province are urged 
to help the six minority nationality autonomous prefectures 
train more teachers. 
  Local governments should work out preferential policies to 
raise teachers' salaries and improve their living and working 
condition. 
  Those teachers working in remote areas for over 15 years 
will 
have more favorable treatment in work, and their children will 
be able to take part in university enrollment examinations. 
  The provincial government has decided to allocate 6 million 
yuan for ethnic education each year and provide free textbooks 
in minority nationality languages. 
  A fund for development of ethnic education in Qinghai will 
be 
established to attract both domestic and overseas funds. 
  Special concern will be given to education of girls of 
minority nationalities, especially students in girls' schools 
for Hui and Salar nationalities, most of whom are Muslims. 
  School fees can be waived for girl students whose families 
have financial difficulties. Morning and evening classes will 
be given to the girls. 
  Preferential policies will be given to minority nationality 
students to enter institutions of higher learning, in particular 
to enter teacher's universities. 
  Legal and other documents will be published to ensure smooth 
progress of minority nationality education.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said today that the actions of the United 
States to link China's most favored nation (MFN) status with the 
human rights issue have done nothing but present obstacles to 
the promotion of human rights. 
  The spokesman, Shen Guofang, made the remarks at a weekly 
press conference held here this afternoon when commenting on a 
report that the United States recently asserted that if China 
would make major progress in its human rights, it would consider 
adopting the approach of reviewing China's MFN status once in 
several years. 
  Shen said that the Chinese Government has repeatedly stated 
most clearly that the mutual offer of MFN status between China 
and the United States is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial 
trade arrangement, and that the MFN ought not to be linked with 
issues irrelevant to it. 
  Recently, Shen said, President Clinton and the U.S. 
Government both indicated the intention to put behind the annual 
debate on China's MFN status, in order to settle this issue 
permanently and have the Sino-U.S. relations built on a more 
solid foundation. 
  "We believe this is a positive and sensible notion," said 
Shen, "But it is yet to be translated into action on the part of 
the U.S. side." 
  The spokesman said that the U.S. practice of linking the MFN 
status with the human rights issue also constitutes a violation 
of the principle of respect for state sovereignty enshrined in 
the U.N. Charter. 
  "This linking sounds as if it is for promoting human rights, 
but as a matter of fact, it is an act of violating human rights 
and infringing upon the rights to development elaborated in the 
declaration on the right to development and the Vienna 
Declaration and program of action adopted by the World 
Conference on Human Rights last year," said Shen. 
  "These actions of the U.S. have done nothing but present 
obstacles to the promotion of human rights," the spokesman 
stressed.

  [Text] Shenzhen, 3 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Despite the 
difficulties caused by the obstacles resulting from the British 
side's uncooperative attitude and confrontation in the course of 
China resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, we have a powerful 
motherland backing us and enjoy the concerted efforts of the 
Hong Kong compatriots. There are no difficulties or dangers 
which cannot be overcome, and there are no obstacles which 
cannot be removed. Lu Ping, director of the State Council's 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, made these remarks today at 
a ceremony to present certificates for the continuation of 
service of the first group of Hong Kong affairs advisers. 
  Lu Ping thanked the Hong Kong affairs advisers for raising a 
large number of valuable opinions and suggestions through 
various forms and channels on a number of issues relating to 
Hong Kong's power transfer and steady transition since their 
appointment. Lu Ping said: On one hand, the appointment of the 
Hong Kong affairs advisers manifests their sense of 
responsibility for materializing "one country, two systems" and 
Hong Kong's steady transition in 1997 as well as for preserving 
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity; on the other, it also 
gives expression to the Chinese Government's determination to 
ensure the implementation of the policy of "Hong Kong people 
administering Hong Kong" and to practice a high degree of 
autonomy in Hong Kong. 
  Lu Ping continued: Several days ago, the British Hong Kong 
Legislative Council ratified parts of the draft legislation 
formulated according to Chris Patten's "constitutional reform 
package," and the British Government published a White Paper on 
the substance of the Sino-British talks on the constitutional 
structure. These unilateral moves -- which undermine cooperation 
-- suggest that the British side will willfully continue to 
pursue a policy of confrontation during the transitional period 
of a little more than three years. This behavior will only 
drive all kindhearted people to heighten their vigilance and 
abandon any illusions about the British side's empty promise of 
so-called "cooperation." 
  Lu Ping also cited Deng Xiaoping's remarks from 10 years 
ago: 
"We should believe that the Hong Kong Chinese can properly 
administer Hong Kong. The disbelief that Chinese people can 
properly administer Hong Kong was inherited from the old 
colonialist school of thought." "The prosperity of Hong Kong 
was created by the Hong Kong people, who are primarily Chinese." 
"The Hong Kong people are able to administer Hong Kong 
properly, and we must have this confidence." 
  In conclusion, Lu Ping said: In the near future, we will 
invite a third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers, who will 
come from all social levels and fields in Hong Kong. The ranks 
of the Hong Kong affairs advisers are growing, and they will 
play a more important role in bringing about the recovery of 
Hong Kong's sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Article by Tung Fang-jan (2639 2455 0373): "Deng </F>
Xiaoping's Recent Speeches in Shanghai"] 
  [Text] Last December, Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect 
of China's reform and opening up, came to Shanghai to recuperate 
in the company of his family. During his stay in Shanghai, he 
separately met with Shanghai party and government leaders Wu 
Bangguo, Huang Ju, Chen Zhili, Chen Liangyu, Chen Tiedi, Xu 
Kuangdi, Pudeng New District Administrative Committee Director 
Zhao Qizheng, and former Shanghai leaders Chen Guodong, Hu 
Lijiao, Wang Daohan, and Yang Di on 26 and 27 December. At the 
meetings, Deng also talked about Shanghai's reform and Pudong's 
development. 
  Deng Xiaoping said: When I was in Beijing, I often 
thought about Shanghai and Pudong. It was impossible to forget 
them. The development of Pudong is too late, but a good 
opportunity remains now, so we must keep a high speed and must 
not slow down. Some people are worried that such a practice may 
cause trouble. What trouble could there be? I do not believe 
this. Those who have such concerns also cannot say what trouble 
there will be. Our minds should be further emancipated. We 
must have courage and must not slow down the speed. Quicker 
economic development may bring about a better situation in 
reform and opening up. You should not fear. Otherwise, you will 
not be able to accomplish anything. I will give protection to 
you all. (Those present all laughed). 
  The development of Pudong in Shanghai was announced in the 
12th year of China's reform and opening. During the 12 
years, China's economic reform took two separate, major steps in 
regional opening and industrial opening. In the first step, 
China successively set up five special economic zones in 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan, as well as 14 
economic and technical development zones in coastal areas 
between 1979 and 1988. In the second step, in 1990, China 
decided to open and develop Shanghai's Pudong New District. The 
two strategic steps were both personally decided by Deng 
Xiaoping. Deng's decisions were made on the basis of his 
assessment of the world situation and China's current realities. 
China has a large population, but China's economic foundation is 
weak. It is impossible to start large-scale construction in all 
parts of the country in one single move. Breakthroughs should 
first be made in some key points in the process of economic 
development. The first-step and second-step decisions were made 
by Deng on the basis of such realities. Deng held that 
Pudong's development had a bearing on Shanghai's development, 
and if Shanghai develops, "the situation of reform and opening 
in the Chang Jiang Delta area, in the whole valley of the Chang 
Jiang, and even the whole country will be different." 
Therefore, he required that "Pudong's development be tightly 
grasped without vacillation through to its completion." 
  On 3 January, in the company of State Council Vice Premier 
Li 
Lanqing, Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee Secretary Wu Bangguo, 
and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, Deng Xiaoping mounted the Yangpu 
Bridge and tried to walk 100 meters on the bridge. The 
officials and the assistants around tried hard to dissuade Deng 
from doing this. So he stood in the middle of the bridge to 
look at both sides of the Huangpu Jiang. He stretched his hand 
to point and said that he was glad to see that the buildings 
were getting taller and taller. 
  That evening, Deng met with principal leaders of the 
Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee and Zhao Qizheng, Xia Keqiang, and Hu 
Wei, responsible officials of the Pudong New District 
Administrative Committee, and he delivered a speech to them. 
  Deng Xiaoping said: Things that can be accomplished 
within this century should not be postponed to the next century. 
Developing the economy at high speed is a major principle and 
policy. Pudong is the locomotive of such development. Its 
development has been delayed, and I was anxious about this. 
Major construction projects in the fields of energy and 
transportation should be started as soon as possible, with the 
necessary funds being concentrated so that they will yield 
returns at an earlier date. He added: An international 
financial center is certainly a place where all currencies can 
be freely converted. For Shanghai, this is of great importance. 
If China tries to acquire a certain international status in the 
financial aspect, it should first rely on Shanghai. I have 
reiterated this point many times. I have said this in Shanghai 
and have also mentioned this in Beijing. Some people say that I 
have partiality for Shanghai, but I said that no place could 
replace Shanghai's status. Pudong is the locomotive of 
development, and this has been written into the report to the 
14th CPC Congress. (CHING PAO editor's note: On 12 October 
1992, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin 
particularly mentioned in his report to the 14th CPC Congress 
that "the opening and development of Shanghai's Pudong will 
function as a locomotive to promote the further opening of the 
cities along the Chang Jiang, and Shanghai should be built into 
an international economic, financial, and trade center as soon 
as possible, thus bring along a new leap forward for the 
regional economy of the Chang Jiang Delta area and the whole 
valley of the Chang Jiang.") Therefore, You must do a good job! 
Your successes in development will enable me to speak aloud. 
(All of those present laughed.) 
  Deng Xiaoping then added: I have seen the model of the 
Lujiazui Financial and Trade Development Zone you sent to me 
(author's note: this was the latest of three models.) It is 
very nice. Such projects should be started. There are more 
than 100 buildings with a total of more than 4 million square 
meters of floor space. They are indeed impressive! There 
is no limitation in the emancipation of people's minds. Nothing 
will be accomplished if people fear this or that. In the final 
analysis, Shanghai's development was the result of daring 
practice. You should advance the process of reform and opening 
by grasping the opportunity and should not waste your time by 
getting involved in unnecessary courtesy activities and, thus, 
should not let the opportunity slip. This time, I came a 
bit earlier than before, because I want to have more time to 
listen to your reports and to see what you have done. Shanghai 
is able to make great accomplishments, but I must again 
emphasize that the faster economic development, the more 
attention we should pay to the building of material and 
spiritual civilization. This is also a constant principle, 
which must be understood by our cadres at all levels. 
Rapid economic development will also require us to 
further improve our work style. We should say less and do more 
and should stress practice. Whatever they are doing, our cadres 
should give consideration first to whether the people are glad 
and satisfied or not and whether the people support the policies 
or not. This is the key to the success of our reform and 
opening. 
  Deng Xiaoping also said: The development of the present 
international situation is favorable to us, and we are facing an 
opportunity that has rarely been seen. Recently, there 
have been some little troubles in Hong Kong. Chris Patten is 
playing little tricks there. We should ignore him and do what 
we need to do on our own. Hong Kong's prosperity and stability 
are still dependent on our economic development. In my view, 
they do not understand the Chinese people and the Chinese 
Government. There is no Li Hongzhang [Qing Dynasty official 
blamed for ceding Hong Kong Island to Britain] any more. The 
people will not agree if we do not recover Hong Kong. 
Therefore, Patten and the British Government will get nowhere 
on the Hong Kong issue. 
  Reportedly, after leaving Shanghai, Deng Xiaoping may travel 
southward to inspect Guangdong and Hainan. 
  On 13 January, JIEFANG RIBAO, the organ of the Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee, published a commentator's article at 
the top of the front page, entitled "Further Emancipating 
People's Minds," which revealed Deng's talk about emancipating 
people's minds. Next day, XINHUA dispatched the excerpts of the 
article. On 14 January, RENMIN RIBAO published a lengthy 
article entitled "Deng Xiaoping's Ideas About Opening and 
Development and the Development of Shanghai's Pudong" by Huang 
Qifan, deputy director of the Pudong New District Administrative 
Committee. All this formed another "opinion storm" in Shanghai 
after the series of commentaries written in the name of Huangfu 
Ping in 1991. 
  Zhou Ruijin, the former party committee secretary of JIEFANG 
RIBAO, who organized the writing of the Huangfu Ping articles, 
has been in the post of deputy editor-in-chief of RENMIN RIBAO 
for several years. This time, RENMIN RIBAO in the north and 
JIEFANG RIBAO in the south echoed each other, and brought about 
a lively and dynamic situation in public opinion. It is 
believed that the CPC newspapers will publish more articles with 
original ideas in 1994 to meet the needs of economic development.

<F P=106> ["Tea House" column by Ou Zaonan (2962 5679 2809): "Start </F>
the Discussion From Comrade Xiaoping's Way To Stay in Good 
Health"] 
  [Text] Everyone is delighted to see Comrade Deng Xiaoping, 
who is in his nineties, still able to walk in a firm and steady 
pace, and remaining sprightly and in good shape. People were 
especially excited when they saw Deng Xiaoping, at the age of 
88, making an inspection tour of Shenzhen and Zhuhai, pushing 
for a new upsurge of reform and opening up throughout the 
country. 
  While wholeheartedly wishing Comrade Xiaoping good health 
and 
longevity, people also are interested in how this great and 
tested revolutionary has managed to remain in good health. A 
newspaper report revealed that Comrade Xiaoping's principle for 
healthy living is to lead a simple and spare life, and to do 
moderate exercise. 
  According to the newspaper report: Comrade Xiaoping's daily 
diet is extremely simple. Breakfast: a small bowl of glutinous 
rice wine mixed with an egg, two steamed buns, a bowl of 
porridge, and a bit of soybean paste. Lunch: a glass of white 
or rice wine, three vegetarian dishes, a dish of soybean paste 
or chili paste, and two small bowls of rice. Supper: a glass 
of white or rice wine, three vegetarian dishes, and two small 
bowls of rice. He has some meat dishes only on Sunday. 
  Comrade Xiaoping likes to drink wine, especially glutinous 
rice wine. He said: "I like to drink some rice wine. The 
brewing of rice wine is simple and easy, and I always do it 
myself. To brew glutinous rice wine, you first cook some 
glutinous rice, put it in a jar, and add some sugar and some 
yeast. Then you seal the jar, and the wine will be ready to 
serve in a few days." 
  This is a very traditional formula in China for the brewing 
of glutinous rice wine. Comrade Xiaoping has adhered to the 
principle of a simple diet and has persisted in doing moderate 
exercise. A few years earlier, despite his advanced age of over 
80, he used to go to Beidaihe to swim. Therefore he has managed 
to keep his weight constant. 
  Constant weight is an extremely good indication of health 
for 
people of advanced age. A REUTER reporter once filed an 
interesting piece of information: On 19 December 1986, the 
reporter had an exclusive interview with Tian Atong, one of the 
four master tailors of the Hongdu tailor shop in Beijing, which 
is the Chinese leaders' specially designated garment supplier. 
Mr. Tian told the reporter: "I first made clothes for Deng 
Xiaoping in 1956. His figure has remained constant since then, 
so the cutting has not needed to be changed." This implied that 
Comrade Xiaoping had neither gained nor lost weight for the 
whole 30 years from 1956 to 1986. No change in the cutting of 
garment is an important indication of good health. 
  In addition, Comrade Xiaoping, as a great proletarian 
revolutionary and the chief architect of China's reform and 
opening- up program, always has remained strong-willed, 
broad-minded, and optimistic, whether under favorable or 
unfavorable circumstances. This is not only a very lofty 
character, but also seems to be a part of his secret for healthy 
living and longevity.

<F P=106> [Communique of the Third Plenary Session of the Central </F>
Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of 
China, dated 1 March 1994] 
  [Text] The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of 
the Communist Party of China held its third plenary session in 
Beijing from 25 February to 1 March 1994. The session was held 
in a new situation in which the whole party is thoroughly 
studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping," implementing in an all-around way the guidelines 
of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure, and 
working for a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line, the session worked in accordance with 
the major principle of the party's work -- seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability -- and the central 
authorities' demand for waging a deepgoing, protracted and more 
effective anticorruption struggle. It reviewed and summed up 
how the whole party has implemented the central authorities' 
decision on performing several tasks well in the near future 
with respect to the anticorruption struggle since the second 
plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection. It also discussed and arranged the tasks of the 
anticorruption struggle for 1994. 
  Attending the session were 103 members of the CPC Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection, and present as non-voting 
delegates were persons in charge of discipline inspection and 
supervision organs of all provinces, autonomous regions, 
municipalities, central departments, State Council departments, 
and the People's Liberation Army. The plenary session was 
chaired by the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for 
Discipline Inspection. It examined and approved the report of 
"combating corruption in a deepgoing and protracted way and 
serving reform, development, and stability," delivered by Wei 
Jianxing, secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection, on behalf of the Commission's Standing Committee. 
  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, 
delivered an important speech at the plenary session. Present 
on the occasion were party and state leaders, including Li Peng, 
Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, and Hu Jintao. Also present were 
responsible comrades of central and state organs and relevant 
departments. 
  The meeting, after earnestly studying and discussing Comrade 
Jiang Zemin's important speech, reached a consensus: Comrade 
Jiang Zemin's speech is very profound, there is no mistaking 
what it is aimed at, and it is good guidance. All comrades of 
the party should seriously study and implement the guideline of 
"affirming achievements, seeing problems, summing up experience, 
keeping a clear head, and continuing the efforts to do an even 
better job in fighting corruption" emphasized in his speech; and 
carry out the several requirements, put forward in the speech, 
for doing good anticorruption work in the next stage. At the 
same time, the party organizations at all levels should 
earnestly adhere to Comrade Jiang Zemin's demand for further 
strengthening the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the 
people, and step up the education in upholding the mass 
viewpoint and the mass line among the party members and cadres, 
particularly leading cadres. The party organizations should 
call on the party members and cadres to constantly measure their 
own words and deeds with the party's purpose of serving the 
people wholeheartedly, and take a further step to create a 
situation in which the party and the masses are of one mind, a 
unity exists between the cadres and the masses, and concerted 
efforts are made to safeguard and deepen reform, open up wider, 
promote development, and maintain stability. 

    The plenary session reviewed and summed up how the whole 
party had carried through the party Central Committee's decision 
on fighting corruption since the second plenary session of the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission. The session pointed 
out: Since August 1993, party committees and governments at all 
levels have resolutely and swiftly implemented the party Central 
Committee and State Council's "Decision on Concentrating on 
Anticorruption Work in Some Areas in the Near Future" and have 
done a great deal of work in this regard. The vast numbers of 
cadres and masses have sincerely supported the work and have 
actively participated in it. Discipline inspection and 
supervision cadres at all levels have worked diligently and done 
their job conscientiously. Following their arduous efforts over 
three years, considerable results have been achieved in fighting 
corruption and results to varying degrees also have been 
achieved in carrying out the work in three areas decided by the 
central authorities. Some localities and departments have done 
a great job and have achieved fairly demonstrable results in 
some respects. Some negative and corrupt practices also have 
somehow dwindled. Generally speaking, the trend of the 
anticorruption struggle has been good and work in this regard 
has been carried out in a healthy manner, basically fulfilling 
the central authorities' expected objectives and creating a 
positive effect on preserving political stability, promoting 
reform and opening up, accelerating economic development, and 
ensuring the exercising of macroeconomic regulation and control 
of the economy. The plenary session holds that the 
anticorruption work has not developed in a balanced manner and 
some results have not been secured. We should realistically 
affirm the anticorruption results achieved during the preceding 
stage; at the same time, we should realize that negative and 
corrupt practices are still serious. Therefore, we should 
continue to work diligently and must not relax for a moment. 
  The plenary session maintains that the anticorruption 
decision made last year by the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council is completely correct; and the guiding ideology, 
principle, and policy set forth in the decision have ensured the 
healthy and orderly development of the anticorruption struggle. 
Following the practice during the precedent stage, party 
committees and governments at all levels have deepened their 
understanding of the party Central Committee's idea and measures 
on fighting corruption. They have summed up some effective ways 
to carry out the work: 1) Anticorruption work must be viewed 
from the overall situation of reform, development, and 
maintaining stability; we must focus on those outstanding 
problems that hamper reform, development, and stability; we 
should define the anticorruption tasks and objectives step by 
step; we should closely integrate the anticorruption work with 
the implementation of the party Central Committee and State 
Council's major decisions and measures on reform and 
construction. 2) Anticorruption work is a long-term task; 
therefore, we should have an overall strategic plan and yet have 
a real sense of urgency. The work should be carried out step by 
step and efforts should be made to ensure results in each stage. 
We should begin with taking stopgap measures and gradually 
solve deep-rooted problems. 3) Anticorruption work should be 
viewed from the general situation and we must adhere to the work 
in three areas decided by the central authorities. While 
resolutely punishing corrupt elements, we should resolutely wipe 
out all kinds of negative and corrupt practices, including 
correcting unhealthy practices prevailing in various trades and 
professions. The key to doing this work well is that leading 
cadres should practice self-discipline and be honest in 
performing their duties. 4) Not only should well-defined and 
specific anticorruption tasks and objectives for each stage be 
laid down, but we also must strengthen top-to-bottom and 
bottom-to-top supervision, inspection, and guidance. 5) The 
whole party must be mobilized to fight corruption; the party and 
government must join forces in fighting corruption; major party 
and government leaders should personally take charge of the 
work. All trades, professions, and sectors should act as a 
whole according to the unified planning of the party Central 
Committee and State Council and engage themselves in total 
warfare. 6) Anticorruption work needs the media's effective 
support so that a generally favorable atmosphere can be formed. 
The aforementioned effective ways should be adhered to and 
gradually be supplemented and developed. 
  The plenary session pointed out: The general guideline for 
this year's anticorruption work is, under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, to persist 
in thoroughly carrying out the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee; to attend to the overall situation of the 
party's work closely revolving around the central task of 
economic construction; to continue to carry through the central 
authorities' anticorruption decision; and, proceeding from 
securing the anticorruption results we have achieved, to carry 
through the anticorruption struggle in an in-depth and more 
effective manner over a long period. According to the central 
authorities' instructions, the anticorruption work in three 
areas will remain unchanged this year, but new substances should 
be added based on the characteristics of the situation. 

    First, the five requirements put forward by the central 
authorities for leading party and government cadres at and above 
the county (department) level to maintain integrity and honesty 
should be continuously and firmly implemented. On that basis, 
the following measures are formulated and reiterated: 1) It is 
not allowed to purchase imported luxury cars or replace existing 
ones in violation of regulations. It is not allowed to use 
one's authority to order enterprises or subordinate units to 
replace one's cars, to borrow cars from them, or to apportion 
expenses among them for purchasing cars. It is not allowed to 
use loans, raise funds, or special allocated funds to purchase 
cars for use by leading cadres. Leading party and government 
organs and units at the county (city) level that are behind in 
paying their staff members and workers are not allowed to 
purchase cars. 2) It is not allowed to purchase homes by 
depressing their prices in violation of the State Council 
regulations on housing reform. It is not allowed to use one's 
authority to offer preferential terms for the purchase of homes 
for oneself, or one's children or relatives. It is not allowed 
to use public funds to renovate one's home above the established 
standards. 3) Leading cadres shall travel light when conducting 
official activities in the country, and their meals and 
accommodations shall not exceed the local reception standards. 
It is not allowed to organize special dance parties for leading 
cadres. 4) It is not allowed to hold extravagant, wasteful 
ceremonies on such special occasions as weddings, deaths, job 
transfers, birthdays, and moves to a new home; still less is it 
allowed to use public funds and property to hold extravagant 
ceremonies or to use these special occasions to accumulate 
wealth. 5) It is not allowed to use one's authority to delay 
paying back public funds. It is not allowed to borrow public 
funds to purchase or build homes for oneself or for one's 
relatives or friends, or to engage in profiteering. 
  Leading cadres of enterprises and institutions must also 
maintain integrity and honesty and observe law and discipline; 
they must oppose all kinds of negative, corrupt practices, such 
as abuse of power for personal gains, embezzlement, bribery, and 
waste. 
  Second, we must continue to do a good job of investigating 
and handling major and serious cases. We must focus on 
investigating and handling cases of violation of discipline and 
law by leading party and government organs and cadres and by 
judicial, administrative law enforcement, and economic 
administrative departments and their working personnel, 
particularly on leading cadres involved in embezzlement, 
bribery, and abuse of power for personal gain; on law and 
discipline enforcement personnel involved in fraudulent 
practices, embezzlement, and other law-breaking and 
discipline-violating practices in the course of enforcing the 
law and discipline; and on legal persons involved in violation 
of law and discipline. Party committees and governments at all 
levels must strengthen their leadership over case investigations 
and firmly remove all kinds of resistance and interference. A 
superior organ shall send people to assist or supervise its 
subordinate units in investigating major, difficult cases. 
Further steps should be taken to strengthen cooperation and 
coordination among discipline inspection and supervision organs, 
judicial organs, organization and personnel departments, 
propaganda departments, and administrative law-enforcement and 
supervision departments to form a total operation force so as to 
improve our ability to crack major and serious cases. 
  Third, we must further strengthen our work to rectify 
unhealthy practices in various trades and professions, restore 
discipline, carry out special projects to rectify practices, and 
earnestly resolve one or two prominent problems. We must 
continue to resolutely stop the unhealthy practices of state 
organs and their subordinate departments in wantonly collecting 
fees. We must implement the central regulations on "separating 
revenues and expenditures" in the collection and disposal of 
administrative fees and fines and make it a main emphasis of 
this year's work to resolutely stop wanton collection of fees; 
we must produce notable results in this work. We must earnestly 
resolve the problem of party and government organs as well as 
their working personnel using their authority to seize 
enterprises' property for their own use under various pretexts 
without compensation; and we must earnestly resolve the problem 
of party and government organs transferring enterprises' funds 
to set up small reserve funds for their own use or to use them 
to wantonly give out cash awards. In addition, we must 
resolutely stop the unhealthy practice of demanding that 
enterprises sponsor various activities under various names. We 
must continue our work to reduce the peasants' burden. We must 
adopt effective measures to resolutely implement the regulations 
requiring party and government organs to separate themselves 
from business entities set up by them. We must continue to 
rectify the unhealthy practice of using public funds for tourism 
outside the country (border) and strictly screen official trips 
out of the country (border) to firmly reduce those excessive 
trips. Corresponding policies and control measures shall be 
formulated to resolve this question from the sources. 
  The plenary session demanded that while concentrating on 
carrying out the three anticorruption tasks, discipline 
inspection and supervision organs, in the process of 
implementing the party Central Committee and the State Council's 
major policy decision and measures on deepening reform, 
developing the economy, and safeguarding stability, should also 
strengthen law enforcement and supervision, earnestly supervise 
the implementation of democratic centralism, safeguard the 
inviolability of political discipline, and ensure that all 
policies and decrees are implemented to the letter. 
  The plenary session analyzed the situation in the struggle 
against corruption. It pointed out: This is an important year 
in our efforts to comprehensively implement the guidelines of 
the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee to promote sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development of China's economy, a year crucial to 
bringing about change in our economic structure. We must 
approach and grasp the task of combating corruption, improving 
party style, and building a clean government from the 
consideration of the overall interests of our entire party work, 
and we must carry out this task in the interests of our entire 
party work. Rapid economic development and in-depth reform will 
inevitably cause readjustments involving the interests of 
different quarters and a change of thinking and viewpoints. The 
struggle against corruption, to improve party style, and to 
build a clean government will also encounter new developments 
and problems. We still face a grim situation and shoulder an 
extremely arduous task in the struggle against corruption. 
Party committees and governments as well as discipline 
inspection and supervisory organs at all levels must even more 
steadfastly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic policy 
of "fostering both material and cultural and ideological 
progress, attaching equal importance to both" by waging the 
anticorruption struggle in a deep-going, sustained, and more 
productive way and by strengthening the building of party style 
and clean government. To ensure a more productive 
anticorruption struggle, party committees and governments at all 
levels, particularly their principal leading comrades, must 
continue to place this major task, which is vital to the party 
and country's future, as an important item on their agenda and 
earnestly strengthen their leadership over it. We must render 
vigorous support to discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs' work. We must strengthen supervision and inspection 
according to the principle of accountability at each level to 
ensure the accomplishment of the three anticorruption tasks. 
  The plenary session demanded: It is necessary for discipline 
inspection and supervisory organs to further strengthen 
themselves. It is necessary for discipline inspection and 
supervisory cadres to profoundly study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm themselves with 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
and use it to guide their work. At the same time, it is 
necessary for them to earnestly study the decisions of the 14th 
National Party Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, learn about socialist market economy, and 
improve their political and professional standards. It is 
necessary strengthen the building of the leading bodies of 
discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels, 
strictly enforce democratic centralism, and enhance their 
fighting capacity. It is necessary to further rationalize work 
relations, bring their discipline inspection and supervisory 
functions into better play, and raise their work to a new level. 
  The plenary session firmly believed: As long as party 
committees and governments at all levels resolutely implement 
the central decision on the anticorruption struggle, achieve 
unity in thinking and understanding, earnestly strengthen 
leadership, fully rely on the masses, and vigorously carry out 
their work, this year's anticorruption work will definitely 
score new interim successes. 
  The plenary session called: Under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line and rallying closely 
around the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
its core, all party comrades should earnestly study and 
implement the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's important 
speech at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection, overcome all kinds of 
difficulties and obstructions with perseverance and a solid work 
spirit, and firmly wage the anticorruption struggle to make new 
contributions to safeguarding political stability, guaranteeing 
reform and opening up, and promoting economic development.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Central People's 
Radio Network [CPRN] is currently making efforts to upgrade its 
means of program transmission to try to improve the reception of 
its broadcasts in outlying and mountainous areas. 
  It has been some time since listeners from places such as 
Fujian, Guizhou, and Guangxi began writing to the CPRN editorial 
section complaining about receiving unclear, statical, or 
inaudible signals from CPRN broadcasts, particularly Program 
Two, at their places of listening. 
  At the request of listeners, CPRN Assistant Chief Engineer 
Sun Yingnian [1327 6601 1628] gave this briefing: CPRN now has 
seven sets of programs. While Program One and Two and the FM 
stereo broadcast of Program Three are being transmitted by CPRN 
transmitting stations set up in major regions across the 
country, all provinces and municipalities also are receiving and 
relaying CPRN programs. Therefore, I would say that central 
radio broadcasting has basically covered all regions of the 
country. However, the extensiveness of broadcast coverage does 
not necessarily mean the clear reception of broadcasts. The main 
underlying reason for the poor reception can be traced to the 
poor quality of broadcasts at their source. 
  Assistant Chief Engineer Sun Yingnian said: Because CPRN's 
broadcast center is located in Beijing, it needs to first 
transmit its programs to various localities across the nation 
from Beijing and then to retransmit these through local 
transmitting stations. To ensure the quality and continuity of 
broadcast programming, the central radio station adopted various 
means of transmission for its programs, including live-relay 
satellites, microwave, fiber-optic cable, broadcast cable, and 
other advanced means of broadcasting and transmission. The 
problem of poor reception at individual localities usually 
occurs in outlying or mountainous areas which lack the 
conditions required for microwave reception or 
satellite-receiving facilities or a place to receive and relay 
the central radio station's programs, and thus which are thus 
only able to receive programs with shortwave receivers and then 
to transmit them to an adjacent transmitting station for 
retransmission. Because of the unstable signal intensity, heavy 
static interference, or sudden signal loss experienced in the 
shortwave signal reception, the signals received from a 
retransmission of the programs would remain poor, thus adversely 
affecting reception quality. Now a relevant department under 
the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television has developed a new 
satellite receiving device specially for use in receiving and 
demodulating CPRN programs transmitted via the "Chinasat-5" 
satellite. This device is expected to be popularized in the 
near future. After its popularization, listeners in our 
outlying and mountainous areas will all be able to tune in more 
clearly to CPRN's various sets of programs.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Times Call Upon Heroes, Bring Up </F>
Heroes--on Learning From Xu Honggang"] 
  [Text] Shortly after the Lunar New Year, a young hero's 
name-- Xu Honggang--rapidly spread inside and outside the 
barracks and across the entire country. Jiang Zemin and other 
leading cadres of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military 
Commission cordially met Xu Honggang and praised him warmly for 
his heroic deeds. The General Political Department and the 
Central Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly issued a 
circular calling on the whole nation to emulate Xu Honggang. 
Why did the deeds of an ordinary soldier produce such a strong 
reaction and evoke such extensive echoes? In the final 
analysis, it is because his magnificent feats reflect the 
people's aspirations and respond to the call of the times. 
  Our era is a great one in which we have initiated the 
brilliant cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The themes of our era comprise Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; the party's basic line; the ideology and spirit 
of patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and revolutionary 
heroism; an ideology and spirit that is beneficial to reform, 
opening up, and modernization and national unity, social 
progress, and the people's happiness; and the ideology and 
spirit of striving for a happy life through honest labor. The 
noble thoughts and heroic deeds of Xu Honggang are precisely a 
resounding song with the main melody of the times. He rushed to 
help comrades in danger or difficulty, earnestly practiced what 
he advocated for the socialist cause, is irreconcilable towards 
ugly phenomena, and persistently performs the duties of a 
soldier. His thoughts and actions reflect the traditional 
virtues of the Chinese nation, shining with the glow of 
socialist ideology and morality, and mirror the fine traditions 
of our party and Army, which shimmer with the brand new spirit 
of the times. He boasts the common valuable character of the 
heroes of the older generations as well as the distinguishing 
features of a hero of the current generation. He is a brilliant 
model of a soldier because of his courage in devoting himself to 
a cause which is of universal significance to building up a 
healthy social atmosphere. This is the basic reason why Xu 
Honggang's deeds produced such a great appealing effect. 
  If any nation wants to be rejuvenated and any society wants 
to make changes, it should portray heroes and heroic images 
suitable to the requirements of the times so that people can be 
inspired and motivated. Just as the years of the revolutionary 
war called for heroic fighters to break through the brambles and 
thorns and to charge and shatter enemy positions, today, the 
accomplishment of the magnificent cause of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics likewise calls for heroic people to 
lead the broad masses to forge ahead and the advanced elements 
in society to take the lead in developing the "five kinds of 
revolutionary spirit" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 
"64-character pioneering spirit" emphasized by Comrade Jiang 
Zemin. They must have lofty ideals, take the overall interests 
into consideration, be ready to dedicate themselves to a cause, 
abide by social ethics, and have a high sense of responsibility, 
a healthy tendency of fostering justice and combating evil, the 
noble character of supporting those in danger and assisting 
those in difficulty, and the pioneering spirit of keeping on 
fighting in spite of all setbacks. With these, they can bring 
about a fundamental improvement of social morality and promote 
the constant advance of socialist spiritual civilization, so 
that our undertaking of reform, opening up, and modernization 
can march from victory to victory. This is precisely the social 
cause of heroic people emerging in great multitudes, who, 
singing the resonant songs of righteousness, have lived up to 
the earnest expectations of the broad masses. The hero Xu 
Honggang sprung up in response to the times. 
  Marxism tells us that the growth of a hero is closely 
connected with the times he is in and the cause he takes up. 
The great cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is one that calls for heroes, and the practice 
of pioneering a cause to build socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a vast arena for bringing up heroes. In 
tracing the footprint of Comrade Xu Honggang's growth, we can 
clearly note that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics was the most valuable 
nourishment for his mind; the fiery life of reform, opening up, 
and the drive for modernization is an exceptionally fine 
environment for his growth; the People's Army that boasts the 
true character of the veteran Red Army and the tradition of 
revolutionary heroism is a revolutionary furnace in which he is 
tempered; and the spirit of the masses who work hard to change 
the world in heading for a relatively comfortable life is the 
source of strength that urges him to make advances. In short, 
the spirit of our times, the fine tradition of our party, the 
heroic character of our Army, and the traditional virtues of the 
Chinese nation are all vividly reflected in him. It is an 
essential demand of our times to bring up group after group of 
heroic people like Xu Honggang. This represents the mainstream 
of our times. In the high tide of reform and opening up, those 
who indulge in money worship and pleasure- seeking and those 
extreme individualists will certainly be eliminated by the 
times, as they run counter to the historical trend. 
  In emulating Xu Honggang, we must act like him in responding 
to the call of the times with our practical actions. Every 
comrade should think over such a serious question: Can we do 
what Xu Honggang has done under the same blue sky and on the 
same earth? The great era of reform and opening up and the 
magnificent practice of army modernization have provided 
everyone with more or less the same environment for growth and 
the same arena of life, but each person's performance in 
response to the call of the times is entirely different. Why? 
There are many aspects, and the most fundamental is whether he 
can sincerely and realistically put into practice the spirit of 
the times. Xu Honggang has done it honestly. He has armed his 
own mind with the great theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, nurtured himself with the glorious 
traditions of veteran Red Army men, portrayed his own image with 
the noble spirit of serving the people with heart and soul, and 
trained himself through his dedication to the arduous practice 
of the national defense undertaking. Instead of uttering heroic 
words, he cherishes lofty aspirations and is ready to be devoted 
and to make sacrifices. It is precisely this spirit that makes 
Xu Honggang a hero. When we learn from Xu Honggang, we should 
particularly emulate this kind of spirit. With such a spirit, 
anyone can be another Xu Honggang when he is called to take up 
the cudgels for a just cause, another Su Ning when he is called 
for to devote himself to the modernization of national defense, 
another Huang Jiguang or Dong Cunrui when he is called to charge 
the enemy lines, and another Lei Feng when he is called to make 
contributions in an ordinary post. 
  Heroes are the pioneers of the times and models for the 
masses. The more heroes like Xu Honggang we have, the more 
cohesive our society will be, the stronger our Army's combat 
capacity will become, and the more our cause will flourish. We 
must enthusiastically respond to the call of Chairman Jiang and 
the Central Military Commission; conscientiously put into effect 
the guidelines of the circular jointly issued by the General 
Political Department and the Communist Youth League Central 
Committee; extensively and profoundly conduct activities of 
emulating the hero Xu Honggang; bring up more new socialist 
personalities with lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and 
a sense of discipline; and repeatedly push forward the building 
of a revolutionized, modernized, and regularized Army!

  [Text] Nanjing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangsu 
Province will focus on the establishment of a market economy and 
double its gross domestic product, based on last year's figures, 
by the end of this century. 
  "When the goal is accomplished, Jiangsu people will be able 
to live a comparatively comfortable life ahead of schedule," 
Chen Huanyou, governor of the province, said. 
  According to the governor, the province plans to increase 
its 
gross domestic product by 12 percent over last year's figure of 
250 billion yuan; and its imports and exports are planned to 
grow by nine percent to 9.5 billion U.S. dollars this year. 
  The annual income of urban employees is expected to reach 
4,100 yuan per capita, up 16 percent over last year, and that of 
farmers an average 1,450 yuan per capita, up 14 percent. 
  Chen encouraged enterprises to try out the modern enterprise 
system by employing the joint stock operations and forming 
enterprise groups. 
  The private economic sector, he added, will continue to 
surge 
this year. 
  To solve the problem of power shortage, Jiangsu plans to 
install power-generating units with a combined capacity of two 
million kw this year, bringing the total installed capacity in 
the province to 10 million kw. 
  In addition, Jiangsu plans to install more telephone 
exchanges and build more basic industrial enterprises during 
this period.

  [Text] Nanjing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Nanjing, capital of 
east China's Jiangsu Province, has developed into a major 
economic center second only to Shanghai in the middle and lower 
reaches of the Chang Jiang River. 
  The city has formed an economic and co-operative network 
involving the fields of transportation, trade, banking and 
information with Shanghai, Wuhan (capital of Hubei Province), 
Chongqing in Sichuan Province, Hefei (capital of Anhui Province) 
and Nanchang (capital of Jiangxi Province). 
  Meanwhile, the city's markets for capital goods and 
international futures have become regional transaction centers. 
  With convenient transportation facilities, Nanjing is 
regarded by major world consortiums and research institutions as 
a city with a promising future. 
  Wang Wulong, acting mayor of the city, said Nanjing is 
improving its urban functions. 
  It has opened 430 professional markets and trading centers, 
and markets of finance, technology and labor service. Their 
annual transaction volume tops 10 billion yuan. 
  One of the major cities in the Chang Jiang River Valley, 
Nanjing has opened four container shipping routes to Japan, Hong 
Kong, Singapore and the Middle East, respectively. Its annual 
handling capacity reaches more than 50 million tons at present, 
and is expected to top 100 million tons by the end of this 
century. 
  At present, Nanjing's 1,000 financial organizations are 
doing 
business with some 200 banking organizations in over 40 
countries and regions. 
  In addition, the city is developing a number of credit and 
trust, securities, financial and international leasing companies 
to pave the way for the setting up of banking organizations in 
the middle and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang River Valley. 
  A survey shows that Nanjing has approved the establishment 
of 
2,600 foreign-funded enterprises from more than 40 countries and 
regions so far.

  [Text] Nanjing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- The lower reaches of 
the Chang Jiang River in east China's Jiangsu Province have 
developed into a high-tech industrial belt. 
  The Chang Jiang River, China's longest, flows across Jiangsu 
and cuts by Nanjing, capital of the province, and Zhenjiang, 
Yangzhou, Nantong, Changzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou Cities, to form a 
belt which covers an area more than 400 km in length and 100 km 
in width. 
  This area has seven open ports which have more than 20 
berths 
able to accommodate ships of at least 10,000 dwt [deadweight 
ton]. 
  With thousands of industrial enterprises, it generates about 
80 percent of the gross domestic product in the province. 
  Since 1991 Jiangsu has invested billions of yuan in building 
up the industrial belt along the valley. 
  So far, the seven cities in the valley have formed a chain 
of 
modern industrial installations, covering raw materials, energy 
development, processing and high-tech. They account for one 
tenth of the country's total industrial output. 
  In addition, these cities boast complete telecommunications 
and transportation networks. 
  A provincial official in charge of the economy said that 
Jiangsu has opened eight state development and bonded zones, as 
well as international tourism and holiday areas over the past 
few years. 
  Investors from more than 100 countries and regions are 
busily 
setting up enterprises or exploring land for development. 
  A survey shows that the provincial government has approved 
the establishment of 18,000 foreign-funded enterprises, 
involving a total investment of more than 16 billion U.S. 
dollars. Included are over 60 noted trans-national corporations. 
  Meanwhile, China's first high-tech industrial chain has 
opened in the Jiangsu section of the Chang Jiang River Valley. 
  With a total area of 38.38 sq [square] km, the chain 
includes 
four high-tech industrial zones in Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi and 
Changzhou, respectively. The chain also houses more than 700 
high- tech project?nvolved in the fields of electronic 
information, the combination of machinery and electrical 
appliances, new materials and bio-engineering. 
  The Suzhou High-Tech Industrial Development Zone has more 
than 100 projects run by both Chinese and foreign investors. 
Each of the projects has an investment topping 10 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  According to the official, about 100,000 rural industrial 
enterprises in the Chang Jiang River Valley in the province are 
paying attention to upgrading themselves technically. 
  The technology and equipment of more than one half of them 
have reached the advanced Chinese standard and even 
internationally in some cases. One tenth of them have 
co-operated with overseas business people in forms of joint 
ventures or technical co- operation. 
  According to the latest statistics, the annual industrial 
output value generated by rural industrial enterprises in five 
counties, including Wuxi, Jiangjin and Wujin, in the river 
valley has surpassed 20 billion yuan each, ranking them among 
the leaders in the country. 
  One new feature is the Sino-Singapore joint development of 
the Suzhou Industrial Park. 
  The two sides have decided to spend 20 billion yuan on 
developing a 70-sq-km area into a industrial park consisting of 
a modern industrial zone, a high-tech zone, an industrial 
processing zone and an industrial town. 
  So far, the park has concluded contracts on building more 
than 60 projects with Singapore, involving a total of 1.6 
billion U.S. dollars.

<F P=106> [Article by He Guanghui (6320 0342 6540), vice minister of </F>
the State Commission for Restructuring Economic System: "1994: 
China's Reform Tasks"] 
  [Text] The year 1994 will be the first year for 
implementing the "Decision" taken at the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee. It will also be a crucial 
year for realizing overall progress and key breakthroughs in 
economic structural reform. We must put efforts into 
indomitable and progress-making struggle. This year, the key 
task for economic structural reform is: With the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system and the promoting of 
reform of the macroeconomic regulatory and control system as the 
focal points, and in coordination with the establishment of a 
market system with a production factors market as its main part, 
to speedily promote the reform of the social welfare and housing 
systems, and do well in reforms in other respects. 
<H3>  I. With the Transformation of the Enterprise Operational 
Mechanism as the Focal Point, Exploring Effective Avenues for 
Establishing a Modern Enterprise System </H3>
  The putting forward of the need to establish a modern 
enterprise system is a scientific summation of enterprise reform 
practice over the last few years. All enterprises must put 
efforts into moving in this direction. 
  Establishing a modern enterprise system is an arduous and 
complex task. It involves essential transformations of the 
nature, position, roles and activities of enterprises, and will 
actually be a restructuring of the entire enterprise system. 
Thus, when exploring ways to establish a modern enterprise 
system, our avenues of thought should be a bit broader and our 
standpoint should be a little higher. In our work, we must be 
meticulous in our arrangements, be strict in our standards, 
actively explore, and gradually push reform forward. We must do 
everything possible to avoid simplification and rushing headlong 
into mass action. 
  We must grasp firmly and do well in the various 
elements of basic work in establishing a modern enterprise 
system. We must continue to seriously implement the 
"Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations on Transforming the 
Operational Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the 
Whole People." We must also further implement the various types 
of operational autonomy in enterprises, speed up the pace at 
which the operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises is 
transformed and the organizational structure is readjusted, and 
continue to deepen the reform of the labor, personnel and 
distribution systems within enterprises. At the same time, it 
is necessary to implement the "Regulations on the Supervision 
and Management of the Assets of State-Owned Enterprises," 
strengthen supervision over the assets of state-owned 
enterprises, guard against the erosion of state-owned assets, 
and guarantee and increase the value of enterprises' state-owned 
assets. It is necessary to continue to implement the "Rules on 
Enterprise Financial Affairs" and "Enterprise Accounting 
Standards," so as to accelerate the transition toward enterprise 
financial and accounting systems which are scientific and in 
accord with international practices. We must gradually sort out 
and appraise assets, clearly set down property rights divisions, 
sort out and clarify creditors' rights and liabilities, appraise 
assets and verify the volume of enterprise corporate assets. 
  We must put efforts into exploring organizational forms 
for the assets structure of state-owned enterprises 
  -- Beginning with enterprises in which the operational 
situation are good, it is necessary to gradually carry out 
reorganization in accordance with the company system. That 
small number of medium- sized and large enterprises which make 
good profits, have high management efficiency and are in accord 
with the orientation of industrial policies can be directly 
reorganized as limited stock companies in which the state has a 
controlling or participatory shareholding. The majority of 
competitive-type industrial enterprises which are in accord with 
the industrial policies can be reorganized as limited liability 
companies or limited stock companies in which both the state and 
other corporate entities contribute funds. Enterprises in 
special industries can be reorganized as limited liability 
companies funded solely by the state. 
  -- Enterprises with the conditions can pool funds with 
foreign businesses and establish limited liability companies or 
limited stock companies. The foreign funds can be directly 
invested or be inputted through capital stock financing. Newly 
organized joint ventures using Chinese and foreign investment 
must all operate in accordance with the new structure. 
  -- We must further expand the mergers and alliances between 
enterprises. In accordance with the different situations of 
enterprises, forms such as merger through the provision of funds 
or partial purchase can be adopted. If both sides are 
state-owned enterprises, then with the agreement of the managing 
departments, and on the basis of voluntary participation, the 
form of noncompensated merger can be adopted. However, 
regardless of which form is adopted, in all cases they must 
handle appropriately and well the liability burdens of the 
original enterprises and arrangements for staff and workers. 
-- Those state-owned enterprises which have superiorities in 
terms of land resources and which should not be located in city 
centers can, through transferal transformation or transformation 
involving change of business, establish new enterprises with new 
mechanisms. 
  -- In respect of small-scale state-owned enterprises, we can 
carry out reform through adopting forms such as leased 
operation, contracted operation, sale or combined leasing and 
sale. It is also possible to implement a shareholding 
cooperative system. In selling such operations it is necessary 
to draw in the mechanism of competition, and to adopt the method 
of tendering or auction. For those enterprises which do not have 
the conditions, and for which the only option is to realize a 
sale through agreement, the agreed price must be set through 
certain procedures. It is possible to sell an enterprise 
outright, or else first lease it and then sell it. That is, 
first the state will recover the circulating funds, and levy use 
charges for the fixed assets, and subsequently, when the 
conditions are ripe, it will sell off the fixed assets. 
  -- Those state-owned enterprises which have long operated 
poorly, the products of which cannot be sold, whose assets 
cannot meet their liabilities, and which cannot be reorganized 
or transformed through other avenues should be declared bankrupt 
in accordance with the law. 
  -- All newly commenced industrial construction projects 
should be organized as enterprises in accordance with the new 
standards and should set down new enterprise mechanisms. All 
projects which involve productive operations can first establish 
companies and then start on construction. In setting up the 
project, they must as quickly as possible establish a company in 
which property rights relations are clear, responsibilities are 
clear and there is separation between government and enterprise 
functions. New enterprises must be established in accordance 
with the "Company Law." 
  In accordance with the demands of a modern enterprise 
system, it is necessary to actively engage in the renewal of the 
non-state- owned enterprise system. Establishing a modern 
enterprise system is not only a reform task for state-owned 
enterprises, but also a major issue faced by other types of 
enterprises including urban collective enterprises, township and 
town enterprises, and nongovernment high-tech enterprises. They 
must all, through diverse types of exploration, achieve clarity 
of property rights, and gradually change themselves into 
shareholding cooperative enterprises. Some can be changed into 
shareholding companies. In respect of privately operated 
enterprises, we must encourage them to reorganize into 
standardized companies, so that their activities can be guided 
toward rationality. 
  If state-owned enterprises are to realize a 
transformation of mechanism and a change of track, they must 
make full plans to resolve the problem of heavy burdens left by 
history. First, it is necessary to rationally deal with 
enterprises' debt burdens. Second, it is necessary to deal with 
the problem whereby the social insurance accumulation of veteran 
staff members and workers is insufficient. Third, it is 
necessary for enterprises to gradually move away from 
nonproductive undertakings, and resolve the problem of 
enterprises "running society." Fourth, we must gradually 
resolve the problem of excess personnel in old enterprises. 
  It is necessary to guard against the phenomenon whereby only 
the nameplate is changed and there is no real transformation of 
mechanism. The limited shareholding companies and limited 
liability companies which have already been established must, in 
accordance with relevant laws and regulations, establish 
complete internal organizational structures, achieve scientific, 
high-efficiency management and put efforts into changing the 
operational mechanism. When drawing in foreign funds to 
transform old enterprises, it is necessary to pay attention to 
the following: 1) It is necessary to avoid the phenomenon 
whereby there is just a change of nameplate, but no change of 
mechanism, and avoid situations where in name there is a 
joint-fund enterprise, but where in fact the foreign funds do 
not arrive. 2) When workshops, departments or projects engage 
in joint-fund operations with foreign partners, we must avoid 
situations where the workshops, departments and projects which 
are operating well are turned into joint-fund operations, while 
the ones which are operating poorly are left to the state. 
<H3>  II. With Reform of the Revenue, Financial and Investment 
Structures as the Focal Points, Accelerating the Building of 
Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Systems, and Changing the 
Role of the Government in Managing the Economy </H3>
  In 1994, major steps will be taken in reforming the revenue, 
financial and investment structures. This is an extremely 
timely and correct decision taken by the party Central Committee 
and the State Council, and it has decisive significance in 
accelerating the establishment of a new structure. 
  1. On reform of the financial revenue structure 
  In accordance with the demands of the socialist market 
economy, a financial system whereby there is revenue-sharing 
will be established. This is one of the key tasks in this 
year's reform of the macroeconomic management structure. 
  In implementing the revenue-sharing reforms, it is first 
necessary to scientifically and rationally divide the 
administrative jurisdictions of the central and local 
governments, and on this basis divide the scope of financial 
expenditures at the various levels. Second, on the basis of 
rationally dividing jurisdictions, the various tax types should 
be divided between central financial revenue and local financial 
revenue, and there should be an appropriate increase in the 
proportion of central financial revenue. Third, there should be 
rational local financial income and expenditure base figures set 
down, and a scientific expenditure system should be established 
whereby the central financial administration returns tax revenue 
and transfers expenditure to the localities. Fourth, in 
coordination with the implementation of the revenue-sharing 
system, the two levels of state tax bureaus and local tax 
bureaus should be established. Fifth, in accordance with the 
principles and requirements put forward in the new financial 
plan for the central and provincial levels, the provinces (as 
well as the autonomous regions and directly administered 
municipalities) should correspondingly formulate and implement, 
in respect of their subordinate city and county financial 
administrations, specific revenue-sharing measures. 
  The reform of the revenue system should be carried out in 
accordance with the the principles of "unified tax laws, fair 
burdens, a simplified tax system, and rational 
decentralization." The reform of the circulation tax system 
mainly involves the abolition of the former product tax and the 
former unified industrial and commercial tax levied on the three 
types of enterprises which are partly or wholly foreign-funded. 
These will be changed into a value-added tax, the scope over 
which the value-added tax is levied will be expanded, the 
value-added tax rates will be simplified and merged, the method 
for levying the value-added tax will be improved, and a system 
will be implemented whereby tax is recorded on goods dispatch 
notes and the taxation is withheld. In respect of some special 
consumer products, a further consumption tax will be levied. In 
respect of operational industries, excluding commercial 
establishments which are mainly part of tertiary industry and 
which are not subject to value-added tax, operational tax will 
continue to be levied. In respect of the reform of income tax: 
1) The income tax for domestically funded enterprises will be 
unified. The former method where different tax rates were levied 
on enterprises depending on their ownership nature will be 
changed, and a unified income tax rate of 33 percent will be 
levied. In accordance with their actual situations, it will be 
possible to adopt some transitional allowance measures for some 
enterprises and, at the same time, to abolish the state-owned 
enterprise regulatory tax. 2) A unified personal tax system 
will be implemented. Our country's "Personal Income Tax Law" 
has already been promulgated and it came into formal effect on 1 
January this year. We must seriously implement it. 
  The reforms of the financial revenue system this year will 
affect the financial contract system and the enterprise contract 
system. They are quite big steps and it is necessary to carry 
out all sorts of linkage and coordinating work. It is necessary 
to adopt various types of effective measures to safeguard and 
motivate the enthusiasm of the localities and enterprises. It 
is also necessary to guard against the occurrence of various 
types of leaks during the intense changes, which would lead to 
the erosion of financial revenue. In this way we will guarantee 
the smooth implementation of these reform measures and will 
achieve a smooth transition. 
  After the financial revenue reforms, great changes will 
occur 
in the financial relationship between the central authorities 
and the localities. The major change will be a reduction in 
revenue from the tax types levied directly at levels below the 
provincial level. The various types of tax revenue to be 
returned to the localities, including the portion of the tax 
reductions and exemptions over the next two years being returned 
to relevant accounts, will all be returned to the 
provincial-level financial administration. A major principle of 
this financial reform is to firmly continue the trend toward 
rational decentralization. The central government is not 
centralizing powers, but rather is mainly strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and appropriately 
balancing the expenditure capacities of the various regional 
financial administrations. After provincial-level financial 
strengths are appropriately centralized, all provinces should, 
in accordance with the principle of this reform, arrange for 
most operating expenditure to be by the basic-level governments. 
This will be more in accord with the realities of each 
locality, and will satisfy the demands of the local people. The 
provincial-level governments should also appropriately balance 
the financial expenditure capacities of the various basic-level 
governments, and promote balanced socioeconomic development. 
This raises the question of how the province is to divide the 
income from the various tax types among the subordinate 
governments, how it will share revenue and how it will 
rationally transfer disbursements. This work is extremely 
important and extremely onerous. The economic restructuring 
departments in all areas must, on the basis of serious 
investigation and research, in accordance with the guiding 
principles of the central authorities and under the guidance of 
the various levels of government, coordinate the various 
departments in doing well in this work. 
  2. On reform of the financial structure 
  First, the People's Bank of China will be turned into a true 
central bank, and a central bank macroregulatory and control 
system which independently implements monetary policy will be 
established. The final goal of monetary policy should be a 
stable currency value. The intermediate goals and operational 
goals of monetary policy are to control the money supply, the 
total volume of credit, interbank borrowing interest rates and 
bank reserve provision rates. The power to handle basic money 
and regulate the scale of credit should be taken back by the 
headquarters of the People's Bank of China. Under the 
precondition of fully considering stability during the period of 
transition, the existing quota management of credit funds should 
be changed to assets risk management and assets-liability ratio 
management. The supervision and management of the various types 
of financial organs by the central People's Bank should be 
strengthened, so as to safeguard normal financial order. 
  Second, policy-nature banks will be established. A 
separation will be realized between policy-nature financial 
business and commercial-nature financial business. This is a 
precondition for the changing of specialized banks into 
commercial banks. It is also an objective requirement for 
cutting the direct links between policy-nature credit and basic 
money and for guaranteeing the initiative of the People's Bank 
in regulating and controlling basic money. The policy-nature 
banks will, under the guidance of state industrial policies and 
plans, make their own operational decisions, shoulder their own 
risks, and firmly uphold the principle of operations which 
guarantee capital and a little profit. They will not engage in 
commercial financial business. The policy-nature banks will 
comprise the State Development Bank, the Import-Export Credit 
Bank, and the China Agricultural Development Bank. These will 
form a complete policy-nature investment and financing system, 
and will mainly take on the policy-nature investment and 
financing business in various economic spheres. 
  Third, the current specialized state banks will be changed 
into true commercial banks. After policy-nature financial 
business is separated out, the existing specialized state banks, 
that is the China Industrial and Commercial Bank, the China 
Agricultural Bank, the Bank of China and the People's 
Construction Bank of China, will gradually make the transition 
to state-owned commercial banks. They will operate in 
accordance with the operational mechanism of modern commercial 
banks, will truly decide on their own operations, will take sole 
responsibility for their own profits and losses, will bear risks 
and will practice self-restraint. In the process of 
track-changing, the state-owned commercial banks should pay 
attention to readjusting their own organizational structures. 
Overlapping between the businesses of the state-owned 
commercial banks will be allowed, so as to form a mechanism of 
competition. However, abnormal competition will be restricted. 
The other current national and regional banks should also carry 
out transformation in accordance with the relevant laws and 
regulations which will soon appear. At the same time, on the 
basis of the urban and rural credit cooperatives, we should 
actively and safely develop a cooperative bank system to serve 
agriculture, small and medium-sized enterprises and regional 
economies. The cooperative bank system will be formed by rural 
cooperative banks and urban cooperative banks. Urban 
cooperative banks will set up two levels of branches -- city 
branches and basic-level branches. All will have independent 
corporate status. Regardless of whether we speak of specialized 
state banks being changed into commercial banks or urban and 
rural credit cooperatives being turned into cooperative banks, 
the changes must be carried out in a gradual and planned way. 
At present, the various localities have high enthusiasm for 
developing local and regional commercial banks, but there is 
insufficient understanding of the operational mechanisms and 
possible risks of commercial banks. This situation is greatly 
deserving of attention. Commercial banks are not a second 
financial administration for the government, and cannot 
arbitrarily expand the scale of credit. They are actually 
financial enterprises and must be operated as enterprises. For 
commercial banks, especially small and medium-sized commercial 
banks, strengthening asset-liability management is more 
important. If a tight money situation occurs and it is 
difficult to meet payments, it could lead to the bank going 
bankrupt, and the repercussions of this would be very strong. 
In this respect, it is necessary to have a very clear 
understanding, and matters must be handled very carefully. 
  3. On reform of the investment structure 
  The focal points of the reform of the investment structure 
in 
1994 will be: 1) Gradually establishing corporate investment 
and bank credit risk responsibility. On this basis, eventually 
investment and financing for competitive-type projects will be 
pushed toward the market, and the enterprises will make their 
own decisions and will take on the risks. The decisions on 
credit provision will be taken by the commercial bank, and the 
bank will take responsibility for profits or losses. A project 
registration and report system will replace the current 
administrative examination and approval system, and the 
government will influence this investment mainly by 
strengthening industrial policy guidance and information 
guidance. 2) The investment and financing channels for basic 
projects and key construction projects will be broadened, and 
all sides will be encouraged to participate in investment. Funds 
will be raised, for example, through the shareholding system, 
auction of enterprises, leasing, and property rights transfer. 
At the same time, this will be coordinated with the 
implementation of the revenue-sharing system, which will 
strengthen the capacity and the responsibility of local 
governments to invest in basic projects and key construction 
projects. 3) Newly commenced industrial projects and projects 
in progress will actively promote a company corporate 
responsibility system. 4) Policy-nature financing and 
commercial-nature financing will be separated, and a central 
policy-nature investment and financing system will be 
established. 
  4. On transforming government functions, reforming 
government organs and establishing intermediary 
organizations 
  Transforming government functions and reforming government 
organs are pressing requirements in establishing a socialist 
market economy structure. This is also something which 
enterprises and society have indicated is a quite major issue. 
If determined efforts are not put into resolving this problem, 
it will be difficult to achieve success in transforming the 
operational mechanism of enterprises. 
  In 1994, in accordance with unified deployments by the 
central authorities, it is necessary to continue and to strive 
to complete, at an early date, the reform of central government 
organs, and to actively push forward reform of local government 
organs. In reform of both central government organs and local 
government organs, the changing of government functions should 
be taken as the focal point. At present, in changing government 
functions, we need to do well in three areas of work: 1) 
Functions which fall within the scope of enterprise operational 
autonomy should truly be returned to enterprises. 2) The 
resource deployment functions should be transferred to the 
market. 3) In economic activities, social service functions and 
quite a proportion of supervisory functions should be 
transferred to intermediary organizations. Intermediary organs, 
as links between government and enterprise, enterprise and 
enterprise, and government and society, will have service, 
linkage, notarizing and supervisory functions which cannot be 
replaced by government administrative management. In accordance 
with the requirements of the market economy operation, stress 
must be placed on developing and improving accountant, auditor 
and lawyer offices as well as property and credit appraisal 
organs and so on. In coordination with the reform of government 
organs, there should be organized, on the basis of need and in 
accordance with the law, industry associations, guilds, chambers 
of commerce and other such organizations, which will assist the 
government in carrying out socioeconomic management. The 
intermediary organs must, through adherence to the law and 
maintenance of standards, form self-coordinating, 
self-protective and self-restraining mechanisms. The market 
intermediary organs will create between them a mechanism of 
competition, whereby the superior succeed and the inferior are 
weeded out. The intermediary organs must also assume 
corresponding legal and economic responsibility for the results 
of their actions, and accept the management and supervision of 
relevant government departments. 
<H3>  III. With the Fostering of Production Factor Markets as the 
Focal Point, Continuing To Promote Price Reform and the 
Fostering of a Unified, Open Market System </H3>
  1. Strongly developing commodity markets and 
continuing to deepen the reform of the circulation structure 
  In the production centers, sales centers and distribution 
centers for major commodities, it is necessary to continue to 
actively develop and perfect a large number of wholesale markets 
for agricultural products, industrial consumption products and 
means of production. Also, market information functions will be 
improved, trading measures will be improved, the efficiency of 
trading will be raised and the range of such markets will be 
expanded. There will be strict standardization of the commodity 
futures market experimental points, and there will be 
reappraisal and reregistration of existing futures exchanges and 
futures brokering companies. At the same time, the pace of 
futures legislation will be accelerated. The reform of the 
goods and materials ordering fairs system will be continued, 
while systems of state ordering of goods and long-term contracts 
will be explored. New modes for linking producers with users 
such as coordinated provision of goods and materials will be 
expanded, so as to gradually replace the system of mandatory 
planned distribution, while the circulation channels for means 
of production will be put in order. Various types of brokerage 
companies and broker organs will be stably developed, while 
legislation to cover brokers will be stepped up so as to 
standardize the activities of brokers. The reform of the 
large-volume agricultural product circulation systems will be 
continued and pushed forward. In areas where grain prices have 
still not been freed, the adoption of decentralized 
decisionmaking will be continued, so as to gradually realize 
freeing of prices. In places where prices have already been 
freed, it is necessary to do well in the various aspects of 
related reform work following the freeing of grain prices, 
further perfect the system of graded stores and the grain 
regulatory fund system, and use the market mechanism to 
strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control of grain. There 
is a need to actively create conditions under which to stably 
push forward the reform of the system of purchase and sale of 
cotton and silkworm cocoons, so that this is brought onto the 
market track. It is necessary to consolidate and improve the 
circulation system for agricultural products such as meat, 
sugar, eggs, fruit and vegetables, which are already basically 
subject to market regulation, so as to speed the establishment 
of a risk regulation and control mechanism. 
  2. Further deepening price reform 
  Pushing price reform forward is still a major task this 
year. 
We must, as swiftly as possible, achieve the merging of the 
dual-track pricing system for means of production. We must 
select an opportunity to merge into a single price the high and 
the low prices for crude petroleum within the plan. At the same 
time we should raise the price levels. Those prices which have 
already been freed should continue to be subject to the market. 
When the conditions are ripe, we should then merge the prices 
for crude petroleum. The prices for state monopoly coal should 
be completely freed. Under the precondition of not affecting 
the overall stability of prices, there should be an appropriate 
readjustment of the price of electricity. There will be an 
appropriate increase in the guaranteed price of grain and the 
price of cotton. This year, the reform tasks are very onerous 
and they will affect every household and may affect social 
stability. All areas must make meticulous arrangements, 
strengthen supervision and control and guarantee the smooth 
carrying out of reform. 
  3. Actively developing production factor markets, 
including the financial market, the land market and the labor 
market 
  Further opening up the financial market. In 1994, 
we must take positive and stable steps in marketizing interest 
rates. We need to develop standardized interbank-borrowing and 
bill-discounting markets, and strengthen management of the money 
market. We must cut the direct links between the money market 
and the funds market, and guard against funds from the 
interborrowing market flowing into the securities market and the 
real estate market. We must further put in order the 
relationship between deposit interest rates, credit interest 
rates and negotiable securities interest rates. The various 
types of interest rates must reflect differences in time 
periods, costs and risks, and rational interest rate 
differentials must be maintained, so as to reflect supply-demand 
relationships in the market. 
  In the negotiable securities market, the scale of the issue 
of various types of bonds must continue to be expanded in a 
planned way. Bond issue organs and bond and credit rating 
organs will have to be established, so as to promote the healthy 
development of the bond market. On the basis of improving the 
government bond market, state-owned commercial banks and other 
financial organs, as well as post office savings organs and 
social security funds, should be required to hold a certain 
proportion of their balances in government bonds. The national 
commercial financial organs will be able to use this as security 
when obtaining financing from the People's Bank. This will 
create conditions for the central bank to engage in open market 
business. 
  The scale of public issue of shares will be expanded in a 
planned way. The secondary securities market will continue to 
be developed and perfected. A number of cooperative investment 
funds will be developed in a step-by-step way, and these will be 
commissioned by small and medium-sized investors to engage in 
investment in securities. This will reduce the risk of 
investment in securities. Market management of stock exchanges 
will be strengthened and effective measures will be adopted to 
strike at activities whereby major operators control share 
prices from behind the scenes. The construction of a nationwide 
securities network price-quoting system will be continued. On 
the basis of summing up experiences in terms of internal 
circulation and trade of corporate shares, the scale of 
corporate share trading will be expanded, so as to promote the 
normal circulation of corporate shares. The "Securities Law" 
will be promulgated as quickly as possible, and then the issue 
and sale of shares will be standardized strictly in accordance 
with the "Securities Law" and the "Provisional Regulations for 
Managing the Issue and Trading of Shares." The management of 
securities exchanges and trading systems will also be improved. 
  In reforming the foreign exchange management structure, 
efforts will be made to achieve the merger of the exchange rates 
and to establish a managed floating exchange rate system which 
is based on the market. The system of foreign exchange quotas 
and retained proportions will be abolished and an exchange 
settlement system will be instituted. The system of planned 
examination and approval for the foreign exchange used for 
normal foreign trade, labor cooperation, technology imports and 
such current account expenditure will be abolished, and there 
will be conditional convertibility for renminbi in current 
accounts. A unified national interbank foreign exchange market 
will be established, to replace the current foreign exchange 
swap centers. At the same time, foreign currency bid prices and 
foreign currency circulation will be strictly prohibited. 
  Correctly guiding the healthy development of the land 
market. It is necessary to establish a primary-level, 
standardized state- monopoly urban land-use market, and expand 
the range of land-use system reforms. In respect of the sale of 
commercial land-use rights, the modes of calling for tenders and 
auction can be adopted, so as to raise the economic efficiency 
of land use. The compensated transfer of land-use rights must 
manifest the principles of openness, justness and fairness. The 
price arrived at in negotiated leasing of land must be fair to 
society. The sale of use rights and development of large pieces 
of land must be handled carefully. On the basis of truly 
safeguarding agricultural land and strictly controlling the 
transfer of agricultural land to nonagricultural purposes, we 
must do well in the experimental points for reform of the rural 
land-use system. 
  It is necessary to uphold the principle of giving equal 
importance to resources and to asset management. There is also 
a need to strengthen land registration and appraisal work. Tax 
will not be levied on income from the leasing of land in the 
primary market, but such income must be handled within the 
financial budget. On the basis of the primary-level, 
state-monopoly, urban land market, we should free up and enliven 
the secondary land market. The secondary market must establish a 
regular land-use rights transfer price-formation mechanism and, 
through levying and readjusting real estate taxation and other 
measures, guard against the obtaining of super-profits in real 
estate transactions and the erosion of state earnings. 
  Macroregulation and control over land development and use 
must be strengthened, and it is necessary to uphold unified 
government management of planning, development, sale and 
earnings distribution from land. Financial taxation, pricing 
and legal measures should be used to regulate and control the 
land supply-demand relationship, and to standardize the land 
market. Actively fostering the labor market. On 
the basis of gradually readjusting the enterprises' 
organizational structure, and reforming the labor employment 
system and the system where graduates are assigned to jobs, we 
should gradually reduce the planned allocation of labor and the 
scope of such arrangements. We must put efforts into developing 
a labor market and draw the mechanism of competition into the 
employment sphere. At present, we should stress the development 
of a human resources and skills interflow market, expand the 
scope of dual-directional choice in employment and promote the 
rational flow of labor. We must put great efforts into social 
labor employment intermediary organizations for job 
introduction, employment training and labor arbitration and 
mediation. We must strengthen the information interflow in the 
labor market, so as to guide the rational transfer of labor. We 
must actively encourage enterprises and the various levels of 
government to put efforts into developing tertiary industry, to 
expand avenues and to create more employment opportunities. In 
respect of the flow of surplus labor from the rural areas, we 
must do well in guidance and service work, so as to prevent 
various types of negative influences. Through coordinated 
reforms in various respects, we must gradually form various 
types of labor market systems at the state, local and enterprise 
levels, and provide labor with better opportunities for equal 
competition, so as to more fully bring into play the role of the 
market mechanism in the rational deployment of labor resources. 
4. Further improving market order, improving market 
regulations, and putting efforts into developing market 
relations 
  It is necessary to tightly grasp the work of formulating 
laws 
and regulations for safeguarding market order, standardizing the 
activities of market entities and cleaning up the market 
environment, so as to guarantee that market activities are 
carried out in a just, fair and open way. It is also necessary 
to set up and perfect corresponding market supervisory organs 
and enforcement systems. We must adopt effective measures to 
eliminate the phenomena of regional blockades and departmental 
regimes which still exist to a serious degree, and to remove all 
restrictions which are not in accord with the requirements of a 
market economy and which obstruct the formation of a unified, 
open market system. Here it must be especially pointed out that 
in the process of promoting the development of markets, 
government departments must place stress on developing market 
relations which are in accord with the demands of the socialist 
market economy, and guarantee the basic role of the market 
mechanism in resource deployment. Stress must be placed on 
promoting and safeguarding fair competition, improving market 
regulations, and standardizing trading activities. The 
practices which exist in market construction at present, whereby 
localities proceed from their own interests, ignore conditions, 
do not concern themselves with needs, are greatly avaricious, 
blindly compete, blockade each other, and just rebuild venues 
and set up desks, are completely incompatible with market 
economy principles. 
<H3>  IV. Accelerating the Pace of Reforms of the Social Welfare 
System and the Housing System </H3>
  Based on the spirit of the "Decision" of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, in carrying out 
reform of the social welfare system, it is important to grasp 
the following principles: 
  The first is that the level and pattern of the system must 
be 
in accord with the level of economic development. Proceeding 
from the national conditions, the state and the enterprises 
cannot take on too much, and even in respect of basic welfare 
such as care of the elderly and medical services, the individual 
must pay some fees. 
  The second is that there must be a difference between urban 
and rural areas. At the present stage, there exist very great 
differences between the urban and rural areas in our country in 
terms of level of production, employment structure and income 
level, and the modernization and socialization of the rural 
economy will require a long process over time. The broad rural 
areas will not in the near term possess the conditions for a 
compulsory social welfare system governed by unified national 
legislation. We cannot just copy the methods of the urban 
enterprises. The broad number of rural residents should 
continue to uphold the good traditional practices of looking 
after the elderly at home and helping their neighbors. In 
wealthier areas, on the basis of voluntary participation by the 
peasants, an old-age insurance system involving personal saving 
accumulation can be instituted. 
  The third is that there must be a separation between social 
insurance and commercial insurance. 
  The fourth is that the social welfare management organs must 
be unified and the management must be governed by legislation. 
  The focal point in 1994 is to further improve the old-age 
pension and medical insurance systems for urban staff and 
workers. The orientation is that the old-age pension and 
medical funds should be jointly provided by units and 
individuals. A new method should be implemented whereby social 
funds and personal accounts are combined. At the same time, the 
unemployment insurance system should be further improved. 
  In accordance with this reform orientation, the basic line 
of 
thought for the reform of the old-age pension system for urban 
staff and workers is that individual old-age pension accounts 
will be established, and the old-age pension fees will comprise 
a certain proportion of wages and will be jointly contributed by 
the employing unit and the individual staff member or worker. 
The amounts will be recorded in the individual account. In 
future, at the same time as realizing the monetization of wages, 
the proportion to be contributed by the individual staff members 
and workers and the proportion to be contributed by the 
employing unit should be gradually brought to an equal level. 
If individual laborers participate in the old-age pension 
scheme, the costs will be borne entirely by the individuals. 
When promoting the reform of the property rights system, 
engaging in the reorganization, transfer and clearing up of 
assets, and arranging joint ventures with foreign funds, in all 
cases it is necessary to consider the raising of social welfare 
funds and the sources for guaranteeing social welfare funds. 
  The medical and health system reforms will be focused on 
reform of the current publicly funded and labor insurance 
medical and health system, and establishing a county- and 
city-level medical and health insurance system in which 
individual medical and health accounts are combined with social 
insurance funds for major illnesses. The basic line of thought 
is to divide the funds used for the existing labor insurance 
medical treatment and publicly funded medical treatment into two 
segments. Part of this will be used to establish an overall 
social insurance fund for major illnesses, which will be 
centralized and will be used as a regulator, and the monies from 
which will be expended to cover major illnesses of staff members 
and workers. The other part will be used to establish medical 
and health accounts for individuals. Further, individual staff 
and workers will, at set intervals, pay in a certain amount of 
their wages to supplement the individual medical and health 
accounts, and these will be used for general medical and health 
expenditure. The reform of the medical and health system will 
be quite complex, and quite difficult. All areas must actively 
develop forecasting and formulate specific plans. We will, 
together with relevant departments, select several cities as 
trial points in which to carry out experimental reforms. 
  Unemployment insurance will mainly involve putting into 
effect the State Council's whole-people ownership staff and 
workers unemployment insurance implementation measures, 
expanding the scope of unemployment insurance, and reforming the 
methods of calculation and issue of unemployment insurance. We 
must establish a unified unemployment insurance system which 
covers the staff and workers in state-owned, collective and 
private ownership enterprises and the Chinese side of joint 
ventures. Industrial injury insurance for enterprises will, on 
the basis of trials at experimental points, be gradually 
expanded in coverage and the management modes will be reformed. 
  Of course, our country is huge in territory, and the 
economic 
development of various regions is very unbalanced. Thus, the 
various types of insurance noted above, and especially urban 
old-age pensions, cannot be implemented to the same degree 
across the country. Thus, the various areas should be allowed, 
under the guidance of unified national policies and principles, 
to have different forms, ranges and degrees of pensions. 
  As to the reform of the housing system, at the Third 
National 
Housing Reform Work Conference held from 30 November to 3 
December last year, the State Council put forward the principles 
and orientation of reform and set down specific deployments for 
housing reform work this year. All areas must seriously and 
fully implement the measures in accordance with the spirit of 
the conference. 
<H3>  V. Earnestly Grasping Well the Various Reforms in Other 
Spheres </H3>
  1. Continuing to deepen reform in the rural areas 
  The responsibility system which has the household 
output-linked contracts as its main part, and the dual-level 
operational structure which combines centralization and 
decentralization, are basic systems in our country's rural 
economy. They must be stably maintained for a long period and 
be continually improved. In order to stabilize the land 
contract relationships so as to encourage peasants to increase 
their investment and raise land-use efficiency, it is necessary 
to extend the contract periods for cultivated land. Under the 
precondition of upholding the collective ownership of land and 
not changing the use of land, with the agreement of the 
contractor, we should allow the compensated transfer of land-use 
rights in accordance with the law within the period of the 
contract. In a small number of economically quite developed 
areas, in accordance with the principle of voluntary 
participation by the masses, we can allow some modes such as 
transfer of contracts and shareholdings, in order to develop 
operations of an appropriate scale. 
  Rural collective economic organizations should actively 
develop service-nature economic entities, to provide services to 
household operators. It is necessary to actively develop 
various sorts of specialized service organizations, so that the 
dispersed small-scale operations of rural households are closely 
linked with the daily developing market, and to promote the 
development of agriculture in the direction of commoditization, 
specialization and modernization. 
  Township and town enterprises are new market entities which 
have sprung up during the development of the rural commodity 
economy. These will in future play an increasingly great role in 
handling the transfer of surplus labor from the villages, in 
guaranteeing the stable development of agriculture, in 
increasing the incomes of rural people, in bringing prosperity 
to the rural economy and in speeding industrialization and 
modernization of the rural areas. It is necessary to further 
deepen reform of the township and town enterprises, improve the 
various forms of contracted operation responsibility system, 
improve internal operational mechanisms and management 
structures, and reduce administrative intervention. In 
accordance with the principles of active support, correct 
guidance, continual improvement and gradual standardization, on 
the basis of clarifying property rights, we should adopt various 
forms including lateral participatory shareholdings, asset stock 
splitting and joint shareholdings by peasants, so as to actively 
and safely develop a shareholding cooperative system. However, 
we must certainly not engage in administrative matchmaking. 
Much effort must be put into developing various kinds of 
economic and technological alliances and cooperation. Using 
backbone enterprises or famous products as the center, and on 
the basis of voluntary participation, we must encourage the 
formation of enterprise groups through mergers or alliances, and 
link the further development of township and town enterprises 
with the construction of towns. It is necessary to strengthen 
planning and guide the appropriate centralization of township 
and town enterprises, fully utilize and transform the existing 
towns and build new towns. On this basis, we can speed the 
development of tertiary industry in the rural areas, readjust 
the industrial structure of township and town enterprises and 
strengthen the capacity of township and town enterprises to 
absorb the surplus labor in the rural areas. To this end, we 
should explore the reform of the household registration 
management system in townships and towns, and allow the peasants 
to enter the towns, so that more surplus rural labor can be 
locally absorbed. 
  The government's support for agricultural production and 
protection of the peasants' rights and interests will be 
strengthened. A regulatory storage system and market risk fund 
for grain and other basic agricultural products will be 
established and built upon and a guaranteed price procurement 
system will be implemented to guard against excessive 
fluctuations in market prices. Standardized and legally 
stipulated management will be implemented in respect of the 
charges and the labor duties borne by the peasants, so as to 
truly safeguard the economic interests of the peasants. 
  2. Deepening reform of the foreign trade structure, 
further expanding opening up to the outside 
  We must implement operational autonomy in an overall way for 
foreign trade enterprises and, in accordance with the demands of 
a modern enterprise system, develop externally oriented 
enterprise groups. It is necessary to improve foreign trade 
macromanagement, further reform the import management system, 
reduce administrative examination and approval, strengthen 
organizational coordination through chambers of commerce and 
regulation and control through economic measures, and gradually 
establish a system of open tenders and auctions for quotas and 
licenses. This year, we can first select some commodities to 
carry out some experiments. We must further simplify 
examination and approval links, so that production enterprises, 
scientific and technological enterprises and circulation 
enterprises can enjoy foreign trade operation rights. We must 
speed foreign trade legislation, and gradually establish a quite 
complete foreign trade legislation system. 
  We must grasp the opportunity, further increase the breadth 
and depth of opening up, expand the areas and spheres of opening 
up, and actively do well in the work of drawing in foreign 
funds. The existing policy of open zones (including special 
zones, development zones, open cities, bonded zones and so on) 
will not change. However, it is required that the management of 
open zones be raised in grade, and be carried out in accordance 
with a new mechanism. It is necessary to raise the level of 
management, promote economic development, and realize the 
various functions stipulated for open areas. On the basis of 
continuing to do well in opening up in coastal areas and 
riverine and border regions, opening up should be expanded to 
areas along major communications routes and major electricity 
trunk lines. The spheres of opening up should be expanded to 
tertiary industry. There should be planned and gradual 
expansion of open spheres. 
  There is a need to actively do well in the work of drawing 
in 
foreign funds and expanding the degree of industrial policy 
slanting, and to gradually change the mechanism by which foreign 
funds are drawn in from the existing preferential policies to 
providing a good investment environment and a legislative base. 
The focus of the work of drawing in foreign funds is to 
increase the proportion of foreign businesses involved in basic 
facilities, basic industries, and high- and new-technology 
projects, to accelerate the pace at which foreign funds are used 
in the technological transformation of medium-sized and large 
state enterprises, and to encourage large multinational 
companies to invest in China. At the same time as continuing to 
stress the two basic forms of foreign fund import constituted by 
direct investment by foreign businesses and foreign borrowing, 
at the current stage it is important to especially stress the 
expansion of share capital financing and securities financing. 
It is necessary to clearly distinguish the functions of the 
various relevant government departments in respect of drawing in 
foreign funds, and further simplify the examination and approval 
procedures for foreign-funded projects. It is necessary to 
actively encourage the Central and Western regions to draw in 
foreign funds to develop their resources and enliven their 
economies. 
  3. Accelerating the pace of reform of the science and 
technology structure 
  In accordance with the principle of "maintaining overall 
stability while allowing freedoms," the scientific and 
technological system will have to carry out structural 
readjustment and achieve a transformation of mechanism and 
interflow of skilled personnel. Technological development-type 
organs must enter the market, develop all sorts of links and 
cooperation with enterprises, and build up scientific and 
technological vanguard enterprises and enterprise groups. It is 
necessary to speed the pace at which development-type scientific 
and technological research institutes are turned into 
enterprises, and to encourage scientific and technological 
personnel to run nongovernment scientific and technological 
enterprises, in accordance with the principles of "self-raised 
funds, voluntary organization, autonomous operations and sole 
responsibility for profits and losses." 
  It is necessary to speed the pace of reform of the 
educational system. In accordance with the requirements of the 
"China Education Reform and Development Program" decided on by 
the Third Plenary Session, the most important component of the 
reform of the education structure is to change the situation 
whereby the government runs all schooling, and to form a new 
structure where the main element is government-run schools, but 
whereby various circles in society all participate in the 
running of schools. Secondary and tertiary polytechnic 
institutions and universities must gradually implement a system 
whereby students pay fees to attend school, but where there are 
also scholarships and student loans available. Compulsory 
education should mainly be funded and run by the government. At 
the same time, we should encourage the raising of funds in 
society through many channels and many forms in order to fund 
nongovernment educational institutions. It is necessary to 
improve the structure of education, and put great efforts into 
developing professional education and adult education, so as to 
accord with the demands of the socialist market economy. In 
respect of the educational systems of schools, we need to 
gradually change the situation of departmental and regional 
divisions. While taking into account different situations, we 
need to gradually make the transition to a system where there 
are two levels, comprising schools run by the central 
authorities and schools run by the local authorities, and 
whereby the schools system is mainly planned and managed by the 
localities. 
  4. In accordance with the principle of combining 
reform decisions and legislative decisions, strengthening reform 
of legislative work 
  In accordance with the demands of reform and opening up and 
the degree to which legislative conditions are ripe, this year 
the state will put forward a company law, a securities law, a 
budget law, a labor law, a foreign trade law, a central bank 
law, a commercial bank law, a negotiable instrument law, an 
insurance law, a futures trading law, a registered accountants 
law, and other laws and related regulations. 
<H3>  VI. Solidly Carrying Forward the Various Elements of 
Advance Experimental-Point Work For the Establishment of a New 
Structure </H3>
  Establishing a socialist market economy structure is an 
unprecedented creative enterprise. In this sense, all of our 
reform practice is exploration and experimentation. Thus, at 
the same time as continuing to push forward the overall reforms, 
we should select a number of areas, industries and enterprises 
in which to establish comprehensive or single-item trial points 
for carrying out experiments in the establishment of a new 
structure. 
  Actively and stably carrying out experiments in 
enterprise mechanism transformation and track-changing. In 
order to actively explore the avenues for establishing a modern 
enterprise system, the State Council has decided to select 100 
enterprises which have a large scale, possess over three years 
of stable operational results, have a unified leading group and 
have a quite strong reform consciousness as trial points in 
experiments to establish a modern enterprise system. The main 
contents of the experiments will be: Putting in order the 
property rights relations of state-owned enterprises, 
establishing an enterprise corporate assets system, implementing 
separation of government and enterprise functions, establishing 
a diversified enterprise organizational form which is in accord 
with the development of the productive forces, establishing a 
complete and scientific internal management system for 
enterprises, implementing a new financial and accounting system, 
and so on. The experimental enterprises should, in accordance 
with their different characteristics, formulate down-to-earth 
and feasible experimental programs, and carry out the various 
reforms in a planned and gradual way. 
  Further doing well in experiments for comprehensive, 
coordinated reform in urban areas. The task of 
comprehensive coordinated reform in urban areas is to take the 
initial steps in building a socialist market economy structure, 
and to create experiences. The experimental points will play a 
demonstration role and spurring role in the course of the 
national reforms and become pioneer regions in establishing a 
new structure. In accordance with this requirement, the various 
experimental-point cities must, in accordance with the spirit of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and 
in the light of their own specific realities, further improve 
the experimental-point programs for comprehensive reforms. The 
programs must have an overall, coordinated and leading nature, 
and must also be feasible. At the same time, they will have to 
formulate various types of specific implementation plans, and 
put these into action. The experimental-point cities, as the 
vanguard areas in establishing a new structure, must firmly 
implement the various central, unified reform measures and 
especially the macromanagement structural reforms. Also, in the 
light of their own local realities, in the effective 
implementation of these measures, they must create fresh 
experiences. In the spheres of enterprise reform, changing 
government functions, fostering a market system, establishing a 
new-type social security system and speeding the reform of the 
housing system, all experimental-point cities can, in accordance 
with their own bases and conditions, and under the precondition 
that it is in accord with the overall orientation of reform, 
bravely explore, be daring in practice, strive to make new 
breakthroughs, and accumulate experiences for the whole 
country's reforms. The experimental-point cities must further 
liberate their ideas, and must dare to address those reform 
spheres which involve the deep-level readjustment of interests 
and which will be very difficult. In those aspects which 
present difficulties under the current system and which have to 
be reformed in establishing a market economy structure, these 
cities should actively engage in reform, make brave 
breakthroughs and experiment courageously. They must not shrink 
from this. We are preparing to formulate a relevant document, 
in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, to facilitate the better 
carrying out of urban experimental work. This year is a crucial 
year in which the comprehensive urban reforms are being 
implemented in an overall way. This requires that each city 
grasp the opportunity, do work in a down-to-earth manner, strive 
to take quite big steps next year, achieve major breakthroughs 
and realize obvious achievements. 
  Continuing to do well in comprehensive reform 
experiments at the county level. We must take the 
fostering of market entities, the establishment of market 
entities, the development of integrated agricultural, 
industrial, commercial and trade organizations, the acceleration 
of the transformation of government functions, the carrying out 
of structural reform and the establishment of social welfare 
systems as the focal points in the county-level comprehensive 
reforms. The various experimental-point counties can, in 
accordance with their own specific situations, proceed from 
their own realities, readjust the contents of reform and give 
prominence to reform focal points. The State Commission for 
Restructuring Economic System will select a number of 
comprehensive reform experimental-point counties, and then we 
and the relevant provinces and districts will jointly provide 
guidance for the specific experimental-point work, explore 
avenues, and guide the deepening of the comprehensive reform at 
the county level. 
  The State Commission for Restructuring Economic System is 
preparing to focus on the above-noted experimental points. Each 
area can also proceed from its own realities, set down some 
experimental-point projects and actively accumulate experiences 
in exploring new avenues for establishing a new structure. 
  This year's reforms are unprecedented in both their breadth 
and depth. In accordance with the new situation, we must 
further liberate our thought, change our concepts, unify our 
understanding, firmly strengthen and improve reform guidance, 
earnestly do well in building an economic restructuring 
contingent, and make proper arrangements for next year's reforms 
and grasp them tightly and well.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Planning 
Commission and the State General Administration of Taxation 
recently issued a "Circular Concerning Being Sure To Maintain 
the Stability of Commodity Prices After Tax Reform." 
  The circular says: Beginning 1 January this year, China is 
conducting a major reform in its tax system, which is an 
important measure for the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure. After the introduction of the new tax 
system, some taxpayers do not completely understand the system, 
believing that the practice of the value-added tax means to add 
17 percent or 13 percent for tax to the original prices. There 
are some taxpayers who avail themselves of the opportunities 
afforded by tax reform to gain windfall profits by jacking up 
prices. As a result, prices are pushed up and the price system 
becomes chaotic, causing dissatisfaction among the people. To 
guarantee correct implementation of the new tax system, avoid 
price increases, maintain the stability of the market, and 
ensure a stable livelihood of the people, the circular is hereby 
issued as follows: 
  1. The major goal of current tax reform, for the most part, 
is to convert product taxes and turnover taxes into value-added 
taxes. Generally speaking, the newly designed value-added tax 
rates will not increase the tax burden for enterprises. The tax 
rates under the former tax system were uneven; now they are 
simplified and unified as two categories. Consequently, the tax 
burden for many enterprises is fair or somewhat lower. However, 
tax burden for a small number of products has increased 
somewhat. Enterprises should assimilate an increased tax burden 
through changing their management mechanism, tapping inner 
potential, and increasing economic performance. Meanwhile the 
state should correspondingly adopt such measures as lowering 
income tax rates for enterprises and exempting state-owned 
enterprises from turning over their profits to the state for 
"two kinds of funds" [funds collected for construction of key 
energy and transport projects and funds for state budget 
regulation] so as to alleviate enterprises' burdens. Therefore, 
enterprises which do not experience increased tax burdens after 
the tax reform should not increase their prices; enterprises 
which enjoy a low tax burden by a fair margin should 
appropriately reduce their prices; and enterprises which 
experience increased tax burdens should, in principle, not 
increase their prices. Individual enterprises which are 
overwhelmed by their tax burden and need to increase their 
prices should have such changes approved by departments in 
charge of commodity prices. 
  2. At present, taxes are included in all current prices; 
that 
is, they are tax-included prices. 
  The formula enabling enterprises to change original 
tax-included prices to non-tax prices is as follows: 
  non-tax price = original tax-included price / (1 + 
value-added tax rate) 
  No taxpayers are allowed to add value-added tax or any other 
tax burden onto current prices. 
  3. Current factory prices, wholesale prices, and retail 
prices should not be increased because of the tax reform. 
Taxpayers should pay value-added taxes and other taxes or fees 
included in current prices. The current price (including tax) 
system should be conscientiously introduced to any commodities 
whose prices are set by the state (including maximum prices). 
In considering whether or not enterprises experience increased 
tax burdens, it is necessary to take many factors into 
consideration, such as reduction of taxes on purchased goods, 
reduction or exemption of "two kinds of fund" and income taxes, 
as well as cost-affected interests of loans for fixed assets. 
Without approval, no enterprises are allowed to readjust their 
prices. For commodities whose prices are regulated by market 
demand, enterprises should also try to maintain price stability 
in accordance with the abovementioned requirements. 
  4. For linking wholesale and retail prices of all consumer 
goods and capital goods, the rate of difference between prices 
for purchased goods and prices for sold goods (calculated on the 
basis of current tax-included prices) remain unchanged. Various 
tax burdens will be levied with or under such rates. No 
enterprises or units are allowed to increase such rates without 
authorization. 
  5. Departments in charge of commodity prices at all levels 
should strengthen their supervision over and check on prices. 
They should seriously deal with and immediately correct 
activities including unauthorized price increases for 
commodities whose prices are set by the state, price increase 
because of miscalculations due to a misunderstanding of the tax 
system, and availing oneself of the opportunities afforded by 
tax reform to gain windfall profits by jacking up prices. 
  6. Departments in charge of commodity prices and taxation in 
all localities should pay close attention to the market trend 
after the introduction of tax reform. They should also promptly 
report to the Administration of Commodity Prices under the State 
Planning Commission and the State General Administration of 
Taxation on newly emerging situations and problems as well as 
suggestions for their solutions. The State Planning Commission 
will hold a special meeting to study some issues concerning 
pricing policies after the tax reform.

<F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "An Important Law Governing Market </F>
Price Behavior"] 
  [Text] With approval of the State Council, the State 
Planning Commission has promulgated the "Regulations on Marking 
Prices for Commodities and Services." This is an important 
economic law for improving state macrocontrol, developing a 
market system, standardizing the practices of fixing prices, 
promoting open and fair trade, and safeguarding consumers' 
legitimate rights and interests. 
  Under the situation of the socialist market economy, 
reasonable market prices and market operation must be based on 
open, fair, and orderly market competition. At present, the 
market system is yet to be developed and trade regulations 
remain imperfect with the result that some businessmen demand 
exorbitant prices for their goods, cheat customers, and sell 
bogus goods. The situation in which the quality of goods does 
not agree with their prices is so serious that it has aroused 
strong resentment among the general public. According to the 
"Regulations," all enterprises, administrative and institutional 
units, and individuals must clearly mark prices for their 
commodities and services, transaction accounts must be settled 
in terms of knock-down prices, no goods shall sell at a price 
higher than the marked price and no surcharges shall be 
collected, specific items and prices must be listed on invoices, 
and punishment must be meted out to those businessmen and those 
units providing service which violate the "Regulations." The 
regulations will help increase the transparency of prices and 
make transactions more open. In this way, the malpractice of 
cheating customers with prices will be curbed to a certain 
degree, the market will be subject to supervision by the public, 
the legitimate rights and interests of consumers and operators 
will be safeguarded, and an open, fair, and orderly market 
competition will take shape. 
  With the deepening of the economic restructuring, prices for 
most commodities and services have been open to market forces 
and thus greatly increased the marketization of the economy. 
However, freeing prices does not mean the government will 
refuse to have anything more to do with the market. Rather, the 
government will exercise indirect and macro-control over the 
market by economic, legal, and necessary administrative means. 
Since the "Regulations" will keep the public aware of the 
process of fixing prices by producers and operators, they will 
help the government timely and accurately monitor market prices 
and thus formulate scientific macrocontrol measures, which will 
guide the operation of producers and operators in the right 
direction and effect a rational allocation of resources. In the 
meantime, the "Regulations" will also keep the public aware of 
the process of fixing service charges by administrative and 
institutional units so that the government will improve 
administration and put a end to unauthorized charges. 
  The enterprise is the main body of market competition and 
the 
core of market competition is price. Fixing prices in 
accordance with the "Regulations" will help enterprises have 
access to information about commodity prices so they will 
formulate correct price strategies for entering market 
competition. The "Regulations" will also enable enterprises to 
learn their strong points and weaknesses through competition in 
the market to improve management, increase efficiency, and 
develop the capacity to meet emergencies. 
  The "Regulations" provide consumers with a legal basis for 
safeguarding their rights and interests, enabling them to 
compare prices offered by different vendors, and to get good 
value for their money. Under the "Regulations," the broad 
masses of the people will supervise the practice of demanding 
prices for commodities and report any fraud to the government 
department concerned for investigation and punishment. 
  Governments and departments in charge of prices at all 
levels 
must conscientiously implement the regulations and work toward 
the point where when there is a law it is observed, enforcement 
is strict, and lawbreakers are prosecuted. All producers, 
operators, and units providing services must enhance their 
awareness of the need to abide by laws, consciously observe 
relevant rules and regulations, and set to others an example of 
observing discipline and abiding by the law. The broad masses 
of shoppers are expected to supervise implementation of the 
regulations. Let us make concerted efforts to implement these 
regulations to the letter to promote the formation of a market 
order featuring fair transactions and fair competition.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Rui (5618 3843) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--At the 
National Statistical Work Conference today, State Council Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua stressed that in today's rapidly changing 
society, statistical information is a yardstick of the national 
economy and social progress and that it is necessary to ensure 
that statistics are accurate, timely, comprehensive, and 
convenient and that accuracy takes precedence. 
  Zou Jiahua said: It is not very easy to ensure the accuracy 
of statistics. It is a rather serious phenomenon where, for 
their own advancement or transfer or for political honors or the 
material interests of a small group, leaders of some localities, 
departments, and units would carry out statistical tricks. Some 
even retaliated against statistical personnel who dared to 
uphold principles. It is necessary to tackle these negative and 
corrupt practices with party discipline and state law. 
  He said: The socialist market economy makes new demands on 
statistical work. Following the change in the form of the 
state's economic management from the previous tangible, 
microscopic, and direct management to intangible, macroscopic, 
and indirect management, the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council always encounters three questions in making 
macroeconomic policy decisions and in macroeconomic regulation 
and control: First, in what condition is the current national 
economy and social progression? Second, how are we going to 
regulate and control them if they are abnormal? Third, what 
will be the effects of the macroscopic regulatory and control 
measures? These three questions concern statistics at all 
times. Without timely and accurate information supplied by the 
statistical system and without their effective supervision, it 
is difficult to make correct policy decisions for the national 
economy. 
  Zou Jiahua said: In statistical work, we must break through 
traditional statistical concepts and further reform and open up. 
We should establish a statistical system that suits China's 
national conditions in keeping with the general laws of the 
market economy and by referring to the world's advanced 
statistical science and technology. It is necessary to 
radically reform statistical and surveying methods, develop 
partial survey methods, and actively promote the sample 
surveying method in particular. It is necessary to establish a 
system of statistical and survey methods which is based on 
periodic general surveys, whose main body is regular sample 
surveys and which uses major surveys, scientific calculations, 
and a small number of overall statistical reports in a 
comprehensive way. 
  Zou Jiahua also stressed: Cultivating and developing an 
information market and achieving the commercialization and 
industrialization of information is one of the main points in 
the development of a market system. Vigorously cultivating and 
developing a market in statistical information is a task which 
brooks no delay. Statistical departments must energetically 
promote the effective circulation of social and economic 
information and share it with society.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- China has made progress 
in reforming statistical work, and statistical organs at all 
levels throughout the country have attained new achievements in 
promoting statistical work into a social, industrial, 
commercial, and international practice. Statistical work is 
moving in the direction suitable to a socialist market economy. 
  As a key link to changing statistical work in compliance 
with 
a market economy, the experiment on establishing and improving a 
new national economic accounting system has evolved into the 
phase of practice, and the basic framework of accounting systems 
for the state and provinces has been preliminarily established. 
The "China National Economic Accounting System (Experimental 
Program)," which was developed and formulated in 1992, not only 
tallies with China's actual situation in developing a socialist 
market economy but also conforms to the international norms 
commonly practiced in the world. Compared to China's original 
accounting system, the new system has made new breakthroughs in 
the scope, contents, and methods of accounting. China will 
comprehensively transfer to the new accounting system in 1995. 
Statistical organs in all localities and departments have 
treated this reform as their central work, whereas the State 
Statistical Bureau and the overwhelming majority of provincial, 
regional, and municipal statistical bureaus have fully used all 
kinds of statistical data, including those held by departments 
in charge of various businesses at all levels, to complete the 
compilation of gross national product [GNP] and the form for it, 
the input-output table, the flow of funds accounts, the balance 
of international payments, and other basic accounting forms, 
thus laying a foundation for a complete transfer to the new 
system. 
  To meet the requirement of strengthening macroeconomic 
management, China has also studied and established relevant 
special statistical systems in carrying out statistical work. 
Together with the departments concerned, the State Statistical 
Bureau has formulated a program for improving the application of 
indexes to appraise and assess the industrial economy and a 
program for the trial computation of the quarterly GNP, in 
addition to having established the systems of industrial value 
added, sales, output value, a system for assessing and computing 
the economic efficiency of industrial enterprises, and a 
quarterly GNP accounting system. Meanwhile, to reflect in a 
timely manner the basic conditions in China's 
factors-of-production markets, the construction of development 
zones, and the development of trial state enterprise groups, the 
State Statistical Bureau also formulated the "system of 
synthetic statistical forms for factors-of-production markets 
and development zones" and the "system of statistical forms for 
trial state enterprise groups." The implementation of the new 
program using indexes to appraise and assess the economy has 
played a positive role in improving China's macroeconomic 
management and in correcting the tendency of pursuing an 
increase in output value alone and blindly competing with one 
another in terms of growth rates.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (XINHUA) -- China has made a big 
stride in reforming its statistical report system. Following 
the implementation of a new report system for state statistics 
this year, the State Statistical Bureau will, thanks to the new 
report system, be able to know the operation of the market 
economy from statistical information which it regularly collects 
from grass-roots statistical organs. The implementation of this 
new system signifies a transformation in China's statistical 
work; statistical work, which was adapted to a planned economy 
in the past, will now serve a market economy. 
  The State Statistical Bureau devised this new state 
statistical report system in line with the requirement for 
establishing a socialist market economic system and following 
the revision and simplification of various specialized 
statistical report systems and of various statistical targeting 
systems. This new statistical report system enabled the 
Statistical Bureau to carry out a major reform of the 
statistical targeting system; to unify standards in statistical 
work; to smooth out the relationship between specialized 
statistical departments; to correct the defects of 
compartmentalization and dislocation formed under a planned 
economic system which have long plagued specialized statistical 
departments; and to raise the level of standardization and the 
regularization of the statistical system as a whole. This new 
state statistical report system features eight sets of basic 
statistical report forms for enterprises, institutions, 
administrative units, and fixed-asset investment units, as well 
as relevant composite statistical report forms. To coordinate 
with the application of the new statistical report forms, the 
Statistical Bureau has also set standards for statistical 
investigation units, devised a "category and zip code" system 
for various trades and professions in the national economy, and 
formulated other statistical standards. 
  A statistics expert pointed out that marketing has been made 
the centerpiece of the target structure in the new state 
statistical report system and that the past emphasis on 
gathering information that reflected the speed of the generation 
of output value and output amount has now shifted to an emphasis 
that stresses the collection of information that reflects 
efficiency -- namely, an emphasis on collecting information on 
the relations between input and output, on exchange and 
distribution, on the accumulation of surpluses, on production 
and marketing, on people, on assets, and on goods. This kind of 
statistical report should help permit the better understanding 
of the operations of enterprises which are the main players in 
market transactions from the angle of macrodecision-making and 
macroeconomic regulation and control.

  [Text] Chinese leaders have ordered a nationwide campaign 
against fake statistics amid fears they may be growing out of 
touch with the precariously balanced economic situation. 
  Liu Chengxiang, of the State Statistical Bureau [SSB], said 
the order was given by a vice-premier, Zou Jiahua, at a meeting 
in Beijing last week. 
  Zou had called on the bureau to adhere to party discipline 
and state laws to solve what he called "negative, corrupt 
behaviour". 
  "Our leaders are worried that their ability to take signals 
from the economy this year may be hampered by fake statistics," 
Liu said. 
  Liu said retrospective analysis of gross domestic product 
growth figures was showing up about 2 percent of errors every 
year. Problems were worst in numbers from coastal areas and 
township enterprises, he said. 
  "Local officials know that others will judge the 
achievements 
of their political careers based on statistics," he said. "As a 
result, there are a lot of weaknesses showing up in our national 
statistical system." 
  Under-reporting of profits and tax revenues was another 
worry 
of the bureau this year after a new national tax-sharing system 
was introduced, he said. In other cases, excess paperwork was 
causing things to be counted twice by mistake. 
  In one recent case, a local forestry bureau reported it had 
planted 20,000 hectares of trees over the past five years when 
in fact the same 4,000 hectares had been repeatedly replanted 
after the seedlings kept dying from lack of proper care. 
Meanwhile, Beijing will rely more on the bureau this year than 
in the past to guide its macro policy, Liu said. 
  "The central government has asked us to start providing them 
with sample-based analysis and forecasts so that they can be 
more sensitive to the economic situation this year," he said. 
  The State Council had been told the growth rate was too 
high. 
In their January meeting with the State Council, SSB officials 
advised that growth was "a little too high," Liu said. 
  "We said that the growth rate so far this year will lead to 
inflation which urban people cannot bear," he said. 
  While Beijing's official targets for 1994 are 9 per cent GDP 
growth and 10 percent inflation, the SSB had already bumped up 
its internal estimates to 11 percent growth and more than 12 
percent inflation, he added.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Xiao Wu: "Inflation to Be Kept at </F>
'Acceptable' Level] 
  [Text] China will spare no effort to curb inflation and 
keep consumer prices "at a level acceptable to the public," a 
senior government official pledged yesterday. 
  "The rise in the cost of living this year will not surpass 
the growth in the people's per capita income," said Zhang Sai, 
General Director of the State Statistics Bureau. 
  Zhang released the government's final version of the 1993 
economic report, which contained statistics of every sector in 
the national economy . 
  He said this year the growth of China's Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) will slow down. 
  The government will work to cut fixed-assets investment and 
the money supply to prevent the economy from overheating. 
  Prices of consumer goods in the 35 largest cities already 
soared by 23.3 percent in January from the same month of last 
year. 
  This was attributed to the buying spree through the New Year 
and Spring Festival holidays. 
  Zhang said inflation will not reach any higher this year, 
but 
refused to disclose the exact inflation rate. 
  The government will strive to gradually defuse the 
inflationary pressure step by step this year, he added. 
  He called this a crucial task for achieving government 
economic targets. 
  "If the government doesn't take stern measures to avoid a 
runaway fixed-assets investment and keep the country's inflation 
at bay, we might see the re-emergence of an overheated economy, 
just like that at the end of 1988, the general director said. 
  Zhang also admitted a widening gap between rich and poor has 
appeared along with the economic boom. 
  Meanwhile, the disparities in economic development between 
the inland and coastal areas have also become more conspicuous. 
  This is not the ultimate goal of the government's economic 
development plan, he said. 
  The government has been encouraging one part of the 
population to become rich first through honest labour. 
  Relevant departments are now calling for trans-regional 
cooperation between inland provinces and eastern coastal areas 
in order to better tap economic potential. 
  On last year's agricultural production, Zhang said, peanut 
production topped the list with a year-on-year rise of 34.6 
percent. 
  But, production of cotton, rape seeds, sugar cane, beet, 
tobacco and cow milk all suffered setbacks. 
  Among industrial products, household refrigerators became 
the 
most popular item on the domestic market. The sector saw output 
grow by 28 percent from the previous year. 
  But the production of tractors had the poorest showing among 
China's industrial sectors in 1993, when the country turned out 
only 37,000 tractors, down 35.3 percent from the previous year.

<F P=106> [By reporter Cao Min: "Contract System Signs Up 30% of </F>
State Employees"] 
  [Text] Thirty percent of State employees now work under 
contract rather than the decades-old "iron rice bowl" system. 
  Contracts now stipulate duties, obligations and rights of 
both employees and the State. This encourages competition and 
motivates workers. 
  Of the 80 million workers in State firms, 23.3 million work 
under collective contracts, according to statistics from the 
Labour Ministry. 
  The ministry is urging more enterprises to sign workers to 
contracts in the future. 
  Despite this, there are no labour laws governing the 
contract 
system . 
  So a contract labour law is being drafted and will be 
submitted this month to the National People's Congress for 
examination and approval, said Dong Ping, a Labour Ministry 
official. 
  Although contract and lifelong "iron rice bowl" systems 
still 
co- exist in State firms, most new workers are hired under 
contract. 
  Some well-developed coastal cities like Shenzhen, Zhuhai and 
Yamen are encouraging all workers to be hired under the contract 
system. 
  In shanghai, China's largest industrial city, nearly 1.5 
million workers are under labour contracts, or 97.53 per cent of 
all employees in State firms. 
  At Shanghai No 5 Steel and Iron Plant, the trade union 
bargained for a collective contract for all the employees. 
  More enterprises are expected to follow suit, Dong said. 
  In East China's Shandong Province, 9,359 State firms 
switched 
to the contract system, employing 2 million labourers. 
  Several pilot cities--Anyang in Henan Province, Zhuzhou in 
Hunan, and Yancheng in Jiangsu--have signed all State workers to 
contracts. 
  And provinces such as Guangdong, Hainan, Jilin, Hebei and 
Liaoning are also expanding contract employment to all 
State-owned enterprises, Dong said. 
  It is still, however, in the experimental stage in remote 
and 
underdeveloped regions. 
  The contract system first began with new workers in some 
areas in 1986, and has been on a trial basis nationwide since 
1987. 
  Under the system, those working at full enthusiasm receive a 
pay raise. 
  Most State-owned enterprises have been revitalized by the 
new 
employment system, Dong claimed. 
  And workers have benefited as well. For instance, more 
workers now defend their own interests as stipulated in the 
contract. 
  Recently, an official survey conducted among 2,400 State 
workers found that about two-thirds favour the contract system. 
  Those surveyed said the greatest fears under contract are 
job 
stability and salary. 
  Some, especially those working at foreign-invested firms, 
complain they would be fired by their bosses too often.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jiling (1776 2623 3781)] </F>
  [Text] Nanjing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- While inspecting Jiangsu 
recently, Song Jian, State Councillor and the minister in charge 
of the State Science and Technology Commission, called on those 
who work in new and high technology development zones not only 
to attract foreign funds and import technologies but also to 
attach high importance to promoting the commercialization, 
industrialization, and internationalization of the domestic 
scientific and technological results and to accelerating the 
pace of the development of China's new and high technology 
industry. 
  Song Jian inspected new and high technology development 
zones 
in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou and new and high technology 
enterprises in the Torch Plan belt of Suzhou, Wuxi, and 
Changzhou from 11 to 17 February. He said that one of the 
conspicuous characteristics that comes from comparing a new and 
high technology development zone to an economic development zone 
is that the former places even more emphasis on the 
transformation of domestic scientific and technological results. 
He also noted the need to formulate more preferential policies 
and to provide better conditions for large and medium-sized 
enterprises, scientific research institutes, and colleges and 
universities to set up branches in the zone to carry out the 
large-scale production of new and high technology products. 
  Song Jian also spoke of the need to strive to upgrade 
industry's scientific and technological levels, to greatly raise 
productivity, and to help transform traditional industry into 
new and high technology industry. He said that because China's 
new and high technology industry is now in the beginning stage, 
it is essential for the development zone to provide a 
development base for this budding industry and to become an 
experimental and demonstration zone for establishing a new 
system. He called for promoting cooperation among large and 
medium-sized enterprises and scientific research institutes, and 
to give support to private scientific and technological 
enterprises and to big enterprise groups with an annual output 
value between 1 billion and 10 billion yuan, so that they will 
hold a big market share of the domestic market and compete on 
the international market. Song Jian held that the absorption of 
foreign capital and the import of foreign technologies are an 
important way to accelerate the development of China's new and 
high technology industry. He pointed out, however, the need to 
assimilate, master, and upgrade imported technologies so that 
they will help build China's superiority in technology. 
  To upgrade industry, Song Jian called for devoting efforts 
to 
train a large number of high-level and 
internationalization-minded scientists and technicians. He also 
called for the attracting of a number of doctorate and master's 
degree holders and foreign-trained scholars with strong 
technical backgrounds, commercial skills, and excellent foreign 
language proficiency to work at leading organs and management 
departments in the development zone.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Economic laws and 
regulations concerning foreign-funded companies China 
promulgated in recent years have effectively protected foreign 
companies' investments and businesses here. 
  This is the view shared by chief representatives of Beijing 
offices of nearly 20 foreign companies and heads of Sino-foreign 
joint ventures. 
  They said in a recent interview with XINHUA reporters that 
China's legislation in the economic sector had been much 
improved. 
  Statistics show that the Seventh National People's Congress 
[NPC] and its Standing Committee had passed 87 laws during its 
five-year term from 1989 to 1993, one fourth of which were on 
foreign investment in China, and last year, 15 of the 20 laws 
adopted by the Eighth NPC Standing Committee concerned the 
economy. 
  They also said that China attached great importance to 
protecting interests of foreign companies with laws and 
regulations. 
  Among the adopted laws, the Law of Sino-Foreign Cooperative 
Enterprises and Maritime Law of the People's Republic of China 
(PRC) are concerned with foreign companies' businesses in China, 
and a chapter of the corporate law was made specifically for 
foreign companies. 
  Besides, Law on the Inspection of Import and Export 
Commodities, Income Tax Law for Enterprises With Foreign 
Investments and Foreign Enterprises also defined rights and 
obligations of foreign companies in China, which are welcomed by 
foreign entrepreneurs and bankers. 
  Chun Song-chin, chief representative of the Beijing office 
of 
the Lucky-Goldstar International Corporation from the Republic 
of Korea, said that although China's legislative system needs to 
be further improved, the adoption of so many laws in such a 
short time is indeed an "amazing progress." 
  According to him, China has approved over 70,000 
foreign-funded companies last year, which account for half of 
the number China has approved in the last 15 years. 
  Many trans-national groups have come to China in recent 
years, he said, adding that foreigners have begun pursuing 
long-term development in China, rather than seeking short-term 
benefit as most of them did before. 
  Chun attributed this not only to the social stability, and 
the more open market, but also the improving legislation which 
makes foreigners feel safer in investing here. 
  Dick Liu, president of the Du Pont China Company, said that 
it is obvious that Chinese laws can protect foreign companies in 
China. 
  The patent law China passed in 1984 did not protect the 
patent of chemical products, he said. However, the new patent 
law put into operation in 1993 has included the protection of 
chemical products and agricultural chemicals. Thus the 
interests of foreign chemical enterprises like Du Pont will be 
further protected, he said. 
  Takeshi Kagami, the chief representative of the Beijing 
office of the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, 
expressed his hope that the Law on Commercial Banks, Law on the 
Central Bank, insurance law and the law of bills which are being 
prepared will be passed at an early date. 
  He said that he was confident that these coming laws will 
define clearly business spheres and status of foreign banks in 
China, and create better financial conditions for the 
development of foreign enterprises. 
  Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief Beijing representative of 
Germany's 
BASF Chemical Corporation, pointed out that as an international 
corporation with branches all over the world, one of his 
company's rules is to abide by laws of countries where its 
branches are located. 
  "So we are eager to know every law China has just passed," 
he 
said. "We hope that China could publish the English version of 
the laws as early as possible." 
  H. T. Kun, director of the public relations department of 
the 
AT&amp;T China Company, said that his company had established a 
special department to study the Chinese laws, and many other 
overseas business offices also do so.

<F P=106> [By Carol Pui-yee Lai] </F>
  [Text] Beijing will hear its first case of a computer 
software copyright infringement filed by a Hong Kong company. 
  The Hong Kong Broad Mind Computer Company (BMC) has filed a 
suit against Beijing Hai Wei Electronic Engineering Company and 
Beijing Hai Wei Computer Technology Company for pirating 
firmware of their CT110 Chinese and English terminal. 
  The hearing, scheduled to be held in Beijing's intellectual 
property court on Friday, will be the first case of this kind 
involving Hong Kong businessmen since China joined the Berne 
Convention. Beijing acceded to the Berne Convention for the 
Protection of Literary and Artistic Work and the Universal 
Copyright Convention in September 1992. 
  Sunny WS Cheung, BMC's managing director, said they 
discovered pirated versions of CT-110 when their mainland sales 
of CT-110 dropped from 5,000 in 1988 to only several hundred in 
recent years. 
  They could not take action in 1989 because there was no 
relevant legislation to protect against computer software 
piracy. But in October 1991, Beijing started to implement a 
regulation to protect computer software copyright. BMC then 
registered in Beijing their CT 110B software, which was an 
upgraded version of the original CT-110. Yang Shaokun, managing 
director of the Hai Wei company, said he was confident the 
judiciary would be impartial. 
  He said BMC knew Hai Wei produced CT-110 as early as 1989 
and 
they did not take action at that time. The usual statute of 
limitations for filing a civil law suit in China is two years. 
  While BMC said they could provide evidence to prove they 
were 
the original owner of CT110, Cheung said he was worried Beijing 
would intervene administratively in the case. The U.S.-based 
Business Software Alliance last week named China as one of the 
world's main offenders against intellectual property rights. 
  And the vice-chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce, Steven 
Senderling, last week said China's growing counterfeiting 
problem could jeopardise its attempt to enter the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and he blamed a lack of 
enforcement.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA)--Our country's nonferrous 
metals industry scored brilliant achievements last year: The 
output of 10 common nonferrous metals reached 3.268 million 
metric tons, thus surpassing the output target of nonferrous 
metals industry on the "third high plane" two years in advance. 
  In our country, experts from the nonferrous metals industry 
are used to setting every million metric ton of annual output of 
nonferrous metals as an output target. Last year, the annual 
output of our country's nonferrous metals industry exceeded 3 
million metric tons, which implies that China's nonferrous 
metals industry has advanced its production forces and technical 
standards to another new level. 
  Nonferrous metals, which have a wide application, are 
important resources for economic construction. As far as the 
electric industry is concerned, 800 metric tons of 
copper-aluminum are needed to generate every 10,000 kw of power; 
whereas 90 percent of structural materials of aircraft are 
aluminum-magnesium alloy. For quite a long period after the 
founding of new China, our country's nonferrous metals were 
treated as important strategic resources and the nonferrous 
metals industry was treated as a classified industry. At that 
time, information on the production and consumption of 
nonferrous metals was considered a secret, and the nonferrous 
metals industry developed slowly. In 1978, the output of our 
country's nonferrous metals was 996,000 metric tons, which had 
trouble meeting the needs of state construction. The nonferrous 
metals industry became a "bottleneck" industry which hindered 
the development of our national economy and society. 
  Our country's nonferrous metals industry has achieved 
unprecedented large-scale development since China's National 
Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation was founded in 1983. 
Over the past 11 years, our country's nonferrous metals 
industry achieved 2 million metric tons of net output increase 
and also doubled or redoubled taxes, fixed assets, and profits 
retained by enterprises. 
  The brilliant achievements can be attributed to reform and 
opening up. It was precisely during the 15 years of reform and 
opening up that our country's nonferrous metals industry 
achieved rapid development. Up to 1988, the output of 
nonferrous metals surpassed the "second high plane" of 2 million 
metric tons, and, during this period, the output showed an 
annual average increase of 7.5 percent. On the other hand, only 
five years were spent moving from the "second high plane" to the 
"third high plane" of 3 million metric tons of annual output, 
with the annual average increase at 10 percent. Apart from 
output increase, the variety structure has also been optimized, 
and a more rapid development of varieties which have great 
market demand, such as aluminum and zinc, has been achieved. 
When the output of our country's nonferrous metals reached 1 
million metric tons, aluminum accounted for 30 percent, and zinc 
accounted for 20 percent. In 1993, the proportion of aluminum 
and zinc increased to 38 percent and 23 percent respectively. 
  In the 1990's, China National Nonferrous Metals Industry 
Corporation has accelerated the pace of bringing enterprises to 
the market. At present, products which are priced according to 
the state plan only account for 1.5 percent of the total output; 
almost all products have entered the market; and the domestic 
and international markets have basically been merged into a 
single whole. Moreover, the China National Nonferrous Metals 
Industry Corporation took the first step by setting up our 
country's first metal exchange in Shenzhen. 
  In particular, it is worth mentioning that, apart from the 
10 
percent increase in output last year over that of the previous 
year, our country's nonferrous metals industrial sector also 
fully implemented the "three systems" reform in its subsidiary 
enterprises and vigorously called for "diversification with one 
business at the core." As a result, 10 percent of the total 
personnel of the whole industry were transferred to other trades 
and professions, and labor productivity was improved by 11 
percent. People from economic circles consider that this 
phenomenon has major practical significance. 
  Fei Ziwen, president of the China National Nonferrous Metals 
Industry Corporation, said a few days ago that our country's 
nonferrous metals industry is now deliberating a major reform: 
The Corporation will turn over the function of administering 
the industry to a professional association, which is currently 
being organized, and will carry out the experiment of setting up 
state holding companies. It was learned that the professional 
association of China's nonferrous metals industry is expected to 
be founded during the first half of this year. The professional 
association, which nonferrous metals institutions and 
enterprises are going to join on a voluntary basis, will be a 
legal person which is an institution in nature and which will 
act as an intermediary between the government and enterprises. 
The government will entrust the professional association to 
administer the industry. When the professional association is 
officially founded, the China National Nonferrous Metals 
Industry Corporation will go all out to run economic entities 
properly and will no longer administer the industry.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Council's 
circular on "paying serious attention to spring plowing," which 
was issued today, points out: It is now the busiest season for 
spring plowing. People's governments at all levels should take 
emergency action to conscientiously carry out various rural 
economic policies, continue to lighten the peasants' burdens, 
further mobilize the peasants' initiative in production, lose no 
time in making preparations for spring plowing, and work 
assiduously to strive for another bumper harvest in agriculture 
this year. 
  The circular says: Last year, a relatively good harvest was 
reaped in agriculture, and comprehensive development was 
attained in the rural economy, with grain yields rising to the 
new level of 450 billion kg. This has exercised an important 
role in increasing effective supplies of agricultural products 
and promoting national economic development. This year, we 
should seize the good opportunity to carry out in-depth reform, 
make further efforts to intensify agriculture and rural work, 
and initiate an exceptionally favorable situation in rural 
areas. At present, spring plowing is being gradually carried 
out from south to north, so that it is time to make full 
preparations for spring plowing in the north as well. People's 
governments at all levels and the various departments concerned 
must enhance their awareness of the urgency and must seriously 
do a good job of preparations and spring plowing. 
  To this end, the State Council has set the following demands 
in its circular: 
  1. Acquire a clearer understanding and take the preparation 
work and spring plowing very seriously. This year, the 
principal tasks of rural work include: Developing the rural 
economy, increasing the peasants' income, and ensuring effective 
supplies in the market. These are arduous tasks. In order to do 
rural work well this year, it is of vital importance to ensure 
the smooth implementation of various reform measures, maintain a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy [as received] development in the 
national economy, and maintain social stability. With regard to 
the current rural work, it is necessary to concentrate efforts 
on making proper preparations and organizing the appropriate 
manpower for spring plowing so as to lay a solid foundation for 
the steady increase of output of the major agricultural 
products, including grain, cotton, edible oil, and so on, as 
well as products from the "shopping basket" project. As the 
whole year's work depends on a good start in spring, people's 
governments at all levels and the various departments concerned 
should, under the new situation of establishing a socialist 
market economic structure, further deepen their understanding, 
intensify the position of agriculture as a foundation, and take 
the preparation work and spring plowing seriously to avoid 
bungling the farming season. 
  2. Strengthen leadership and ensure that various policies 
are put into practice. The crux of taking firm control of 
spring plowing this year lies in the serious attention paid by 
the leading cadres and the actual implementation of various 
policies. At present, it is necessary to urgently carry out the 
various policies formulated by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, the central rural work conference, 
and the national work meeting on the "shopping basket" project 
as well as grain, cotton, and edible oil. We must resolve 
practical problems which crop up in the course of policy 
implementation and ensure that various state policies to foster 
agriculture are put into practice. People's governments at all 
levels should concentrate their energies on strengthening 
leadership in spring plowing. The various departments concerned 
should clearly understand their responsibility, perform their 
duties properly, and enthusiastically give assistance and 
support to agriculture. It is necessary to enlist cadres to go 
deep into the grass-roots level to resolve various practical 
problems in spring plowing in a timely manner. Leading cadres 
at prefectural (city) and county levels should personally work 
on the front line of production in these crucial times in order 
to become acquainted with the real conditions there and resolve 
any problems. 
  3. Give positive guidance and concentrate efforts on 
ensuring sufficient grain and cotton acreage. The effort to 
maintain stability in the farming area of bulk agricultural 
products such as grain, cotton, and others, which have a bearing 
on the national economy and people's livelihood, is a task of 
primary importance for spring farming this year. Governments at 
all levels must adopt vigorous measures to encourage peasants to 
boost production in grain, cotton, edible oil, and other 
agricultural products through various forms. In both producing 
and marketing areas, the increase of grain and cotton output 
must be placed in a significant position. Under the precondition 
of ensuring stabilized acreage for grain and cotton, efforts 
should also be made to rationally readjust structure and layout 
so as to enhance economic results. People's governments in the 
cotton producing areas along the Huang He, the Huai He, and the 
Hai He should try every possible means to guide peasants in 
growing more cotton and ensure that the existing fallow land 
[chun bai di 2504 4101 0966] and reserved cotton fields are 
properly grown, while cotton producing areas in the Chang Jiang 
valley and Northwest China should try their best to increase 
cotton acreage. An inspection on ensuring sufficient grain and 
cotton acreage should be carried out immediately in various 
localities so that the work is conducted according to plan. In 
the meantime, field management for grain and oil-bearing crops 
should be reinforced, and various measures for increasing output 
should be intensified to ensure that another bumper harvest in 
grain and edible oil will be reaped this summer. 
  4. Make overall planning and develop the rural economy in a 
comprehensive way. During the spring plowing, it is necessary 
to make overall planning while giving prominence to key points, 
keep in mind the goal of increasing the peasants' income, 
organize rural economic work in a comprehensive way, make proper 
arrangements for spring afforestation, vigorously develop animal 
husbandry and aquiculture, increase the output and supply of 
"shopping basket" products, lead township and town enterprises 
in their robust and healthy development, and so on. To achieve 
the above aims, it is necessary to make comprehensive 
arrangements and conscientiously put them into effect. 
  5. Provide better services to agriculture and do a good job 
of supplying adequate agricultural means of production, loans, 
and so on. All trades and professions should increase their 
awareness of serving agriculture and conscientiously perform 
various tasks to serve agriculture. It is necessary to 
stabilize the organs that disseminate agricultural science and 
technology and the contingent of agricultural scientific and 
technological personnel, vigorously disseminate improved 
varieties, and popularize advanced and applicable agricultural 
production technology. As regards the production and transfer 
of agricultural means of production, fertilizer in particular, 
the State Council has set explicit demands, and various 
departments and local governments at all levels should really 
take up responsibility to put them into effect. The departments 
in charge of material supplies and marketing should provide 
peasant households with the necessary chemical fertilizer, 
pesticides, plastic film, diesel oil, and farming implements. 
Departments in charge of water resources should take firm 
control of building water conservancy projects in spring and 
continue to enlist the masses in the construction of irrigation 
works. The departments in charge of agricultural machinery 
should step up their work in organizing the overhauls, repairs, 
transfers, and experiments of farming machines. In various 
localities, the masses should be mobilized to collect farmyard 
manure, publicize the application of mixed manure, spread 
fertilizer deep into the earth, and popularize other effective 
techniques to economize on fertilizer and increase soil 
fertility. The departments in charge of commodity prices and 
administrations for industry and commerce should intensify their 
supervision over the markets of agricultural production means, 
strictly check arbitrary price rises, resolutely crack down on 
the production and marketing of forged and inferior goods, and 
safeguard the peasants' legitimate rights and interests. 
  6. Make proper arrangements of the masses' lives and 
production in impoverished and disaster-hit areas. Governments 
at all levels must guarantee the supply of grain to the masses 
in impoverished and disaster-hit areas so that grain will not be 
out of supply in these areas under any circumstances. To 
counter the situation of spring crop failure in a small number 
of disaster-hit areas, the state has arranged 1 billion kg from 
the special reserved grain to overcome the masses' grain 
shortage in these areas. At the same time, various localities 
must arrange a certain quantity of relief grain and organize the 
transfer and supply of such relief grain in a conscientious 
manner. Special consideration should be given to the peasant 
households who are short of money and grain. The supply of 
materials and funds necessary for the preparation work of spring 
plowing should be meticulously organized for the masses in the 
areas encountering spring crop failure, and the people's ability 
to combat disasters and provide for and help themselves in the 
disaster-hit and impoverished areas should be augmented.

<F P=106> ["Speech" by Wen Jiabao, CPC Central Committee Secretariat </F>
member, delivered while inspecting rural work in Jiangxi 
Province, late November 1993: "Strive To Create a New Situation 
in Agriculture and Rural Work"] 
  [Text] The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee was another important meeting in the history of our 
party. "The Decision By the CPC Central Committee on Several 
Questions Concerning the Building of the Socialist Market 
Economy Structure" (the "Decision") adopted at the meeting has 
followed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, concretized and systematized the 
goals and basic principles on building the socialist market 
economy structure set at the 14th CPC National Congress, 
constructed the basic framework of the socialist market economy 
structure, and formulated the general program for the reform of 
the economic structure. It is a program for actions to carry 
out the reform of the economic structure and to speed up 
economic development from the present to the end of the century. 
It is of great practical significance and farreaching 
historical significance to the reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization in our country. The "Decision" has regarded rural 
reform as its important part and put it in a very important 
position. This is because the development of the socialist 
market economy needs a firm agricultural foundation and 
deepening rural reform is an important part of building the 
socialist market economy structure. We should seriously 
implement the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and the guidelines of the central 
rural work conference, strive to open up a new situation in 
agriculture and rural work, and push the reform and development 
in rural areas to a new stage. This is of very great importance 
to smoothly attaining the goal of building the socialist market 
economy structure and to fulfilling the strategic task of the 
national economy and social development in the 1990's. 
<H3>  I. Concerning the Present Situation in Agriculture and 
Rural Areas </H3>
  Guided by the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the 
agriculture and rural economies of China have entered a new 
period of development and the general situation of the rural 
areas is good. In particular, since General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin convened the rural work forum of six southern provinces in 
Wuhan and Premier Li Peng convened the national television and 
telephone meeting on agricultural work in Beijing at the end of 
last year, a new turning point has emerged in agriculture and 
rural work. This is prominently expressed in: First, all 
promissory notes for payment in the procurement of agricultural 
products have been cashed and virtually no more promissory notes 
have been issued in the procurement of agricultural products 
this summer and autumn; second, the central authorities and 
local governments have taken resolute measures to reduce the 
peasants' burden and have attained evident good results; third, 
since the central authorities began to strengthen 
macroregulation and control, the situation whereby large 
quantities of land are not used for farming and large amounts of 
funds are flowing out of the rural areas has taken a turn for 
the better; and fourth, leadership at all levels has attached 
greater importance to agriculture and has changed the phenomenon 
of neglecting agriculture which had emerged. Therefore, the 
situation in agriculture this year is better than was expected 
at the beginning of the year. 
  However, we must be aware of problems such as lowering the 
comparable efficiency of agricultural production, particularly 
grain production; the widening price scissors of industrial and 
agricultural products; and the slow growth in peasants' income, 
have not yet been fundamentally solved. In the course of 
promoting reform, there are many new situations and new problems 
in agriculture and rural work which we have to study and solve. 
We should, through implementing the "Decision" by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
guidelines of the central rural work conference, earnestly solve 
the existing problems and further develop the favorable rural 
situation. 
<H3>  II. Concerning Stabilizing the Party's Basic Policies for 
Rural Areas </H3>
  In leading the practice of rural reform, our party has 
gradually formed a series of basic policies. The Eighth Plenary 
Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee systematically summed 
up these policies. There are nine major ones. The most 
important ones are implementing the responsibility system, with 
the household contract responsibility system on a household 
basis with remuneration linked to output as the dominant factor, 
and the two-tier operational system integrating centralization 
with decentralization; persisting in regarding public ownership 
as the dominant factor and developing various economic 
compositions at the same time; not relaxing grain production, 
energetically developing diversified management, and supporting 
and guiding the healthy development of township and town 
enterprises; gradually removing restrictions on agricultural 
products markets and using various channels for circulation; and 
encouraging some localities and some people to become rich 
earlier than others through honest labor and lawful operation in 
a bid to eventually attain common prosperity, and so on. These 
policies, which have been tested in practice for more than 10 
years, are proving to be completely correct. They conform to 
the three standards put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the 
reality of agriculture and rural work in our country, and the 
desires of the broad masses of peasants. The 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee explicitly put forward that these policies must remain 
stable for a long time to come and should be constantly improved 
in practice. 
  From the very beginning, the party's various basic policies 
for rural areas are characteristic of their market orientation: 
First, they give the peasants the right to make their own 
decisions on production and management to arouse the enthusiasm 
of the broad masses of peasants; second, they enable agriculture 
and the rural economy to enter the market and give play to the 
role of market mechanism; and third, they strengthen protection 
and service for agriculture and stabilize agriculture's position 
as the foundation. The rural reform based on these basic 
policies is, in fact, the successful practice of building the 
new socialist market economy structure in rural areas. 
Therefore, stabilizing and improving the party's basic policies 
in rural areas are important parts of the building of the 
socialist market economy structure. We should have a thorough 
understanding of this. 
<H5>  III. Concerning Deepening the Rural Reform </H5>
  Some problems which have cropped up in the development of 
agriculture and the rural economy should be solved mainly 
through carrying out reform. At present, in implementing the 
"Decision" and the guidelines of the central rural work 
conference and in deepening the rural reform, it is necessary to 
seriously and properly grasp three aspects of work. First, on 
the basis of stabilizing the contract responsibility system on a 
household basis with remuneration linked to output, promote an 
optimized distribution of rural economic resources and the 
rational flow of production essentials in order to arouse the 
enthusiasm of peasants and various kinds of rural economic 
organizations, raise labor productivity, and improve the 
efficiency of the utilization of resources. Therefore, the 
"Decision" and the central rural work conference stipulated: 
While upholding the prerequisite of collective ownership, the 
period for farmland contracts should be extended, the 
inheritance of contracted management rights of production 
projects of a development nature should be permitted, and the 
transfer with compensation of the land utilization rights should 
be permitted; in a few localities where the economy is 
relatively developed, various forms such as the transfer of 
contracts and buying shares can be adopted to develop management 
to an appropriate scale while adhering to the principle of 
voluntary participation by the masses. These stipulations are 
of great significance to improving the land contract system and 
to raising labor productivity in agriculture and the output rate 
of land. Second, develop the rural market, invigorate rural 
economic circulation, and adopt various ways to link the 
scattered production and management of thousands upon thousands 
of households with a unified market. Make great efforts to 
develop the agricultural products market and to develop markets 
for various production essentials, such as land, manpower, and 
funds, in a bid to gradually form a complete market system. In 
the course of building and perfecting the rural market system, 
stress should be laid on the development of various intermediate 
organizations which link the peasant households with the market. 
Many good forms, such as the integration of commerce, industry, 
and agriculture; making production, processing, and marketing a 
coordinated process; and companies helping peasant households, 
have existed in Jiangxi. These management organizations and 
management methods have broken the limits of ownership, 
departments, and localities, and have linked the peasant 
households with the market, cities with rural areas, and 
production and circulation with consumption. They have powerful 
vitality and we should energetically give them support and speed 
up their development. Third, build a system for the government 
to guide, support, protect, regulate, and control agriculture. 
This is determined by the characteristics of agriculture itself 
and is also an objective demand in developing the socialist 
market economy in rural areas. The building of a social service 
system for agriculture is an important guarantee to promoting 
the specialization, commercialization, and socialization of 
agriculture. The peasants have an urgent demand for such a 
system and we must make great efforts to do a good job in this 
respect. 
<H3>  IV. Concerning Solutions to Conspicuous Problems in the 
Development of Agriculture and the Rural Economy </H3>
  The most conspicuous problem at present is grain and cotton 
production. The central rural work conference focused its 
attention on studying this problem and put forward some 
solutions to it. First, increase the comparable economic results 
in grain and cotton production, increase the peasants' income 
from grain and cotton production, further arouse the peasants' 
enthusiasm in production, and ensure a steady growth in the 
output of grain and cotton. Second, establish central and local 
grain risk funds and a reserve regulation system to ensure an 
ample supply of grain, stabilize market grain prices within a 
rational range, and protect the interests of the peasants and 
the consumers. Third, make great efforts to support the 
economic development of main grain and cotton producing areas. 
Main grain and cotton producing areas should stabilize grain 
and cotton growing areas, increase the multiple crop index and 
per unit area yield, rationally readjust the production setup, 
develop diversified management and township and town 
enterprises, in particular, do a good job in the processing 
industry for agricultural and sideline products, taking the road 
of development of integrating production growth with increase in 
value through transformation. Efforts should be concentrated on 
giving support to major counties which produce commodity grain 
and cotton and the building of production bases should continue 
to be strengthened. All localities and departments should 
firmly grasp the formulation of implementation methods and 
organize people to implement them as soon as possible. 
  Grain is of great importance and has a bearing on the 
national economy and the people's livelihood, social stability, 
and state security. New problems cropped up in grain production 
and circulation should be seriously dealt with and properly 
solved and should not be treated lightly. In studying and 
solving these problems, we must proceed from the national 
conditions of our country and from reality. Our country has a 
large population and not much farmland. The comprehensive 
production capacity of agriculture, that of grain in particular, 
is not great and the capability of resisting natural disasters 
is not great either. The development in different localities is 
uneven and there are localities which do not have sufficient 
grain, even in provinces and regions which produce much grain. 
The formation of a unified and orderly grain market system has 
not yet been completed. Some external conditions for grain 
production and management, such as the supply of the means of 
production and the storage and transportation of grain, need 
further improvement. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the 
steady growth of grain output over a long period to come. At 
the same time, it is necessary, through deepening reform, to 
gradually and properly put the purchase and marketing structure 
in order and correctly handle the relationship between grain 
producing localities and marketing localities, the relationship 
between grain and other cash crops, the relationship between the 
domestic market and the regulation of imports and exports, and 
the relationship between the present and the future. In short, 
it is necessary to implement correct policies for grain 
production and management which are conducive to the development 
of grain production, the stability of the grain market, and the 
protection of the interest of the peasants and the consumers. 
<H3>  V. Concerning the Development of Productive Forces in Rural 
Areas </H3>
  Concentrating efforts on the development of productive 
forces 
in rural areas is the central task in the party's rural work. 
It is necessary to strengthen the construction of water 
conservancy work, popularize practical technology for 
agriculture, and strengthen the material and technological 
foundations for agriculture. It is necessary to gear 
readjustment of the agriculture product mix and the production 
setup in rural areas to market and to make great efforts to 
develop high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency 
agriculture and develop township and town enterprises and other 
nonagricultural industries. Jiangxi has put forward two main 
tasks in the development of the rural economy and we can say 
such tasks are of universal significance. One of them is 
development, the development of agriculture, the development of 
various kinds of nonagricultural industries, and the development 
of products. Many localities have made full use of local 
resources to carry out a series of developments so that 
production and management have developed to a considerable 
scale, have developed into industries, and have effectively 
promoted the development of the rural economy. The other is to 
continue the development of the township and town enterprises. 
The "Decision" and the central rural work conference have fully 
affirmed that township and town enterprises are an important 
part of the rural economy and have put forward principles and 
measures to guide and assist township and town enterprises to 
develop healthily. It is necessary, through deepening reform, 
to blaze new paths in the property rights system and the ways of 
management of township and town enterprises in order to further 
increase their vitality. It is necessary to develop mainstay 
industries and best-selling products, increase production to a 
considerable scale, improve economic results, and to increase 
competitive power. It is necessary to guide township and town 
enterprises into becoming appropriately concentrated, fully 
transform and utilize existing small cities and towns, develop 
new cities and towns, and integrate the development of township 
and town enterprises with the construction of small cities and 
towns. 
  Reform means the liberation and development of productive 
forces. "Development is the last word." It is necessary to 
concentrate efforts on developing productive forces so that the 
rural economy can develop to a higher level. 
<H3>  VI. Concerning Strengthening Agriculture's Foundation 
Position </H3>
  The "Decision" and the central rural work conference 
stressed 
the necessity to readjust the structure of the national economy, 
readjust its distribution pattern, increasing the percentage to 
be used in agriculture, of investment in the capital 
construction of the state, funds included in the financial 
budget, and credit funds. The central authorities have put 
forward that, in formulating the state credit plan, it is 
necessary to ensure the growth rate of agricultural loans is 
more than two percentage points over the growth rate of other 
loans and that, in the additional bank loans next year, the 
percentage of loans for agriculture should be increased to more 
than 10 percent and the percentage of financial input into 
agriculture should also be increased. Not only the central 
authorities but also local governments should act in this way. 
  In readjusting the economic structure, the important thing 
is to readjust the ratio between industry and agriculture. 
Comrade Mao Zedong put forward this issue in his speech "On the 
Ten Major Relationships" a long time ago. The experience of 
several decades has proved that if the structure is rational and 
the agricultural foundation is stable, the development of 
industry and the economy will have a favorable environment; and, 
if the structure is irrational, agriculture shrinks and the 
agricultural foundation is unstable and industry, even the 
entire national economy, will be affected. At present, an 
important factor affecting industrial production is the market. 
The stockpiling of products in some industrial enterprises is 
because the market, the rural market in particular, has not 
opened up. The market in China has a great potential and such 
potential lies mainly in rural areas. If agriculture is not 
developed, and if the peasants' purchasing power is not 
increased, industry will not have the necessary raw materials 
and a broad market. We should understand this truth. 
  Readjusting the economic structure and properly handling the 
ratio between industrial and agricultural production is an issue 
to which we should pay attention for a long time to come. For 
decades, we have repeatedly come across this issue. In the 
course of building the socialist market economy structure, it is 
all the more necessary to attach importance to the issue. The 
development of agriculture and the rural economy has to meet the 
needs of the market economy but, on the other hand, in the 
course of building the market economy structure it is necessary 
to strengthen support and protection for agriculture. 
Agriculture is the kind of production which produces great 
social benefits but few benefits for itself and which has a 
relatively weak foundation and needs special support and 
protection from the government. All developed countries act in 
this way. To ensure that agriculture's foundation position 
remains unshaken, we must increase input in agriculture and 
strengthen support and protection for agriculture. 
<H3>  VII. Concerning Strengthening the Building of Spiritual 
Civilization in Rural Areas </H3>
  It is necessary to uphold the principle of grasping with 
both 
hands, and grasping firmly with both hands, strengthen the 
building of the socialist spiritual civilization in rural areas, 
strengthen the building of rural grass-roots organizations with 
party branches as the cores and the building of democracy and 
the legal system, and strengthen the building of grass-roots 
political power and the building of the contingent of rural 
cadres. It is necessary to frequently carry out education on 
patriotism, socialism, and collectivism among peasants; 
eradicate feudal superstition, outmoded conventions, and bad 
customs; oppose extravagance and waste; encourage 
industriousness and thriftiness in managing a household; and 
display the spirit of mutual help and friendship. At present, 
the peasants are highly critical about social order. It is 
necessary to strengthen comprehensive management of social order 
and crack down sternly on train bandits and road scoundrels, on 
illegal activities which damage the peasants' interest and 
undermine production, and on kidnapping children and women. It 
is necessary to strengthen guidance to rural cultural life. In 
films, television, music, operas, literature, and paintings, it 
is necessary to create more works loved by peasants. Literature 
and art performance troupes should regularly go to rural areas 
to give performances for peasants and should strive to enrich 
peasants' cultural lives. 
  At present, to properly implement the guidelines of the 
Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
central rural work conference, it is necessary to depend on two 
things: The first is to depend on party organizations at all 
levels. It is necessary to pay attention to protecting the 
enthusiasm of rural grass-roots cadres, raising their 
ideological level and enhancing their understanding of policy, 
and encouraging them to work creatively. Party organizations at 
the provincial, prefectural, county, and township levels should 
put implementation of the guidelines of the two meetings on 
their agendas and make concrete arrangements. It is necessary 
to put forward our own targets, plans, and methods for 
implementation in accordance with the principles, goals, and 
planning put forward by the "Decision" and closely in light of 
local reality. The other is to depend on the masses of people. 
It is necessary to disseminate the guidelines of the "Decision" 
and the central rural work conference among the broad masses of 
peasants. It is necessary to be good at using lively and vivid 
methods and simple, easy to understand language to relay to 
peasants the guidelines of the central authorities. 
  In the course of changing over to the socialist market 
economy structure, many things in agriculture need studying and 
many problems needs solving. The responsibility of rural work 
is very heavy and it is necessary to strengthen the party's 
leadership over rural work. The broad masses of cadres who have 
taken up rural work, the leading cadres in particular, should 
seriously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, study a series of expositions by Comrade Xiaoping 
concerning agricultural development and rural reform, and 
strengthen the consciousness of adhering to the party's basic 
line and implementing the party's various principles and 
policies for rural areas. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress, and under the correct leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, united as one, 
work hard, strive to properly carry out various kinds of rural 
work, and promote rural reform and rural economic development.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- China has decided to 
step up the development of rural enterprises in its inland 
provinces as part of an effort to narrow the gap between their 
economy and that of coastal regions. 
  The country's central bank, the People's Bank of China, will 
allocate special funds every year till the year 2000 as low 
interest loans for these areas to develop township enterprises. 
  This was revealed here today by He Kang, vice-chairman of 
the 
Chinese Association for Science and Technology (CAST) at a CAST 
national conference. 
  They will also be given priority in using other loans from 
banks, or encouraged to raise funds through issuing shares, said 
the vice- chairman, who was formerly minister of agriculture. 
  Economic and technological cooperation between the inland 
provinces and coastal regions is to be enhanced in terms of 
selling of technology, jointly venturing and raw material 
processing, he said. 
  Other programs include developing rural towns and trade with 
bordering countries, he disclosed. 
  "Though these places suffer from the inconvenience of 
transportation, they have a long border line, on which they may 
rely to enter foreign markets," He Kang said. 
  "With both foreign markets and home markets accessible, the 
inland provinces could better allocate resources." 
  But the rural enterprises in the inland provinces, covering 
80 percent of China's territory and having 65 percent of the 
country's 800 million farmers, get a smaller slice of the cake 
than their coastal counterparts. 
  He Kang said that the inland areas have advantages of rich 
natural resources, abundant labor and considerable market 
potential. 
  "With support by the central government, aid from the 
eastern 
areas and avid expectations of their people, the rural 
enterprises in the inland provinces will be quickly developed 
and the whole economy will step further," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- More than one-third of 
Beijing's landspace has been covered with trees and grass, 
officials said here today. 
  At a meeting here today, officials from the municipal 
government said that Beijing's green coverage rate has reached 
33.58 percent due to the efforts of all residents, specially the 
many outstanding afforestation workers, who were commended at 
the meeting. 
  Beijing aims to uplift its green coverage rate by one 
percent 
annually to reach 40 percent by 2000, a goal announced by Mayor 
Li Qiyan last year. 
  Last year, Beijing enlarged its urban grassland by 541 ha 
[hectares] and planted trees on some 17,000 ha of mountainous 
areas. And more trees were planted along roads and around 
villages.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Peasants have been thrown into confusion since 
Beijing flooded the grain markets with reserves from state 
granaries last December, according to a top provincial official. 
  "Now they don't know what to plant. At first prices rose, 
but then the granaries were opened and they got more confused," 
the assistant governor of Sichuan province, Xu Zhongmin, said. 
  Wheat prices have fallen 5 percent in Sichuan since the 
state 
intervened to ensure supplies of cheap food in the cities, Xu 
said. 
  "There is a limit to what the city people can stand. But at 
some point you've got to consider the interests of farmers and 
how to spark their enthusiasm." 
  Speaking after a weekend seminar in Shenzhen, Xu admitted 
stability remained a problem among Sichuan's 90 million peasants. 
  "Their mood is relatively stable now, but we're still taking 
measures to resolve problems which cropped up," he said. 
  Last June peasants in Renshou county, south of Chengdu, 
rioted over fees imposed on them to build a new road. Beijing 
subsequently criticised Sichuan leaders for their failure to pay 
adequate attention to the rural situation. 
  "We've fired a whole bunch of cadres in Renshou since then, 
and told the rest to change their impatient and harsh approach 
to dealing with the farmers," Xu said. 
  "This wasn't a big thing--there were only about four or five 
people who created the disturbance--but it caught the attention 
of the central government and that made it important." 
  Efforts to hold extra fees charged by local governments to 
within 5 percent of incomes had been "basically successful", he 
said. 
  Of the five phrases that make up Beijing's latest slogan for 
government work in 1994, Xu said Sichuan was concentrating on 
the one that says "guarantee stability". 
  In line with Beijing's new policy on agriculture, Sichuan 
leaders were focusing their attention on raising bottomline 
incomes of farmers, he said. 
  On average, farmers in Sichuan earned a meagre 695 renminbi 
(HK$617) last year, less than a third of urban incomes in the 
province. The urban-rural gap continued to widen, with rural 
incomes growing at 9 percent, compared to 20 percent in cities. 
  Xu said the province was aiming to boost per capita rural 
incomes by Rmb80 to Rmb100 this year, through a mixture of price 
reforms and outright income supplements. 
  Boosting rural incomes also depends on developing the 
province's township enterprises, which employed about 8 million 
people last year. 
  This would not only help stabilise the mood of farmers, 
according to Xu, but would also draw in more foreign investment. 
  "We always claim to have a huge market. But if the peasants 
remain poor it's not worthwhile--it becomes a false market," he 
said. 
  Part of the plan relies on encouraging farmers to leave the 
land. Sichuan "exports" more than 5 million workers to other 
provinces every year. This "Sichuan army" earned the province 
Rmb5bn in remittances last year, Xu said. 
  Another 5 million farmers leave the land every year for 
towns 
and cities in the province. 
  "We have a rule of thumb that one peasant who leaves the 
land 
can support a whole family," Xu said. "We support this kind of 
thing." 
  But with resignation and uncharacteristic frankness, Xu 
admitted he was slightly out of touch with Sichuan's rural 
situation. 
  "It's such a big province that I lack a deep understanding 
of 
the situation," he said. 
  "It's especially hard for a provincial leader to know when 
some local cadres are committing errors. It could take us many 
months to find out."

  [Text] Beijing has overruled the Guangdong provincial 
government's decision to discriminate against British firms when 
awarding the remaining contracts of the Guangzhou underground 
rail projects a source said. 
  The move comes after Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu said British 
companies would have no chance of winning the remaining two 
contracts of the rail project because of the Sino-British 
dispute on Hong Kong's political reform. 
  Meanwhile, the top representative of the European Union (EU) 
in Hong Kong confirmed the EU had been given assurances from 
China that there would be no discrimination against firms from 
any of the union's member states because of political reasons. 
  Etienne Reuter, head of the office of the European 
Commission 
in Hong Kong, said the EU did not see any "material 
consequences" from the "verbal threats" from China that it would 
discriminate against British traders. He said the EU had not 
received complaints from any British traders. He added that 
China's boycott against any members of the union because of 
political reasons would not be compatible with trade and 
co-operation agreements between the EU and the mainland. 
  But Mr. Reuter said if there were evidence that China 
discriminated against any traders from its member countries, the 
union would consult China and try to come up with a solution 
before taking any measures against Beijing.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Trade Grows With Belgium in </F>
Spite of Deficit"] 
  [Text] Trade with Belgium is surging despite China's 
deficit with the European nation. 
  Wu Yi, the Chinese foreign trade minister, said in Beijing 
yesterday that bilateral trade has improve since a flurry of 
high-level visits between the two sides last year. 
  Her view was shared by Robert Urban, visiting Belgian 
Minister for Foreign Trade and European Affairs who announced 
that his country would increase credit this year to finance more 
exports to and investment in China. 
  "The Belgian government has urged its financial institutions 
to provide more support for trade with China," he said yesterday 
at a trade conference between China, Belgiur and Luxembourg. 
  Wu urged Belgium to provide more loans to promote bilateral 
trade. 
  From 1979 to 1993, Belgium provided China with more than 
$100 
million in loans to support projects in energy, pharmaceuticals, 
textiles electronic and environmental protection. 
  Last year, Belgium's exports to China surged 71.4 percent to 
reach $786 million, while two-way trade hit an all-time high of 
$1.39 billion Wu said China's trade deficit was more than $100 
million with Belgium. 
  She said she hoped steps would be taken to narrow the 
deficit. 
  China sent purchasing delegations to Belgium in 1991 and 
1992. helping to clinch import contracts worth $54 million. 
  A follow-up delegation in 1993 nailed down imports worth 
$250 
million. 
  In particular, China has increased imports of advanced 
technology and equipment from Belgium. 
  Last year, the country signed four import agreements in the 
sector valued at more than $30 million. 
  Meanwhile, China's trade with Luxembourg also increased, 
hitting a record high of $36 million last year. 
  The surge was bolstered mainly by imports of steel products 
from the tiny European nation.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (AFP)--China, which has warned 
that the row over Hong Kong will hurt Britain's interests in the 
mainland market, gave reassurances Thursday that it conducted 
its trade on the basis of "fair play." "We welcome foreign 
companies coming to compete on the basis of fair play in the 
Chinese market," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a 
weekly news briefing when asked about the threat to discriminate 
against British companies. "We always handle international trade 
in the spirit of principles of fair competition, equality, and 
mutual benefit and in the light of established international 
practices," said Shen. 
  European Union (EU) Commissioner Leon Brittan said here 
Tuesday that he had received "unequivocal" assurances from China 
that it would not take discriminatory action against any EU 
state on political grounds. 
  The assurances followed Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu 
Yi's reiteration the previous day of Beijing's stance that 
Britain's "unfriendly and uncooperative" behaviour on Hong Kong 
would inevitably damage Sino-British trade ties. The comment 
followed last month's escalation of the row between London and 
Beijing in the wake of the adoption by Hong Kong's legislature 
of part one of a bill broadening the franchise in the final 
elections before the colony reverts to China in 1997. 
  On the Hong Kong administration's announcement Wednesday 
that, even after the proposed transfer of funds to help pay for 
a 20.3 billion U.S. dollar airport, it would leave behind some 
120 billion HK dollars (15.4 billion US) in reserves in 1997, 
Shen said only that China should not be left with a huge 
economic burden. "We must not leave an excessively heavy 
economic burden to the people of Hong Kong and the government of 
the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," said Shen, 
despite the fact that the level of reserves was nearly five 
times the amount London has guaranteed. 
  The financing of the airport is another bone of contention 
between Britain and China, with Beijing constantly raising 
concerns that it may become an excessive drain on the 
territory's funds.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- Chinese top legislator 
Qiao Shi said here today that the National People's Congress 
(NPC), China's parliament, is always happy to expand its 
cooperation and exchanges with its counterparts in other 
countries and help to stablize the population in Asia and the 
rest of the world. 
  Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC's Standing Committee, said 
this 
at a meeting with participants in the 10th Asian 
Parliamentarians' Meeting on Population and Development (APPD), 
which opened here today. 
  Welcoming all the participants, Qiao noted that most of the 
Asian countries are faced with the problems of population and 
development. The solution of this problem is of great 
significance to world peace, stability, prosperity and 
development. 
  In recent years, Asia has been enjoying booming economic 
growth and many countries here have also gained remarkable 
achievements in the population and family planning sectors, Qiao 
said. 
  He added that Asian countries have made great contributions 
to the solution of the population and development problem of the 
world. 
  Qiao told the guests that China's economy has logged 
relatively fast growth since it launched its reform and opening 
up drive more than a decade ago. 
  However, owing to its large population, the ratio of China's 
natural resources and industrial and agricultural products to 
its population is still very low, Qiao said. 
  In the past 20 years, China has been vigorously pursuing 
family planning. The decline of the birth rate has eased the 
contradiction between population growth and socio-economic 
development, natural resources and environmental protection. 
  Yet, China still has a long way to go in controlling 
population growth and lifting its people's living standard, Qiao 
stressed. 
  On the meeting, Qiao noted that the gathering was conducive 
to the strengthening of friendship among parliamentarians from 
various countries and to the solution of the population and 
development problems in Asia. 
  Fukusaburo Maeda, chairman of the Asian Population and 
Development Association, expressed thanks on behalf of all 
participants for China's warm reception and good organization. 
  Population and development are the biggest issues facing 
today's world, Maeda said. 
  He told Qiao that China has made great contributions in this 
area and expressed the hope that it would continue to do so.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ma Chenguang: "Asian Family Planning </F>
Urged--Conference Pushes More Regional Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Premier Li Peng yesterday called for greater 
regional cooperation to stem the population tide sweeping across 
Asia -- home to 60 percent of the world's populace. 
  He pledged that China will continue its efforts at 
population 
control by sticking to its family planing policy; those efforts 
help develop the economy and improve people's daily lives. 
  And other Asian nations should formulate their own 
strategies. But their plans need to be developed according to 
individual characteristics, he said in a written statement to an 
Asian Pacific population seminar. 
  The question of population is a question of development in 
essence, the Premier added, and can only be tackled at its root 
according to each country's natural conditions, tradition and 
economic level. 
  The 10th Asian Parliamentarians Meeting on Population and 
Development is seeking solutions to Asian population problems. 
  More than 50 parliamentarians and scholars from 17 nations 
were drawn to the two-day seminar, organized by the Asian 
Population and Development Association (APDA) based in Japan and 
the Education, Science, Culture and Public Health Committee 
(ESCPH) of the National People's Congress of China. At the 
opening of the meeting, APDA Chairman Fukusaburo Maeda said 
controlling Asia's population is a decisive global issue. Its 
populace is expected to top 3.34 billion people this year. 
  It has six of the 10 most populated countries in the world: 
China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Japan and Bangladesh. 
  Maeda praised China's efforts to contain its birth rate, an 
"unmatched success in population policy while proceeding with 
rapid economic growth." 
  The population by the end of last year was 1.18 billion, 
according to the newly published statistics. 
  The birth rate fell from 33.43 per thousand in 1970 -- 
before 
family planning -- to 18.09 in 1993. And natural population 
growth has continued its fall, from 14.55 per thousand in 1981 
down to last years 11.45. 
  Without the policy 15 million more babies would have been 
born over the past five years. 
  Maeda said quick solutions to overpopulation in Asia would 
help ensure domestic stability. 
  Analysts recommended controlling the birth rate eradicating 
poverty, creating sufficient food and job opportunities, 
improving education standards, literacy rates and living 
conditions. 
  Chinese ESCPH Chairman Zhao Dongwan said that the nation's 
ultimate goal is to educate and explain to the people why family 
planning is so important. That way, he said, future generations 
will carry on the practice on their own. 
  He admitted that obstacles to China's development and 
population quality still exist, including economic and social 
development, resource utilization and environmental protection. 
  China, by sharing problems of unbalanced population problems 
and socio-economic development with other developing Asian 
countries, needs to strengthen cooperations with them to further 
contain its expansion of population. 
  Also yesterday, NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi, 
parliamentary leader, met with the Asia-Pacific parliamentarians 
and scholars at the Great Hall of the People.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Japan today expressed 
its concern over the U.S. decision to revive the Super 301 trade 
provision. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said at the news 
conference "we have to express concern about the U.S. Government 
move to build up the strength of its procedures that would clear 
the way for unilateral action in resolving trade disputes with 
other countries." 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton reinstated Thursday [3 March] 
the 
lapsed trade measure that gives Washington the right to impose 
sanctions if Japan fails to meet the U.S. demand on greater 
market access to foreign products. 
  The top government spokesman Takemura told reporters that 
Prime Minister Hosokawa received a phone call from Clinton last 
night. The prime minister told Clinton that Japan is working on 
a package of market-opening measures and hoped that both 
countries should show restraint over trade disputes. 
  Takemura said that Japan "strongly hopes that the government 
of the United States will act in a sensible manner." 
  Meanwhile, Premier Hosokawa ruled out any immediate steps to 
counter the U.S. latest move. He noted that he and President 
Clinton had "agreed to deal with the matter coolly" in their 
telephone conversation last night. 
  Japanese business executives across the country deplored the 
U.S. move. Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of 
Economic Organizations, pointed out that Super 301 runs counter 
to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Hosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, noted that the U.S. apparently wants to use the clause 
as a tool to take the upper hand in its trade talks with Japan.

  [Text] Seoul, March 4 (XINHUA) -- South Korea today 
expressed regret over the reviving by the U.S. Government of the 
Super 301 trade provision. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the South Korean 
Government deeply regrets that the U.S. Government revives the 
Super 301 provision through administrative means, at a time when 
the Uruguay Round of talks is almost bringing about a worldwide 
free trade system after seven years of negotiations. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton reinstated Thursday [3 March] 
the 
lapsed trade measure that gives Washington the right to impose 
sanctions if a trading nation with the U.S. fails to meet the 
U.S. demand on greater market access. 
  South Korea always considers that international trade 
disputes should not be solved by the domestic law of one 
country, but through the process decided by the World Trade 
Organization. 
  The 301 provision was first made in 1974 to impose sanctions 
on the countries that had unfair trade practice with the U.S. 
  In 1988, the U.S. Government created the Super 301 
provision, 
which strengthened and quickened the imposition process of such 
sanctions. 
  The U.S. decided to revive Super 301 after U.S.-Japan trade 
talks broke down.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 3 (XINHUA) -- The UN protection 
force in Bosnia needs 10,650 more soldiers to carry out its 
mission there, Yasushi Akashi, special envoy for the UN 
secretary-general, said Thursday [3 March]. 
  Addressing a press conference held in Zagreb, Akashi said 
4,600 soldiers are needed for Sarajevo and 6,050 for other 
regions of Bosnia. 
  He stressed that the international community must guarantee 
the increase if it sincerely hopes for a peace in the war-torn 
former Yugoslav republic. 
  If the request is not met, he warned, all the achievements 
of 
the peace efforts made in Sarajevo will be lost again. 
  According to Jean Cote, former commander of the UN 
protection 
force in Bosnia, Turkey, Malaysia, Egypt and Jordan are willing 
to join the protection force in Bosnia. But whether these 
countries will be invited to send their troops will be decided 
by the United Nations. 
  Cote said the United States, Britain and France should 
contribute the most to the protection force.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic Thursday [3 March] rapped the United States for 
replacing the role of the United Nations and other international 
institutions to arrange a federation agreement between the 
Bosnian Muslims and Croats. 
  Speaking to the press after returning from a visit to 
Moscow, 
Karadzic said the Serb side would do all it can to maintain 
peace on all fronts, so that the new round of peace talks would 
be held in a possibly good atmosphere. 
  He also stressed that the alliance between Muslims and 
Croats 
should not be allowed to hurt the Serbs. 
  "It is no good for the United States to replace the role of 
the United Nations and other international institutions," he 
said. 
  The Bosnian Muslims and Croats reached an agreement this 
week 
in Washington to set up a federation. The United States was the 
arranger of the talks for the agreement. 
  Karadzic also said that since Washington has hosted the 
talks 
on Bosnia, why should Moscow not host other talks? 
  He said that Russia's participation in peace efforts in 
Bosnia has a "decisive meaning" and would establish a balance of 
power in the international scene. 
  In another development, the UN Secretary general Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the 
four Galeb combat aircrafts shot down by NATO forces on February 
28 took off from Serb-controlled area in Croatia.

"Crucial Talks Between Chinese Foreign Minister and U.S. 
Secretary of State in Middle of This Month"] 
  [Text]Sino-U.S Relations Enter a New Stage 
  The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday 
that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher would visit 
China from 11 to 14 March at the invitation of Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen. It is believed that this meeting of the foreign 
ministers of China and the United States will produce results in 
improving bilateral relations and alleviating some 
contradictions between the two countries. 
  In Washington, talking about his visit to Asia, U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher said that in September last year, 
President Bill Clinton had instructed him to develop relations 
with China in a broader way. In November, while attending the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin met with Clinton in Seattle. Since then "Sino-U.S. 
relations have entered a new stage." These remarks indicate 
that the United States is paying great attention to Secretary of 
State Christopher's visit to China. 
  Since the summer of 1989, relations between China and the 
United States have been at a low ebb. It was not until November 
last year, when the top leaders of the two countries met after 
an absence of nearly five years, that relations between the two 
countries began to develop toward a new direction. Although 
there are still contradictions between China and the United 
States, such as the U.S. deficit in bilateral trade, China's 
human rights situation, and disputes over intellectual property 
rights, as noted by the United States, with the exception of the 
human rights issue, on which China maintains its own position 
and all the more opposes U.S. linkage of human rights with 
granting most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status to China, the 
other two problems are easy to solve, and, moreover, are being 
resolved. 
<H5>  Both Sides at Odds With Each Other on Human Rights Issue </H5>
  As such, the crux of the failure of Sino-U.S. relations to 
further improve lies in the human rights issue. When leaving 
Beijing for home on 2 March, Assistant Secretary of State John 
Shattuck, who had finished a two-day visit to China, said that 
China had made some progress in improving its human rights. 
However, further progress on human rights was needed if it 
wanted Clinton to extend its MFN status in June. Obviously, 
this means continuing to bring pressure to bear on China. On 
this issue, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman 
reiterated China's position yesterday: Opposing U.S. linkage of 
the human rights issue with MFN status. 
  However, the purpose of Shattuck's visit to Beijing was to 
make arrangements for Christopher's visit to China. At meetings 
with many top-level Chinese officials, including Vice Foreign 
Minister Liu Huaqiu, Shattuck stressed that the Clinton 
administration hoped to strengthen Sino-U.S. relations. 
However, on the MFN renewal issue, China must make 
improvements. He clearly remarked: "This is the bottom line 
for the U.S. Government." 
  It can thus be seen that whether or not this deadlock can be 
broken or what form it assumes depends on the current Beijing 
talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries. 
<H5>  Seeking a Point of Compromise in the Deadlock </H5>
  On the one hand, under pressure from Congress, the Clinton 
administration has strongly demanded China to respond on the 
human rights issue so that he can justify himself on the issue, 
and, on the other hand, he also faces strong pressure from 
American manufacturing, business, and economic circles, which 
oppose the use of political means to compel China to submit. If 
China and the United States fall out with each other, Chinese 
retaliation against the United States will also be detrimental 
to its economy. 
  It must be pointed out that the U.S. economy has entered a 
new stage of stable growth from recovery. U.S. economic 
strategy puts stress on Asia. The vast market of China is 
precisely what the United States desires most. It is obvious 
that since the Sino-U.S. summit in November last year, Clinton 
has decided to develop economic relations with China and 
Southeast Asia. In terms of the international political 
situation, for the United States and China to maintain friendly 
relations will benefit the economic and political stability of 
the two countries, Asia, and the world at large. 
  In fact, China has been continuously improving its human 
rights. This has been acknowledged by many officials from the 
United States and Europe who have visited China. It must be 
said that it would be conducive to both sides and feasible for 
the foreign ministers of the two countries to seek a long-term 
solution to the MFN issue in one move by proceeding on the basis 
of their long-term and immediate interests.

  [Text] Washington, March 3 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton signed an executive order here today reinstating for two 
years the defunct Super 301 trade law. 
  Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor called the Super 301 a "strong 
market opening tool" which was to "complement our market opening 
efforts and to establish trade priorities." 
  As early as November 1991, during the presidential campaign, 
Clinton pledged to reinstate the trade law, which was called 
America's ultimate weapon in forcing trade concessions from 
foreign countries. 
  "It should be clearly understood we are not designating or 
identifying any practice of any country today, rather, we are 
putting in place the Super 301 procedure." Kantor stressed to 
reporters. 
  In 1994 and 1995, Kantor said, the U.S. Trade Representative 
Office will identify unfair trade practices of the priority 
countries by September 30, six month after the annual trade 
estimate report on March 31. 
  Twenty one days after the September 30 identification, 
priority countries will become the subjects of U.S. 
investigation on unfair trade practices. 
  The first step, Kantor explained, is the consultation in 
effort to eliminate barriers to the U.S.. If no agreement is 
reached, further U.S. investigation will be conducted which 
might lead to trade sanctions. 
  The Super 301, Kantor said, was a "flexible instrument" and 
an "early warning." "Our goal is to eliminate all the major 
trade barriers around the world which block market access for 
our products and services. No one should doubt our commitment 
to move forward," he said. 
  The trade representative stressed, meanwhile, that Super 301 
was a message to "any country" which practices unfair trade with 
the U.S.. 
  "Japan is unique among developed nations in maintaining 
trade 
barriers, it could have impact on Japan and other countries," 
Kantor said.

  [Text] Washington, March 3 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton signed an executive order here today reinstating his 
legal authority to use Super 301 trade law to impose trade 
sanctions against foreign countries. 
  Super 301 is an amendment to Section 301 of the 1974 trade 
act, which gives the President authority to impose trade 
sanctions, although it allows trade disputes to drag on for as 
long as a decade. 
  Under Super 301, effective from 1988 to 1990, U.S. names the 
countries which it says engage in unfair trade practices and, if 
a resolution is not reached in 18 months, imposes punitive 
tariffs, sometimes as high as 100 percent, on certain imports 
from these countries. 
  In 1989, Japan, Brazil and India were the targets for Super 
301. The threat of trade sanctions resulted in concessions from 
Brazil and Japan, especially in the areas of processed wood 
products, supercomputers and satellites. 
  Reinstitution of Super 301 by an administrative fiat from 
the 
President, meanwhile, supersede efforts in Congress to renew the 
measure through legislation.

  [Text] Washington, March 3 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
announced here today it agreed to begin a third round of formal 
talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 
Geneva on March 21. 
  "The talks will aim at a thorough and broad resolution of 
the 
nuclear and other issues that separate the DPRK from the U.S. 
And the rest of international community," State Department 
spokesman Michael McCurry said in a statement. 
  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci will head the 
U.S. delegation to the third round negotiation. 
  The announcement came after a team of inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began their work at 
the DPRK's nuclear sites and representatives of the Republic of 
Korea (ROK) and the DPRK resumed discussion at Panmunjom earlier 
today. 
  The department spokesman also announced that the United 
States agreed to suspend the combined military exercise, Team 
Spirit in 1994, with the ROK. 
  However, McCurry said that "the long-standing security 
relationship between the ROK and the U.S. remains strong, and 
the suspension of Team Spirit '94 will not weaken our joint 
defensive capabilities." 
  McCurry stressed, "the undertakings of the U.S. regarding 
Team Spirit '94 and a third round of U.S.-DPRK talks are based 
on the premise that the IAEA inspections will be fully 
implemented and the South-North nuclear dialogue will continue 
through the exchange of special envoys."

(2621 2398)] 
  [Text] Colombo, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- In an interview with Sri 
Lankan journalists here, Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and 
concurrently foreign minister, said China stands for 
establishing a new international political and economic order, 
which should be founded on the basis of the Five Principles of 
Peaceful Coexistence. 
  In response to a reporter's question about the role China 
will play in the future world, Asia in particular, the Chinese 
foreign minister said: "If we say that China can play a certain 
role in this process, China should be a factor for promoting 
world peace and economic development." 
  Touching on Sino-Sri Lankan trade and economic relations, 
Qian Qichen said: In recent years, China and Sri Lanka have 
seen new features in their economic and trade activity, that is, 
both countries have pursued a policy of economic reform and 
opening up and their economic developments have accelerated. 
  He pointed out: Under such circumstances, bilateral economic 
exchanges should not be limited to those between the 
governments. Greater emphasis should be placed on exchanges 
between nongovernmental sectors. They can explore various 
investment and cooperation opportunities. 
  When asked by a reporter about China's experience in 
economic 
reform, he said: China has been quiet successful in its economic 
reform. Over the past 15 years, a market economy has been 
gradually instituted in China and the economic growth has 
continued. Meanwhile, the basic socialist system has remained 
unchanged. He added: In the process of reform, although China 
has learned from some advanced experiences of foreign countries, 
it has proceeded from the realities in the country and taken its 
own road.

  [Text] Tehran, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen arrived here this morning for a 
three-day official visit to Iran in a bid to promote bilateral 
relations. 
  Qian and his 14-member delegation were greeted by Iranian 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati at the Tehran International 
Airport. 
  Upon his arrival, Qian told reporters that the Chinese and 
iranian peoples have their long traditional friendly relations, 
saying that "we are glad to see many exchange visits by the two 
countries' high-ranking officials in recent years." 
  "Cooperation between the two countries have been well 
expanded and the two countries have the same or similar views 
toward many regional and international issues," Qian said. 
  He said that he was eager to meet Iranian leaders, saying 
that he will discuss ways of developing the friendly relations 
between the two countries and exchange views over international 
issues and regional situation with Iranian Foreign Minister 
Velayati. 
  Welcoming Qian, Velayati said that cooperation between Iran 
and China would help maintain peace and stability in the region, 
adding that Iran pays much importance toward developing 
relations with China and this is a decisive decision. 
  This is the last leg of Qian's five-nation tour which has 
taken him to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. He 
started the tour on February 21. 
  During his visit, Chinese foreign minister is expected to 
meet with Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Majlis Speaker 
'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri and other high-ranking officials, and have 
talks with the Iranian foreign minister. 
  The past few years witnessed a steady development of the 
bilateral relations after visits of state leaders of the two 
countries. The good political ties have facilitated economic 
and trade relations. The trade volume between China and Iran 
jumped to 712 million U.S. dollars in 1993, representing a 63.2 
increase over the previous year. 
  According to Chinese trade officials, China's export 
products 
have expanded from light industrial products and garment in the 
past to large production lines, equipment, machinery and high 
technology at present. 
  In economic and technological cooperation, the two countries 
have also made progress and the two sides have launched 41 
projects with a total investment of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in 
the past decade, which range from dam construction, machinery 
industry to nonferrous industry.

  [Text] Tehran, 4 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, vice premier 
of China's State Council and concurrently foreign minister, 
arrived here this morning for a three-day official goodwill 
visit to Iran. 
  Qian Qichen and his entourage were greeted by Iranian 
Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and other officials at the Tehran 
International Airport. This is the third time that Qian Qichen 
visits Iran since October of 1989. 
  In an interview by reporters at the airport, Qian Qichen 
said: "A traditional friendship exists between the Chinese and 
Iranian people, and relations between the two countries date 
back to ancient times. We are glad to see many exchanges of 
visits in recent years by leaders and officials of all levels in 
the two countries. Friendly relations and cooperation between 
the two countries have expanded continuously, and the two 
countries share identical or similar views on many major 
international and regional issues." 
  He said: "I believe that this visit will definitely further 
enhance friendship and mutual understanding between the two 
peoples, and it will promote the development of friendly 
relations and cooperation between the two countries." 
  Velayati said: "The relationship between Iran and China is 
very important and decisive. Iranian-Chinese cooperation can 
serve as a pillar of peace and stability in the Asian region."

Mainland Will Strengthen Its Economic Integration With Taiwan, 
and Decides To Establish Investment Zones for Taiwan Businessmen 
in Coastal Areas To Curb the Taiwan Independence Movement"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (WEN WEI PO)--An authoritative 
person here has disclosed that in the near future the central 
authorities will approve the establishment of several investment 
zones for Taiwan businessmen in coastal areas to meet the needs 
of the situation of investment by Taiwan businessmen in the 
mainland. In revealing this new policy, the high-level 
leadership of the central authorities stressed that we should 
not rush headlong into mass action in the establishment of 
investment zones for Taiwan businessmen and that we should carry 
out solid work in economic relations and trade with Taiwan. How 
we establish such zones depends on how we absorb investment by 
Taiwan businessmen, and we should not confine ourselves to one 
form. 
  The authoritative person quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that 
the Taiwan independence movement can best be contained by 
letting the economy of the two sides become closely integrated. 
The high level of the central authorities stressed that this 
viewpoint of Deng Xiaoping should be embodied in the entire work 
on Taiwan and that economic relations and trade with Taiwan is 
engineering that places hope in the Taiwan people. 
  A high-level leader of the central authorities said in a 
relevant speech a few days ago that the central authorities hold 
that the request for the establishment of investment zones for 
Taiwan businessmen put forward by some localities is good and 
that they are considering giving approval to the establishment 
of several such zones on a trial basis in several localities 
along the coast. However, we should not rush headlong into mass 
action in the establishment of investment zones for Taiwan 
businessmen, but should make arrangements and give approval in a 
planned manner. The central authorities hold that localities 
which are not on the coast need not focus all their attention on 
investment zones for Taiwan businessmen and that there are 
numerous ways to attract Taiwan capital. For example, a major 
Taiwan businessman can be allowed to develop a vast stretch of 
land and then this businessman can attract other businessmen to 
come. In this way, it will be possible to attract more Taiwan 
businessmen to a development zone in a short time, and the open 
zone will naturally take shape faster. Localities which fail to 
obtain approval for the establishment of investment zones for 
Taiwan businessmen may follow this very good method. 
  The authoritative person continued to quote a high-level 
leader of the central authorities as saying that in recent 
years, Taiwan businessmen have vied with one another in making 
investment in the mainland. The volume of investment has grown 
by a big margin and some businessmen have even asked to contract 
the development of a large stretch of land. This being the 
case, since some coastal economic development zones are already 
almost filled with construction projects, and their fund-raising 
capacity is almost fully utilized, these zones are far from 
being able to meet the actual needs of investment by Taiwan 
businessmen. The central authorities approving the 
establishment of investment zones for Taiwan businessmen and 
approving the adoption of more open policies for attracting 
Taiwan capital is precisely to meet the needs of the situation 
as it has developed. 
  He said that to attain reunification, it is first of all 
necessary to let the Taiwan compatriots really understand the 
mainland, particularly the tremendous changes since reform and 
opening up began 15 years ago. The overwhelming majority of 
Taiwan compatriots who invest in the mainland will benefit from 
the market on the mainland. The increase in economic exchanges 
will enable the Taiwan compatriots to increase their 
understanding of the mainland and will deepen the feelings and 
friendship between the people of the two sides of the strait.
