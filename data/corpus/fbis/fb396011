  [Text] The provincial propaganda and ideological work 
conference opens in Harbin this morning. 
  At the conference, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, made a speech entitled "Attach High Importance 
To And Realistically Achieve the Propaganda and Ideological Work 
Under the Market Economic Conditions." 
  Sun Weiben said: To achieve the 1994 provincial tasks for 
reform, opening up, and modernization, the people from higher 
levels downward across the province should unite as one and make 
concerted efforts, all fronts should work closely in line with 
the central task of the party, and it is also necessary to 
strengthen and improve the propaganda and ideological work and 
to upgrade the level of serving the overall party work 
situation. At the national propaganda and ideological work 
conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin set forth major propaganda and 
ideological work tasks under the conditions for setting up the 
socialist market economy. The province should strengthen the 
active and creative nature of the propaganda and ideological 
work and the sense of responsibility for carrying out the work 
and further successfully carry out the work in a down-to-earth 
manner. 
  Sun Weiben pointed out: The 1994 propaganda and ideological 
work priorities are to further organize the people to study the 
third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; to 
implement to the letter the task of arming the whole party with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics; to persist in the principle of linking 
theory with practice; to emphatically solve the practical 
problems; to conduct the education on the purpose of the party 
within the party, conduct the education on the Chinese nation's 
traditional virtue, and conduct the education on ardently loving 
the socialist motherland among the youngsters in line with the 
provincial fighting targets for economic and social development 
and the provincial work tasks; to strive to cultivate the new 
persons with ideals, education, morality, and a sense of 
discipline; to vigorously support the production of the 
spiritual products reflecting the main melody; and to strive to 
create high-taste, high-style, and high-grade cultural works so 
as to satisfy the people's increasingly higher spiritual and 
cultural demands and to mobilize the people's spirits and 
vitality. We should vigorously strengthen the management of 
cultural markets and ensure that our literary and artistic works 
and cultural markets conform to the main melody of the times and 
the social progress. 
  Sun Weiben said: We should prominently propagate and explain 
the relationship between reform and development and stability 
and provide an accurate media orientation for reform and 
construction. The press work should closely coordinate with the 
propaganda work. Both the press and propaganda fronts should 
tightly grasp the accurate guidance orientation, have a 
clear-cut stand to support reform, and go all out to safeguard 
political and social stability. We should prominently attend to 
the propaganda on economic work, reform, and opening up and 
create a good ideological and media environment for making 
Heilongjiang prosperous and developing Heilongjiang. 
  Sun Weiben stressed: We should realistically strengthen 
leadership and really bring into play the functions of the 
propaganda and ideological work departments and their work 
contingents. The party committees and governments at various 
levels, all fronts, and all departments should foster the 
awareness of mass propaganda and form cohesive power for 
strengthening the propaganda and ideological work. That whether 
or not the leading cadres pay attention to and achieve the 
propaganda and ideological work should be regarded as a key 
indicator for assessing their political awareness and leadership 
ability. That whether or not the propaganda and ideological 
work and the spiritual civilization are successfully carried out 
should be regarded an important standard for judging their 
success or failure. To achieve the propaganda and ideological 
work, the party committees and governments should work according 
to the practice of the central authorities and in line with the 
real demands for strengthening the propaganda and ideological 
work, and gradually increase the economic input to the 
propaganda and ideological work. 
  In regard to the issue concerning the construction of the 
propaganda and ideological worker contingent, Sun Weiben pointed 
out: It is necessary to cultivate a propaganda and ideological 
worker contingent with the spirit of contributions, the style of 
respecting professional work, the strong sense of political 
awareness, proficiency in professional work, and moral 
integrity. The party committees at various levels should 
enthusiastically show concern for this contingent, try every 
possible to help improve their working and living conditions, 
and make them happy and do their jobs cautiously and prudently. 
  The major tasks of the provincial propaganda and ideological 
work conference are to study, relay, and implement the 
guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work 
conference; and to study the tasks, targets, and measures for 
strengthening and improving the propaganda and ideological work. 
  Present at the conference were Provincial Leaders Tian 
Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Yang Guanghong, Wang Xianmin, Li 
Qinglin, Liu Hanwu, Sun Kuiwen, and Dai Moan; and responsible 
comrades of the propaganda departments at various levels. 
  Yang Guanghong, standing committee member of the provincial 
party committee and director of the propaganda department, 
relayed the guidelines of the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference.

  [Text] The commission on politics and law under the 
provincial party committee and the provincial committee for 
overall improvement of social order urged that from now on, all 
localities and all departments concerned should immediately go 
into action and rapidly make a good start in launching the 
battle of improving social order. 
  On the afternoon of 2 March, the commission on politics and 
law under the provincial party committee and the provincial 
committee for overall improvement of social order held a 
telephone conference to mobilize all people of the province to 
engage in the battle of improving social order in spring. The 
conference urged that the leading comrades of the departments 
concerned at various levels and the broad masses of security 
cadres and policemen should have a sense of high responsibility 
to the party and the people, consciously and positively engage 
in the battle of improving social order in spring, bring the 
battle of improving social order into line with the major work 
agenda of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government, and regard the battle as a great matter and attend 
to it. The party and government principal leaders should 
personnally assume leadership over the work and personally solve 
major problems cropping up in the course of launching the 
battle. All departments concerned should work closely in 
cooperation with one another, build up a powerful momentum to 
meet for the battle, and organize capable work teams to 
coordinately meet for the battle. We should concentrate human, 
material, and financial resources so as to provide reliable 
material guarantees for meeting for the battle. 
  The conference urged: To win a success in the battle, the 
political and legal departments and the public security 
departments should bring into play their role as the main force, 
fully exercise their functions, resolutely implement the 
principle of sternly and rapidly punishing criminals according 
to laws, strengthen the extent of attacks, and strengthen 
various measures for management of social order according to 
laws. The political and legal departments and the public 
security departments should work closely in cooperation with one 
another, strengthen unity, and enhance the overall functions for 
meeting for the battle. All departments concerned should 
positively join the battle of improving social order, get rid of 
the wrong idea of having nothing to do with themselves, take on 
the duty that they should do, and ensure the smooth and 
effective progress of the battle. In launching the battle, we 
should put attacks in a prominent position. 
  The conference stressed: We should sternly deal blows to 
serious criminal activities with the focus on cracking major 
cases, eliminating gangs of criminals, and pursuing escaped 
criminals; regard it as the primary important task of battle; 
and firmly attend to it. We should intensify the investigation 
work, concentrate efforts to tackle difficult problems, and 
strive to crack a number of major and appalling cases. Leaders 
should personally engage in the cracking of major cases on a 
contracted responsibility system. Handsome awards should be 
given to the personnel with contributions to cracking major 
cases. Those who create serious consequences to the neglect of 
duties should be investigated and called into account. The rest 
follow-up links relating to the attacks against criminals should 
immediately and lawfully handle the cases, that have been 
investigated. 
  The conference pointed out: This battle should be focused on 
putting attacks in a prominent position. Simultaneously, 
educational, defense, management, building-up, and reformatory 
links should appropriately catch up with the progress of the 
battle; cooperatively work for and ensure the progress of the 
battle; and consolidate the achievements in the battle. We 
should study ways and work out necessary measures for solving 
key problems, make the measures for overall improvement of 
social order coordinate with one another, actually bring into 
play the functions of the departments for overall improvement of 
social order, and make real achievements in the battle.

  [Text] After satisfactorily finishing all the items on the 
agenda of the session, the second session of the seventh 
Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] ended at Shenyang's Bayi Theater 
on the afternoon of 4 March. 
  Lin Sheng chaired the closing ceremony. Executive chairmen 
including Sun Qi, Lin Sheng, Liu Mingjiu, Yue Weichun, Wang 
Suzhi, Gao Qingzhou, Zhang Lingyun, and Zhang Chenglun were 
seated on the rostrum. Former Chairman Xu Shaofu and former 
Vice Chairmen Weizhi, Wu Jianan, Zhang Yan, Yu Jingqing, Shen 
Xianhui, Chen Yanzhi, Liu Qisheng, and Li Ming attended the 
session as nonvoting members. 
  At the session, (Zhang Jueyun) reported on examination of 
motions at the second session of the seventh provincial CPPCC 
committee on behalf of the motions examination committee. The 
session adopted the resolution on the work report of the 
standing committee of the provincial CPPCC committee, the 
resolution on the work report of the motions examination 
committee, and the resolution on the second session of the 
seventh provincial CPPCC committee. 
  The resolution called on all CPPCC members; the CPPCC 
organizations, democratic parties, and mass organizations at 
various levels across the province; and the personages of all 
circles to work with one heart and soul under the leadership of 
the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee and to make positive 
contributions to fulfilling the 1994 reform and construction 
tasks. 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, made 
a speech at the session. 
  He said: In the past year, the provincial CPPCC committee 
held high the banners of patriotism and socialism; 
conscientiously exercised the functions for political 
consultation and democratic supervision; positively participated 
in and discussed political affairs; and did a lot of work and 
produced wide influence in promoting reform, expanding the scale 
of opening up, establishing contacts, eliminating 
contradictions, promoting social stability, promoting the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization and socialist 
democratic politics, expanding the contacts with the people at 
home and abroad, and promoting the peaceful reunification of the 
motherland. The provincial CPPCC committee organized its 
members, democratic parties, CPPCC organizations to engage in 
the activities of suggesting ways and means particularly for the 
promotion of progress in the second pioneering work. Thus, many 
valuable opinions and suggestions were set forth. All this has 
made positive contributions to promoting the progress of reform 
and opening up. 
  Gu Jinchi said: The year 1994 is a year to accelerate the 
setup of the socialist market economic system. The new 
situation of setting up the socialist market economic system has 
set new higher demands on the CPPCC work. We hope that the 
CPPCC organizations at various levels will conscientiously 
exercise the functions for political consultation and democratic 
supervision, suggest better ways and means for setting up the 
socialist market economic system, closely grasp the two major 
subjects of unity and democracy, and do a lot of work to 
safeguard social and political stability. We should 
conscientiously study ways for bringing into better play the 
CPPCC's functional role in the new situation of setting up the 
socialist market economic system and continue to create a new 
situation in the CPPCC work. 
  Sun Qi, chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee, made a 
speech at the closing ceremony. 
  Sun Qi said: During the session, all participants, with a 
high-degree sense of responsibility and mission, positively 
participated in and discussed the political affairs in line with 
the provincial actual conditions of economic construction, 
reform, and opening up. All democratic parties positively 
conducted their functions for participating in political affairs 
and talked freely. This has embodied the close ties of showing 
utter devotion to and sharing weal and woe with the CPC. I 
believe that through the concerted efforts of all members, all 
tasks as defined at this session will be realized successfully, 
and the provincial CPPCC committee will further improve its work 
of participating in and discussing political affairs and make 
greater progress in its work in the new year.

  [Text] After a two-day session, the provincial work 
conference of directors of organizational departments concluded 
in Shenyang on 5 March. During the conference, the spirit of 
the national forum of directors of organizational departments 
was relayed. Yu Junbo, member of the provincial party standing 
committee and director of the organizational department, 
delivered a report to make organizational work arrangements for 
the province this year. 
  During the work conference Gu Jinchi, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, delivered an important speech on 
conducting the organizational work under the new situation and 
on having the province seize the opportunity and provide 
reliable guarantees for accelerating development. 
  Gu Jinchi said: An important characteristic in the current 
development in the country is a deep change cropping up in the 
transformation from the planned economic system to the market 
economic system. This has set new demands for the 
organizational work, which chiefly are to seize the opportunity 
and to accelerate development. In conducting organizational 
work under the new situation, we should not only help cadres 
upgrade their capability of having the market economy well in 
mind but also help them gain the experience of building two 
civilizations simultaneously. We should not only uphold the 
principle of having the party manage cadres, but also provide a 
fine environment for outstanding personnel to give full play to 
their professional knowledge and skill. 
  Gu Jinchi said: We are encountering so many difficulties and 
tasks for overcoming these difficulties and improving the 
shortcomings are very arduous. Therefore, the organizational 
work should assume important responsibility in this regard. The 
organizational front should coordinate with the propaganda and 
ideological front to do a good job in grasping the work of 
having party members and cadres emancipate their minds and in 
building leading bodies at all levels and party organizations at 
grass-roots levels so as to bring into full play the enthusiasm 
and creativeness of various talented personnel and to have them 
fully play their role in the main battlefield of economic 
construction. 
  Gu Jinchi urged the organizational departments to lead the 
broad masses of party members and cadres to take the lead in 
emancipating minds, as well as promoting the organizational work 
and to continuously create a new situation in work by regarding 
reform as a motive force. 
  Attending the work conference were Xu Wencai, member and 
secretary general of the provincial party standing committee; 
secretaries from the party committees under the provincial level 
departments and bureaus; and directors from the organizational 
departments of various cities.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Lei (1728 7191): "Qin Wenjun, Deputy </F>
Director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, Says There Are Three 
Reasons Why CPPCC Will Not Set Up Branch Organization in Hong 
Kong"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Qin Wenjun, 
member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee and 
deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch in Hong Kong, 
pointed out this afternoon that there are three reasons why the 
CPPCC will not set up a branch organization in Hong Kong at this 
time; they are: Consideration given to the administration in 
Hong Kong at this time; consideration given to problems after 
1997; and the relevant provision of the Basic Law. 
  The Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee 
continued panel discussions this afternoon. Hong Kong members 
of the CPPCC National Committee were divided into two panels, 
and Qin Wenjun, as convener of the first panel, presided over 
the discussion of the first panel together with Xu Simin. 
  In the panel discussion, Qin Wenjun said: During today's 
discussion, many members have proposed that the CPPCC should set 
up a branch organization in Hong Kong, and in recent years some 
members have kept making such a proposal. We will relay your 
ideas and suggestions to the senior levels and will ask them and 
the relevant departments to study and consider them. 
  He said: In my opinion, it is not very suitable to establish 
a branch organization of the CPPCC in Hong Kong under the 
current conditions, and there are three main factors, which are 
provided for the members' reference. 
  First, the CPPCC is a political organization in which 
China's 
CPPCC members participate in government and discuss government 
matters, whereas Hong Kong is still under the administration of 
the British Hong Kong authorities, so it is not suitable to 
establish such an organization in Hong Kong. 
  Second, after 1997, the Chinese Government will practice 
"one 
country, two systems" in Hong Kong, therefore it is believed 
that the way such an organization will be established at that 
time is a problem that is being deliberated by the relevant 
quarters. 
  The third point is that the Basic Law has relatively clear 
stipulations on the issue of establishing Hong Kong branches or 
offices by the organizations inside the country (including 
government departments and power organs). 
  He said that therefore, judged from the current situation, 
it 
is not very convenient to set up a branch organization of the 
CPPCC in Hong Kong.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 9 (XINHUA) -- A local newspaper 
today quoted a senior Chinese official as saying that there is 
lack of sincerity on the part of the British side from the very 
beginning of the Sino-British talks over the Hong Kong issue. 
  Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong 
Kong Branch, made these remarks at a public occasion held here 
on Tuesday [8 March] night in response to the Hong Kong 
Government's decision to table the remaining part of its 
political reform bill to the Legislative Council. 
  Zhang said that the Chinese side had always wanted to 
cooperate with the British side over the Hong Kong issue, but 
the British side did not want that cooperation. 
  The unilateral action taken by the British side last 
December 
to table the first part of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's 
Political Reform Bill to the Legislative Council regardless of 
the repeated admonitions by the Chinese side had already 
signaled that they had not really wanted the talks, said Zhang. 
  "In fact, there is lack of sincerity on the part of the 
British side from the very beginning of the Sino-British talks," 
he said. 
  Zhang listed a number of facts to support his argument. 
  In view of the records of the British side for not being 
able 
to abide by agreements, he said that the Chinese side had 
insisted that certain principles of the talks must be set up 
before the two sides began to talk. 
  But the British side refused to do so, he said, adding that 
the Chinese side later made concessions over the issue so that 
the talks could proceed. 
  However, said Zhang, during the talks the British side had 
put forward a number of unreasonable demands including things 
amounting to interference in the sovereign rights of China and 
affairs that should be handled by the future government of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
  In order to break the deadlock of the talks and achieve an 
agreement, Zhang went on, the Chinese side later proposed to 
solve the easier problems regarding the 1994-95 electoral 
arrangements in Hong Kong first before more difficult ones were 
touched upon. 
  At first, the British side objected to the proposal, said 
Zhang. The two sides were not able to sit down to talk until the 
Chinese side had accepted a number of preconditions put forward 
by the British side, he added. 
  However, Zhang said, when the two sides were almost to reach 
an agreement, the British side suddenly decided to withdraw from 
the talks by finding some flimsy excuses. 
  Now it is very clear that the Chinese side has made its 
utmost efforts in the Sino-British talks over the Hong Kong 
issue, said Zhang, adding that it is the British side that has 
sabotaged the talks and cooperation between the two sides.

<F P=106> [Dispatch: "Chen Ziying Urges British Side Not To Undermine </F>
Cooperation Again, Stresses That Airport Financing Package Is 
Being Studied"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- Chen Ziying, deputy 
director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, pointed out here today that although the British side 
had already sabotaged Sino-British cooperation on the issue of 
Hong Kong's political system, he hoped the British side would 
not undermine cooperation in other aspects. He also said that 
as the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] was bearing a heavier 
work load, he did not rule out the possibility that the National 
People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee would appoint new 
members to the PWC. 
  Chen Ziying made these remarks when answering questions 
raised by reporters after he had attended the opening ceremony 
of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee today. He said: The Sino-British Joint Declaration 
stipulates that the Chinese side and its British counterpart 
should make joint efforts to maintain the smooth transition of 
Hong Kong. The Chinese side has always called for handling 
things in accordance with the Joint Declaration, and its deeds 
always square with its words. The British side, however, has 
undermined cooperation between the two sides on the issue of 
Hong Kong's political system, which produced bad effects. The 
Chinese side wishes that its British counterpart would not 
undermine cooperation between the two sides in other aspects. 
  When asked about the fourth new airport financing package, 
Chen Ziying said that the Chinese side was studying it 
vigorously. He stressed: Every problem related to the new 
airport should be solved by proceeding from the objectives of 
contributing to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and of 
fully implementing the stipulations of the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the new airport. All the suggestions made by 
the Chinese side have been written down in the Memorandum of 
Understanding as the consensus of the two countries, and no new 
demands have been set since then. Hence, as long as everything 
is done in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, a 
larger and better new airport will emerge very soon. 
  When talking about the PWC's work, Chen Ziying said: The PWC 
has very heavy tasks to bear, and much work must be studied 
seriously. It is not enough merely to rely on the strength of 
the 57 incumbent members, so I do not rule out the possibility 
of recruiting more members in the future. Moreover, the State 
Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch are making preparations for recruiting the third 
group of Hong Kong affairs advisers, and the list can be 
published once the work is complete. 
  On the other hand, Zheng Yi, deputy secretary of the NPC 
Standing Committee and deputy director of the PWC, said today 
that the PWC was handling its work quite smoothly and that the 
five special subgroups were vigorously accelerating their work. 
He said: As a work organ under the NPC Standing Committee, the 
PWC should report on its work to the NPC regularly. However, 
this topic has not been placed on the agenda of the NPC session 
this year. In the future, the PWC will report on its work 
according to the progress and requests made by deputies to the 
NPC.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Cites Host of Facts Indicating </F>
That British Side Is Responsible for Undermining Talks"] 
  [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA News 
Agency Hong Kong Branch, yesterday cited a host of facts to 
point out that the British side is solely responsible for 
undermining the Sino-British talks and cooperation. Robin 
McLaren, the British ambassador to China, said yesterday morning 
after attending a meeting of the Executive Council in Hong Kong, 
that he hoped the Chinese side would not overreact to the 
tabling of the second part of the reform bill by the Hong Kong 
Government in the Legislative Council today. Zhang Junsheng 
said he wanted McLaren to explain what is meant by "overreact." 
  Zhang Junsheng said that as far as the Chinese side is 
concerned, its original intention was to win cooperation with 
the British side, and that the British side is the one who has 
now undermined the talks and cooperation. The British side 
decided unilaterally last year to leave the negotiating table 
and to submit the first part of the reform bill to the 
Legislative Council, and this showed that they did not want to 
have Sino-British cooperation, but wanted a complete breakdown 
of the talks. 
  Zhang Junsheng reflected: "In fact, since the very beginning 
of the Sino-British talks, the British side did not have 
sincerity for the talks." When the Sino-British talks began, in 
light of the British side's record of not keeping its promises 
in agreements, the Chinese side first demanded the British side 
to recognize the principles for the relevant talks, but the 
British side refused to recognize these relevant principles. 
Afterwards, the Chinese side made concessions and the talks 
were able to enter a concrete stage. However, the British side 
did not return to the foundation of the Sino-British 
understanding, but raised many unreasonable demands, including 
attempts to interfere in China's sovereignty as well as matters 
which should be handled by the future government of the special 
administrative region, and this led the talks to an impasse. 
Thereafter, in order to win an agreement, the Chinese side 
proposed separating the arrangements for the 1994 and 1995 
elections and solving problems step by step through the method 
of "tackling the easy ones first." In the beginning, the 
British side rejected this and then raised a number of 
preconditions; both sides discussed the methods, however, when 
an agreement was about to be reached, the British side quit the 
talks with an excuse. They are now saying that because the 
Chinese side omitted the words "on its own" from the phrase "the 
government of the special administrative region will determine 
on its own whether to reinstate the appointed membership 
system," they quit the talks. Zhang Junsheng said that this was 
complete sophistry from the British side. In fact, the British 
side never mentioned this problem across the negotiating table, 
while in diplomacy such wording problems can be discussed after 
the principle has been fixed. 
  Zhang Junsheng said that, in fact, the British side had left 
the negotiating table because it insisted on solving the problem 
of using the single-seat, single-vote system in the 1995 
Legislative Council elections simultaneously, whereas this 
problem is a problem of principle. The British side's rationale 
was that the single-seat, single-vote system had already been 
passed by the Legislative Council. If anything passed by the 
Legislative Council can be imposed upon the Chinese and British 
Governments, then what kind of talks were these? Using such an 
excuse to quit the talks only shows that the responsibility for 
undermining the talks and cooperation is solely on the British 
side.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Chen Ziying Comments on Tabling of </F>
Constitutional Reform Package to Legislative Council, Stressing 
That British Side Refuses to Cooperate With Chinese Side Because 
It Does Not Want To Have Through Train"] 
  [Text] Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said here today: It 
is not strange that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten is tabling 
the other part of his political reform proposals to the 
Legislative Council [Legco]. It seems that the British side is 
determined not to converge with the Basic Law. However, the 
structure of three-tier councils of Hong Kong formed during 
British rule will end on 30 June 1997. By doing this, the 
British side will have to be totally responsible for all 
consequences thus arising. 
  Chen Ziying, who attended a CPPCC panel meeting today, made 
the above remarks when asked a question by reporters. 
  Chen Ziying said: Everyone sees very clearly that the 
British side has already decided to refuse to cooperate with the 
Chinese side on the political system issue by coming up with 
another package which does not converge with the Basic Law. 
This shows that they do not wish to have the through train. 
"It seems that they are already determined about this, so it is 
not strange (that they are tabling another part of the political 
reform package to the Legco). 
  A reporter asked what he thought about some NPC deputies 
from 
Hong Kong preparing to make an official proposal to the 
forthcoming NPC session that the three-tier councils be 
reelected. 
  Chen Ziying said: I am not very sure of the contents of the 
proposal, but I believe that after 1997 as China resumes the 
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, "we have the Basic Law 
and we are completely able to and have the means to thoroughly 
implement the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and to carry 
out one country, two systems, and the rule of Hong Kong by Hong 
Kong people. This is not to be doubted at all." 
  He said: Now that the British Hong Kong authorities are 
determined to refuse to cooperate with the Chinese side on the 
political system question and not to converge with 1997 during 
the transition period of British rule, "the decisions they make 
before 30 June 1997 under the British Hong Kong administration, 
of course, will be valid until 30 June 1997, and this means that 
the three-tier councils formed in Hong Kong under British rule 
will end then. This is a very natural thing. By doing this, 
the British side will have to be completely responsible for all 
consequences thus arising." 
  Moreover, asked whether the Chinese side has taken a milder 
attitude than in the past, Chen Ziying said there is no question 
of being mild or not, the Chinese side's fixed position has 
always been to maintain Hong Kong's smooth transition and 
long-term prosperity and stability. 
  Regarding whether or not the fact that the British side has 
ruined the foundation of cooperation will have an adverse 
influence, Chen Ziying stressed: "We have always hoped that 
China and Britain could have good cooperation on the question of 
Hong Kong during the transition period as this is good for Hong 
Kong's smooth transition. But this is only our wish. The 
British side does not wish the same. In the last 17 rounds of 
talks, we already made very great efforts, but in the end they 
were ruined by them so easily. This was what we very much did 
not want to see. The fact that they have ruined cooperation on 
the political system issue, of course, has a very bad influence. 
Therefore, we hope that the British side will not ruin 
cooperation in other areas any longer and will not go against 
the wishes of Hong Kong people any longer.

  [Text] China has asked John Chan and Yeung Kai-yin, the 
two most senior civil servants to have resigned from the 
Government recently, to become Hong Kong affairs advisers. A 
senior Chinese official yesterday confirmed for the first time 
that Chan, the former secretary for education and manpower, and 
Yeung, the former secretary for the treasury, had been 
approached by the New China News Agency (XINHUA) and invited to 
be among the third batch of advisers. 
  Neither was available for comment yesterday. They are 
believed to be considering the offers. 
  The Chinese source also confirmed that Peggy Lam one of the 
most senior legislative councillors and chairwoman of Wan Chai 
District Board, had accepted the offer to become an adviser 
along with four other district board chairmen. They are Shum 
Choi-sang of Eastern, the former owner of WAH KIU YAT PO; Choy 
Wai-shek of Sham Shui Po, also a member of the Airport 
Consultative Committee; Pang Hang-yin of North; and Chau 
How-chen of Tsuen Wan. The appointments will be announced in 
Beijing at the end of this month. 
  The new advisers will be invited, like their predecessors, 
to 
go to Beijing to attend a certificate awards ceremony. 
  XINHUA is understood to be involved in final consultations 
with several other candidates who are still to decide whether to 
serve on the influential advisory body. 
  Chan, now managing director of Kowloon Motor Bus, was once a 
key strategist for the government in handling talks with China 
over the future of Hong Kong leading up to the signing of the 
Joint Declaration in 1984. He is also tipped as one of the 
strongest candidates for the future chief executive of the 
special administrative region (SAR) government after the 
handover in 1997. 
  When Chan left the administration last summer, he said that 
he would be prepared to offer advice to the Chinese government 
if it was sought. Chan's resignation was a surprise to the 
administration and he has refused to reveal why he quit. It has 
been speculated that he left to distance himself from the 
controversial political reform plans of the Governor, Chris 
Patten, and to further his political future after 1997. 
  Yeung was a more distant runner in the chief executive 
stakes. It was believed that he resigned from the government 
last year over differences of opinion with Patten over the 
administration's style of management. Yeung is regarded as a 
top administrator and is now an executive director of Sino Land, 
a land development and investment company. 
  It is Beijing's intention to invite former government 
officials to be advisers because of their knowledge, 
understanding, and experience. It is understood that there will 
be about 40 new Hong Kong affairs advisers, bringing the total 
to more than 100. China has already invited two democrats, 
Antony Cheung, chairman of Meeting Point, and Frederick Fung, 
chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's 
Livelihood, to become advisers. They have accepted the 
invitations. 
  China has appointed three levels of advisers: The 
Prepapartory Working Committee, the Hong Kong advisers and the 
more junior district affairs advisers, who were appointed last 
week to advise on nonpolitical matters. Two district board 
chairmen, Ambrose Lau of Central and Western and Lau Wong-fat of 
Tuen Mun, were appointed in the first and second batches.

  [Text] The Legislative Council yesterday passed a motion 
calling on the government to lobby for unconditional renewal of 
China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status by the United 
States. "The renewal of China's MFN status should not be linked 
to human rights or any other nontrade related conditions," said 
Liberal Party legislator James Tien who moved the motion. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an executive order last 
year specifying that China's MFN status would only be renewed if 
it improved its human rights record. 
  Mr Tien urged the government to call on Washington not to 
"politicise economic and trade issues" and to avoid trade wars 
that might jeopardise the economies of China, the U.S., and Hong 
Kong. 
  It is estimated that Hong Kong will lose almost $200 billion 
in trade and 75,000 jobs if MFN is withdrawn. 
  Liberal Party legislator Henry Tang called on the government 
to lobby for permanent MFN status for China instead of yearly 
renewal. 
  But the United Democrats (UDHK), the second largest voting 
block in the legislature rejected the Liberal Party's proposal 
to decouple human rights and the MFN. UDHK legislator Huang 
Chen-ya moved an amendment urging the government to mount 
pressure on China to improve human rights to secure permanent 
MFN status. But that brought torrents of criticism from the 
Liberal Party and other pro-democracy factions, with Liberal 
Party legislator Selina Chow accusing the UDHK of double 
standards. "On the one hand, the UDHK urged the Chinese 
Government to separate economic issues and political ones. But 
on the other hand, they support the U.S. (in linking) human 
rights with trade issues." She condemned the UDHK for standing 
by the U.S. government over its use of human rights as a tool to 
interfere in the political affairs of other countries. 
  Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) 
legislator Frederick Fung also opposed the UDHK move. "If MFN 
is not renewed this year, human rights conditions (in China) may 
even worsen because of the adverse impact on China's economy," 
he said. 
  Meeting Point legislator Fred Li shared the ADPL view 
calling 
for unconditional MFN renewal. But UDHK legislator Cheung 
Man-kwong fended off the criticisms, accusing the Liberal Party 
of "turning a blind eye" to human rights in China. 
  "If we keep silent... the Chinese Government will further 
abuse human rights," he said. 
  Mr Cheung's ally, James To, said the U.S. Government had 
already spelt out that "the link between human rights and MFN 
was an undeniable fact. "We want MFN renewed. But we also want 
human rights to be improved," he said. 
  The UDHK amendment was defeated by 29 votes to 13. 
  Secretary for Trade and Industry Chau Tak-hay travels to 
Washington this month to relay Hong Kong's concerns. He said 
the government would lobby for unconditional MFN renewal for 
this year and rejected calls to mount pressure over human 
rights. "It would be tempting to think that such an appeal to 
China would be entirely logical." He added that it was wrong to 
mix politics with trade.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters] </F>
  [Text] The controversial electoral bill was tabled in the 
Legislative Council yesterday, as China repeated warnings it 
would disband the three tiers of government in 1997. In moving 
the Legislative Council (Electoral Provisions) (Amendment) Bill 
1994, the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng 
Wing-fui, said the proposals on functional constituencies and 
the election committee were in line with the Joint Declaration 
and the Basic Law. 
  In Beijing, senior officials and Hong Kong advisers to China 
warned the Hong Kong administration not to mislead the public 
into believing the three-tier political structure would survive 
beyond 1997. A deputy director of the local Xinhua (the New 
China News Agency), Qin Wenjun, accused Governor Chris Patten of 
spreading rumours that the Chinese Government would not risk 
international criticism by dismantling the pre-1997 political 
structure. 
  "It is a total deception and misleads the public. The 
political structure formed under the `triple violation 
blueprint' can never survive (the sovereignty transfer)," Mr Qin 
said. 
  A vice-director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Offfice, Chen Ziying, said the tabling of the electoral 
bill was "no surprise." "Any consequences incurred because of 
that will have to be fully borne by the British Government," he 
said. 
  Director of the local XINHUA, Zhou Nan, said Britain's 
unilateral move would have no major adverse impact on the 
territory's smooth transition. "I've said in the past that they 
have damaged (the talks) a long time ago." 
  Under the bill, corporate voters on the existing functional 
constituencies would be replaced by individual voters in the 
companies or organisations in each functional group. Together 
with the nine new functional constituency seats, the entire 
workforce of more than 2.7 million would be given a vote in the 
functional constituency polls. 
  The first part of the electoral bill, containing less 
controversial reforms, was passed last month.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Shadows Over Budget"] </F>
  [Text] Sir Hamish Macleod yesterday brought down a Budget 
which should be the envy of the developed world. In what other 
country could the government cut salaries tax and profits tax -- 
taxes that already are low by world standards -- order big 
increases in spending on social welfare, health, education and 
roads, and still produce a surplus? If the Financial 
Secretary's forecasts prove correct, the surplus will help 
produce reserves of more than $260 billion, to be handed over to 
the Special Administrative Region [SAR] government in 1997. 
  The Budget is generous--but Sir Hamish could afford to be 
big- hearted. As he said, the task of this Budget was to manage 
prosperity. That this is so is a tribute to the Government and 
its basic philosophy of keeping its own activities restrained to 
allow the private sector to blossom and to the productive energy 
of the people of Hong Kong. It is a tribute, too, to fortune -- 
the good fortune of being in the world's fastest-growing region 
and the bad fortune of a sky-rocketing property market which 
nevertheless keeps filling the administration's coffers. 
  The salaries tax concessions will help ease the financial 
burden on millions of people. The profits tax cut should help 
to make Hong Kong business a little more competitive. The 
forecast reserves awaiting the new sovereign government in 1997 
should calm China's fears that borrowing to build the airport 
and related projects would risk leaving the SAR bankrupt. 
<H5>  High Growth Needed </H5>
  All this is based on the assumption of continued high 
economic growth. Growth in 1994-95 is estimated to stay at 5.5 
percent -- well above growth rates in other developed economies. 
The territory's growth should be helped by better performance 
in the United States and United Kingdom and by continued rapid 
expansion in China. 
  Unfortunately, another key figure is forecast to be 
unchanged 
in 1994-95: The rise in the cost of living will again be 8.5 
percent, eroding the gains people will make from tax cuts and 
salary rises. As the Budget is in surplus, it should make a 
small contribution to keeping inflation controlled. But the tax 
cuts will fuel more consumer spending, helping to push inflation 
up. 
  The property boom will continue to be one of the biggest 
contributors to inflation. Sir Hamish admitted that Government 
moves to try to control property prices (including the 
restrictions on mortgage lending) had been ineffective. He 
proposed a number of measures to increase the supply of new land 
and building sites and cut delays in getting projects finished 
in an effort to control prices. 
  But he also decided to reduce the impact of property stamp 
duty for lower- and medium-priced flats. Making it easier for 
people to buy homes is desirable socially but the effect of 
higher demand will be to pull prices up. The Budget will not 
keep a lid on the price of property. 
  Inflation, however, is not the only cloud on the budgetary 
horizon. The territory's dependence on China, which accounts 
for so much of our prosperity, also brings risks. 
<H5>  Beware the Fallout </H5>
  One flows from the possibility that China's economy will 
grow 
too quickly, producing a bust to follow the present boom. That 
would hurt Hong Kong businesses and families and make nonsense 
of the Budget forecasts. Another comes from the annual debate 
over China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status with the US. If 
MFN were not continued both the US and the Chinese economies 
would be damaged. The fallout for the territory would be 
devastating. 
  The Budget documents estimate that, if China lost its MFN 
status, Hong Kong would suffer a loss of up to $26 billion in 
income and of up to 75,000 jobs. Growth would be cut to just 
over three per cent. Little wonder that the Government supports 
China's case in this annual battle with the US. 
  Hong Kong began compiling growth statistics in 1966. Since 
then the territory has enjoyed -- and earned -- 27 unbroken 
years of expansion. That historical fact is no guarantee that 
growth will go on. So people here should be concerned about 
China and its trade. We should hope that Beijing manages to keep 
high growth going without losing control. And we should hope 
that the US puts its muscle behind levers other than trade as it 
tries to press China for improvements in human rights. 
  If those hopes are realised, the clouds will cast nothing 
but 
shadows on the bright economic picture. Hong Kong will have its 
28th straight year of rising prosperity.

Editor Jackie Sam: "PR Exercise Will Endear PLA Soldiers to the 
Public"] 
  [Text] If Mr Liu Guinan, vice-director of the People's 
Liberation Army (PLA) Guangzhou political department, is to be 
believed, China will soon be throwing open some PLA camps to 
Hong Kong people. These are camps where soldiers sent here in 
1997 are being trained. 
  This will be a PR exercise. No more, no less. Or, 
re-phrased in the language of the Cold War, a campaign to win 
the hearts and minds of Hong Kong people. It's a good start. 
Hong Kong people have to get used to the PLA and vice versa. 
The last thing we would want to see in 1997 is the PLA regarded 
as an occupation army. Or the PLA treating the Hong Kong 
population with hostility. 
  Widespread anxiety about a PLA presence is a fact of life. 
The reasons are historical. Beijing is aware of this, 
otherwise it would not have gone to such lengths to select and 
train the men and women who will be stationed here. Their 
special preparation includes the study of Hong Kong laws, way of 
life, languages (Cantonese and English), and all the 
nitty-gritty which makes this territory so exasperatingly 
unique. Regular visits to the Guangdong camps by Hong Kong 
people will foster understanding, goodwill and -- hopefully -- 
lasting bonds. 
  Hong Kong Affairs Advisers and the territory's National 
People's Congress deputies appear to be at the top of the PLA 
invitation list, presumably because they are important people. 
Giving important people first crack is, of course, the 
Chinese-way in such matters. But if the object of this exercise 
is winning hearts and minds, the people who matter are the 
ordinary folk. Will the common folk get invited? Or are 
invitations to be confined to community leaders? Will 
grassroots leaders like District Board [DB] members get a chance 
to visit the camps? Will all these people -- DB members or 
common people -- have to pass political muster, meaning their 
views must be acceptable to China? These are some of the 
questions which need to be asked. Because the converted have 
less anxieties about a PLA presence than the apolitical majority 
or those opposed to the transfer of sovereignty. Inviting only 
the converted will not advance the PLA cause of building 
bridges, making friends. Ultimately the whole population has to 
get along with the PLA, and vice versa. 
  There are other areas the PLA can usefully explore to 
achieve 
its aims. Inviting university undergrads to participate in 
language training would help to foster better understanding 
between the young soldiers and Hong Kong youth. Another way 
would be to liaise with the Hong Kong Administration to enable 
batches of PLA men to visit the territory informally, to 
familiarise them with the sights and sounds of Hong Kong. If 
this was done on a regular basis, the PLA contingent would not 
be total strangers on arrival in 1997. 
  If the Hong Kong Administration is sincere about a smooth 
transition, it would offer to arrange such familiarisation tours 
without waiting to be asked. It would also be reassuring to 
Hong Kong people if China could enact laws covering the 
behaviour of its troops in the territory speedily and 
disseminate them. This way both Hong Kong people and the 
individual soldiers would know exactly what each other's rights 
and responsibilities are. 
  Hong Kong people want to be assured that PLA men posted here 
would be subjected to the rule of law. They would want to be 
assured, too, that their public behaviour would be subject to 
civilian control. What goes on within the camp where Hong Kong 
people and Hong Kong interests are not involved is another 
matter. But a PLA officer who gets involved in a drunken brawl 
with a local in Wan Chai, or runs up a bill he cannot settle 
must be subject to local laws. If a soldier has committed an 
offence outside his camp and the aggrieved party is a local, it 
would be most reassuring to know that a policeman can arrest him 
and deal with him under Hong Kong laws, without a superior PLA 
officer having the right to intervene. The PLA, undoubtedly, 
has this in mind. But, for most people here, seeing will be 
believing. 
  The PLA is not the monster that a minority in Hong Kong have 
made it out to be. But the PLA is made up of many soldiers, all 
human beings. And Hong Kong is a city of countless temptations. 
Hong Kong people are also far more individualistic than their 
mainland counterparts. The PLA is off to a good start. But it 
needs to keep in mind at all times its aim to endear itself to 
Hong Kong people.

  [Text] Macao, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The Working 
Committee of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group discussed 
handling of three major issues during the transitional period in 
Macao at its 11th meeting held here today. 
  Han Zhaokang, a representative from the Chinese team of the 
Joint Liaison Group, told reporters after the meeting that the 
Chinese side mainly listened to the introduction by the 
Portuguese side on their work to deal with the three major 
issues, namely localization of public servants and law as well 
as officialization of Chinese language. 
  The official said that the Chinese side also made initial 
comment on the Macao Criminal Law handed over by the Portuguese 
side recently. 
  The official added that the two sides have all stressed the 
importance and pressingness to handle the three major issues 
during the transitional period, as 1999 is nearer. 
  Moreover, the two sides also expressed the hope to handle 
these issues as quickly as possible, he said.

  [Text] Macao, March 8 (XINHUA) -- In 1993, Macao posted a 
total foreign trade deficit of 1.9 billion Macao patacas (about 
240 million U.S. dollars), an increase of 18.5 percent over 1992. 
  Last year's exports totalled 14.2 billion Macao patacas 
(about 1.84 billion U.S. dollars), a 1.1 percent rise over the 
previous year's figure. While the imports reached 16.1 billion 
Macao patacas (about 2.09 billion U.S. dollars), climbing by 2.9 
percent. 
  Textile and clothes are Macao's main export commodities, 
accounting for 72.9 percent of the total export volume. 
However, the ratio dropped by 3.4 percent in 1993 as compared 
with 1992. 
  There was also drop in exports to Europe and the United 
States, two main export markets of Macao, which absorb 60 
percent of the total export volume. 
  Exports to Asian markets continued to rise reaching 28.6 
percent last year. 
  Rise in imported consumer goods, raw materials and 
semi-finished products, which amounted as high as 82.7 percent, 
has resulted in the increase of Macao's imports.

  [Excerpts] The Second Session of the Eighth Henan 
Provincial People's Congress opened solemnly this morning, and 
People's Hall was permeated with a warm and auspicious 
atmosphere. The rostrum was decorated with garlands and small 
green trees, and a dignified national emblem was hung in the 
middle of the rostrum, flanked by two brightly colored red 
flags. Those seated on the front row of the rostrum were the 
executive chairmen of the session and of the presidium, 
including Li Changchun, Ren Keli, Song Zhaosu, Zhang Zhigang, 
Liu Guangxiang, Fan Lian, Hu Tingji, Hou Zhiying, Qin Kecai, 
Zhong Lisheng, and Wang Hongfan. 
  The opening ceremony was presided over by Li Changchun. 
Those seated on the rostrum included provincial party, 
government, and military leaders Mao Zhongchen, Lin Yinghai, Wu 
Guangxian, Zhu Chao, Zhang Deguang, (Fan Xinchen), (Ma 
Jianzhang), Zhang Wenbin, Zhang Shiying, Zhang Honghua, Yu 
Jiahua, Hu Tiyun, Liu Yujie, Zuo Mingsheng, (Hu Jiati), Hu 
Shujian, Yao Ruxue, Zhu Shuquan, Shao Lingfang, (Wang Miao), and 
members of the presidium of the session. Zheng Zengmao, 
president of the provincial higher people's court, and Li Xuebin 
also were seated on the rostrum. 
  At 0830, Li Changchun announced: The Second Session of the 
Eighth Henan Provincial People's Congress is now open. The PRC 
national anthem was played following his announcement. After 
that, Li Changchun invited Governor Ma Zhongchen to make his 
government work report. 
  [Begin Ma recording] Fellow deputies, on behalf of the Henan 
People's Government, I now make my provincial government work 
report to this session for examination and discussion by 
provincial people's deputies and nonvoting delegates. [end 
recording] 
  Ma Zhongchen's report was divided into four parts: 1) 1993 
was a year in which our province achieved marked results in 
reform, opening up, and modernizations; 2) We must take economic 
construction as a center in order to promote the rapid 
development of our national economy and social undertakings. 3) 
It is imperative to speed up the establishment of the socialist 
market economy system, and carry out well various reforms in key 
sectors; 4) It is necessary to strengthen the building of 
spiritual civilization, and to promote the development of 
democracy and the legal system so as to create a good 
environment for reform and opening up. 
  Mao Zhongchen said: In 1993, people throughout the province 
conscientiously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National 
Congress, and measures of the central authorities aimed at 
exercising macroscopic regulation and control. They seized the 
fine opportunity, deepened reform, expanded opening up, and 
promoted development. They made new achievements in various 
sectors. They continued to develop the favorable situation in 
our province. The year's tasks set by the first session of the 
eighth provincial people's congress were fulfilled, or even 
overfulfilled. This was manifested mainly in the following: We 
maintained a fairly high rate of increase of the national 
economy. We reaped a good agricultural harvest, and our rural 
economy developed in an all- round manner. Our industrial 
production grew rapidly, and better links between production and 
marketing were formed. We accelerated the pace of fixed-asset 
investment, and our key construction projects progressed 
smoothly. Our market was prosperous, and our commodities sold 
well. New progress was made in opening up to the outside world, 
and use of foreign capital was increased by a wide margin. 
Urban and rural residents continued to increase their incomes, 
and people's living standards were further enhanced. New 
progress was been made in various reforms. The building of 
spiritual civilization was further strengthened, and various 
social undertakings developed vigorously. Finally, the 
anticorruption struggle was carried out in key areas in a 
directed and guardual way so as to further promote the work of 
establishing clean and honest administration. Ma Zhongchen 
continued: 
  [Begin Ma recording] This year is a crucial one for our 
province to fulfill the Eighth Five-Year Plan. The guiding 
thought for our government work is: Implementing in an 
all-round manner the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, 
the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, and the Eighth Session of the Fifth Henan CPC 
Committee; upholding the party's basic line, accelerating the 
pace in the establishment of a new socialist market economy 
system, seizing the favorable opportunity, deepening reform, 
expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability [jian chi dang de ji ben lu xian, jia kuai jian she 
she hui zhu yi shi chang jing ji xin ti zhi, zhua zhu ji yu, 
shen hua gai ge, kuo da kai fang, cu jin fa zhan, bao chi wen 
ding]. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  In conclusion, Ma Zhongchen stressed: 
  [Begin Ma recording] Fellow deputies, let us unite closely 
around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
the core. Under the staunch leadership of the provincial party 
committee, let us work together with people of the whole 
province, unite as one, be of one heart and one mind, arouse 
ourselves for vigorous efforts, explore the way forward, and 
struggle hard to fulfill various tasks for the year. [end 
recording] 
  Participants in the second session of the seventh provincial 
CPPCC, and responsible comrades of various departments, bureaus 
and commissions directly under our provincial authorities, as 
well as various democratic parties, and people's organizations 
also were present at the session as nonvoting delegates.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 10 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Zhejiang Province is encouraging scientific workers to set up 
more nongovernmental hi-tech enterprises to boost the local 
high-tech industry. 
  According to the latest statistics, the province has about 
4,000 such enterprises, employing 110,000 people. 
  These enterprises are involved in the fields of machinery 
and 
electronics, gauges and meters, bio-chemicals, genetic 
engineering, medicine and the combination of machinery and 
electrical appliances. 
  Many of them generate an annual output value of at least ten 
million yuan each a year. 
  Under the centrally planned economy, research institutions 
used to undertake projects assigned by the government, which 
allocated limited funds and took charge of the findings. 
  Such a system could hardly arouse the enthusiasm of 
scientific workers for research work, a provincial government 
official explained. 
  During the current reform of the management of science and 
technology, research institutions have more say in their work, 
and scientific workers are encouraged to set up independent 
hi-tech industrial enterprises at their own expense, at the same 
time assuming sole responsibility for their profits and losses. 
They are also encouraged to apply their research findings to 
production. 
  One example is the Hangzhou General Electrical Appliance 
Company, a nongovernmental enterprise specializing in 
telecommunications. 
  Founded in 1990 with self-raised funds of more than 100,000 
yuan, the company generates an annual output value exceeding 100 
million yuan and profits climbing to 10 million yuan a year. 
  The company has 140 employees, including 30 people with 
doctor's and master's degrees. 
  The company has developed a series of advanced 
program-controlled telephone exchanges to meet the needs of the 
market. 
  Another example is the Hangzhou Organic Silicon New Material 
Development and Application Company, a nongovernmental 
enterprise combining science and industry with trade. 
  Many of the products, including HS-900 seal mat coat 
material, SI building waterproofing agent and HS-T-3 silicon 
resin, developed by the company have filled the gaps in China's 
science and technology. 
  The company has just transferred 15 research findings to a 
Singapore company, and is using the money earned therefrom to 
build new workshops and other production facilities. 
  The Hangzhou Feishida Computer Technology Company has been 
paying close attention to employing scientists and technicians, 
and offering better working and living conditions for them ever 
since its founding five years ago. 
  With 20 research workers, the company has developed FGC 
color 
high-resolution video control boards and other computer software 
series. 
  After inspecting the company, Song Jian, minister in charge 
of the State Science and Technology Commission, highly praised 
it for making great contributions to the computer industry. 
  An official of the Zhejiang provincial society for 
nongovernmental industrialists specializing in science and 
technology said that the rise of nongovernmental enterprises in 
science has paved the way for transforming scientific findings 
to productivity, and enabled more and more people to see clearly 
the functions and value of scientists and technicians in the 
country's economic development.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 8 (CNS) -- Guangzhou, capital of 
Guangdong Province, suffered a 25.1 percent rise in prices last 
year and inflationary pressures in the city this year has 
continued to increase. The solution to this problem, according 
to the mayor of the city, Mr. Li Ziliu, lies in intensification 
of reform and implementation of regulation and control measures. 
  Mr. Li, speaking yesterday at the second session of the 10th 
municipal People's Congress, said that in order to control and 
stabilize prices in the city, Guangzhou this year must further 
improve its reserve system for important commodities, set up a 
regulation fund for non-staple foodstuff prices, strengthen 
management over markets, especially pay greater attention to the 
management, regulation and control over the prices of 
vegetables, and establish several vegetable wholesale markets in 
its northern and eastern urban districts with the aim of 
reducing the amount of intermediate selling circles. 
  Mr. Li said that management over the meat and slaughtering 
markets would also be tightened and there would be a severe 
cracking down on such activities as purchasing at 
deliberately-forced-down prices, driving up of prices, 
overbearing activities in markets, selling of inferior products 
and the slaughtering of dead and diseased domestic animals. 
  The mayor also asked for strengthened supervision over 
prices, a stop to illegal charges being levied and the raising 
of prices while at the same time the interests of consumers must 
be protected as well as guaranteed stability and smooth 
operation of the markets. 
  The goal set to control the price rise in the city this year 
is 15 percent. 
  The city will focus its efforts of the construction of 18 
shopping centres, 18 wholesale markets, two commercial districts 
and 14 indoor markets and make preparations for the setting up 
of futures markets for grain and edible oil and materials for 
agriculture and petroleum which will operate according to 
international practices, promoting the city's commercial 
business to a high level.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 7 (CNS) -- Commodity inspection 
departments in Guangdong Province last year issued claims to 
related overseas trade dealers seeking claims of US$47 million 
for their low-quality, damaged or insufficient goods. 
  According to statistics, the Guangdong Commodity Inspection 
Bureau last year checked over 400,000 batches of imported and 
exported goods worth US$60.8 billion, more than 8,000 batches of 
which were imported goods valued at US$32.3 billion. 
  According to the bureau, the commodity quality problems 
discovered by the bureau mainly focused on equipment, steel 
products, processed oil, grain and chemical products. Of these 
imported goods with a quality problem, most of the equipment 
coming under this description was out-dated and imported as 
investment by foreign businessmen with their technical 
performance failing to meet an acceptable level or even failing 
to have the basic technical requirements. Some of such 
equipment had been assembled with bad parts and components and 
were in an incomplete state. Some five percent of steel 
products imported via ports in Guangzhou last year were found to 
have quality or quantity problems.

  [Text] Haikou, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Mushrooming private 
high-tech enterprises have contributed greatly to the scientific 
progress and economic development of south China's Hainan 
Province, a senior industry official said here today. 
  In the past years, these enterprises have undertaken most of 
the important research programs in the province and developed 
many new products of national significance, the official said. 
  These products include a microwave cancer killer, artificial 
bone, optic-fibre and natural carotene. 
  The Department of Science and Technology of the provincial 
government last year made a survey of 72 products of 44 private 
high-tech enterprises. 
  The survey showed that most of the 72 products are at or 
near 
advanced international levels. Many are best-selling or have 
great market potential. 
  The province has so far registered more than 1,000 private 
high-tech enterprises, most of them being started and operated 
by scientific researchers or experts. 
  The employees of all these enterprises have a sophisticated 
professional background. The officials said some 5,900 
employees of the around-1,000 enterprises are of senior or 
medium professional level. 
  The official said more than 90 percent of these enterprises 
maintain close co-operation with scientific bodies and 
universities in the interior, where most of the employees came 
from. 
  This very close tie has enabled these enterprises to carry 
out a large part of the early-stage research and even 
manufacture at cheaper costs and formed a powerful backing to 
their development, the official said.

  [Excerpts] [Words indistinct] At 0800 on 24 February, 
provincial CPC Secretary Wang Maolin arrived at the Zhonglian 
Guest House, where members of the Zhuzhou prefectural people's 
deputies delegation were staying. When Secretary Wang, who was 
grinning from ear to ear, entered the meeting hall, the people's 
deputies burst into warm applause. Smiling, Wang Maolin told 
them: Today, I am going to listen to your opinions on Governor 
Chen Bangzhu's government work report, and discuss with you the 
reform in Zhuzhou. 
  Immediately after Comrade Wang Maolin finished speaking, 
(Wang Qingming), mayor of Zhuzhou city, said: The development 
strategy for the whole province formulated by Governor Chen's 
government work report conforms with practical reality. We will 
build Zhuzhou into a hi-tech industrial base, a goods collection 
and distribution base, and a transport, information and 
telecommunications center in the southeastern part of Hunan. 
This is a fairly strenuous task. [passage omitted] 
  During the discussion, enterprise reform and the 
establishment of the system for modern enterprises was an issue 
much discussed by people's deputies. They showed very great 
interest in this topic for discussion. People's Deputies Wu 
Zhenduo, Cui Xinchen, and Ding Aiguo pointed out: It is 
extremely difficult to carry out enterprise reform, and we are 
encountering numerous difficulties. However, it does not work to 
give it up. Wu Zhenduo, chairman of the board of directors of 
the Nanfang Power Machinery Group, expressed his views in light 
of practical reality; after deep consideration, he stressed that 
the three measures taken by us for structural reform are 
comparatively successful as a whole. However, our reform is not 
yet in full swing. [words indistinct] We must push various 
trades and service toward the market. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin, who worked in enterprises for many 
years and has rich management experience, emphasized: The 
method adopted by the Nanfang Corporation is worth popularizing. 
This method for reforming the enterprise system actually means 
socialization of enterprises. State-owned enterprises in 
Zhuzhou's industrial circles must take the lead in this regard, 
and must set an example for the whole province. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin 
made an important speech at the closing ceremony of the second 
session of the seventh provincial CPPCC yesterday afternoon. 
  He said: Our province's CPPCC work mounted a new plane in 
1993. The provincial party committee and the people of the whole 
province are satisfied with that. The tasks in 1994 for all 
work in the province are honorable as well as arduous, and this 
requires us to concentrate forces from all sides, including the 
CPPCC at various levels as well as broad CPPCC members, and give 
play to all positive factors to shape a mighty combined force to 
grasp reform, development, and stability. 
  Comrade Wang Maolin indicated: The central leadership has on 
several occasions stressed that CPPCC work during the new 
historical stage must not be weakened but augmented, completed, 
and perfected. The CPPCC comprises representative figures from 
various social circles: representatives from various democratic 
parties are just part of them. This being the case, we should 
not believe that without democratic parties, the CPPCC 
organization would be dispensable. Comrade Wang Maolin stressed 
that party committees at various levels strengthening leadership 
in a down-to-earth way and all-out support from governments at 
various levels are the crux of giving full play to the CPPCC's 
role. To achieve this, party committees at all levels are 
required to include the improvement and strengthening work of 
the CPPCC on the agenda. They should make arrangements to hear 
reports on the work of the CPPCC twice a year; at the same time, 
they should present topics for research and assign tasks to the 
CPPCC. Party committees and governments at all levels should 
solicit opinions from CPPCC organizations before important 
decisions are presented. This should be shaped into the 
institution. 
  In addition, Comrade Wang Maolin stressed that to give full 
play to the CPPCC's role, CPPCC organizations at all levels must 
work hard to improve their own work, especially augmenting the 
work of various ad hoc committees through reform and giving play 
to the function of CPPCC members in its entirety. In 
particular, he mentioned that CPPCC members who still take 
responsible office in party and government departments should 
take an active part in CPPCC activities which participate in 
government and discuss state affairs while doing a good job of 
their own work. They should not be absent from these activities 
arbitrarily and be members of the CPPCC in name alone.

  [Text] Yesterday [27 February], Governor Chen Bangzhu was 
present at the panel discussions of the Shaoyang city, Hengyang 
city, and Huaihua prefectural delegations, one after another, to 
listen to deputies' suggestions and opinions on the government 
work report. 
  While talking with people's deputies from Shaoyang 
yesterday, 
Governor Chen Bangzhu stressed: As a deputy of Shaoyang, I come 
here today mainly to listen to your proposals and views on the 
government work report. I hope you will speak without any 
inhibitions. Chen Qiusheng, provincial people's deputy and 
manager of the Qingshao cigarette factory; Liu Zhigang, Wugang 
County magistrate; Li Zigang, Xinshao County magistrate; and 
others spoke one after another. In his speech, Deputy Liu 
Zhigang fully affirmed the work achievements of the provincial 
government last year, and favored the arrangements for the work 
this year. He also suggested that large projects be provided 
for Shaoyang. 
  Governor Chen Bangzhu stressed: Modern enterprises must take 
the road of high technology. They must not always think of 
large projects. They must proceed from invigorating themselves. 
  In the afternoon, Governor Chen Bangzhu and Vice Governor 
Zhou Shichang led responsible persons of the provincial 
planning, economic, and construction commissions to take part in 
the discussion of the Hengyang city delegation. (He Xinjun), 
people's deputy and acting major of Hengyang, made a special 
speech in light of the city's practical reality. He said: 
Whether Hunan is attractive is determined by its 
macroenvironment [words indistinct]. It is necessary to further 
form a rational pattern for opening to the outside world, and 
the provincial, city, and county authorities must make concerted 
efforts to set their sights on the outside world so as to place 
their emphasis on an export- oriented economy. Deputy Zhou 
Tongxin talked about the Hengyang railway station reconstruction 
project, and the (Meiliang) airport construction project. 
Governor Chen Bangzhu urged the provincial departments 
concerned to put forward their plans, then and there. 
  After that, Chen Bangzhu came to the panel discussion of the 
Huaihua prefectural delegation. (Hu Zhongyuan), administrative 
commissioner of the prefecture; (Xiang Maolin), chairman of the 
Xupu County People's Congress Standing Committee; and others 
expressed their views on the development of counties and 
districts, the migration from reservoir areas, transportation 
projects, [words indistinct], the integration of policies, and 
so on. Governor Chen Bangzhu answered these questions one after 
another.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 9 (CNS) -- Chengdu police recently 
cracked a large drug trafficking case, seizing 26.9 kg of heroin 
and sending 18 criminals to the justice department for handling. 
  According to the Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Public 
Security, on August 28 last year, police in the Jinmu District 
of Chengdu Municipality learnt that a gang of people were 
engaging in drug trafficking. Police were immediately sent to 
track down and investigate the case after which they were joined 
by another special police team, organized by the provincial, 
municipal, and district public security departments, taking the 
total number of policemen on the case to over 100. The case was 
finally settled after over 170 days of efforts. 
  The drug trafficking gang was made up of illegal elements 
from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangdong. Since the first half of 
1992, these criminals, acting in league with overseas drug 
traffickers, had conducted drug trafficking and smuggling 
activities on several occasions, making profits of several 
millions of renminbi. 
  In this case, the police also confiscated five imported 
luxury cars, over 1 million renminbi, and a number of weapons, 
ammunition, and equipment for drug processing.

  [Text] Carrying with them the expectations of people of 
all nationalities in Tibet, Tibet's deputies to the second 
session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and 
representatives to the second session of the Eighth Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National 
Committee left Lhasa by special plane this morning for Beijing 
for the meetings. 
  To do a good job in presenting the Tibet people's requests, 
suggestions, and expectations at the meetings, the deputies and 
representatives visited grass-roots units and their constituents 
to familiarize themselves with Tibet's economic reform as well 
as its cultural and educational development and the state of 
public health, agriculture, and animal husbandry. They also 
extensively solicited views of cadres and masses in various 
sectors; heard a report given by the regional people's 
government about Tibet's economic affairs in 1993 and reform 
projects for 1994; and discussed many ideas and suggestions with 
regard to Tibet's reform, opening up, and economic, spiritual, 
democratic, and legislative construction. They pledged that 
they would never disappoint the people in Tibet and will convey 
their high expectations to the Beijing meetings. 
  The deputies and representatives were seen off at the 
airport 
by leaders of Tibet and relevant departments.

  [Text] China has engaged in a massive military build-up in 
Tibet and conditions there are getting worse despite U.S. 
pressure for greater respect of human rights, a watchdog group 
said on Thursday [3 March]. "Today there are as many Chinese 
soldiers in Lhasa as there are Tibetans. Tibet, its people, and 
its unique culture are in grave jeopardy," said Lodi Gyari, 
president of the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT). 
  There has been no progress on human rights in Tibet in the 
past year, Gyari said. The ICI showed photographs smuggled out 
of Tibet showing a massive build-up of military facilities, six 
prisons, and huge areas of new housing. The group also 
displayed an official city planning map for Lhasa in the year 
2000 which showed the traditional Tibetan areas of the city 
reduced to virtually nothing -- just the Jokhang and Potala 
palaces, described as cultural and tourist sites. 
  Roads to monasteries in and around Lhasa are frequently the 
sites of military checkpoints, effectively restricting monks' 
movements, and military installations virtually surround many 
monasteries, the ICT said. "ICT and others have documented 
repeated and widespread use of arbitrary detention, torture and 
repression of religious and other civil freedoms throughout 
occupied Tibet," the ICT said. 
  ICT hoped to alert Americans as the country weighed renewal 
of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. President Bill 
Clinton said last year that he would not extend China's MFN 
beyond June 1994 unless Beijing could demonstrate significant 
progress on human rights. One specific request was that China 
begin dialogue with the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama. 
  Gyari endorsed Clinton's call for China to begin talks with 
the Dalai Lama, but said there must be a clear commitment from 
the Chinese government to the time, place and a substantive 
agenda for such negotiations to be useful. "In the case of 
Tibet, China has made no signs of taking steps to protect 
Tibet's unique cultural and religious heritage, as stipulated in 
the president's MFN executive order," the ICT said. 
  Human rights analysts believe the number of political 
prisoners held in Lhasa's six prison camps has risen by 30 
percent in the past year, the ICT said. China has countered 
that Tibet remained at the centre of anti-socialist activity 
from "internal and external hostile forces".

  [Text] It was learned from a work conference on the 
management of cable television, which opened on 4 March, that 
according to relevant decrees and regulations on management 
issued by the State Council and the Ministry of Radio, Film, and 
Television, the Tibet Radio and Television Department, its 
Public Security Bureau, and the State Security Department will 
jointly conduct a comprehensive inspection, registration, and 
rectification of units subscribing to cable television channels 
and owning ground satellite stations in Tibet. 
  Because the work in management and other aspects failed to 
keep abreast with the situation of rapid development, the blind 
expansion of satellite ground stations and cable television 
stations, poor censorship of programs, and other problems have 
cropped up in some areas in Tibet in the past couple of years. 
To solve these problems and to subject the utilization of 
ground facilities for receiving statllite signals and the 
management of cable television to legal administration for 
orderly development, the regional radio and television 
department, public security bureau, and state security 
department will conduct a comprehensive inspection, 
registration, and rectification campaign. 
  All units should immediately stop receiving and relaying 
programs from the BBC; the Chinese Channel, the Entertainment 
Channel, and the Sports Channel of Star TV; and other television 
stations outside Tibet. Units owning two ground satellite 
stations must close down one of them. The Holiday Inn and other 
foreign-funded hotels, which have registered to receive programs 
from outside Tibet, should immediately stop receiving and 
relaying programs from the BBC. Units wishing to receive 
programs from outside Tibet should undergo examination and 
approval procedures again. Units which have applied for the 
installation of such facilities and have received permits for 
installation, permit-holding units which have clearified the 
kinds of programs they are receiving, and units whose installed 
facilities have passed assessment and have obtained permits to 
broadcast programs must go through relevant procedures again 
with the departments concerned by 5 April. Those who do not 
comply with this order will be punished strictly according to 
rules, and those who are involved in serious cases will be 
charged with criminal responsibility.

report. While reviewing last year's work, He Zhiqing said: The 
year 1993 was one in which we implemented in an all-round manner 
the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Governments 
at all levels in our province guided the people of various 
nationalities to constantly deepen reform, make efforts to 
expand opening up, actively speed up development, overcome 
various kinds of difficulties, and create a new situation in 
various work in accordance with the demand of establishing the 
socialist market economy system, and the spirit of the first 
plenary session of the eighth provincial party committee. All 
these were manifested in the following: Our national economy 
maintained its faster pace of development; a new step was taken 
in economic structural reform; results were achieved in 
exercising macroscopic regulation and control; marked 
achievements were made in key construction projects; opening up 
to the outside world was further expanded, and new results 
achieved in education, science and technology, and other 
undertakings; people's livelihood in both urban and rural areas 
was further improved; democracy and the legal system were 
continuously improved; the building of spiritual civilization 
was further strengthened, and phased achievements were made in 
the anticorruption drive and in the promotion of clean, honest 
administration. 
  While talking about the main tasks for 1994, He Zhiqiang 
stressed: The main guideline for the work of the provincial 
government is: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and by the 
party's basic line, we will fully implement the spirit of the 
14th CPC National Congress, and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee to actively promote various reforms, 
with the establishment of a socialist market economy system as 
the target. We will further expand opening up, will continue to 
maintain a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the 
national economy, and will strengthen the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization and the development of democracy and the 
legal system. We will safeguard political stability, and 
promote all-round social progress. In other words, in 
accordance with the major guideline formulated by the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council for the work of the 
entire party and the whole country, and in light of Yunnan's 
local conditions, we will further emancipate our minds, seize 
the favorable opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, 
promote development, and maintain stability. 
  He Zhiqiang continued: To fulfill the various tasks for 
1994, we must devote our main efforts to firmly grasping the 
following 12 kinds of work: 1) Advancing our entire cause, 
giving prominence to focal points, and speeding up the 
establishment of the socialist market economy system; 2) Truly 
strengthening agriculture as a foundation for fully developing 
the rural economy; 3) Firmly grasping production in the 
industrial and transportation fields so as to enhance economic 
results; 4) Maintaining a rational scale of investment in order 
to continue strengtheniong key construction projects; 5) 
Accelerating the pace of adjusting the economic structure so as

inhabited by minority nationalities and in impoverished areas; 
8) Truly doing a good job in making proper arrangements for 
people's livelihood; 9) Accelerating the development of

1421 1730): "Wu Yi on Most-Favored-Nation Status, Says the 
United States Should Not Wield the Big Stick"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (HSIN WAN PAO) -- Wu Yi, minister 
of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said today: "The 
Americans should not wield the big stick when they come to 
China. If they do so, they should not have come." Wu's remarks 
are aimed at U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, who is 
scheduled to arrive in China soon. 
  Wu Yi participated in the opening session of the National 
People's Congress [NPC] this morning as a visitor. Wu was met 
by reporters when she arrived at the meeting hall. 
  Wu Yi said that most-favored-nation [MFN] status is purely a 
trade matter, which should not be linked to politics. 
Therefore, we simply cannot accept the human rights question 
being raised by him (Christopher). This attitude of the Chinese 
Government is well known to the outside world." 
  Wu continued: "The MFN issue is absolutely a trade matter, 
which should be resolved by trade methods. They (United States) 
want to link it to politics. This is totally unacceptable to 
us." 
  Christopher will arrive in Beijing tomorrow.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- The second session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's 
legislature, opened in the Great Hall of the People here this 
morning. 
  Attending today's opening ceremony are 2,808 NPC deputies 
from all over the country and the People's Liberation Army. 
Also attending as nonvoting delegates are more than 1,800 
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference. 
  The current NPC session is regarded as an important meeting 
being convened at a time when China is speeding up the 
establishment of a socialist market economy and accelerating its 
modernization drive. All social sectors in China place high 
hopes on the session. 
  At 9:00, Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee 
and 
an executive chairman of the session presidium, declared the 
opening of the session. 
  Minutes later, Premier Li Peng began delivering a government 
work report to the session. 
  He said, "The sound development of the economy will maintain 
its growth momentum in 1994, an important year for pushing ahead 
with reforms." 
  The premier stressed the importance of correctly handling 
relations between reform, economic development and social 
stability. 
  He said, "economic development is the center of all our 
work, 
reform and opening up are the motive force of development, and 
development and reform are the foundation of long-term social 
and political stability in China; and social stability, in turn, 
is a prerequisite for economic development and smooth progress 
in reform." 
  The premier said that, to ensure a sustained, rapid and 
sound 
development of the national economy, the growth rate of China's 
gross domestic product (GDP) for 1994 has been set at nine 
percent. 
  In the wake of 13 percent increases for China's national 
economy in the last two consecutive years, the growth rate 
planned for 1994 is both "vigorous and appropriate." 
  The government work report runs about 16,000 words, 4,000 
fewer than a similar report he delivered a year ago. Li Peng 
devoted two-fifths of his report to China's economic work and 
new reform measures adopted by the government since the 
beginning of 1994. 
  The report covers seven parts: a review of government work 
in domestic affairs in 1993 and basic principles for work in 
1994; maintaining a steady, rapid and sound development of the 
national economy; speeding up the establishment of a socialist 
market economy; expanding scientific and technological 
undertakings and developing education and culture; strengthening 
socialist democracy and the legal system; promoting the peaceful 
reunification of China; and China's diplomatic work. 
  Attending today's session are leaders of the Chinese 
Communist Party and the government Jiang Zemin, Li Ruihuan, Zhu 
Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren. 
  In attendance are also diplomatic envoys to China. 
  About 1,000 Chinese and foreign reporters are in the Chinese 
capital to cover the session. 
  The Central Broadcasting Station, the China Central 
Television Station and China Radio International are giving the 
session live coverage.

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong members 
attending the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) 
issued here today a statement on Hong Kong Governor Chris 
Patten's tabling of the remaining parts of his political reform 
bill. 
  Following is the full text of the statement: 
  On March 9, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten tabled the 
remaining parts of his political reform bill to the Legislative 
Council for the first reading. This is yet another deliberate 
violation by the British Hong Kong authorities of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law of Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region and earlier agreements and 
understandings reached between China and Britain, and another 
demonstration of the British Hong Kong authorities' policy of 
confrontation with China. We hereby issue our solemn statement 
as follows: 
  1. The talks on the arrangement of the 1994-95 election of 
Hong Kong between the Governments of China and Britain have 
terminated because the British side unilaterally tabled to the 
Legislative Council its political reform bill that violates the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and agreements and 
understandings reached by the two sides, thereby disrupting the 
talks completely. The three-tier legislative structure that the 
British Hong Kong authorities set up according to its political 
reform bill naturally comes to an end by June 30, 1997. Hong 
Kong members of the CPPCC National Committee fully support 
relevant declarations and stand of the Chinese Government 
pertaining to the establishment of the first government of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its three-tier 
legislative structure on July 1, 1997 in accordance with the 
Basic Law and relevant resolutions of the National People's 
Congress (NPC). 
  2. We hereby ask the central government to accelerate 
preparation work for the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region, speed up work pace and make all necessary preparations 
so as to ensure a smooth transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty and 
maintain its stability and prosperity.

<F P=106> ["Dispatch" by WEN WEI PO reporting team: "Farmlands and </F>
Output Have Reduced Over Consecutive Years; Guangdong's 
Agricultural Situation Is Still Grave"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Feb -- At the ongoing meeting of the 
Guangdong Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], many CPPCC members called for 
paying serious attention to agricultural production. Liang 
Lifeng, on behalf of the Guangdong Committee of the China 
Democratic League, made a speech at the meeting pointing out 
that although Guangdong had made great achievements in 
agricultural reform, it had not fundamentally changed 
instability in agriculture's position, instability in 
agricultural production, and instability in the peasants' minds. 
  A sharp decrease in farmlands and a rapid increase in the 
population are Guangdong's important characteristics upon 
entering the 1990's. In 1992, the net decrease in the 
province's farmlands amounted to 1.1423 million mu, equivalent 
to the area of a medium-sized county; whereas in the first three 
years of the 1990's, the population increased by 1.6667 million 
annually, equivalent to the populations of two medium-sized 
counties. In 1992, the province's per capita possession of 
farmland was 0.56 mu, 74 percent of the amount in the previous 
10 years. Facing this grim situation, a provincial meeting on 
protecting farmlands held at the end of last year clarified that 
farmland in the province should be increased instead of being 
reduced. On this point, Liang Lifeng suggested formulating a 
policy to actively support and encourage the work of restoring 
and expanding farmland, adding that certain percentages of the 
taxes and charges collected by land management departments from 
renting out and transferring farmland should be used for 
restoring and expanding farmland. 
  Last year's decrease in Guangdong's grain production was the 
third decrease, subsequent to 1991 and 1992. It was also the 
second major decrease since the founding of the PRC (the first 
happened in 1985). It is true that to a certain degree, natural 
disasters caused this major decrease, but a more important 
factor was the reduction in the acreage of farmland. An 
authoritative person said that Guangdong should have at least 50 
million mu of land planted to grain, but last year Guangdong's 
grain acreage had fallen below the critical line, to stand at 48 
million mu. The cost of growing grain is high, 50 kg for 47 
yuan; but the selling price is low, 50 kg for 42 to 55 yuan. So 
the peasants are far from being able to get average profits from 
social production. "Low grain prices have hurt the peasants" 
and have caused their initiative in grain production to drop. 
Liang Lifeng appealed by saying: First, investment in 
agriculture, which is a "weak industry," should be increased. 
Last year, Guangdong's agricultural investment accounted for 
only 7.27 percent of its financial expenditure, a decrease of 
5.81 percent in comparison with 1980. The percentage of 
agricultural investment in financial expenditure should be 
raised to 10 to 12 percent. Second, grain protection prices 
should be raised; the grain protection price of 50 kg for 70 
yuan, which has been fixed by the provincial government, should 
be observed. Third, agricultural loans should be ensured so 
that they are used for grain and other agricultural production. 
Fourth, it is necessary to develop economies of scale.

<F P=106> [By Tiffany Bown] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (AFP)--China's National People's 
Congress (NPC) opens its annual session here Thursday, planning 
to usher in a year of legislation that will lay the framework 
for establishing a socialist market economy. 
  NPC Chairman Qiao Shi told a preparatory meeting Wednesday 
that the session "is extremely important since it is convened at 
a time when China is establishing a socialist market economic 
structure and marching on the road of modernisation," XINHUA 
reported. 
  Nearly 3,000 delegates to the 13-day second session of the 
eighth NPC are expected to approve the economic and social 
development plan and the budget for 1994, as well as examining a 
draft budget law, NPC spokesman Zhou Jue told journalists. 
  The delegates are also to study Premier Li Peng's government 
work report, likely to focus on efforts to cool the overheated 
economy. 
  Zhou said that this year the NPC and its standing committee 
"will accelerate the pace of legislation so as to roughly put in 
place the legal framework necessary for the establishment of the 
socialist market economy." 
  Some 152 pieces of legislation, of which 53 relate to 
economic reform, are due to be dealt with in 1994, compared with 
19 and 12 respectively last year. 
  A Western diplomat, however, doubted the NPC would succeed 
in 
laying the legal framework for a socialist market economy this 
year, saying much of the planned legislation covered relatively 
minor issues. Legislation in vital areas like banking and 
securities would take longer than originally planned, as the 
Chinese authorities were now taking a "reality check" on the 
amount of preparatory work necessary, the diplomat said. 
  Zhou made no mention of any banking legislation and 
acknowledged that problems remained in progress towards a 
long-awaited securities law. "Securities is a new subject so we 
lack adequate experience to cope with it," Zhou said, adding 
that "more careful study" was needed. 
  Qiao said the NPC session would be guided by the theories of 
senior leader Deng Xiaoping and the communist party's basic 
line, thereby indicating that political reform was not on the 
agenda. 
  NPC spokesman Zhou appeared to rule out consideration of 
long-standing proposals to replace legal clauses on 
"counter-revolutionary crimes" -- frequently used to detain 
dissidents -- with references to specific violations. 
  "Counter-revolutionary crimes as contained in China's 
criminal law refers to crimes that endanger state security," he 
said. "I think for such crimes that endanger state security it 
deserves punishment in every country." 
  Zhou also defended the NPC's reputation as little more than 
a 
rubber-stamp body [as received], saying the system of China's 
parliament "fully suited the national conditions of my country." 
"China's National People's Congress is different from 
parliaments in other countries and we will not mechanically copy 
the experiences of others," he said. 
  In a vivid reminder that dissenting views will not be 
entertained, China has recently launched a crackdown on 
political activists, detaining them or escorting them from the 
capital to ensure the NPC's smooth running. 
  The 163-member NPC presidium, elected Wednesday, includes 
89- 
year-old Deng -- who retired from his last official post in 1990 
-- as well as President Jiang Zemin. Deng, who looked frail and 
dazed when he appeared in public last month for the first time 
in one year, was also a member of the 1993 NPC presidium but did 
not make an appearance. 
  The NPC, created in 1954, is elected every five years and 
convenes an annual plenary session. Its standing committee 
meets several times a year to examine and adopt laws.

<F P=106> [Report by LIEN HO PAO news team: "CPC Bans the Media From </F>
Reporting on Dark Aspects During the Two Sessions"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar -- Several days ago, the CPC 
Propaganda Department instructed the mainland media not to 
report on dark aspects of society during the sessions of the 
National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and not to discuss 
controversial policies, but to disseminate the slogan of 
"stability overwhelming everything." In this year's propaganda 
work, the CPC has particularly stressed the importance of 
stability, and this has been rare in recent years. 
  Prior to these two sessions, the CPC held a "national 
propaganda and ideological work meeting," asking the localities 
to maintain unanimity with the Central Committee in propaganda 
work. Recently, it particularly urged the media to focus on 
"stability" when reporting on the two sessions, instead of 
providing news that might lead to social instability. The news 
to be banned from coverage includes: 
  -- Inflation: Despite the CPC plan to control inflation 
below 10 percent this year, commodity prices in many big Chinese 
cities had increased by more than 20 percent in the first two 
months of this year. People are anticipating price increases, 
and many NPC and CPPCC deputies are concerned about price 
increases. With the principle of "stability overwhelming 
everything" in command, the CPC will not allow the media to 
report on inflation. 
  -- Pay arrears: State-owned enterprises have suffered from 
losses for many consecutive years and many units have been 
unable to pay wages. Although the CPC has announced pay 
increases, many enterprises cannot even pay the pre-increase 
wages. In addition, some retired workers are earning small 
pensions, and their welfare and insurance have been abolished; 
this has caused resentment among medium- and low-wage earners. 
The CPC has instructed the media not discuss these problems, 
which might cause instability in society. 
  -- Deterioration of social order: Social order is generally 
worsening in mainland cities and rural areas. Not long ago, 
looting of grain occurred in Hunan, and looting of oil happened 
in Shanghai. Social news is the favorite of the mainland media 
and the scale of coverage has increased. Therefore the CPC has 
restricted such coverage. 
  -- New theoretical controversy: Last year, there was much 
controversy in mainland academic circles and among government 
officials over ownership rights and development rates. The CPC 
has urged the media not to discuss these unconcluded issues, 
and everything must proceed according to the decision of the 
14th CPC National Congress. 
  Moreover, the CPC also has instructed the media not to 
provide news on high consumption, waste and extravagance, or 
high educational fees, for fear of evoking resentment among 
low-wage earners. In addition, the CPC has urged the media to 
have confidence in the "combat against corruption" and to 
continue providing positive coverage. 
  This year the CPC will introduce a number of reform measures 
that will involve the redistribution of major interests and may 
cause turbulence in society. Therefore in propaganda work the 
CPC will pay more attention to "stability" than the previous 
years, and will chant the slogan "stability must take precedence 
over everything."

Ai Feng (5337 0023): "Moving Toward Maturity for Another Year 
-- Written on the Eve of the Opening of the NPC and CPPCC 
National Committee Sessions"] 
  [Text] "Here comes yet another spring verdant with 
sprouting grass." This year's "two sessions" are soon to open. 
  The past year was the first year after the party proposed 
building the socialist market economy at its 14th national 
congress. Though the voyage has not been "soul-stirring," it 
nevertheless followed "an uneven course." It has been a year of 
moving toward maturity. 
  At this year's "two sessions," the deputies [to the National 
People's Congress (NPC)] and members [of the national committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
(CPPCC) ] will deliberate and discuss the government work 
report. They will naturally have a lot to say about this major 
subject. 
<H3>  Seize the Opportunity: A Year of Brilliant Achievements. 
The "Resolution" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee Is An Important Sign of "Moving Toward 
Maturity" </H3>
  People probably still remember clearly, even without looking 
through the old papers, that the keynote or hottest topic at 
last year's "two sessions" was "to seize the opportunity and 
speed up development" and "to seize the opportunity and speed up 
reform." This inspiring, enthusiastic momentum was especially 
keenly felt at the news briefings held in various provinces. 
  One year has passed. The situation and figures indicate that 
the desired results were achieved. 
  The GDP exceeded 3 trillion yuan, up 13.4 percent over the 
previous year; a bumper agricultural harvest was reaped and the 
added value of agriculture grew by 4 percent, with total grain 
output reaching 456.4 billion kg; the "bottleneck" industries 
were strengthened, and new records were created in the 
construction of new railway lines and the conversion of 
single-line tracks to multiple tracks; the total retail volume 
of consumer goods grew 11.6 percent over the previous year, with 
price hikes factored in; and so on and so forth. In a word, 
last year, China's economy carried forward the fast growth it 
had experienced in 1992. 
  On the front of reform, the regulations on the "change of 
mechanism" for state-owned enterprises were implemented; diverse 
economic sectors were developed; explorations were made for the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system; price reform was 
deepened; and grain prices were decontrolled in more than 90 
percent of all counties (cities). More importantly, proposals 
for the reform of the financial and tax system, the monetary 
system, the investment system, and the foreign trade system were 
formulated and promulgated one after another. 
  What is particularly important is that the "Decision of the 
CPC Central Committee on Certain Issues Concerning the 
Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System," made at 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last 
November showed so complete a structure, so well-defined a 
framework, so original a mental approach, and such closely 
combined theory and practice that it amazed people both in and 
outside China. The birth of this magnificent and scientific 
blueprint that maps out the reform of our country in this 
century signals that our reform has smoothly reached the 
critical stage of overall advance and is also the most important 
indication that we have begun "moving toward maturity." 
  "Ah, the unique view unfolds on this side of the trail." (A 
line from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1934) Today, what 
people both within and outside the country can see is a 
socialist China enjoying economic development, political 
stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress. 
  Have the Chinese seized the opportunity? How was the 
government work in the past year? The talks made by the 
old-generation revolutionaries, such as Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
and Comrade Chen Yun, just before the Spring Festival can be 
seen as a positive answer to this question on behalf of the 
whole nation. 
<H3>  Macroregulation and Control: The Unforgettable 1993. 
Deepening the Comprehensive Understanding of Socialist Market 
Economy Through Practice Is Yet Another Manifestation of "Moving 
Toward Maturity" </H3>
  "Macroregulation and control" was probably the most 
characteristic content in 1993 economic life. 
  When people were throwing enormous fervor into economic 
development and when the planned economy was being converted to 
the market economy at an accelerated pace, the inadequacy of 
understanding, the lack of experience, and the limiting angles 
often gave rise to some "blind spots" in people's vision. 
  In the context of rapid economic development, should we 
guard against "overheating?" How shall we assess the messages 
from the "development zone rush," the "stocks rush," and the 
"real estate rush?" Is the latent deep-level danger growing? 
Faced with these and other questions, for a time, people 
developed differing opinions. At the end of the year before 
last, the central authorities gave some warning to "prevent 
overheating." Last year, at the beginning of the year and in 
March and April, the central authorities issued more reminders. 
But people did not quickly come to a consensus. The thought 
that "if you are overheated, I am not" became an argument "not 
for publication;" "I will do it my way" was interpreted as 
"market behavior;" and the "uneven heat distribution" caused by 
structural and inter-regional imbalance seemed to provide 
"evidence" for such ideas. As proved time and again by history, 
the phenomenon of "rushing headlong into action" that 
overstepped the bounds of feasibility resulting from "emulation" 
in "doing something good" is the most difficult to stop. People 
have been too eager to speed up development. 
  But the most sensitive economic barometer, commodity prices, 
issued a serious warning. Not only did the price of steel 
products soar, the cost of living index in large cities exceeded 
22 percent! Furthermore, there was serious disorder in the 
monetary sector, the lifeblood of the national economy: 
unchecked interbank loaning, rampant fund-raising, direct and 
indirect participation of banks in speculative real estate 
deals, and the excessive release of banknotes. If these 
problems could not be solved in good time, major fluctuations 
would be inevitable. 
  It was under these circumstances that the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council resolutely made the decision to 
strengthen and improve macroregulation and control. After that, 
the people's ideas gradually converged. 
  The work on macroregulation and control was naturally 
difficult, but the desired results were soon achieved and what 
is commonly known as a "soft landing" was realized. The 
phenomenon of "issuing IOU's to purchase agricultural products," 
the solution to which had been demanded for many years, has been 
greatly changed this year, winning praise. 
  Yet there is no need for reticence about the fact that the 
effects of macroregulation and control on the economic life are 
also multifaceted. The latent problems in some areas, which 
were born out of "overheating" were exposed earlier than they 
would have been because of the implementation of the regulation 
and control measures; other parts, due to lack of experience in 
controlling the strength and method of regulation and control, 
felt new difficulties. "Macroregulation and control" itself, 
for a time, became the most talked about and thought about issue. 
<H3>  Work as One: Overall Advancement of Reform. To Give Full 
Play to Our Advantages in Implementation Is an Important 
Guarantee for "Moving Toward Maturity" </H3>
  "Macroregulation and control" was designed not to "check and 
stifle," but to "check and enliven." The new practice and new 
thinking in this area have generated two achievements that are 
of profound and far-reaching significance. 
  Achievement one: People have come to realize that the market 
economy also requires macroregulation and control, which, at the 
current stage in the transition, should be even strengthened; 
and that today's macroregulation and control must conform to the 
market economy and therefore must be improved. It is essential 
to reform as well as an important element of reform. 
  Achievement two: Under the leadership of the central 
authorities, a blueprint for realizing the socialist market 
economy in China was well drawn in terms of theory and the 
overall framework. In terms of concrete operations, various 
reform proposals were well designed after sufficient 
investigation, research, and repeated consultations and, with 
the right opportunity, were promulgated in good time. 
  During the system changeover, what must be avoided at all 
costs is the "overlapping" of two problems. What kind of 
trouble will be created if enterprises that are not yet capable 
of "self-restraint" and a "laissez-faire market" come together? 
In the final analysis, whether we are looking at a problem 
which macroregulation and control aims to solve or a difficulty 
that macroregulation and control itself encounters, there are 
always underlying causes in the system. That is why it is only 
logical that strengthening and improving "macroregulation and 
control" should lead the way in the overall deepening of reform. 
  There were also all kinds of comments and worries about the 
various reform proposals, especially those for financial and tax 
reform. 
  Considering the risks of the "merging of two exchange 
rates," 
even foreign experts were seized with deep concern for us. In 
June, the exchange rate of U.S. dollars to renminbi reached 
1:12, and some people even predicted that it would go up to 
1:15. Could we hold our ground? But no sooner had the 
macroregulation and control measures been published than the 
exchange rate started to drop. After moving on a downward curve 
for some time, it rebounded. But the state exercised regulation 
and control with economic means, quickly stabilized the 
situation, and kept it down. Through this process, the state 
even obtained more foreign exchange. Comments coming from China 
and overseas said: That was a brilliant job! 
  The reform of the tax system is considered worldwide to be 
one of the most difficult reforms. It once took the Japanese 
Diet three terms to adopt a new tax regime. It has been said 
that Mrs. Thatcher's stepping down was somewhat related to the 
change in the tax regime. A senior U.S. official said: In the 
United States, whoever does this job is probably the most 
unpopular person in the entire country. This is because any 
change in the tax system would touch the most extensive scope of 
interests. 
  The current situation of China's tax system reform is 
different from that in the West, but people are nevertheless 
still worried that it will run into obstruction, give rise to 
disputes, and cause a shock. But the actual progress that has 
been made so far may well be called another "exception to the 
rule." It has not only exceeded what was generally predicted 
abroad, but has also been much smoother than what we ourselves 
originally imagined. Judging from what happened in January this 
year, the operation of the new tax system was normal. Though 
there were some operational problems in the convergence of old 
and new procedures, they did not have any negative impact on 
production and circulation. Tax revenue in January was 61 
percent higher than the same period last year. As well as being 
a result of growth in production, it is also an achievement of 
the new tax system. Naturally, however, this is just a 
beginning. 
  The above facts are another proof of this truth: In 
socialist China led by the communist party, as long as the 
central authorities, local authorities, and the people at all 
levels in the whole country work with one mind and make 
concerted efforts, any difficulties on the path ahead can be 
surmounted. 
<H3>  Deepen Reform: The Focal Point of This Year's Work. To 
Handle Well the Relationship Among Reform, Development, and 
Stability Is the Key to "Moving Toward Maturity" </H3>
  At the beginning of the year, the central authorities put 
forward the 20-character principle, namely, "to seize the 
opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote 
development, and maintain stability [zhua zhu ji yu, shen hua 
gai ge, kuo da kai fang, cu jin fa zhan, bao chi wen ding 2119 
0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 2368 1129 7030 2397 0191 6651 
4099 1455 0202 2170 4489 1353]. 
  The forthcoming two sessions are bound to understand and 
implement this principle at greater depth. 
  This year, when a number of major reform measures were being 
promulgated at the same time, the "acceleration" had in a sense 
become reality; and to implement these proposals and to carry on 
with reform in greater depth and in a down-to-earth manner is 
now the most important task. 
  Development is the last word. Development also requires a 
new mental approach. In the context of rapid development, the 
key to avoiding the "chronic maladies" that have easily cropped 
up in past years is to introduce new mechanisms through reform 
and to push forward and catalyze development with the new 
mechanisms. 
  This might constitute the background against which last 
year's "acceleration" can be converted to this year's 
"deepening" and "promotion." 
  --How shall we continue to handle well the relationship 
among 
reform, development, and stability? 
  --How shall we continue to realize the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy [chi xu, kuai su, jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 
1660] development of the national economy? How should we 
interpret the word "healthy?" 
  --How can the stabilization of commodity prices be achieved? 
How is it intrinsically related to control on the scale of 
capital construction? 
  --How can the exploration of ways to establish a modern 
enterprise system be integrated with the enhancement of the 
economic efficiency of state-owned enterprises? 
  --How can such matters as anticorruption operation and 
improvement on social security, which people are concerned with, 
continue to be strengthened? 
  People are hoping that, at this year's two sessions, the 
deputies and members will discuss these important issues from a 
higher, deeper, and more comprehensive perspective and make the 
corresponding decisions. 
  "Another year of yearning, to the twittering of the 
swallows." The "two sessions," to be held in the spring season 
which is full of vitality and hope, herald a still more colorful 
[duo zi duo cai 1122 1217 1122 1752] future. 
  People believe that, on the road of China's construction of 
the socialist market economy, 1994 will certainly be another 
year of "moving toward maturity!"

<F P=106> ["Special Dispatch": "There Are Deletions and Supplements </F>
in Li Peng's Report on the Work of the Preliminary Working 
Committee"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar -- Sources at the "two sessions" 
have disclosed that a new paragraph stressing the work of the 
Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] has been added to the part 
of Li Peng's Government Work Report which deals with the Hong 
Kong issue. 
  It has been learned that the session today withdrew all 
copies of Li Peng's Government Work Report already distributed 
to CPPCC members, replacing them with copies of a revised 
version this evening. 
  In the revised version of Li Peng's Government Work Report, 
a 
new paragraph has been added to the part dealing with the Hong 
Kong issue. 
  The original version: The British side should be 
held fully responsible for the breakup of the Sino-British 
talks. According to the decision of the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress, the Preliminary Working 
Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region has begun its work. 
  Inserting a new paragraph: Tasks are arduous and 
the responsibility is heavy. It is our hope that the 
Preliminary Working Committee can unite Hong Kong compatriots in 
the most extensive way, succeed in all fields of work in 
preparation for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, as well 
as its first session of government and legislature, and live up 
to the expectations and great trust of the people of the whole 
country. 
  Joining the original version: No matter what 
twists and turns we may face, the Chinese Government and people 
have the determination and ability to exercise sovereignty over 
Hong Kong as scheduled, and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term 
stability and prosperity. Britain's colonialist rule over Hong 
Kong is coming to an end and no force on earth can stop it from 
happening.

  [Text] Wan Dan, a leader of the 1989 student movement, who 
was arrested and released by the authorities the day before 
yesterday, late last night faxed to the Hong Kong media an open 
letter to the two meetings entitled "Safeguard Human Rights, 
Enhance Social Stability," urging the two meetings to show 
concern for the political rights and natural human rights of the 
individual. Wang Dan held that the living standard of the 
Chinese people has improved somewhat as compared with the past 
and that it is time at present to show concern for the rights of 
the individual. 
  In his open letter, Wang Dan stated that he will 
unyieldingly 
investigate the human rights situation of the Chinese people and 
will, "within the scope permitted by law," "openly" investigate 
cases involving human rights. He stated that he is mentally 
prepared for being "suppressed" and will never feel "regret." 
  Wang Dan emphasized that "the democratic movement is not an 
antigovernment movement and safeguarding human rights is not 
subverting the government." 
  The full text of Wang Dan's open letter is as follows: 
  Deputies to the Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC] and members attending the Second Session 
of the Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC] National Committee: 
  The Constitution of the PRC stipulates: Citizens have the 
right to make suggestions and to criticize any state organ. On 
the occasion of the opening of the "two meetings," I, in the 
capacity of an ordinary PRC citizen, want to put forward my own 
views on some issues in the political life of the country for 
the reference of the deputies and members. 
  I support the reform and opening up policy pursued by the 
authorities and agree that in the course of reform and opening 
up the living standard of the people has improved somewhat as 
compared with the past. It is precisely because of this that I 
think that in China today the issue of the right to subsistence 
has been resolved and, therefore, the safeguarding of the 
political rights and natural human rights of the individual 
should naturally be put on the agenda of the meetings. 
Respecting human rights is a commitment of the socialist state. 
However, it is undeniable that some problems exist in the 
course of implementation. I make no attempt to conceal the 
truth that on the human rights issue my views differ from those 
of the authorities in many aspects, but I do not want to impose 
my views on the government. I only hope that the government 
will, in enforcing the law, handle affairs strictly according to 
law and earnestly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests 
of citizens (including those under detention or serving 
sentences). Therefore, I am willing to make known to the 
authorities my activities. I will, in my own personal capacity, 
carry out detailed investigations into specific cases involving 
human rights and, with seeking truth from facts and obtaining 
the approval of the people concerned as a prerequisite, discuss 
with parties concerned some phenomena of serious infringements 
of human rights on behalf of the people concerned or their 
family dependents. If I fail, I will make appeals in a 
legitimate and open manner. I will adhere to two basic 
principles in all my activities: 
  1. Acting within the scope permitted by existing law; 
  2. Openness. 
  NPC deputies and CPPCC members, I would like to take this 
opportunity to let you know my basic stance on human rights. 
Promoting reform and opening up and maintaining social stability 
are the main themes of the "two meetings" and are also the 
common aspirations of ourselves and the authorities. I think 
that promoting social stability and safeguarding human rights 
are not mutually opposed; on the contrary, energetically 
safeguarding work on human rights and arousing the enthusiasm of 
people of various strata is a move which conforms to the wishes 
of the people and can strengthen China's international position. 
This is an important requisite for promoting social stability. 
  I fully understand that safeguarding human rights and 
developing democracy is a gradual and orderly process. 
Therefore, I do not ask the authorities to do anything at once, 
but I hope the authorities at least can refrain from anything 
such as serious infringements on human rights. I think this is 
in conformity with the initial stage of socialism and can be 
done at present. 
  Here, I must emphatically point out: 
  The democratic movement is not an antigovernment movement. 
  Safeguarding human rights is not subverting political power. 
  My going around campaigning on specific human rights cases 
proceeds from humanitarianism. I am concerned with whether or 
not the rights and interests and the dignity of the individual 
are protected and respected. The ultimate goal is to maintain 
social stability and to promote the progress of democracy. My 
activities are not aimed at the Chinese Government, but at 
specific problems. I hope my good and honest wishes can be 
understood by NPC deputies, CPPCC members, and the authorities. 
At the same time, I am also willing to take responsibility for 
them. 
  I thoroughly understand that in the political environment in 
China at present, it is necessary to take some risks in raising 
objections to the behavior of the government. I am mentally 
prepared for suppression by organs of dictatorship because of 
this. However, I will feel no regret. I believe that what I am 
doing is just and conforms with the three requirements I set for 
myself when I was discharged from prison in February 1993: Not 
letting down the people, not letting down history, and not 
letting down my own conscience. 
  Wishing the two meetings complete success! 
  Wang Dan

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Members of the Eighth 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) gave high marks to the committee 
for its outstanding work in 1993. 
  The National Committee did a good job last year in expanding 
exchanges with the outside world, offering advices on major 
state affairs and strengthening investigative work by its 
special committees, members said at group discussions here today. 
  The CPPCC National Committee is having its second plenary 
session in Beijing. 
  Hu Xuping, a member from Kunming City of Yunnan Province, 
said the visit to three countries in South Asia by Li Ruihuan, 
chairman of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, was a great 
success and has further consolidated China's friendly relations 
with them. 
  Members expressed satisfaction at the adoption of their 
suggestions on important state affairs by the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party and the central government. 
  Wang Jue, a well-known economist, said CPPCC should play a 
greater role in participating in state affairs. He suggested 
the CPPCC National Committee dispatch special investigative 
groups to large state-owned enterprises to gather first-hand 
information as a first step to offering good advices. 
  Wang Muheng from Xiamen University said that CPPCC should 
help the mainland establish direct transport and commercial 
links with Taiwan by using its resources. He said his 
university is to enroll more Taiwan students soon. 
  Ye Xuanping, a vice-chairman of the CPPCC National 
Committee, 
attended a group discussion held by representatives of the 
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, China's Chamber 
of Commerce. He urged CPPCC members to bear in mind the 
country's central task of developing productive forces and 
improving the living standard of the people. "CPPCC members 
should unite people of all social circles for fulfilling this 
central task," he said.

"CPPCC Member Bluntly Says CPC Indulges in Idle Talk"] 
  [Text] The Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] began its panel discussions yesterday. Many 
members launched fierce verbal attacks on the agriculture and 
education issues and on fighting corruption and promoting clean 
government. Getting worked up, one member blurted out: "What 
the CPC is saying is idle talk." 
  CPPCC members have more complaints about the issue of 
fighting corruption and promoting clean government. A member 
said: In his report to the preparatory meeting of the CPPCC on 
anticorruption work launched last August, Wei Jianxing, 
secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, said 
that the central authorities had investigated and dealt with 
eight major cases. This fully shows the determination of the 
central authorities to fight corruption. However, this member 
suggested that the central authorities should persist in 
fighting and stamping out corruption. Especially as the current 
methods of offering and taking bribes are being renewed all the 
time and when there is neither a third party present nor a 
receipt written in the course of handing over and taking bribe 
money, it is difficult to investigate and deal with such cases. 
Moreover, since corruption is widespread in economic 
departments, it is even more necessary to sternly stamp out 
corruption there.

<F P=106> [Dispatch from Beijing by LIEN HO PAO News Team: "CPPCC </F>
Members Press for the Right to Vote"] 
  [Text] Many CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference) members yesterday demanded that the CPPCC should 
enjoy more real powers or even the right to vote like that 
exercised by the upper houses in foreign countries yesterday, 
the first day for group discussions. Again, many CPPCC members 
were dissatisfied with the contents of the report on work done 
by the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee and leveled 
many criticisms at it. 
  The economic group is a new group set up by the Eighth 
National CPPCC Congress and also a dynamic group. The economic 
group held two wonderful discussions at the Beijing Jingfeng 
Guest House yesterday. When commenting on the role of CPPCC 
members, Xu Qingxiong, board-of-directors chairman of the 
Shanghai Wanguo Stock Company, said: "CPPCC members should not 
be content with discussing state affairs. However, they are not 
entitled to participate in shaping policy decisions and can only 
express their views when the policies have been published." 
  He added: "For example, in foreign countries tax reform is 
decided on after lengthy debate. But in China, CPPCC members 
had no idea about it until the tax reform program was 
published." Zhao Weichen, convener of the economic group, 
responded: "Opinions of CPPCC members should be solicited 
before any decisions are made." 
  CPPCC members can presently participate in the 
administration 
and discussion of state affairs but enjoy no right to vote in 
formulating policies and bills. In his speech, Wei Yuming, 
CPPCC member and former deputy minister of foreign economic 
relations and trade, pressed for the right to vote for CPPCC 
members. He said that the government work report as well as 
important policy decisions should be presented to the CPPCC for 
discussions before rather than after they are published. 
  Wei said that CPPCC members are not representatives because 
"they are appointed by the authorities." He believed that CPPCC 
members' right to participate in the administration and 
discussion of state affairs should be given legal status. He 
further pointed out: "Abroad, CPPCC delegation usually call on 
the upper house or the senate. But the upper house has the 
right to vote while the CPPCC has not. I explained the CPPCC's 
role whenever upper house members asked me about it, but they 
did not understand what I said despite my earnest efforts. To 
participate in the administration of state affairs, the CPPCC 
must enjoy the right to vote. The CPPCC should have the same 
power and functions as those enjoyed by upper houses in foreign 
countries under the new historical situation." 
  In his report on the work done by the CPPCC National 
Committee Standing Committee, the vice chairman of the committee 
Ye Xuanping said that CPPCC members "should fulfill their duties 
without overstepping their authority." This statement evoked 
dissatisfaction from many CPPCC members. Tian Yinong, CPPCC 
National Committee Standing Committee member and former deputy 
finance minister, said he does not understand what is meant by 
overstepping authority. Another CPPCC member Lu Zhongmin, 
board-of-directors chairman of the First Luoyang Tractor Plant, 
said: "There would be no problem of `overstepping the 
authority' if the rules and regulations were strictly observed. 
Such problems, if any, should not have been raised in the 
report on work done by the CPPCC National Committee Standing 
Committee."

<F P=106> [Interview with Hu Sheng, vice chairman of the CPPCC </F>
National Committee and deputy head of the task force for 
amending the CPPCC constitution, by unidentified XINHUA 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- The draft amendments to 
the "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] have been submitted to the Second Plenary 
Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee. A XINHUA 
reporter has conducted an interview with Hu Sheng, vice chairman 
of the CPPCC National Committee and deputy head of the task 
force for amending the CPPCC constitution. 
  [Reporter] The "Draft Amendments to the CPPCC Constitution" 
have been submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth 
CPPCC National Committee for examination. As deputy head of the 
task force for amending the CPPCC Constitution, would you please 
talk about the process of the revision. 
  [Hu] In May 1993, the Second Standing Committee Session of 
the Eighth CPPCC National Committee adopted the "Decision on 
Partial Revision of the CPPCC Constitution." A task force was 
set up with Li Ruihuan as its head and Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqing, 
and me as the deputy heads. After half a year of work, the 
"Draft Amendments to the CPPCC Constitution" have been completed 
and submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC 
National Committee for examination. 
  [Reporter] Why is it necessary to revise the present 
constitution? 
  [Hu] The present constitution was revised in 1982 under the 
leadership of Deng Xiaoping, who was then chairman of the CPPCC 
National Committee. It was a good constitution which played an 
important role in ushering in a new situation in CPPCC work in 
the new period. In the past 12 years, we have made tremendous 
progress in reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization 
drive, and the state has undergone profound changes. 
Especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made those talks when 
he visited the south and the convocation of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, China has entered a new phase of reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive. To meet the 
requirements of these changes, necessary revisions have been 
made to the Constitution, the CPC Constitution, and the 
constitutions of the democratic parties. Therefore requisite 
revisions to the CPPCC Constitution should also be made. 
  [Reporter] What are the principles you followed in drafting 
the amendments the CPPCC Constitution this time? 
  [Hu] In drafting the amendments, our principle is to take 
the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress as our guidance, to 
make the changes converge with the amendments to the state 
constitution, and to emphasize the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, the basic line for the primary 
stage of socialism, the system of multiparty cooperation and 
political consultation under the leadership of the CPC, and the 
socialist market economic system. We also took care to draw on 
the new experience and new achievements in promoting socialist 
democracy and CPPCC work since 1982. Provisions in the 1982 
revised constitution that are still applicable today will, as a 
rule, remain unchanged. We are not writing a new 1994 version of 
the CPPCC Constitution. It is still the 1982 constitution with 
some partial, necessary changes. 
  [Reporter] What are the main contents of the present 
amendments? 
  [Hu] Contents about the theory of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the basic line for the primary stage of 
socialism, and the socialist market economic system have been 
incorporated into some pertinent paragraphs and articles. While 
asserting the CPPCC as a patriotic united front organization of 
the Chinese people, the CPPCC Constitution, as amended, goes one 
step further by asserting it as an important organization of 
multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the 
leadership of the CPC. It also expressly establishes that the 
principal functions of the CPPCC include political consultation; 
democratic supervision; organizing the parties, organizations, 
and personages representing all nationalities and quarters to 
participate in the deliberation and administration of state 
affairs; and so forth. 
  It is possible that changes will be made to the draft when 
it is examined by the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC 
National Committee. It will be promulgated after approval.

<F P=106> [By staff news team: "Top Central Leader Reiterates </F>
Administrative Guidelines on Eve of NPC Session, Stressing that 
Stability Is Overriding Task"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- As disclosed by an 
authoritative source here, when talking about the basic 
principle of work and general tasks for 1994, a senior CPC 
leader stressed that it was of the greatest importance to grasp 
the key points of the vast rural areas and the vast numbers of 
state-owned enterprises to push forward comprehensive reforms 
and development. On the eve of the NPC session, the 
abovementioned leader particularly stressed Deng Xiaoping's 
exposition that "stability must override everything." 
  According to the authoritative source, the senior central 
leader recently talked especially about maintaining a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development in the national economy, and 
called on all party members, leading cadres in particular, to 
reach a common understanding on this issue, especially on the 
complete meaning of the words "sustained, rapid, and healthy." 
  This senior leader said: The sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development is a dialectical unity. In the end, the economy 
will not be boosted if the development is rapid but not 
sustained and healthy. 
  He added: In proposing the general tasks of "seizing 
opportunities, deepening reforms, opening wider to the outside 
world, promoting development, and maintaining stability" for 
1994, somebody suggested changing the term "promoting 
development" to "accelerating development." Later, after 
repeated deliberation, it was not regarded as feasible to 
accelerate only the speed because, by doing so, an organic 
entity cannot be formed with the other aspects. Furthermore, 
the word "rapid" is contained in the expression "sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development" already, so the term "promoting 
development" was finally decided to be written in the 
20-character general tasks. 
  The central authorities called for leading cadres at all 
levels to correctly handle the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability. It is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
remark -- stability must override everything -- that counts. 
Without stability, nothing will be accomplished. For the 
entire party and society, stability must override everything. 
If we lack a stable situation, we simply have no way of 
developing the economy and carrying out the in-depth reform. 
Conversely, if the economy attains a sound development, there 
will be a more solid foundation for stability. How should we 
boost the economy? We must depend on the in-depth reform 
because, without it, we cannot build up a socialist market 
economy.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor, in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang 
Zemin has called for a tough crackdown on elements causing chaos 
as the nation faces serious potential instability following 
sweeping reforms. The appeal to the army, military police, 
public security, and state security organs across the country is 
believed to be the prime cause of the authorities' detentions 
and arrests of dissidents before the annual session of the 
National People's Congress, to be opened today. 
  Mr Jiang's remarks, followed by the crackdown on leading 
dissidents, indicate that China may adopt a tough stance in the 
talks on human rights issues with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, who starts his to Beijing visit tomorrow. "Any 
unstable element should be wiped out when it is in the embryonic 
stage and any issue should be dealt with properly and thoroughly 
before it sprouts and grows roots," Chinese sources yesterday 
quoted Mr Jiang as saying to law and order enforcers. 
  During recent visits to the provinces, Mr Jiang, who is also 
the chairman of the Central Military Commission, summoned 
regional army, armed police, public security, and state security 
officers to make his points. Mr Jiang's speeches have been 
compiled into a document which is now being circulated to the 
army and all other law enforcement departments nationwide. 
  Chinese sources quoted Mr Jiang as telling senior public 
security and armed police officers in Xian, the capital of the 
northwestern Shanxi Province, on 2 February, that: "We must be 
determined to crack down on any troublemakers, wipe out any 
unstable elements, and solve any social problems that may spur 
instability in society at the earliest stage. And the earlier 
we solve these problems, the less we will suffer." 
  Mr Jiang, General Secretary of the Communist Party Central 
Committee, also called on the army and law enforcers to stay 
alert in the current situation at home and abroad. "We, 
especially those responsible for safeguarding our nation, should 
have a strong sense of 'suffering and misery' in this historical 
moment as our nation is undergoing unprecedented fundamental 
changes," Mr Jiang said. He urged the army and law enforcers to 
try their best to ensure a stable social environment and law and 
order by suppressing dissidents and criminals. "Law enforcement 
departments should do their best to safeguard the achievements 
in development and reform and ensure that this endeavor by the 
Chinese Communist Party and the people should not suffer 
overnight because of the negligence of our comrades," Mr Jiang 
said. 
  The party chief explained that the sense of "suffering and 
misery" required every comrade in the enforcement departments to 
stay alert at all times. He said enemies at home and abroad had 
never abandoned their plots to undermine China's national unity 
and sabotage China's reform and development cause -- adding that 
the human rights row was one such case. However, Mr Jiang said 
the domestic and world political and economic situation was very 
good and favoured China's ruling party and the people.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese president and 
Party Chief Jiang Zemin stressed here today that all members, 
especially officials, of the Communist Party, should spend more 
time and effort on study. 
  The general secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Chinese 
Communist Party was speaking at a seminar of people attending a 
four-day national party school working conference which ended 
here today. 
  The seminar was presided over by Hu Jingtao, Standing 
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the party Central 
Committee. 
  Jiang said that with more efforts devoted to study, all the 
party's work would go more smoothly. 
  The point of study, he said, was to have a good grasp of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In 
addition, he said, all members of the party should make great 
efforts to learn the basics of a socialist market economy and 
related policies, laws and regulations. 
  They should also know something of modern science and 
technology, and learn from the experience of Chinese history, 
especially modern history, and the international history of 
socialism. 
  Jiang noted that the Communist Party had always paid 
attention to study, especially when the whole party faced a new 
situation and fresh tasks. The great achievements that China 
had made during the past 15 years were to a large degree the 
fruits of study, he said. 
  "A blueprint for a new economic structure was drawn up 
through the decisions made at the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th Party Central Committee last year," he said. "Our reform, 
covering economy, politics, culture and social life, is making a 
rapid progress. The rapidly changing situation presents to us 
many new problems and thorny questions and the difficulty in our 
work has increased. The way out is to admit our weaknesses and 
find solutions through profound studies," he said. 
  The general secretary reiterated at the seminar that while 
studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, one should take into his heart its 
essence -- mind emancipation and seeking truth from facts -- and 
study hard to grasp a dialectical, historical, materialist and 
scientific world outlook and methodology. 
  He called on all local party schools to further observe the 
policy of integrating theory with practice in their teaching. 
Party schools should, adjusting to the new situation, improve 
their education quality to a higher level.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a national 
statistics work conference today, Zou Jiahua, vice premier of 
the State Council, stated emphatically: Statistical information 
is a yardstick for monitoring the way the national economy and 
society function. In carrying out statistical work, we should 
stress accuracy, timeliness, comprehensiveness, and convenience, 
attaching primary importance to accuracy. We should establish a 
statistical survey methodology based on periodic general surveys 
which are essential; which are focused on regular sampling 
checks; and which are supplemented by surveys in selected areas, 
scientific calculations, and the general application of a small 
number of wide-ranging statistical reports. 
  What new demands has the socialist market economy set for 
statistical work? Vice Premier Zou said: The state's economic 
management mode should shift from the management of tangible 
aspects of the economy, the management of microeconomic 
activity, and direct management to the management of intangible 
aspects of the economy, macroeconomic activity, and indirect 
management. In making macroeconomic policy decisions and 
exercising macroeconomic regulations and control, the party 
Central Committee and the State Council have often been 
confronted with the following three questions: 1) What is the 
current state of operations of the national economy and society? 
2) Does the national economy and society function normally? If 
not, how should they be regulated and controlled? 3) What are 
the results of the implementation of macroeconomic regulatory 
and control measures? These three questions are closely related 
to statistical work and cannot be separated from the latter even 
for a moment. It would be difficult to make policy decisions on 
the national economy in the absence of ample information, 
scientific advice, and effective supervision by a statistical 
system. 
  Zou Jiahua added: To establish a socialist market economic 
structure, we should nurture and develop an information market. 
The commercialization and industrialization of information is 
one of the priority tasks in establishing a market system. 
Because statistical information reflects the general state of 
national economic and social development and is the main part of 
economic, social, scientific, and technological information, 
actively nurturing and vigorously developing a statistical 
information market are tasks that brook no delay. Statistical 
departments should fully play their role as the main departments 
in charge of socioeconomic information, should make great 
efforts to plan and manage national socioeconomic information 
and consultation services, and should vigorously promote the 
effective distribution of socioeconomic information so all of 
society can share it. 
  Zou Jiahua noted: We must further carry out reform and 
opening up in statistical work in accordance with the need to 
establish a socialist market economic system. We should shatter 
traditional concepts regarding statistics, and in accordance 
with the general law of the market economy, should boldly draw 
on advanced international statistic-related science and 
technology to institute a statistical system suited to China's 
conditions. We should exercise stronger centralized and unified 
leadership, and should scientifically and effectively organize 
national statistical work and national economic accounting work. 
We should radically reform our statistical surveying methods 
and develop surveying methods which are not all-encompassing, 
placing special emphasis on widely promoting sampling surveys. 
  Zou Jiahua said emphatically: The statistical survey plans 
developed or approved by the State Statistical Bureau in 
accordance with the law are binding as national laws and 
regulations. All legal entities and citizens must fill in their 
forms truthfully; this is a bounden duty for every legal entity 
and citizen. The current practice of filing false statistical 
reports by the leaders of some localities, departments, and 
units--who are driven by personal honor and advancement, or by 
certain types of political honor and material benefits for small 
groups--is quite serious. Some of them even go so far as to 
retaliate against statisticians who dare maintain their 
principles. We should sternly investigate and deal with such 
negative and corrupt practices.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- Wan Li, honorary 
president of the China Youth Development Foundation, emphasized 
recently that it is essential to give high priority to the 
development of education and that governments at all levels 
should attach importance to education and make great efforts to 
go a good job in education, particularly basic education. 
  Wan Li had a discussion at Zhongnanhai with comrades from 
the 
China Youth Development Foundation. On the implementation of 
the Hope Project, he said: At present, some localities cannot 
guarantee even the issuance of teachers' wages. They spend 
money on sedan cars and wining and dining instead of building 
schools and developing education. They should not have done so. 
Other localities fail to pay teachers because of financial 
difficulties. However, in my view, teachers' wages must not be 
in arrears no matter how poor we are or how difficult our 
situation. Wan Li said: In the final analysis, the trial of 
national strength is a competition of talented people. To keep 
pace with the world's development, we are emphasizing meeting 
the needs of the next century. In other words, we should train 
a cross-century generation of new people, and the key to 
training is education. 
  Wan Li said: At persent, poor regions have two problems in 
education. One is they have no schools, and the other is, even 
if they have schools, school-age children there cannot afford to 
attend them. There is a vicious circle of illiteracy causing 
backwardness in the economy and stupidity creating poverty. So, 
we should redouble our efforts to build more schools, and all 
the people should be concerned about education and the future of 
our country. I approve of a slogan: let us basically wipe out 
the phenomenon of some poor children being deprived of schooling 
and ensure schooling for all school-age children by the end of 
the century. 
  On the orientation of running rural schools, Wan Li said: 
Rural education should develop in the direction of promoting 
vocational education. I suggest that we should take the road of 
integrating agriculture, science, and education in running rural 
schools. In pastoral areas, for instance, we should teach 
children animal husbandry and the skills to develop the 
grassland economy, in addition to reading. Wealth is created by 
man. With scientific and technological personnel, the rural 
areas will become prosperous and the country will become rich 
and strong. 
  Wan Li emphasized: Developed regions should also attach 
importance to the development of education, and the success and 
failure of education should be regarded as one of the criteria 
for appraising leading cadres' job performance. I have been 
told that some children in developed regions are engaged in 
business operations instead of attending school. Such a 
practice is absolutely impermissible. We should use legal means 
in ensuring schooling for children. Without schooling, nothing 
can be achieved. Now, parents in urban areas spoil their only 
child and want the child to seek high marks with the sole 
purpose of advancing to a higher-level school. They pay no 
attention to cultivating their child's ability to be independent 
nor do they consider the child's overall development. In this 
way, how can the child meet the needs of a modern society? In 
conclusion, Wan Li said: The Hope Project is a nice thing. If 
everyone puts in efforts, it is certain that education will be 
successful.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
"State Compensation Law" (draft), an important law formulated by 
China to develop a socialist market economy and guarantee the 
rights and interests of citizens, has been submitted to the 
National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee for 
examination and approval. It is expected to be promulgated very 
soon. 
  Hu Kangsheng, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee's 
Legal System Work Committee who took part in the drafting of the 
law, said in Beijing the other day that the draft law stipulates 
that the state organs must undertake the responsibility for 
compensation in light of the "State Compensation Law" if state 
organs and functionaries are involved performing their functions 
in an illegal manner that encroaches on the legitimate rights 
and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other 
organizations. 
  Hu Kangsheng said that the range of compensation mainly 
comprises two fields: First, administrative compensation, which 
is aimed at duly expanding the scope of administrative 
compensation on the basis of administrative procedural law and 
in view of the currently existing problems. Second, criminal 
compensation, which is aimed at compensating the innocent who 
were mistakenly detained, arrested, or sentenced in the criminal 
suit. 
  Hu Kangsheng pointed out that the standard and method of 
state compensation are determined in light of the following 
principle: The losses of the victim must be duly compensated, 
the state's economic and financial capacity should be taken into 
account, and it should be easy to calculate. 
  Regarding the organs responsible for making compensation, Hu 
Kangsheng said that the losses caused by administrative organs 
and personnel in performing their functions in an illegal manner 
that encroaches on the rights and interests of citizens, legal 
persons, and other organizations should be compensated by that 
organ and those personnel. Criminal compensation for mistaken 
detention, arrest, and sentence is to be made by the organs 
responsible for making compensation. 
  While discussing the procedures for state compensation, Hu 
Kangsheng quoted the draft provisions: The victims first should 
file an application to the organs responsible for making 
compensation and the latter should reach an agreement on 
compensation with the former within two months. The latter also 
may reach an agreement with the former on compensation right 
away, through consultations. 
  When this State Compensation Law is made public soon, Hu 
said, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens 
will be further ensured. It also will impel state organs and 
their personnel to perform their functions according to law, to 
improve their work, and to run a clean administration.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- China's reforms this 
year involve a multi-faceted dimension of changing ideologies, 
building up new systems, and readjusting the interests of 
various localities and departments, according to today's 
"PEOPLE'S DAILY". 
  In a signed article, Ren Zhongping says that 1994 is an 
important year for China to speed up the process of establishing 
a socialist market economic system and extend a package of new 
reforms. 
  Fostering a main market, improving a market system and 
upgrading a regulatory system are the three aspects that must be 
"pushed ahead abreast", the article says, adding that 
"breakthroughs" must be made on the micro and macro levels of 
the market economy. 
  The author calls the tasks an uphill battle like "storming 
fortifications". 
  The present is the optimum time to mount such a battle, Ren 
says, citing the courage and resolve that are needed to overcome 
the difficulties. 
  Otherwise, a rare historic opportunity will slip by and a 
sustained, high-speed and healthy growth of the national economy 
can not be maintained. Consequently, the next strategic 
objectives of the national economy and social development will 
not be able to be realized. Worse still, it would be very 
likely that China would be lingering in a predicament of 
inflation and low-speed economic growth, warns the lengthy 
article. 
  The transition from the co-existence of a planned economy 
and 
a market economy to a single-track market economy will deeply 
touch the interests pattern formed under the old system. 
  What is more, the major transformation from the bottom-up 
self-initiated reforms and the top-down delegation of power and 
giving up of interests to the coordinated and organized 
implementation by people at both ends demand new adaptability, 
Ren says. 
  Therefore, the authority of the central government should be 
upheld and a concept of overall interests be formed in order to 
successfully effect the move from "the advancing of a single 
program" to "the advancing of overall programs". 
  The article says it is necessary to use legal means to guide 
the reforms and manage the economy when policy formulation gives 
way to laws and regulations. 
  The author warns against the tendency among some people to 
think "reforms are an issue for the government and development 
is our business". 
  The article says, "we are in the same boat and everyone is 
involved in the current reforms. We should unite as one to win 
the battle."

<F P=106> [By Liu Shulin (0491 2579 2651): "How Young People Viewed </F>
Society in 1993"] 
  [Text] From October 1992 to May 1993, a survey and 
analysis on current ideological and political conditions among 
young people was jointly carried out by the China Youth Research 
Center and the School of Political Studies for Young Chinese; by 
youth research centers in the provinces and municipalities of 
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shandong, Liaoning, and Lianyun 
Port; and by the Guangxi Communist Youth League [CYL] School and 
Sichuan's Pioneer Radio Factory. 
  The objects of the survey were students, scientific and 
technological personnel, teachers, CYL cadres, and young people 
in other professions whose ages ranged from 18 to 35. Emphasis 
was placed on young people who have high educational attainments. 
  The issues revealed by the survey are now analyzed as 
follows: 
<H5>  1. Political Attitudes Become Stable </H5>
  Among respondents to the questionnaires, those who said they 
"care" or "care very much" about the 14th party congress 
accounted for 42.6 percent and 46.5 percent respectively, and 
the total was 89.1 percent. Those who said they "do not care" 
accounted for only 1.4 percent. Those who said they "support" 
and "fully support" the resolutions adopted by the 14th Party 
Congress accounted for 37.9 percent and 37.4 percent 
respectively, and those who said they "obey the party's 
decisions" accounted for 17.9 percent, so the total for those 
who gave a positive and enthusiastic response accounted for 93.2 
percent, while 6.8 percent of the respondents said they would 
"have to think about it." 
  Another survey by questionnaire aimed at university students 
shows: 
  When a questionnaire-type survey was extended to a wider 
scope of young people, asking their opinions on China's current 
political situation, the results showed: 
  Those who thought the political situation was stable or 
relatively stable accounted for 88.7 percent, those who thought 
it was not adequately stable accounted for only 9.5 percent, and 
those who did not care accounted for only 1.8 percent. Looking 
at their professions, we can find that teachers and students in 
particular tended to view the political situation as stable or 
relatively stable, as 90.3 percent and 89.6 percent of them 
respectively said so; the percentage of scientists and 
technicians who said so was lower at 76.7 percent. Among those 
who thought the political situation was not stable enough, young 
graduate students in particular thought this way, as 18.5 
percent of them said so. 
  Before and after the spring festival of 1992, a "red sun 
craze" emerged in the whole country. Responses by young people 
to questions concerning this phenomenon were: 1) respect for 
the leader of the revolution (23.1 percent); 2) new idolatry 
(7.9 percent); 3) trying to be fashionable (21.2 percent); 4) 
nostalgia (18.7 percent); 5) dissatisfied with the current 
situation (15.4 percent); and 6) hard to tell (13.7 percent). 
  What is the status of the party's four cardinal principles 
in 
the new period, which centers on economic construction? Among 
young people, 80.5 percent said "they must be upheld," 14 
percent said "some areas must be upheld," and 2.1 percent said 
"there is no need for them to be upheld." A survey in October 
1988 asked a question which read: "In your opinion, is it 
necessary to uphold the four cardinal principles in order to 
carry out reform?" Among those who answered only 28.7 percent 
said "it is very necessary," and a majority of them chose "it is 
necessary but must not become rigid" (53.56 percent). Those who 
said "it is not necessary" and "it does not matter" accounted 
for 7.61 percent. 
<H5>  2. Optimistic About Economic Reform </H5>
  Answering a question on the way for our country's economic 
reform, 42.5 percent of respondents advocated strengthening the 
market economy, and 36.4 percent advocated putting the market in 
the main position and planning in a supplementary position. 
Persons showing a positive attitude by choosing these two 
answers accounted for 78.9 percent, while those advocating the 
planned economy accounted for 21.3 percent. 
  Regarding publicity given by the mass media to the great 
tide 
of reform, most young people thought it was conducive to 
emancipating the mind (42.1 percent) and attracting foreign 
capital (29 percent), and the total was 71.1 percent. 
  As for the market economy mechanism itself, no one was 
against it. 
  Concerning the newly announced reform measures, the result 
of 
the survey exceeded all expectations by showing that most young 
people were optimistic about them. 
  We then came to the issue of adjusting and increasing goods 
prices. In an 1988 survey of ideological conditions among young 
people throughout the country, 92.75 percent of the respondents 
to the questionnaires thought that panic buying at that time was 
caused by a loss of control over price reform and the people's 
inability to adapt to the lifting of restrictions on prices, 
65.71 percent thought that restrictions on prices must be lifted 
on condition wages are increased correspondingly, and among the 
"10 most worried about problems," young people put "random price 
increases" in first position, as 63.79 percent of them said 
so. 
  But this kind of response changed during the recent 
survey. The questionnaires tried to find out the reason for 
calmness among the people in light of recent increases in 
transportation and fuel prices by the state, and the result was: 
Among the respondents, 43.6 percent said they "realize that 
this is required by the development of a socialist market 
economy," 31.1 percent said their "ability to withstand price 
adjustments has increased," while 21.2 percent chose the 
unenthusiastic answer that "there is no method even if one is 
dissatisfied," and 4.1 percent said the increases "bred 
discontent." 
  We then came to the issue of not assigning jobs to 
university 
graduates. This was an issue which emerged in 1988 and caused 
controversy. In the past, most university graduates have been 
opposed to the implementation of this policy, saying that it 
would lead to unhealthy practices such as going through the back 
door. But the recent survey showed some changes. Among those 
responding to the question of "how would you evaluate the 
state's policy of not assigning jobs to university graduates," 
37.4 percent said it "can arouse enthusiasm for study among 
students," 26.2 percent said the policy would "boost the 
unhealthy practice of going through the back door," 26 percent 
said the policy "is a policy not applicable at this time because 
of a lack of conditions," and 10.5 percent said "it is hard to 
say." Here we can see that among young people, the proportion 
of those who support the reform is higher; of the three rival 
opinions, the one with an optimistic attitude had the edge. 
<H5>  3. Hate Corruption and Call for Reform </H5>
  Young people's grievances against social problems mainly 
originates from corrupt phenomena among party and government 
personnel. This situation is basically similar to the results 
of the 1988 survey. 
  A question in the questionnaires asked: "What is your 
assessment of the extent of the emerging phenomenon of 
corruption?" Of the respondents, 89.3 percent thought the 
corruption phenomenon at this time is very serious or rather 
serious, and this was an absolute majority; on the other hand, 
only 2.9 percent said that it was not serious, only 1.4 percent 
said that it did not matter or they did not care about it, and 
6.4 percent said that it was hard to tell. These three answers 
accounted for only 10.7 percent. Arranged in order of the 
degree of hatred, the five kinds of evil social phenomena hated 
most by young people are: bureaucracy, abuse of power for 
private interest, corruption and bribery, dissolute lifestyles, 
and others. 
  Among the four choices for the statement that "the crux of 
our country's reform of the political system is," most 
respondents chose "eliminating corruption and establishing 
democratic decisionmaking and democratic supervisory 
mechanisms," which accounted for 50.3 percent of answers, while 
the second most popular choice was "separation of the party and 
government, separation of government and enterprises, and 
streamlining government and delegating power to lower levels," 
which accounted for 41.1 percent. In the 1988 survey, the most 
popular answer to the same question was "separation of party and 
government (47.8 percent), and the second most popular choice 
was "democratic decisionmaking" (30.15 percent), while the 
radical advocacy of "stripping them of their special privileges" 
ranked fifth among seven crucial measures. 
  One question asked: "What do you think is the most important 
factor harming the stable situation in the socialist country?" 
In order of popularity, the 10 choices are ranked as follows: 
1) a backward economy and low living standards; 2) the legal 
system is not sound and the social order is chaotic; 3) a poor 
law and order situation; 4) lackluster efforts to combat 
corruption; 5) price increases; 6) unfair distribution; 7) timid 
reform and opening up; 8) agitation by foreign reactionary 
forces; 9) influence from contemporary Western trends of 
thought; and 10) unstable policies. 
  When comparing the process of reform of the political system 
with the process of reform of the economic system in our 
country, most young people thought that reform of political 
system had lagged behind reform of the economic system (57.7 
percent), while the other three choices made up 42.3 percent. 
<H3>  4. Young People Are More Chaotic in Areas of Ideology and 
Theory </H3>
  Within the questionnaire there was a question which asked 
about the "situation of faith in socialism among most of the 
young people around you," and the survey showed: 
  Only 7.7 percent said they had firm faith, while 14.2 
percent 
said they had no faith, and both were small proportions. Most 
young people were in the condition of "having faith, but also 
puzzled." 
  Analyzing by level of educational attainment, we may see 
that 
graduate students are the most pronounced in saying that they 
"have no faith," as 27.3 percent of them at this level said so, 
and 5.4 percent of undergraduates and students at higher 
learning institutes also said this. However, only 6.3 percent 
of those at the middle-school level said this, and this is far 
lower than the rate at the graduate-student level. Analyzing by 
profession, we may see that 9.3 percent of scientists and 
technicians said they "have no faith," and this is the highest 
percentage; 6 percent of teachers and students said they had no 
faith; and only 1.6 percent of CYL cadres said they "have no 
faith," and this was the lowest percentage. 
  In the questionnaire, one question read: "Listed below are 
various kinds of understanding of patriotism. Which would you 
tend to pick? The result was: 37 percent of respondents thought 
that "to be patriotic, one must love socialism"; 38.2 percent 
thought that "to be patriotic, one does not necessarily have to 
love socialism"; and 24.8 percent thought that "to be patriotic, 
one at least is not opposed to socialism." The first two 
choices were more pronounced. 
  We then came to the socialist market economy. During 
conversations and discussions, we discovered that quite a number 
of young people thought that socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is in fact capitalism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Within the questionnaire, a question read: "In your opinion, 
how does China's democracy look when compared with capitalist 
countries?" Of the respondents, 28.3 percent thought that 
"China's democratic system was better," 7.8 percent thought that 
"the democratic system in capitalist countries was better," and 
a majority, 57.6 percent, thought that "each has its own 
advantages and disadvantages." 
  The questionnaire also asked about the essence of the great 
changes in the former Soviet Union and East Europe, and 57.3 
percent of respondents thought that these changes were peaceful 
evolution caused by capitalism, 21.4 percent thought that the 
changes were the "roads of reform chosen by the various 
countries themselves," and 11.8 percent attributed the changes 
to the failure of the socialist system. 
  "What is the main reason, in your opinion, for the several 
student movements since reform?" The answers were as follows: 
"Caused by social problems" was chosen by many people 
(accounting for 41.6 percent), while 15.9 percent of young 
people thought that student movements were a way to express 
themselves, and 7.5 percent thought that student movements were 
an embodiment of patriotism. Those who thought that the student 
movements were influenced by the trend of bourgeois liberation 
thoughts accounted for 27.4 percent, and those who thought young 
students were not mature enough and prone to cause trouble 
accounted for 7.7 percent. An analysis based on the level of 
educational attainment shows that the graduate-student level was 
the most pronounced in assessing the student movements with an 
affirmative attitude (94.8 percent), and this attitude dropped a 
bit among undergraduates and students in higher learning 
institutes (65.9 percent). An analysis based on profession 
shows that more scientific and technological personnel and 
teachers hold an affirmative attitude toward the student 
movements, making up 73.7 percent and 69.3 percent respectively. 
The percentage among students dropped a bit to 62.9 percent. 
  In the past, in the area of assessing student movements, 
there has been a similar tendency of affirmation. Within the 
questionnaire, a question asked about the cause of the 1985 
student movement, and 47.8 percent of respondents said it was 
caused by "dissatisfaction with the unhealthy trend at that 
time"; 18.5 percent said "it was patriotic, opposing the 
resurrection of Japanese militarism"; 22.6 percent said "it was 
instigated by people who have ulterior motives"; and 11 percent 
thought it was caused by the "inability to adapt to the reform, 
opening up, and new situation." Those who gave an affirmative 
assessment accounted for 66.3 percent, and those who gave a 
negative assessment accounted for 33.7 percent. 
  When asked "what is the major worry in your life," most 
young 
people chose "too low income" among the seven available choices. 
Other choices were ranked in order of popularity as follows: a 
lack of housing, poor interpersonal relations, not being able to 
apply what you have learned, difficulty in getting married and 
in love affairs, not having any way to give play to one's 
talents, and difficulty in going out of the country. In the 
1988 survey, the "low income" answer ranked in fifth position, 
and the other four choices ranked in order of popularity were: 
random price increases, leaders treating people unfairly, 
dissatisfaction with current job, and a lack of good 
recreational venues. 
  In the survey, a question asked: "What, in your opinion, is 
the goal which is most difficult to reach in the process of 
catching up with and surpassing the four little dragons of 
Asia?" Those who chose "level of educational development" 
accounted for 48.5 percent, 26.2 percent chose "level of 
economic development," 15.4 percent chose "level of social 
morals," and 9.9 percent chose the "level of science and 
technology." Here we can see that young people are very 
pessimistic about the current situation and future of education. 
Primary and secondary education, especially primary and 
secondary education in rural areas, is in many aspects worse 
than in the period shortly after the liberation. The road to 
university education for peasant children is becoming narrower 
and narrower. There is a shortage of funds for universities to 
the extent that university presidents have no mood to grasp 
teaching, but spend their energy mainly on creating channels of 
income. 
  As for going to university with one's own money or the real 
possibility that one must go to university by paying one's own 
fees in the future, quite a number of university students and 
their parents said they could not bear. When answering the 
question: "What is your view on going to university by your own 
expense," 43.9 percent of respondents said they "could not bear 
it," 37.5 percent said they "could bear it," and 18.6 percent 
said they "do not care."

<F P=106> ["Newsletter From China" by Leng Mou (0397 4188): "Females </F>
Bear the Brunt of Drastic Social Changes: More Than Two Percent 
of Mainland Female Staff Lose Their Jobs"] 
  [Text] As disclosed by the blue book entitled "Analyses 
and Predictions on China's Social Situation," which has just 
been published in Beijing, a survey conducted by the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions in 1993 on 900,000 female staff and 
workers and more than 1,000 enterprises on the mainland 
discovered that female staff and workers who were forced to 
leave their original jobs (to be referred to as "go off posts" 
hereinafter) as a result of "optimum organization" within 
enterprises accounted for 60 percent of the total number of 
staff and workers having "gone off posts" and 2.3 percent of the 
total number of female staff and workers. The mainland's 
women's organizations and social personalities feel that the 
achievement of "stable employment for women," resulting from the 
emancipation of women since 1949, now is on the wane. 
  The mainland's "Regulations on Labor Protection for Female 
Staff and Workers" provide that women at work can take 90 days 
of maternity leave, but in the course of optimizing 
organizations in enterprises, some enterprises in various 
localities took pregnant and post-delivery women on rest leave 
at home as an excuse to dismiss redundant personnel, forcing 
them to take leave for as long as three to seven years, or up to 
10 years and more. Punishment was meted out to those who 
refused to obey. Under the circumstances of drastic social 
changes, whether these female personnel will be able to take up 
their jobs again is a difficult question to predict. 
  At present, mainland enterprises generally practice the 
regulations that personnel should retire ahead of time, at 45 
for women and 50 for men, which means five years earlier than 
the retirement ages stipulated by the state. Moreover, 
enterprises with poor performance have even adopted punitive 
measures to force personnel to retire. In the first half of 
1993, the Female Staff and Workers Department of the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions conducted a survey in various 
localities, in which it discovered that many enterprises had 
lowered the retirement age for women to 40. However, among the 
female staff and workers who are over 40, only approximately 20 
percent favor retirement ahead of time. These are mostly women 
personnel who are capable of seeking employment by themselves, 
some have a better family financial situation, and a small 
number are in poor health. However, more than 80 percent of 
female staff and workers are unwilling to retire ahead of time, 
and are enduring extremely onerous mental and physical pressure, 
and struggling to survive. 
  Tan Shen, a specialist on women's issues from the Institute 
of Sociology under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 
pointed out: Today, women's issues on the mainland can be 
divided roughly into two types: One is the issue concerning 
reform, which mainly shows that in the course of reform, urban 
women are losing some of the protection they enjoyed under the 
former structure, so that new problems have emerged for six to 
seven years, during which women have undergone a process of 
feeling deeply frustrated and knowing that they have to find a 
way out for themselves. Now, a new pattern is gradually taking 
shape. The other issue is the one concerning development, which 
mainly shows that rural women, as well as urban women who are 
not working under the current structure, have paid a high price 
in the course of development, in which problems such as the 
"blood-and-sweat salary system," prostitution, the abduction and 
sale of women, and so on have cropped up, and serious attention 
has been paid to them from various quarters. However, there are 
still no effective measures at present. 
  Today, women on the mainland have fewer opportunities for 
development, but more troublesome matters than men. This is not 
attributed primarily to child-bearing, but to the division of 
labor in the families for the difference of sex: the revival 
and escalation of the old practice of men in charge of social 
affairs and women in charge of household routines. It has 
further developed into the division of labor in society for the 
difference of sex: the emergence of occupations requiring a 
certain sex, as well as sex discrimination pertaining to them. 
Therefore, in the tendency toward diversification, the choice 
and development for women are unavoidably restricted to their 
sex and matrimony. This tendency is still developing now.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Starting next month, 
the Chinese Government will collect a fee on the mining of 
China's mineral resources from all mining enterprises, including 
those involving foreign investment. 
  Implementation of the "Regulations on the Collection of 
Mineral Resources Compensation Fee" begins April 1, in 
accordance with an order issued by Premier Li Peng on February 
27. 
  The regulations were approved by the State Council on June 
29, 1993, said Song Ruixiang, executive vice-minister of the 
Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, at a news briefing 
today. 
  The fee will be calculated on the basis of the value of the 
minerals mined, but for the next year or two will be fixed at 
1.18 percent "in consideration of the financial difficulties of 
some mining enterprises." 
  The rate will be raised to 5-7 percent between 1996 and 
2000, 
and then to about ten percent. "Ten percent is what it should 
be," the official said. 
  The "eventual rate" resulted from calculations on the value 
of 21 mineral ores including gold, manganese and phosphorus. 
"Even ten percent is lower than such rates in foreign 
countries," the official said. 
  At the rate of 1.18 percent, the government expects to 
collect an annual average of one billion yuan and use it on 
geological prospecting, "especially prospecting involving risks 
and involving resources for China's strategic reserves," he said. 
  Even more important, however, is that collection of the fee 
is meant to uphold state ownership of mineral resources in 
accordance with the constitution and the "mineral resources law" 
and make such ownership real by an economic method, Song said. 
  "Unpaid-for mining means free transfer of state property 
rights to a mining enterprise, and this does not conform to law 
and causes loss of state-owned assets," Song said. 
  "All countries collect mineral resources compensation fees 
in 
one or another form," he noted. "Moreover, the market economy 
necessitates compensation for the consumption of mineral 
resources." 
  In their overseas operations, Chinese mining companies duly 
pay mineral resources compensation fees in observation of laws 
of their host countries, Song noted. 
  "Foreign companies seeking investment opportunities in 
China's mining sector agree to pay such a fee, which demands 
that there be legislation on its collection," the official said. 
  The latest State Council regulations cover "mineral 
resources 
of all types throughout China, on China's land territory and 
within the maritime territory under China's jurisdiction." 
  All mining enterprises have to pay the fee, whether they are 
owned by the state, or collectively or individually owned and 
whether they involve foreign investment. 
  In line with government decrees previously published, 
foreign 
companies engaging in oil and natural gas operations in China, 
onshore or offshore, will continue to turn over to China a 
prescribed percentage of the products as fees on the use of the 
operation areas.

<F P=106> ["XINHUA Mailbox: `What Is a Bond Market?'" -- XINHUA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Feb (XINHUA) -- A bond market is a 
market for trading bonds. Based on its functions, there are two 
different kinds of bond markets: Bond issue markets (primary 
markets) and bond transfer markets (trading markets). 
  Issuing bonds is the traditional method for raising medium 
and long-term capital in various countries. Floaters consist 
mainly of enterprises established by governments, institutions, 
and stock companies; public utilities such as railways, 
telegrams, and telephones; and banking institutions and 
international financial organizations. Through bond markets, a 
large sum of capital can be raised within a short period. 
Vouchers for bond markets are mainly government bonds, company 
bonds, and security vouchers. Like company bonds, government 
bonds are vouchers which repay capital with interest on terms; 
however, because government bonds are guaranteed by government 
creditability, they are fairly safe and entail only a small 
risk. There are various kinds of company bonds, including a 
small number of unsecured bonds from credit companies; however, 
the majority are secured company bonds. Security vouchers are a 
kind of contract certificate which enables debtors to use 
certain property as a guaranty to raise long-term capital. In 
the past, property used as guaranty was mostly real estate; 
however, negotiable securities have recently become the most 
common form of guaranty. 
  Bonds can be transferred or traded through two different 
forms: commission and off-board transactions. The former, also 
called on-board trading, refers to the selling and buying which 
investors commission stock companies to engage in at stock 
exchanges. As all bonds entering transaction at stock exchanges 
are registered and come in great varieties, investors have the 
option of investing in bonds with small risks, big 
profitability, and strong liquidity. Off-board trading refers to 
bond transactions between banks or enterprises and stock 
companies. Presently bond transactions are concentrated mainly 
on off-board trading. Payments for service charges differ 
according to the forms of trading. Applicants for on-board 
trading at stock exchanges are required to pay a commission 
service charge. However, off-board trading does not have to pay 
the service charge; the differential between the buying and 
selling price of bonds is the service charge paid to stock 
companies. 
  Presently bonds are generally transferred through four 
different methods in China's secondary stock markets: 1) Direct 
buying and selling by a company: based on listed prices, 
companies buy discount bonds and transfer them to new buyers, 
with the buying and selling price of bonds based on bank 
discount rates, and with the prices fluctuating along with 
market changes; 2) commission trading: bond holders and buyers 
commission companies to sell or buy on their behalf, with prices 
decided by the buyers and sellers, and with companies collecting 
a fixed service charge; 3) mortgage: a bond holder who urgently 
needs cash but cannot sell bonds through the aforesaid two 
methods can mortgage bonds for capital and redeem them within a 
time limit; otherwise the mortgage company has the right to 
transfer the bonds; 4) appraisal and certification: after 
transactions are completed, and in order to protect the rights 
and interests of the buyers and sellers, companies are 
responsible for appraising the authenticity of bonds and 
collecting a certain percentage of their face value as appraisal 
and certification fees.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227) ] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 21 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Mainland 
China's first Securities Act will be published in April this 
year. This is the first economic law which has not been drafted 
by the executive branch but by experts organized by the National 
People's Congress. It will replace the Provisional Regulations 
Governing the Issue and Trading of Securities previously 
promulgated by the State Council and local regulations on 
securities trading promulgated by Shenzhen and Shanghai, thus 
erecting a national legal framework in securities. 
  The introduction of the Securities Act is naturally related 
to the mainland's fast developing and booming securities 
markets. By the end of 1993, there were already 122 listed, 
joint-stock companies on the mainland, six major companies 
listed outside China, and 51 securities companies across the 
nation, and the number of shareholders reached some 25 million. 
Moreover, over 13,000 enterprises across the country already 
utilize the shareholding system, with the total amount of shares 
amounting to 208.6 billion yuan, and many of these companies are 
hoping to be listed or are pooling funds to expand production. 
It is known that mainland enterprises are also planning to 
issue 5.5 billion yuan of stocks this year. 
  In the meantime, the number of negotiable securities of all 
types keeps increasing. According to statistics, between 1981 
and 1993, negotiable securities issued on mainland China 
totalled 432.3 billion yuan, of which 138.9 billion yuan were 
short-term state treasury bonds; 39.7 billion long-term state 
treasury bonds; 20 billion yuan special government bonds and 
indexed bonds; 40.7 billion yuan state investment bonds 
(including state construction bonds, state major construction 
bonds, and capital construction bonds); 96 billion yuan in 
corporate securities, 61 billion yuan of financial bonds; and 36 
billion yuan in enterprise shares. 
  On the other hand, owing to the unsound system, some 
unpleasant things have occurred in the securities investment 
market; for example, one shareholder committed suicide following 
great losses due to his failure in securities speculation after 
obtaining an overdraft from a local securities company. His 
wife then brought a suit against the securities company, 
demanding reasonable compensation. Therefore, the question of 
whether or not shareholders should be allowed to speculate in 
future by taking out overdrafts has arisen, and this needs to be 
standardized by the Securities Act. 
  A bigger issue is the fact that state-owned enterprises are 
gradually changing to the shareholding system and are listing 
one after another. Given the fact that "state-owned shares" are 
tokens of public ownership, should we legislate to protect them 
to prevent the state from losing controlling power over those 
enterprises? In the process of drafting the Securities Act, 
people have argued greatly about it all along. Professor Li 
Yining, who was head of the drafting committee and who is the 
deputy director of the Law Committee of the NPC Standing 
Committee, disclosed not long ago that the question of whether 
or not state shares should be protected should ultimately be 
decided in keeping with the laws of the market economy; that in 
stressing competition, we should not determine power by the main 
body of shares; and that all investors should be on an equal 
footing. Therefore, the Securities Act provides that state 
shares, corporate shares, and personal shares should be treated 
equally without discrimination. Another question over which 
there has been a comparatively big difference of opinion is 
whether or not the trading of securities should be allowed 
outside the floor [of the exchange]. It was finally decided 
that there was a need to set up roadside exchanges [chang wai 
jiao yi suo 1034 1120 0074 2496 2076] outside the major 
exchanges but that these sites must first be approved. If 
roadside exchanges are banned, this will surely hinder the 
development of the shareholding system and will aid the growth 
of underground securities trading, and will thus produce many 
loopholes. In addition, there is also the question of whether 
or not civil servants should be allowed to buy and sell shares. 
It was finally decided that it was inappropriate to lay down in 
the Securities Act any clauses preventing any person from buying 
and selling stocks. As for whether or not civil servants can 
buy and sell stocks, provisions should be made in other laws, 
regulations, and policies. 
  According to Ji Xiangyu of the Exchange Department of the 
China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, the 
forthcoming Securities Act includes a national central clearing 
system. The variety of the central clearing system should 
include listed A shares, futures, bonds, and debentures in the 
initial stage. At a later stage, it should also include B 
shares, corporate shares, funds, foreign shares traded in China, 
and other financial varieties to be expanded in China in the 
future. As for the shareholders of the national central 
clearing company, he said that membership for foreign banks 
could be considered, but holding rights must absolutely be held 
by the Chinese side. 
  We can see, therefore, that the formulation and introduction 
of the Securities Act really has great significance.

Changes in Mainland Private Economic Sector"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 22 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Through 
expansion over a dozen years, the private economic sector on the 
mainland has grown into an important economic force and has 
broken the state enterprises' monopoly of the economy. The 
private sector has played a positive role in developing the 
social productive forces and in improving the people's living 
standards. 
  According to statistics compiled by the State Administration 
for Industry and Commerce, by late September last year, 
individual industrial and commercial operators had increased to 
16 million, hiring 26 million people, up 11.7 and 14 percent 
respectively over the same period the previous year. Private 
enterprises had increased to 210,000, employing 3.31 million 
people, up 72.6 and 62.4 percent respectively over the same 
period the previous year. The taxes paid to the state annually 
by individual operators and private enterprises averaged 20 
billion yuan, accounting for 7.8 percent of the state's total 
industrial and commercial tax revenues. The private sector took 
on about 1 million redundant laborers, making up 10 percent of 
workers employed by all businesses throughout the country. 
  In Guangdong and Fujian, which carried out reform and opened 
to the outside world earlier than other areas, individual 
operators and private enterprises have grown faster. In 
Guangdong, there are 1.3 million self-employed operators, and 
private enterprises with registered capital exceeding 1 million 
yuan number 1,000. In Fujian there are 540,000 self-employed 
operators and private enterprises, with their total registered 
capital hitting 7 billion yuan. In Henan, an inland province, 
there are now 900,000 self-employed operators and private 
enterprises, the best record for the last 43 years. 
  At present, individual industrial and commercial businesses 
and private enterprises are allowed to operate in bonded areas, 
development areas, and experimental areas. In addition, 
development areas for the private economy have been set up in 
Shanghai, Shenyang, and Dalian, and investment areas for private 
enterprises have been set up in Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Anhui, 
Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. All this is the first major change in 
the private sector on the mainland. 
  The second change is that the private enterprises have 
expanded unprecedentedly in terms of their trades and scope, 
with operations having extended to all trades allowed by the 
government. There is every indication that they now are 
beginning to penetrate such important industries as aviation, 
chemicals, electronics, building materials, grain and edible 
oils, and even into the cultural, educational, and public health 
fields. For instance, private schools and hospitals have been 
established in various places. 
  Private enterprises are allowed to establish horizontal 
trans- sectoral and transregional economic ties, and to take 
stock in, run by lease, contract to run, purchase, and annex 
collectively owned and state enterprises. A total of 46 state 
and collectively owned enterprises were purchased and annexed by 
individual operators and private enterprises in Zhejiang alone 
last year. This is the third change in the private sector. 
  The fourth change is that more and more private enterprises 
are moving toward the international market by setting up joint 
ventures with foreign businessmen. According to incomplete 
statistics provided by 12 coastal provinces and cities, 
Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises set up by private 
enterprises and foreign businessmen have topped 400. Private 
enterprise groups also have grown in number and scope with each 
passing day. Some private enterprise groups have hired more 
than 1,000 employees and their annual output value has reached 
10 million or even 100 million yuan. About 5,000 to 6,000 
private enterprises have earned foreign exchange by exporting 
products and have carried on border trade. A number of 
self-employed operators and private enterprises have done 
business, set up factories, opened companies, and engaged in 
property development in foreign countries. 
  The fifth change is that a number of college graduates, 
experts, professors, public figures, and retired cadres have 
joined private enterprises over the last few years with the 
result that the average age of employees of private enterprises 
has dropped and that their cultural level, professional level, 
social status, and reputation have been raised greatly. 
  The private sector on the mainland has risen from oblivion 
and is playing a greater and greater role in the national 
economy. With the increase in the number of foreign-funded 
enterprises and with more and more state enterprises being taken 
over by private enterprises, the gap between different economic 
sectors gradually will narrow and they will compete on an equal 
footing. As private enterprises operate flexibly and adapt 
themselves quickly to market needs, they will grow at a greater 
pace.

<F P=106> ["China Encourages Higher Pay for Top Entrepreneurs" -- </F>
XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Nanjing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Some Chinese 
entrepreneurs can now command much higher salaries -- and they 
may well be worth these sums because of their greater 
responsibilities and the grave risks in the country's shift to a 
market economy. 
  An advertisement seeking a general manager for a commercial 
center was published in January in Nanjing, capital of east 
China's Jiangsu Province -- offering a record annual salary of 
150,000 yuan (about 17,240 U.S. dollars). 
  This medium-sized business had suffered losses for 14 
consecutive years of its 15-year life, with 13 managers coming 
and going. 
  The position finally went to Zhuang Zongping, former deputy 
manager of the city's Gulou Department Store, after an open 
selection contest held by relevant authorities. 
  Experts described the move as a great change from the usual 
practice of officials being appointed by higher authorities. 
  Bai Meilin, director of the city's Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy, said that a new leadership system is 
important for a smooth shift to the modern enterprise system. 
  Jiang Yu, a general manager of the Xinjiekou Department 
Store, said that advertising for talent with high pay is an 
effective way to get qualified persons for posts which they want. 
  At his inauguration ceremony, Zhuang handed in a risk pledge 
of 16,000 yuan to the parent company, which won't be refunded if 
the center fails to produce an annual profit of 1.6 million yuan 
under his administration. 
  According to the contract, he has decision-making power in 
areas such as employment, direction-setting, personnel 
assignment and resources distribution. 
  Zhuang, aged 43, was considered daring in the city's 
business 
circles, as he had made the sales volume of the Gulou Department 
store jump from 30 million yuan to 250 million yuan within three 
years. 
  This time, with his good business sense and his practical 
and 
bold plan, he defeated six rivals, who were selected from quite 
a few officials, private bosses and agents for foreign companies. 
  His measures to invigorate the center include improving the 
shopping environment, restructuring commodities, distinguishing 
its promotions from neighboring stores and strengthening its 
internal management. 
  Qian Hao, general manager of the Gulou Department Store, 
said 
the store will not be affected by Zhuang's leaving, because it 
has a group of experienced personnel and a healthy management 
system. 
  Relevant leading officials pledged that Zhuang will be given 
full power to enforce his program on his new post. 
  Now Zhuang is setting about renovating the center, which 
will 
reopen on April 8.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- Recently, the Ministry 
of Agriculture and the China Association for Science and 
Technology jointly issued a "Circular on Providing Better 
Guidance and Support for Peasant Specialized Trade 
Associations," calling on all areas to fully understand the role 
played by peasant specialized trade associations in devleoping a 
market economy in rural areas, to provide better guidance and 
support for them, and to further promote their healthy 
development. 
  The "Circular" noted: As rural reform deepened and as a 
market economy enjoyed development, a number of peasant 
specialized trade associations, including specialized technical 
associations and research societies, emerged as the times 
required. As of the end of 1992, there were over 1.4 million 
various peasant specialized trade associations spread over all 
fields of endeavor in the rural economy. Peasant specialized 
trade associations are privately run organizations for technical 
and economic cooperation initiated by peasants on a voluntary 
basis. They were established for the purpose of increasing 
members' income. Based on management by peasant households, 
they encouraged members to assist and cooperate with each other 
in respect of funds, technology, production, and supply and 
marketing. Practices have proved that the development of 
peasant specialized trade associations is conducive to 
increasing peasants' income more quickly, and gives tremendous 
impetus to peasant households' economic development and to the 
governments' market cultivation. 
  The "Circular" stressed: All areas must correctly guide 
peasant specialized trade associations to develop steadily in 
line with the objective needs of establishing a socialist market 
economy. They must pay attention to grasping the following 
points when actually carrying out work: 1) The principle -- 
"run and managed by the private sectors who will benefit from 
their management" -- must be adhered to. The will of peasants 
must be respected when establishing and developing peasant 
specialized trade associations. They may join the assoications 
of their own free will and quit as they wish. An internal 
management system must be gradually established and improved. 
All areas must persist in the orientation of serving 
agricultural production, rural areas, and peasants; they must 
conscientiously focus efforts on offering good services to 
members. 
  2) Adhering to the principle of establishing and 
developing various forms of specialized peasant associations. 
As far as cooperation is concerned, technical-exchange 
associations, associations providing services for production and 
management, and associations in the form of technological and 
economic entities may be established in line with local 
conditions. With regard to initiation of such associations, 
both individuals as well as scientific and technical personnel 
may take the lead in initiating the establishment of such 
associations. With regard to their scope of activities, such 
associations may carry out activities within a community; they 
may also carry out inter-community activities. In line with 
practical needs, various types of specialized peasant 
associations may carry out various forms of cooperative 
activities. 3) It is necessary to respect the rights of 
specialized peasant associations to make independent decisions, 
and the relationship between them and other organizations should 
be handled properly. Being a part of the social service system 
in rural areas, state economic, scientific, and technological 
departments; township and village collective economic 
organizations; and specialized peasant associations should pay 
attention to exploiting their respective advantages, share work 
in a cooperative manner, and strive to provide service to 
peasant households to help them develop production. No unit or 
individual is allowed to transfer the property of specialized 
peasant associations and their members. 4) In establishing such 
associations, the authorities in various localities must take 
into account the practical needs of peasants and offer specific 
guidance in light of local conditions; under no circumstances 
should they insist on uniformity, still less should they rush 
headlong into mass action. 5) Higher and lower levels should 
coordinate with each other, and all sectors should cooperate in 
creating a good external environment for the development of such 
associations. 
  The circular urged all localities to further create 
favorable 
conditions for the vigorous development of specialized peasant 
associations, adding that at present all localities should focus 
on carrying out the following tasks: First, they should conduct 
investigations and studies to get a good picture of the main 
types of specialized peasant associations, their number, and 
their organization in their respective areas, and should study 
new situations and new problems. Second, they should sum up 
experiences, and guide and help the steady development of 
various types of specialized peasant associations through 
experimentation and example. Third, they should organize 
various forms of training classes to gradually improve the 
skills of the managerial personnel of such associations. 
Fourth, all localities should assist specialized peasant 
associations in establishing sound regulations and rules in 
order to strengthen internal management. At the same time, it 
is necessary to provide specialized peasant associations with 
markets, scientific and technological information, and other 
services in order to help them grow.

<F P=106> [By Chen Pi-chun (7115 4310 0689) in Beijing: "Zhu Rongji </F>
Orders High-Ranking Officials To Strictly Control Scale of 
Credit and Capital Construction"] 
  [Text] Recently Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the Chinese 
State Council and president of the People's Bank of China, 
notified high-ranking officials in central ministries and 
commissions of the key policy on this year's monetary work and 
asked them to strictly control capital construction and credit 
scales. Zhu Rongji's instructions indicate the recurrence of 
willful fund raising. 
  Zhu Rongji pointed out that the policy for monetary work 
this 
year will basically exercise macrocregulation and control. He 
stressed: The "rules and regulations" set by the national 
monetary work meeting in July last year should continue to be 
implemented; financial institutions are not allowed to violate 
these regulations to raise funds, to build development zones 
without authorization, or to speculate in stock or real estate 
businesses. 
  As learned, capital construction in China was planned to 
reach 800 billion yuan, but turned out to be 1,100 billion yuan, 
far exceeding the plan. According to an estimate by a mainland 
official, 40 percent of the investment in capital construction 
was spent on cement, steel, other building materials, and 
equipment; some was used for workers' wages. As a result, 40 
yuan out of each 100 yuan invested became consumption funds, 
which constitutes purchasing power in the market and has caused 
successive price hikes. 
  As reported, China's scale of capital construction 
investment 
this year will be bigger than last year, reaching more than 
1,500 billion yuan. According to Zhu Rongji's plan for monetary 
work, the key to controlling the scale of capital construction 
is to control bank loans and plug channels for willful fund 
raising. With these aspects under control, the issuance of 
money can also be controlled and inflation reduced. The 
authorities plan to control inflation to below 10 percent this 
year and reduce inflation next year to about 6 percent, Zhu 
Rongji pointed out. 
  As was learned, two-thirds of China's investment in capital 
construction last year was in local construction projects, while 
one-third was used under central plans. Now, provinces and 
cities throughout China, out of consideration for their own 
interests, are carrying out their own capital construction 
projects, including airports, highways, power stations, and 
ports. All of these are proceeding in excess of the state annual 
plan and are dispersing state financial and material resources. 
However, reports say that the Chinese authorities have 
postponed reforms to the central bank, the policy banks, and the 
commercial banks from the beginning of this year to the second 
half of this year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- China is soon to launch 
a nationwide price check, a senior official said. 
  At a tele-conference today, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua urged 
the 
strengthening and improvement of control over pricing in order 
to curb excessive price rises. 
  Zou said that to create an environment favorable for 
implementing various reform policies, it is necessary to keep an 
overall economic balance and a reasonable economic structure. 
  Redoubled efforts should be made to increase market supply, 
especially production and supply for residents' daily 
necessities, he said. 
  He stressed that any price reform program to be put into 
effect must be approved and arranged by the State Council and no 
arbitrary price rise should be allowed. 
  He said that the pace of establishing a sound price control 
system should be quickened and the supervision and 
administration over the prices of daily necessities and services 
should be strengthened. 
  He called for efforts to guide residents' consumption and 
ease the fear of inflation. 
  Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning 
Commission, said at the conference that the check will cover all 
enterprises, and individual households engaging in industry and 
commerce as well as government institutions and the illegal and 
arbitrary charges since the latter half of 1993. 
  Serious violations will be traced back to the latter half of 
1992, Chen said. 
  The check will be conducted mainly on the prices of daily 
necessities as well as service charges, the minister said. 
  The check will be started later this month.

<F P=106> [By He Jun: "Zou Launches Huge Price Probe"] </F>
  [Text] Setting up a price-control system is a key and 
urgent task in China's drive to develop a market economy, said 
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua as he announced a nationwide price 
inspection in Beijing yesterday. 
  Zou urged central and local governments to make every effort 
to restrain price hikes. 
  And he added: "To ease the controls on some prices during 
economic reform does not mean we should let all the prices go 
adrift." 
  The massive price inspection, which is to start immediately, 
has been ordered by the State Council in a bid to ease 
inflationary pressure which has been mounting since late last 
year, said government officials. 
  China's annual inflation rate was 13 per cent in 1993, but 
the figure in 35 large and medium-sized cities shot up to 23.3 
per cent in January this year. 
  The central government has pledged to keep this year's 
inflation rate below 10 per cent. 
  Zou told a nationwide telephone conference that the key to 
checking rises was balancing supply and demand around the 
country, while developing sound price controls. 
  He urged governments at all levels to stop market demand 
expanding too far. 
  This could be done with rigid control of money supply and 
capital investment and by improving the production and supply of 
people's daily necessities, said Zou. 
  He stressed that, price reforms should be carried out 
strictly according to the State Council's schedule, so as to 
reduce any shocks for consumers. 
  Temporary price limits would be introduced to control major 
fluctuations in the price of vital goods and services, he said. 
  He also stressed that a comprehensive system to regulate 
prices should be established, which would include setting up 
reserves for some key agricultural products, a grain risk fund 
and food price fund. 
  The inspection will start, later this month and is expected 
to get results by the end of June, said Chen Jinhua, Minister of 
the State Planning Commission. 
  It will investigate unauthorized price increases imposed on 
goods and services by enterprises, private businesses and 
government institutions since last June, said Chen. 
  The inspection will also be looking for serious price 
violations dating back to June, 1992, he added. 
  Some enterprises have taken advantage of finance, tax and 
exchange rate reforms brought in at the end of last year to 
arbitrarily raise the price of their products and services in 
violation of government regulations. 
  The inspections aim to root out corruption, said Chen. 
  The probe will also seek out other violations such as 
unauthorized rises in the prices of public transport, commercial 
services and agricultural production materials such as chemical 
fertilizers, plastic covers, pesticides and diesel oil. 
  Chen pledged violators would be severely punished, 
especially 
those who attempt to disrupt the inspection. He encouraged 
people to report such cases to the authorities.

China at a teleconference Tuesday [8 March]. 
  At the conference, Zou noted that last year, especially in 
the third quarter, China witnessed many major accidents. 
  He called on local government leaders to examine seriously 
the state of safety in production and to take effective measures 
to prevent accidents. 
  He said that safety was an important aspect of maintaining 
social stability and security. 
  He urged local governments and enterprises to improve the 
responsibility system for safe production and to deal with the 
cases of major accidents, especially with bureaucracy. 
  He said that enterprises should allocate special funds for 
safety-oriented technological transformation. 
  He demanded better safety inspections in the enterprises, 
especially in some overseas-funded enterprises and rural 
enterprises. 
  He also called for safety training among employees and to 
raise the levels of safety precautions.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>
  [Text] China is heading for a deficit of nearly 70 billion 
yuan (HK$62.16 billion) this year, according to the budget 
speech that Finance Minister Liu Zhongli will deliver to the 
National People's Congress tomorrow. The Budget will paint a 
grim, if realistic, picture of the financial state of the 
country. 
  Sources who read a copy of Mr Liu's speech last night said 
the Finance Minister had predicted a slowdown in the growth of 
revenue and a surge of expenditure this year, leading to a 
gargantuan shortfall. 
  Total expenditure in 1994 is projected at 542.9 billion 
yuan, 
up by 15 percent from last year. The central treasury is 
forecast to receive a total of 475.9 billion yuan of revenue 
this year, representing a 7.7 percent increase over the previous 
year. 
  This results in a budgetary shortfall of 67 billion yuan. By 
contrast, the budget deficit for 1993 was 20.5 billion yuan. 
However, Mr Liu said the accounting system this year had been 
changed to bring the Budget more in line with international 
practice. 
  Chinese economists said last night that the change had made 
it difficult to gauge the true extent of the difference between 
the deficits. They pointed out that if the new accounting 
system had been used last year, the deficit would have been much 
higher than 20.5 billion yuan. 
  Mr Liu said that the increase of revenue for 1994 would be 
"restrained" by the fact that the "revenue base" last year was 
already considerable and that room for expansion was limited. 
Tax exemption to be given to the ailing state industrial sector 
would mean a cut of income of 14 billion yuan, he said. Mr Liu 
also said the total size of domestic and foreign debts would 
reach a staggering 129.2 billion yuan this year, up by 39.3 
billion yuan from 1993. 
  Allocations for agriculture would be boosted to 37.8 billion 
yuan, which translated into a dramatic growth of 17.4 percent 
over the previous year. Agrarian-related expenditure include 
the setting up of a risk fund, increased investments for the 
rural sector in general, and measures to guarantee an increase 
for the income of farmers of at least five percent a year. 
  Science, technology culture, and education will get an 
increase of funds from 18 to 20 percent in the face of frantic 
lobbying from these sectors. 
  On the expenditure plan for 1994, a staggering 187.4 billion 
yuan has been set aside for providing funds to regions. It is 
understood that these cover tax returns to regions under the new 
tax reform programme. 
  Nonproduction type of infrastructure is estimated to cost 
the 
central treasury a total of 12 billion yuan. 
  Expenditure on social development will reach 19.4 billion 
yuan. 
  A total of 62.3 billion yuan will be spent under a category 
called "construction of the Government and regime." It is not 
known whether that also covers defence expenditure. 
  The central treasury is to spend a total of 13.1 billion 
yuan 
on price subsidies. 
  According to the Budget, the actual revenue in 1993 stood at 
511.4 billion yuan, up by 23.2 percent. 
  The actual total expenditure last year was 531.8 billion 
yuan, representing an increase of 21.2 percent. 
  Total expenditure on defence in 1993 was 43.2 billion yuan, 
slightly higher than the estimate of 42.5 billion yuan in last 
year's budget. The Budget attributes the increase of 
expenditure to funds for money-losing enterprises, wages 
doubling from an estimated four billion yuan to eight billion. 
  The Finance Minister revealed that the financial situation 
both at the central and region levels had been so severe that 
some regions had met difficulty in paying wages for workers. 
Describing the financial situation as "severe" and "tough," Mr 
Liu said the tight situation would be aggravated further by 
factors such as the high-level investment in fixed-assets, 
increased procurement prices for grain, and higher expenditure 
on wages for civil servants. 
  Mr Liu has laid down the major tasks for this year as: 
Tightening control on expenditure, strengthening macrolevel 
adjustment and control, cutting expenditure by governments of 
all levels; increasing funding for education, agriculture and 
infrastructure development; and limiting the money supply. The 
Finance Minister also indicated that funds for national defence 
and the law-and-order establishment would be "assured." 
Analysts expect the defence budget to go up on a par with the 
13 per cent increase granted to the People's Liberation Army 
last year. 
  In his 25-page report, Mr Liu insisted that drastic fiscal 
reform in the past two months had proven "correct" with no major 
problems resulting. But he would call on legislators not to 
relax their fiscal prudence because there was always discrepancy 
between the targets laid down in the policy and the reality. 
"This is inevitable," Mr Liu said. 
  He urged regions to coordinate their interests and keep a 
constant watch on the implementation of tax reform. Any 
problems should be nipped in the bud before they get worse, he 
said. 
  Regions were warned to take the "overall national interest" 
above their own and not to make their own local regulations on 
taxes and other financial matters. Mr Liu will also urge 
delegates to strictly follow the Budget, adding any local level 
budget deficits "will not be acceptable." The battle against 
malpractices in taxation such as evasion and avoidance should 
continue unabated he said. 
  Localities will also be asked to ensure the smooth issuing 
of 
government bonds. Under the new budget, the central government 
is to curb expenditure while ensuring adequate funds for 
essential capital projects.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- In analyzing our 
country's industrial economic efficiency last year, the State 
Statistical Bureau, the State Planning Commission, and the State 
Economic and Trade Commission recently drew the following 
conclusion: By and large, our country's industrial economic 
development still relies on extensive management, and the 
improvement in industrial economic efficiency is conspicuously 
characterized by "growth-based efficiency." In the new year, we 
should pay greater attention to improving the inherent quality 
of industrial economic operations while taking care to maintain 
moderate industrial growth in the economy. 
  Based on the analysis, it is not difficult to discern from 
the statistics that last year's industrial economic efficiency 
largely stemmed from an expanded production scale, more 
extensive management, and price increases. The general level of 
industrial economic efficiency remained low, with uneven 
development in different regions. These are the apparent 
factors leading to the difficulty in improving industrial 
economic efficiency: Additional factors behind increased 
expenses and reduced profits which were difficult for 
enterprises to absorb, heavy losses incurred by some 
enterprises, and excessive funds tied up by finished products in 
enterprises. More profound problems were the irrational 
industrial structure, poor efficiency in the distribution of 
resources, and the failure by industrial enterprises to change 
their operating mechanisms to keep pace with the market economy. 
Given the current general balance in total supply and demand, 
the irrational industrial structure is especially prominent and 
has a profound impact on the improvement of the general level of 
industrial economic efficiency. The main cause of this 
situation is the scramble among some localities in recent years 
to make investments and to start, indiscriminately arrange, and 
duplicate projects against the backdrop of an irrational 
investment structure and the diversity of the main sources of 
profits. 
  With regard to this year's industrial economic development, 
the three organs admonished all localities and industrial 
enterprises to truly shift the focus and basis of their economic 
work to the central path of improving economic efficiency; to 
abandon the traditional practice of chronically relying merely 
on increased investment, an expanded production scale, and 
extensive management; to accelerate industrial restructuring; to 
effect a genuine shift in industrial economic development from 
extensive management based on growth rates to intensive 
management based on efficiency; and to realize sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development in the industrial sector of the economy.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (XINHUA) -- As an important step to 
deepen reform of the planning structure, the State Planning 
Commission recently transmitted a production plan for industrial 
and transport sectors for 1994, with projected targets as the 
main body. 
  The projected targets are mainly aggregate targets whose 
function is to provide information guidance; generally aggregate 
targets will not be subdivided and transmitted to lower levels. 
The scope and number of products under the mandatory plan are 
further scaled down and reduced with the promotion of the 
projected targets. In terms of gross industrial output value, 
the ratio of the output plan for industrial products controlled 
by the State Planning Commission plan in 1994 is down to 20 
percent from 24 percent the previous year; the number of product 
targets under the mandatory plan is down to 33 from 36, down 8.3 
percent from the previous year; in terms of gross industrial 
output value, the ratio of output value of the mandatory plan 
(including state orders) was down to 4.6 percent from 6.8 
percent the previous year. 
  There have also been great changes in the contents of the 
mandatory plan. Price controls on most of the products under 
the mandatory plan have been lifted, and the differences between 
the prices of a small number of products that have not been 
totally lifted and the market prices have gradually narrowed. 
Generally, the state only does necessary balancing work on the 
production conditions of certain products that fall under the 
mandatory plan and ceases to provide blanket guarantees for 
external production conditions of products that fall under the 
mandatory plan. 
  The 1994 production plan for the industrial and transport 
sectors provides strengthened planning management for key 
enterprises' electricity consumption and for rail transport, 
because they have the effect of imposing the constraint of a 
"bottleneck" on the national economy. To optimize the 
electricity supply and to ensure normal production by key 
enterprises', the State Planning Commission, the State Economics 
and Trade Commission, and the Ministry of Power Industry 
transmitted the 1994 plan for electricity consumption by key 
enterprises. As for a small number of enterprises which 
undertake the heavy tasks of the state mandatory plan or 
undertake the production of important products that affect the 
national economy and the people's livelihood, the transport of 
their products has been incoporated into the 1994 plan; railroad 
departments will give priority to transporting their products.

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- China's national 
economy and social progress have advanced with giant strides, 
according to six major economic indexes. 
  Statistics show that the country's gross domestic product 
(GDP) was 1,000 billion to 2,000 billion yuan (about 100 billion 
to 220 billion U.S. dollars) between the end of the 1980s and 
the early years of the 90s. 
  For the first time, the GDP topped 3,000 billion yuan last 
year. 
  The total retail volume of consumer goods was 1,000 billion 
yuan-worth last year, following average annual increases of 100 
billion yuan for the previous two years. 
  The output of pork, beef and mutton totalled over 30 million 
tons in 1993, 9.7 percent up over the previous year. 
  The per capita income for urban residents reached 2,000 yuan 
(about 220 U.S. dollars) last year. 
  The total areas of housing built annually, which had been 
about 100 million sq m [square meters] a year for over ten 
years, reached 200 million sq m in 1993. 
  The actual use of foreign funds by China reached 30 billion 
U.S. dollars last year. 
  Economic analysts hold that these statistics mean that 
China's economy has reached a new height.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of 
Chemical Industry recently issued an emergency circular urging 
chemical industrial departments and chemical industrial 
enterprises in all localities to take prompt action to increase 
chemical fertilizer production and to increase the effective 
supplies of chemical fertilizers to meet spring farming needs. 
  With the start of the busy spring farming season, chemical 
fertilizers have been in short supply in some localities. At 
the same time, chemical fertilizer production has continued to 
decrease due to increased costs, shortage of funds, and other 
problems -- the situation is grim. The emergency circular urged 
all localities to faithfully carry out their chemical fertilizer 
production plans, elaborately organize their production work, 
carry out the preferential policies the state has adopted toward 
chemical fertilizer production enterprises, and create favorable 
external conditions for chemical fertilizer production. The 
circular also urged all enterprises to directly sell their 
chemical fertilizers to grass-roots supply and marketing 
cooperatives or peasant households, to market their products 
jointly with grass-roots farming materials supply and marketing 
cooperatives, or to appoint these cooperatives as their sales 
agents, in order to reduce intermediate links and to ease 
peasants' burdens. The circular also urged all enterprises to 
properly arrange loans for the storage of chemical fertilizers 
during slack seasons. 
  It has been learned that the Ministry of Chemical Industry 
will soon send six work groups to all localities to look into 
the situation of chemical fertilizer production and marketing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhang Xianghai, deputy director general of </F>
the State Administration of Taxation, by staff reporter Li Ning; 
place and date not given -- first graf is BEIJING REVIEW 
introduction] 
  [Text] Since China's new policies for reforming the 
country's taxation system went into effect on January 1 this 
year, many foreign investors have expressed great concern about 
possible changes on taxation policies for foreign-funded 
enterprises. In a recent interview with a reporter from BEIJING 
REVIEW, Zhang Xianghai, deputy director general of the State 
Administration of Taxation, answered questions concerning the 
issue. Excerpts follow: 
  QUESTION: [Q] What modifications concerning the taxation of 
foreign-funded enterprises are found in the current taxation 
reform? 
  ANSWER: [A] Taxation reform concerning enterprises using 
foreign investment and foreign enterprises includes the 
following major aspects: According to the decision adopted by 
the Fifth Session of the Standing People's Congress, effective 
on January 1, 1994, foreign funded enterprises and foreign 
enterprises became subject to national unified taxes such as 
value-added tax, excise duty and business tax. Imposition of 
the taxes was necessary to develop both the socialist market 
economy and a fair taxation system, and was in line with the 
demands of a majority of foreign-funded and foreign enterprises. 
The reforms adopted the important principle of placing no undue 
tax burden on foreign-funded enterprises in order to ensure the 
consistency and stability of China's taxation policies. Simply 
stated, the state established taxation rates based on avoiding 
both increases or decreases in the general level of tax burden. 
In general, the reform measures guarantee state revenue, while 
at the same time avoiding placing an added tax burden on 
enterprises. Nonetheless, changes in the taxation structure and 
channels of taxation will inevitably result in minor increases 
or decreases in taxes on certain products and enterprises. As 
part of an effort to solve this particular problem, the state 
will implement necessary policies and measures to ensure a 
smooth transition from the old taxation system to the new. 
According to a recent decision approved by the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress, foreign-funded 
enterprises established before December 31, 1993, which face an 
increased tax burden due to imposition of value-added tax, 
excise duty and business tax, will with the approval of taxation 
authorities, receive refunds for increased tax payments during 
their term of business operations within five years. 
Foreign-funded enterprises established after January 1, 1994, 
are subject to the new tax law. 
  Q: Following the unification of income taxes on domestic 
enterprises, domestic enterprises enjoy tax rates equivalent to 
those of foreign-funded enterprises. However, the latter 
previously enjoyed various other privileges. Are preferential 
policies such as these still valid? 
  A: The taxation reform confirms that the Income Tax Law of 
the People's Republic of China for Enterprises With Foreign 
Investment and Foreign Enterprises, effective as of July 1, 
1991, will remain in effect and the various privileges stated in 
the law will remain unchanged. At present, however, domestic 
enterprises enjoy tax rates equal to those of foreign-funded 
enterprises. This is aimed at providing conditions and 
opportunities for enterprises to compete on an equal footing. 
Preferential policies granted to foreign funded enterprises 
will remain unchanged. On the basis of unifying tax rates for 
domestic enterprises, the state will, at an appropriate time and 
after necessary preparations, use legal means to unify the 
income system for both domestic and foreign enterprises through 
the promulgation of The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the 
People's Republic of China. 
  Q: Previously, various localities arbitrarily established 
development zones and granted certain preferential taxation 
policies without having first obtained the approval of the 
central government. How do state taxation authorities plan to 
approach this issue? 
  A: While it is necessary to provide preferential taxation 
policies for foreign investors, such policies should be enacted 
in strict accordance with the law. Preferential taxation 
policies should be designated only by the central government, 
which alone has the final say concerning the issue. China is a 
large country with 30 provinces (excluding Taiwan), 
municipalities and autonomous regions, hundreds of cities and 
thousands of counties. Confusion would reign if local 
governments were allowed to proceed as they wished. Allowing 
them to do so would not only lessen the original function of 
preferential taxation policies, but would also destroy the 
country's overall taxation environment. Preferential taxation 
policies are only part of the investment environment, and other 
factors such as resources, infrastructure and labor conditions 
are perhaps more important. In 1992, the State Council issued 
the Circular on Strengthening Taxation Administration and 
Strictly Controlling Tax Reductions and Exemptions. The 
circular contains two articles concerning the taxation of 
foreign-funded enterprises, reaffirming that all preferential 
taxation policies arbitrarily designated by local governments 
and departments which are contradictory to the state taxation 
laws and regulations are invalid, and should immediately be 
withdrawn or rectified. The circular also stated that all 
economic development zones lacking the approval of the State 
Council are prohibited from receiving various preferential 
taxation policies granted to approved state level development 
zones. The State Council's effort to rectify the situation is 
designed to guarantee the correct implementation of taxation 
laws and regulations in order to protect the legitimate 
interests of investors. 
  Q: What is the situation concerning tax revenue received 
from foreign-funded enterprises during the past 15 years of 
reform and opening? 
  A: Since implementation of the reform and opening policies, 
China has adopted a series of preferential taxation policies to 
encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the country. The 
preferential polices have played an active role in attracting 
foreign investment and accelerating economic development. 
Throughout the period, China's tax revenues from foreign funded 
enterprises have increased substantially on an annual basis. In 
1992, tax revenues from foreign-funded enterprises soared to 
10.7 billion yuan, a dramatic 52 percent increase over the 
previous year, and the figure hit 20 billion yuan in 1993. 
  In terms of reforms of the taxation system, China has 
insisted on the following three principles -- the protection of 
national interests, facilitating the opening effort, and 
gradually instituting generally accepted international 
practices. China will continue to abide by the three principles 
in any future taxation reform.

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- The wages of foreign 
experts working in China will be increased by 50 percent, 
back-dated to January 1, 1994, according to sources from the 
State Bureau of Foreign Experts. 
  The move is intended to protect the foreign experts' 
standard 
of living from the effects of the merger of China's two-tiered 
foreign exchange rates and from the rise of prices. 
  For experts from abroad coming to work in China in the 
future, said the sources, new salary policies will be applied, 
under which the monthly salary of a foreign expert in the 
culture and education sphere will be 2,000 to 4,800 yuan (230 to 
550 U.S. dollars), and that of other foreign citizens working in 
China 1,200 to 2,000 yuan (138 to 230 U.S. dollars). 
  Foreign experts' holiday subsidies are to be raised, too. 
  The salaries of other foreign experts in the culture and 
education sphere, and of other foreigners, brought to China 
under cooperation agreements of governments, friendly cities, 
college-to-college exchanges and people-to-people exchanges will 
be settled through negotiations, the sources said. 
  The new salaries are in addition to the continuing 
arrangements providing the foreign experts with housing, 
transportation and health care.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692): "State Council </F>
Makes Decision That Profits of Mainland Power Plants Invested in 
by Foreign Businessmen Are Not Allowed To Exceed 12 Percent"] 
  [Text] According to a Beijing source, the State Council 
made a decision not long ago which said that in Sino-foreign 
joint-venture power plants, the investment returns of the 
foreign partner should not exceed 12 percent. The Chinese side 
may reject excessive demands made by foreign parties. 
  The source told this reporter yesterday that an official in 
charge of the State Council had personally taken up the matter 
involving a hydropower plant, a Sino-foreign joint venture in 
Zhuhai. He instructed that the foreign party's request for an 
18 percent return on investment must not be accepted. Later, 
the foreign party lowered the return on investment to less than 
15 percent, which was accepted by the Chinese side. However, 
the State Council pointed out that the case should not be taken 
as a precedent. 
  The source pointed out: "In recent years, localities have 
tried by every means to develop Sino-foreign joint power 
projects on a large scale. More than 300 letters of intent and 
agreements have been signed over the past three years. However, 
only a limited number of projects eventually have proved 
successful." 
  He continued by saying that some provinces and cities were 
overanxious for quick results, accepting the harsh terms 
proposed by foreign parties, including high rates of return on 
investment. This case has aroused attention of the State 
Council. 
  Owing to a lack of experience during the initial period of 
attracting foreign investment in power projects, some southern 
provinces accepted the request by a Hong Kong company for a 50 
percent return on investment and for fixing the price of coal at 
90 yuan per ton for a long term. 
  According to the source, the State Council, in principle, 
has 
set the return on investment for foreign parties in Sino-foreign 
power project ventures at 11-12 percent. If the foreign party 
makes excessive demands, the Chinese side may reject the request. 
  China's total installed capacity was 167 billion kw by the 
end of 1993, and 840 billion kw of electricity was generated 
during the year. Of this, 671.5 billion kw was generated by 
thermal power plants, 127 billion kw by hydropower plants, and 
1.5 billion kw by nuclear power plants. 
  Last year China invested 52.2 billion yuan in power 
construction, newly adding installed capacity of 12 billion kwh. 
The state plans to invest 6 million yuan [as published] this 
year and the newly installed capacity should be higher than that 
in the previous year. 
  He continued by saying that the per capita consumption of 
electricity in mainland China is 600 kwh, while the figure is 
over 5,000 kwh in the United States and over 2,000 kwh in Hong 
Kong, Japan, and Britain. 
  To meet the standard of intermediate-level developing 
countries, where the per capita consumption of electricity is 
1,000 kwh, he said, China will have to increase its installed 
capacity to 1.2 billion kwh. 
  To vigorously develop power construction in the future, the 
source said, China will pay equal attention to thermal, 
hydropower, and nuclear power. At present, China is now 
selecting sites along the coast for building nuclear power 
plants. He continued by saying that high growth has been 
registered in China's economy and industry. For this reason, it 
is imperative to develop energy. On the premise of rationality 
and mutual benefit, China is willing to cooperate with investors 
from all countries to build more power plants in China. 
  He pointed out that progress has been smooth for the Zhuhai 
power plant, built by Zhuhai in cooperation with Hong Kong's 
Cheung Kong and other corporations. A number of large thermal 
power plants will be open to foreign investment, and tenders 
will be invited from all countries very soon.

  [Text] To obtain detailed information on some important 
aspects of national conditions and national power, our country 
has established a system of periodic general surveys based on 
scientific and rational statistical surveying methods. The 
areas to be covered by general surveys, the times when such 
surveys are to be conducted, and the organization of and funding 
for such surveys will all be codified into laws or regulations. 
  According to the State Statistical Bureau, general surveys 
are comprehensive statistical surveys specifically organized by 
the state. Because of their extensive scope and the employment 
of multiple indicators, such surveys can yield detailed 
statistical data that can be grouped into different categories 
based on different indicators. Besides providing major and 
basic statistical data on national conditions and national 
power, such surveys will furnish a sample framework for 
conducting all kinds of spot checks. Although our country has 
successfully conducted some general surveys since it founding, a 
periodic system has yet to take shape for general surveys other 
than census-taking. 
  The State Statistical Bureau has decided: From now on, a 
sound periodic system has to be instituted gradually for all 
general surveys on national conditions and national power. The 
main items of general surveys will include population, industry, 
agriculture, tertiary industry, and other basic statistical 
units [ji ben tong ji dan wei 1015 2609 4827 6060 0830 0143]. 
Censuses and general surveys on tertiary industry, industry, 
and agriculture will be carried out every 10 years, with the 
first at the end of each decade and the remainder in the third, 
fifth, and seventh years of each decade, respectively. General 
surveys on basic statistical units will be carried out every 
five years, in the first and sixth years of each decade. Some 
surveys of relatively small scale or regional surveys will be 
scheduled for other years. 
  It has been disclosed that the State Council has approved 
the 
nationwide general survey on agriculture scheduled for 1997. 
The State Statistical Bureau and relevant ministries and 
commissions will make specific plans this year.

  [Text] After six months of currency stability, the 
renminbi is coming under renewed selling pressure on black 
markets around the country. In Beijing, black market traders 
were yesterday buying dollars at a rate of US$1 to Rmb8.88, a 
premium of more than 2 percent on the local swap market and 
almost 5 percent on rates, inclusive of commission, offered by 
banks. 
  In Guangzhou and Shanghai, black market rates were lower, 
ranging between Rmb8.80 and Rmb8.83 to the dollar, but traders' 
expectations were that dollars are set to become more expensive. 
"Suddenly a lot of people want dollars and there aren't enough 
around," a black market dealer in Beijing said. 
  Until two weeks ago, black market rates for dollars had 
remained in line with the Rmb8.7 to the dollar rate at which 
China unified its currency on January 1. But change has come 
quickly. Black market rates in Beijing have moved to Rmb8.8 to 
the dollar over the past 10 days. Official bank rates, which 
follow prices in China's swap centres, have remained unchanged. 
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, and the State 
Administration of Exchange Controls manipulate dollar rates in 
the swap markets by controlling access to the market and by 
setting price limits. Swap centres opened yesterday at Rmb8.68 
to the dollar. 
  "The return of the black market is a sign that in economic 
terms things are going in the wrong direction," a Beijing-based 
diplomat said. "At these levels there is no need for dire 
concern, but the government should take it as an early warning." 
  At current rates, the black market is already likely to draw 
tourists, expatriates and small companies with dollar revenues 
away from China's banks and swap centres. "The vast majority of 
companies won't be tempted to break the law," the diplomat said. 
"But if we get a spread of 5 to 10 percent, there could be a 
serious problem." 
  Trading volumes in China's black markets are at present 
reckoned to be tiny compared with that of the swap centres, but 
the black market dollar rate has an important psychological 
role. Any depreciation of the renminbi on the black market 
brings pressure to bear on the People's Bank of China to allow 
depreciation of swap market rates. 
  Bankers in Beijing and Shanghai yesterday pointed to two 
main 
reasons for the renminbi's sudden black market depreciation. 
The first is an increase in money supply in the last quarter of 
1993. This liquidity is now feeding through into the economy and 
more renminbi is chasing a static supply of hard currency. The 
second factor is inflation, currently at over 20 percent in the 
big cities, which means people do no want to hang on to renminbi. 
  None of the bankers yesterday would hazard a guess as to 
where the black market dollar rate is headed. Black market 
traders themselves said the momentum was upwards. 
  The free market, however, is likely to receive visits from 
the police if it continues to operate at official expense.

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (AFP)--Some eight months after 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji stepped in to restore stability to 
China's plunging currency, the yuan's dollar value on the street 
is again moving away from bank exchange rates. 
  Black market traders in Beijing were Wednesday buying 
dollars 
for up to 8.87 yuan, compared with Tuesday's close of 8.696 yuan 
on the so-called "united market," comprising five swap markets 
linked earlier this month by computer ahead of a planned 
nationwide exchange beginning April 1. 
  Banks were meanwhile offering just 8.48 yuan to the dollar. 
  Until the end of February, the rate on the street had 
closely 
tailed the swap market -- which has hovered around 8.7 yuan to 
the dollar since the unification of the country's dual currency 
system on January 1. 
  "There are lots of people wanting to buy now and there's not 
enough dollars," one black market trader said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251): "There Is a </F>
Vast Gas Area in South China Sea--Interviewing Wang Yan, 
President of China National Offshore Oil Corporation"] 
  [Text] In 1993, China National Offshore Oil Corporation 
devoted great efforts to prospecting for natural gas, for the 
first time, in the Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin in Nanhai [South 
China Sea]. 
  A great victory was scored in the first trial. In 1993, two 
gas fields were discovered. One was the Ledong 15-1 Gas Field 
and the other was the Dongfang 1-1 Gas Field. 
  Before this, great discoveries had been made in prospecting 
for natural gas in Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin. A decade ago, 
when drilling a well in the contracted Yacheng 13-1 zone in 
Yinggehai, the U.S. company Arco discovered the Yacheng 13-1 gas 
field, which is now under construction and will deliver gas to 
Hong Kong in 1996. 
  As there are three gas fields within the same basin, what 
kind of prospects does it indicate? 
  Hence, this reporter interviewed Wang Yan, president of 
China 
National Offshore Oil Corporation not long ago. 
  President Wang, who took part in the prospecting and 
construction of the first offshore well in our country and once 
acted as the head of Nanhai Xibu Petroleum Corporation, was 
extremely familiar with the Nanhai Sea waters. For him, he 
carries in his mind a map depicting the situation of natural gas 
prospecting in Nanhai. 
  As introduced by President Wang, Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan 
Basin 
is a rapidly subsiding basin, and such a geological environment 
is the best place for producing and storing natural gas. This 
point is also illustrated by the current situation of the 
Yacheng 13-1 gas field in this basin which has already been 
proved. 
  The gas-bearing sandy layer of the Yacheng 13-1 gas field is 
over 100-meters thick. With the assessment and calculation made 
by a third independent party--U.S. Geological Advisory Company, 
which is a worldwide authority, the reserves of this gas field 
are estimated at 100 billion cubic meters, which is equivalent 
to an oil field with 100 million metric tons of crude reserves. 
Compared with natural gas fields which have been discovered in 
our country, the reserves of Yacheng 13-1 gas field amount to 
approximately 50 percent of the remaining proved reserves in the 
whole area of Sichuan; and its size, abundance (referring to the 
gas-bearing area per square kilometer), and productive capacity 
is markedly better than that of gas areas in Shaanxi, Gansu, and 
Ningxia. It is the largest single gas field discovered in our 
country so far. 
  The reserves of the two gas fields newly discovered last 
year 
are also quite large. Now, efforts are being vigorously made to 
drill wells there for assessment. 
  Last year, China National Offshore Oil Corporation drilled 
two exploratory wells, but the attempts failed because the 
pressure was too high. However, the "failure was gratifying" 
because it was only the project which failed but a layer of 
quite abundant gas was found in the two wells. According to 
seismic measures, the gas-bearing sandy layer was more than 200 
meters thick, whereas in the Yacheng 13-1 gas field, which has 
100 billion cubic meters of reserves, the gas-bearing sandy 
layer was over 100 meter thick. Hence, if the drilling of the 
third well in this structure, which has already been carried 
out, is successful and can be further verified, we will have a 
large gas field with reserves even greater than that of Yacheng 
13-1 gas field by 100 to 200 percent. What is gratifying is 
that China National Offshore Oil Corporation has also found the 
structure of Yacheng 23-1 gas field around the area which is 
similar to Yacheng 21-1 gas field. 
  An area of over 260,000 square kilometer in the 
Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin can be prospected and geologists 
have already discovered over 100 formations. There are four 
types of formations for producing and storing natural gas in 
this basin, and now gas fields have been found in three of them, 
which will, no doubt, greatly widen the scope of finding gas and 
indicate very gratifying prospects. The China National Offshore 
Oil Corporation has set the "joint development of oil and gas" 
as a long-term strategy of development. From last year onwards, 
it was unequivocally stated that in the future priority would be 
given to gas extraction. Consequently, in the first year of 
"giving priority to" gas extraction in the 
Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin, reports of new successes kept 
pouring in. 
  The trend of gas extraction is gratifying but also pressing. 
President Wang Yan said: In 1994, the China National Offshore 
Oil Corporation will further give priority to the 
Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin. Now the corporation has set up a 
leading group headed by the chief geologist to handle the 
project in the vast gas area in Nanhai. Investment in the 
Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin will be increased from 400 million 
yuan to 600 million yuan, and we are going to drill six 
exploratory wells and three assessment wells. At present, three 
well-drilling vessels are intensively carrying out work in this 
area. 
  When talking about the significance of discovering a vast 
gas 
area in Nanhai, President Wang pointed out: Natural gas is a 
fine-quality and pure fuel and also important for industrial 
chemicals. Natural gas accounts for approximately 30 percent of 
the world's total of energy production and consumption, among 
some developed countries account for 50 percent, whereas in our 
country it accounts for a mere three percent. Hence, our 
country has a very great potential in developing the natural gas 
industry. In particular, as the vast gas area in Nanhai is 
adjacent to coastal areas in the southeast, which are 
economically developed but extremely short of energy, the market 
prospects are very good. 
  Finally, President Wang pointed at the locations of several 
key exploratory wells on the map, held up three fingers, and 
smiled and said, "Even if the chance is one out of three, there 
is a very high probability of finding a vast gas area." He said 
with full confidence, "This year, we must definitely make a 
major breakthrough in the vast gas area in Nanhai."

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Qinghai provincial party </F>
committee secretary Yin Kesheng by XINHUA reporters Jin Jiasheng 
(6855 0857 5116) and Sun Ninghai (1327 1337 3189): "Take 
Advantage of Resource Superiority To Develop Qinghai's Economy"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Feb (XINHUA) -- Qinghai is a big 
province with abundant resources but a weak economic base. The 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure will 
inevitably create more historic opportunities for Qinghai's 
development. Only by seizing the opportunity and taking 
advantage of the resource superiority can the people of all 
nationalities in Qinghai rapidly develop Qinghai's economy. Yin 
Kesheng, secretary of the Qinghai provincial CPC committee, 
explained the fundamental way to develop Qinghai's economy 
during an interview with reporters soon after the Chinese New 
Year. 
  "Qinghai, with a vast area indeed, has attractive natural 
resources for people to exploit." On Qinghai's resources, Yin 
Kesheng, who did petroleum prospecting work in the Qaidam desert 
for a long time, showed a great deal of emotion. He said: 
Qinghai has such resources as lake salt, hydroelectric power, 
petroleum, natural gas, non-ferrous metals and asbestos, and the 
confirmed deposits of them have a potential value of 8 trillion 
yuan. More than 10 of its mineral deposits, such as sodium, 
potassium, lithium, iodine, bromine, boron and asbestos rank 
first in quantity among all provinces in China. The upper 
reaches of the Huanghe in Qinghai are rich in hydroelectric 
power resources which are scarce in other parts of China. 
Qinghai's petroleum gas, non-ferrous metal, and gold resources 
are also abundant. The confirmed natural gas deposit is now 50 
billion cubic meters, while it was less than 10 billion cubic 
meters in the late 1970's. 
  Since the start of reform and opening up, Qinghai has made 
great efforts to exploit its resources and achieve prosperity, 
and it has found the road to success. Now, potash fertilizer in 
Chaerhan, the lead and zinc mine at Xitieshan, and asbestos at 
Mangya have become large state construction projects. In recent 
years, state-run enterprises, collectives, and individuals in 
various localities in the province were busily engaged in 
exploitation of resources. Baima County in Golog Zang Autonomous 
Prefecture used to be a "national-class" poor county. In recent 
years, the county has discovered gold deposits and greatly 
improved its financial situation. Qilian County in Haibei Zang 
Autonomous Prefecture has rapidly achieved financial 
self-sufficiency by relying on mining asbestos, coal, lead and 
zinc, copper and gold. Many counties, towns, and salt 
enterprises in Qaidam Basin have developed themselves by 
exploitation of natural resources. Now, there are some 100 
state-run mining enterprises and nearly 300 collectively- run 
and private mining enterprises in the province, and the output 
value of the mining industry accounts for one-sixth of the 
province's total industrial output value. 
  On future tasks, Yin Kesheng said: The progress of the 
nation's modernization and the gradual widening of the gap 
between eastern and western regions have further enhanced the 
sense of urgency and crisis among the cadres and people in 
Qinghai. At the same time, the daily increasing demand of 
coastal and interior regions for energy and raw and processed 
materials has provided a huge market for Qinghai's large-scale 
exploitation of resources. In order to achieve a rapid economic 
development, Qinghai must continue to exploit its natural 
resources. He expressed the following views: First, we should 
further emancipate our mind and have new ideas. In order to 
open the door of the province, we must first open the door of 
our mind and must not fear that others might come to take 
advantage of our resources. Second, we should have confidence 
and fear no hardship. Third, we should boldly use technology, 
capital, and specialized personnel from the outside world and 
other parts of our country. Fourth, we should make scientific 
exploitation of resources and avoid working blindly and 
recklessly. Repeated feasibility appraisal should be done to 
planned projects. In economic development, we should consider 
economic benefit, social benefit, environmental protection, and 
resource preservation simultaneously. Fifth, we should pay 
attention to the timely solution of problems and difficulties 
during the exploitation of resources. 
  Qinghai is a province where ethnic minority people live in 
compact communities. The people of Tibetan, Hui, Tu, Salar, 
Mongol and other minority nationalities account for 42 percent 
of the total population, and most natural resources are located 
in regions of ethnic minority people. Yin Kesheng said: During 
the course of natural resource exploitation, we must fully 
consider the interests of local ethnic minority people. All 
resource exploitation projects of the state, the province, 
autonomous prefectures, prefectures, and counties should help 
the development of local economy of minority nationalities and 
play a promoting and radiating role. We should take the road of 
common prosperity for all nationalities. Of course, the ethnic 
minority regions should also contribute to the overall interest 
of the state. Yin Kesheng firmly believes that Qinghai will 
certainly take a greater step in resource exploitation, and its 
development will be full of promise if the people of all 
nationalities are united, continue to display the hard-working 
plateau spirit, and work under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 KYODO -- Three well-known Chinese 
dissidents left Beijing for southern China on Friday [11 March] 
morning prior to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
scheduled arrival for a four-day visit, reliable sources said. 
  According to a statement reportedly left by Wang Dan, Zhuo 
Duo and Min Qi, they have left Beijing "voluntarily" and have 
asked the U.S. Government to renew China's most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trading status, the sources said. 
  It was widely rumored that Christopher, who will arrive in 
Beijing on Friday evening, would meet Wang. 
  But Christopher said Thursday in Tokyo that he has no plans 
"at the present time" to meet Chinese dissidents during his 
visit to China. 
  Several other dissidents, including Wei Jingsheng, have 
reportedly stated that they have left the capital "voluntarily." 
  No direct confirmation of these reports has been possible. 
  Police surrounded Wei's house last week and Wang's residence 
Thursday. 
  The dissidents are reportedly under pressure from the 
central 
authorities to leave town during China's ongoing National 
People's Congress (NPC) and the Christopher visit. 
  Christopher is expected to confront the Chinese leadership 
on 
human rights issues, including the detention and jailing of 
dissidents for peacefully expressing their political views. 
  On Thursday, Wang issued an open letter calling on deputies 
to the NPC to bring the MFN debate, which has been raging 
between the U.S. and Chinese governments, on to the congress 
agenda. 
  The U.S. has linked extending China's trade status with 
"overall significant progress" in human rights and laid out an 
agenda of hoped-for progress.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (AFP) -- The Chinese government 
hit back Thursday at renewed foreign accusations of religious 
persecution and defended recent regulations aimed at restricting 
the religious activities of foreigners in China. 
  "Foreigners in China should respect China's laws, refrain 
from harming the public interest of Chinese society and should 
not interfere in China's religious affairs through whatever 
means," a foreign ministry spokesman said. 
  The spokesman was responding to comments made in Bonn on 
Tuesday by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who said he was 
"concerned by the new Chinese laws on religion which have 
introduced a further restriction on freedom of belief and to the 
arrest of Chinese and foreign Christians." 
  A stronger denunciation came from the chairman of the U.S. 
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human rights, Tom Lantos, 
when he called on Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who 
arrives here Friday, to "emphasise our revulsion and outrage at 
China's vicious campaign of religious persecution." 
  Fearful of a possible challenge to its own authority, the 
Chinese government issued new regulations, which took effect 
January 31, to strengthen control over religious practice and 
limit ties between Chinese and foreign believers. 
  The regulations "are not for the purpose of restricting 
religious freedoms," the spokesman said, "but fully show that 
the Chinese government respects the freedom of belief of 
foreigners in China and Chinese citizens." However, he also 
stressed that "China's religious bodies are not subject to 
foreign control." 
  A group of American, Indonesian and Hong Kong missionaries 
were detained for five days last month for having "conducted 
illegal religious activities" in violation of the new 
regulations. The foreign missionaries eventually returned to 
Hong Kong, but the fate of three local Chinese Christians 
detained at the same time remains unknown. 
  "We must protect normal religious activities and protect the 
cultural and academic exchanges in the field of religion between 
foreigners and the religious circles in China," the spokesman 
said.

  [Text] Geneva, March 9 (XINHUA) -- The 50th session of the 
U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted here today a Chinese 
motion that no decision will be taken on the draft resolution 
entitled "The Situation of Human Rights in China." 
  Similar draft resolutions presented by some Western 
countries 
at the previous three U.N. human rights sessions were rejected. 
  At today's session, the motion put forward by Jin Yongjian, 
head of the Chinese delegation received 20 votes for, 16 against 
and 17 abstentions. 
  Jin pointed out that those who don't prejudice against China 
can see how it currently enjoys political and social stability, 
sustained and rapid economic development while its democracy and 
legal system continues to be perfected. 
  The living standard of Chinese people has gone up 
significantly and they are enjoying wider human rights and more 
fundamental freedom than in any of its previous periods of 
history, Jin said. 
  Jin said that the aim of those countries who had colluded to 
draft the resolutions was only to exert political pressure on 
China and to obstruct China's economic development, thus forcing 
Chinese people to change the path of development which they have 
chosen according to their own national conditions. 
  "China is willing to cooperate internationally in the field 
of human rights, in accordance with the purposes and principles 
of the U.N. Charter and on the basis of mutual respect and 
equality," Jin added. 
  "However, China is firmly opposed to any attempt by any 
country or blocks of countries to vilify it in the name of 
protecting human rights," he said. 
  Before the vote, deputies from many developing countries 
such 
as Cuba, Mauritius, Syria, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and 
Iran, expressed their support for the Chinese delegation's 
motion. 
  They pointed out that the international community should be 
aware of the great progress that China has made in nearly every 
aspect. The Chinese Government has accepted the challenge of 
efficiently managing such a big country, which has a quarter of 
the world's population and has ensured that the living standard 
of Chinese people has gone up consistently. 
  China's contributions to the world should be highly praised 
and encouraged, they said. 
  They also pointed out that some Western countries are used 
to 
imposing their own views on others, and their draft resolution 
about China has been put together with clear political 
intentions.

  [Text] The United Nations, 8 March (XINHUA) -- According 
to Chen Jian, PRC deputy permanent representative to the United 
Nations, the issue of expanding the UN Security Council should 
be settled on the basis of overall considerations, balance, and 
equity to ensure all interests are taken into account and to 
avoid new imbalances. 
  Chen Jian stated: With the changing of the international 
situation and the continuous expansion of UN membership, growing 
calls have been heard from the vast number of UN members, and 
from developing countries in particular, for enlarging the 
Security Council, an important UN body. China favors the 
expansion of the Security Council at the appropriate time. He 
pointed out: Expansion of the Security Council should be done 
under the guidance of the UN Charter and in a manner which 
provides full consideration to the principle of equitable 
distribution so the Security Council will be more 
representative, more efficient, and more capable of dealing with 
major international issues in a positive, balanced, equitable, 
and efficient manner. 
  He added: Expansion of the Security Council involves the 
interests of all quarters. Balancing these diverse interests is 
a very complicated issue. Therefore, we should consider this 
issue from all sides, especially taking into account the fact 
that the developing nations make up a majority of the UN 
membership, so as to strike a balance between developed and 
developing nations as well as between various regions. 
Moreover, it is also important for the regions to reach a 
consensus. 
  Chen Jian also said: It is necessary to give full play to 
democracy by extensively enlisting the views of the member 
nations, medium and small nations in particular; by conducting 
comprehensive, in-depth, and full consultations; and by finding 
a rational formula acceptable to all through negotiation and 
consensus-building.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Japan and the United 
States reaffirmed their determination today to maintain close 
defense ties in the post-cold war era. 
  Representatives from the two countries met for the first 
time 
at what is known as the "two-plus-two" conference of the foreign 
and defense ministers of Japan and the U.S. 
  A joint announcement after the meeting said: "The two sides 
believe that the U.S.-Japan alliance has grown stronger and has 
increased in importance in the post-cold war period." 
  Attending the first security consultative committee meeting 
were U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Under-Secretary 
of Defense Frank G. Wisner, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata and Director General of the Defense Agency Katsuo Aiichi. 
  Wisner was representing the U.S. new Defense Secretary 
William Perry. 
  Participants at the meeting stressed that the security 
relationship between Japan and the United States remains 
unchanged in the new era despite frequent trade disagreements. 
  They also pointed out the need for expanding the two-way 
flow 
of defense technology. 
  Discussing the situation on the Korean peninsula, the two 
sides said they believed that a diplomatic solution is the best 
means of resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The first ministerial "two-plus-two" meeting was held to 
conform a Japanese-U.S. agreement reached 1990.

  [Text] Moscow, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev today stressed the need to make joint 
efforts in building a new Europe. 
  Speaking at a news conference before the meeting of the 
Council for Foreign Policy, the Russian minister said, "Russia 
is set to prevent any weakening of partnership established with 
the United States" and will "specify its substance on the basis 
of full equality of rights and duties." 
  Kozyrev stressed that "It is necessary to begin joint 
efforts 
to form a strategic partnership in building a new Europe." 
  "President Yeltsin has put forth this initiative, which is 
now being considered by the leaders of Western countries," 
Kozyrev added. 
  He said practical headway has been made towards making 
former 
enemies into friends and allies. 
  "The idea of cooperation with NATO has been given substance 
in the U.S. concept of a Partnership for Peace, which opened a 
period of drafting and implementing programs involving all 
countries on an equal basis," the Russian minister noted. 
  He went on to say that "Russia is close to signing the 
relevant documents." 
  Kozyrev warned however that "The NATO mania of impatience in 
advocating others joining the alliance and the partnership, 
accompanied by an anti-Russian hysteria, can lead to the 
strengthening of the position of Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his 
supporters." 
  The Russian minister rejected attempts of "certain circles 
in 
the West, Central and Eastern Europe to speculate on the 
Zhirinovsky factor and revive the image of a NATO enemy in the 
face of Russia." 
  "Those who insist on the thesis of a Russian menace begin to 
believe it themselves," Kozyrev said, adding that the 
artificially generated threat makes people blind and prevents 
them from seeing the real problems of security. 
  "The victory in the Cold War was not won by the NATO 
military 
machine but by the democratic principles of the Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (ESCE). It is the ESCE which 
is bound to win a stable democratic peace in post-confrontation 
Europe," the Russian minister concluded.

  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], March 11 (XINHUA) -- The Myanmar 
[Burma] government is opposed to the U.S. Senate's decision on 
establishment of "Radio Free Asia," saying that it is just to 
try to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries 
including Myanmar, an official report said here today. 
  it is the first time that the Myanmar government expresses 
its concern over the U.S. Senate decision on February 2 to 
establish "Radio Free Asia," a broadcasting service covering 
China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Cambodia, 
Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. 
  Director-general of the political department of the Myanmar 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has of late invited the charge 
d'affaires of the United States Embassy to Myanmar to the 
ministry and conveyed Myanmar's "deep regret" that such a 
decision had been taken. 
  The director-general said that if "Radio Free Asia" should 
become operational and Myanmar is targeted, "it could in no way 
be considered constructive or promoting the development of good 
relations between Myanmar and the U.S."

<F P=106> [Fourth of four installments: "Special article" by Chu </F>
Hsing-fu (2612 1630 4395): "China and the United States Should 
Highly Value Their Harmony--Written on the Eve of Christopher's 
Visit to China" -- previous installments published in the 9, 10 
March China Daily Report] 
  [Text] Mutual Hostility Is Not Good 
  When U.S. Secretary of State Christopher arrives Beijing on 
11 March for a visit, what the Chinese and American officials 
have to discuss is how to enhance understanding, reduce 
friction, and strengthen bilateral cooperation on the basis on 
equality and reciprocity. It can benefit both sides if China 
and the United States, two big countries, can strengthen 
cooperation in various domains, whereas mutual hostility and a 
drain on strength is not good for either side. 
  China does not constitute any threat to the United States. 
China and the United States and the peoples in the two 
countries have traditional friendship, and even during the Cold 
War period, they could be friends. Why cannot they get along 
well after the Cold War? If the United States cancels China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status because of the human 
rights issue, it will strip away the good feeling toward the 
United States among the Chinese people and the People's 
Liberation Army [PLA], China's policy toward the United States 
might become conservative and hard-line, and China might even 
adopt an uncooperative attitude toward some important 
international issues which concern the United States. A 
hard-line, conservative, and uncooperative China is obviously 
not in the strategic interest of the United States. 
<H5>  Strengthen Contact for Mutual Understanding </H5>
  What is worth mentioning is that although China and the 
United States have gone round and round in the strange circle of 
human rights for several years, the armed forces of the two 
countries have already made a gratifying step in contact. In 
September last year, the United States adopted a new "contact 
strategy" toward China. Under the guidance of this strategy, 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Freeman visited China at the 
end of last year, resuming high-level military contacts and 
interaction with China. Recently, the president of U.S. 
National Defense University has also visited China. Military 
contacts and exchanges between China and the United States can 
help foster mutual understanding between the two armed forces, 
and help the two countries to strengthen bilateral military 
cooperation. 
  According to the press, the Clinton administration has 
reached some consensus on relations with China. The consensus 
includes: China is a country to be reckoned with in the world; 
and the Chinese military has a recognizable role to play in 
China's foreign policy formulation, and only through contacts 
can the United States influence the PLA, continue to urge China 
to develop in the positive direction, and continue to make 
China, which will be economically and militarily strong in the 
future, a friend of the United States. U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of Defense Freeman said recently that although this kind of 
"contact strategy" cannot solve the issue of human rights and 
trade between China and the United States, it can ease the tense 
situation which might arise between the two countries regarding 
security issues. 
  Secretary of State Christopher said recently that if China 
makes positive efforts in the areas of abiding by the 
International Human Rights Declaration, releasing political 
prisoners, stopping interference in the Chinese-language 
broadcast of Voice of America, then, the United States will 
consider discussing extension of China's MFN status every 
several years. Officials in the U.S. Department of Commerce and 
Treasury Department advocated a permanent settlement of the MFN 
status for China. However, the United States should understand 
and sympathize with China's concrete conditions, and should not 
just exert great pressure. So long as China and the United 
States can understand each other and make mutual concessions, 
bilateral relations will be smooth, and if both sides can step 
back half a step on the issues which cause controversy, 
relations between the two countries will have broad room for 
development. 
<H5>  Bill of the Cold War Era Should Be Scrapped </H5>
  Judged from the current situation, the practice that the 
United States extends China's MFN status every year is one which 
costs the U.S. Government and people money; it affects 
confidence and long-term planning among American businessmen and 
industrialists who want to invest in China, and lets some 
congressmen and human rights organizations pull the U.S. 
Government by the nose in the area of relations with China, 
thus, putting the government to a very passive position. Even 
if the MFN status is extended every several years, by then the 
White House might be troubled by various interest groups when 
the decision has to be made. Therefore, the best method should 
be neatly settling the issue of China's MFN status once and for 
all. 
  To extend China's MFN trade status once and for all, the 
United States should abolish the Jackson-Vanik amendment. This 
bill of the Cold War era was formulated for the Soviet Union 
which had no freedom of migration and had non-market economy 
system, and it is now outdated. China has always allowed 
freedom of migration, and China has announced it would walk 
toward market economy. Even the countries which have been 
blacklisted as terrorist countries by the United States, such as 
Syria, Libya, and Iraqi can easily enjoy MFN status, so why 
cannot China, which is opening up and is converging to the track 
of world economy, enjoy MFN status which is being enjoyed 
unconditionally by almost every country? 
<H5>  Should Grant China Permanent MFN Status </H5>
  Dr. Michael Svens, a researcher specializing in East Asian 
problems with Rand Corporation, pointed out in a recent speech 
in Washington that, he believed the Clinton administration will 
continue to extend China's MFN status this year. He said that 
if the United States cancels China's MFN status, conservative 
forces inside China will emerge. Many experts in American 
academic circles have the same viewpoint. They advocated that 
human rights and trade issues should be handled separately. If 
Sino-U.S. relations are built on the narrow basis of human 
rights, once a problem arises in the area of human rights, the 
whole Sino-U.S. relationship will be in danger. 
  Looking at problems from a macro-viewpoint, the United 
States 
must not cancel China's MFN status in the future, even more, it 
must also permanently extend China's MFN status. Only by so 
doing can China and the United States walk toward a bright and 
splendid 21st century hand in hand. Both the Chinese and U.S. 
Governments have now this hope and wish. Christopher's visit to 
China is very important in terms of whether the United States 
can do this. (10 March, Washington)

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Head-On Blow at `Human Rights' Mongers"] </F>
  [Text] At the 50th panel session of the UN Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva on the 9th of this month, representatives 
of Western countries again produced a so-called draft resolution 
on "China's human rights situation." In so doing, they 
attempted to raise provocations against and impose greater 
pressure on China by using pretexts they have cooked up. The 
Chinese representative refuted the resolution with perfect 
justice at the meeting and raised a no-action motion on the 
text. It turned out that China's motion passed the panel by a 
majority vote. This incident clearly tells us that interference 
in the internal affairs of other countries under the cover of 
human rights can find less and less public support these days. 
Chinese Premier Li Peng's remarks on the incident in his 
Government Work Report delivered at the NPC session yesterday 
were met with a thunderous applause, thus showing clearly the 
disgust of the 1.2 billion Chinese people with these human 
rights mongers. 
  It is known to all that China is the world's biggest 
developing country. China's backwardness is, to a great extent, 
the result of the protracted aggression and oppression of a 
number of major western countries, which today are engaged in 
selling "human rights." As an independent sovereign country, 
China is now concentrating its energy on economic construction 
with a view to build itself into a modernized country. The 
Chinese Government has gained the thoroughgoing understanding 
that realization of this goal requires a sound social 
environment of stability and unity. Any turbulence in China 
will not only bring disasters to the Chinese people, but will 
also produce a great adverse impact on the stability and peace 
of Asia as well as the world. Practice has proved that the 
policy of reform, development, and stability currently pursued 
by the Chinese Government is a correct and successful policy. 
However, there are always people with ulterior motives in 
foreign countries who fly in the face of the facts, deliberately 
create over and over again so-called "human rights problems," 
and seize on the subject to exaggerate matters. The "shells" 
they are using in their attacks against China are no more than 
the few violators of Chinese law. They never concerned 
themselves in the past and do not take an interest today in the 
sufferings of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people. 
It is obvious to all that their real aim in brandishing the 
club of "human rights" is to impose political pressure on China, 
obstruct China's stability and development, and force the 
Chinese people to give up the development road they have chosen 
which conforms to China's national conditions. It is natural, 
therefore, that what they are up to has been cast aside by the 
Chinese people and the Chinese Government. 
  It seems strange that all human rights mongers in today's 
world suffer from farsightedness. They can only envisage or 
imagine the problems of other countries, especially the Third 
World developing countries, yet turn a blind eye to the human 
rights situation in their own countries. As a matter of fact, 
the human rights records of their own countries are most 
inglorious. Among those who are selling "human rights," the 
most hard-working will perhaps be a handful of people with power 
and influence in the United States. Over recent years, these 
people have gone so far as to lump together the "human rights" 
issue with totally unrelated trade issues, asserting that 
"China's MFN trading status will be abolished" provided China 
fails to improve its "human rights" situation. Such an absurd 
idea has been found unacceptable even by many in the Western 
camp. At his meeting with visiting U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher the day before yesterday, Australian Foreign 
Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said in firm and clear-cut terms 
that Australia disapproves the current practice of the United 
States to lump together human rights with the MFN issue, for the 
MFN trading status "is not an honorable privilege but a form of 
normal trading relations." 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to 
arrive in Beijing today for a visit, and he is the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to visit China since President 
Bill Clinton took office. That China receives him during the NPC 
and CPPCC sessions has clearly underscored the fact that China 
attaches great importance to its relations with the United 
States. The Chinese Government believes that establishing and 
promoting friendly relations between the two countries not only 
tallies with the interests of both, but is also beneficial to 
maintaining peace in the Asian-Pacific region and the world. 
China's policy toward the United States encompasses augmenting 
mutual trust, reducing troubles, stepping up cooperation, and 
refraining from coming into confrontation. During Christopher's 
visit in the country, China is willing to exchange views with 
him on bilateral relations and wide-ranging international 
affairs on an equal footing with a view to further mutual 
understanding. Yet, if someone takes China's forbearance for 
frailty and vulnerability to attack, makes indiscreet criticisms 
with insufferable arrogance, and even threatens to cancel 
China's MFN trading status, then he is sure to meet with a 
rebuff in China.

  [Text] Washington, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton 
administration will introduce the Workforce Security Act this 
week, providing 13 billion U.S. dollars to help the training of 
the unemployed, White House officials said today. 
  "We are on a trajectory of better and better employment 
figures, but they are still not as good as we hope," Labor 
Secretary Robert Reich said today, saying that the new 
legislation will change the entire employment system. 
  Observers said the Workforce Security Act, which features 
the 
establishment of one-stop job searching centers across the 
nation, was the third piece of legislation of the White House in 
improving the nation's job picture. 
  Last year, Congress passed the administration's voluntary 
national standards for elementary and secondary school and its 
school-to-work training and apprenticeship program. 
  In the U.S., around 25 percent of the unemployed workers do 
not have the skills for another jobs. The traditional job 
training system is called obsolete and wrongly targeted. 
  "What the Americans are discovering now, even though there 
are more jobs, they're not getting the old jobs back again," 
Secretary Reich said in a TV interview. "It's not enough simply 
to get some unemployment insurance check. You've got to get 
help in getting the new jobs."

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Ercel J. Baker, 
Canadian assistant deputy minister of fisheries, has written to 
Chinese Ambassador to Canada Zhang Yijun making clear the 
Canadian Government stand on the export of seal products to 
China. 
  Recently, an international animal rights organization 
accused 
China's Shanghai Fisheries General Corporation of violating the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (CITES) by importing 50,000 dead seals from 
Canada's Newfoundland and Labrador Province to make aphrodisiacs 
out of sex organs severed from male seals. 
  Some Western countries' newspapers gave this accusation a 
lot 
of coverage. Some congressmen of a certain country even 
proposed a bill to attack China on the issue. 
  Baker said in the letter: "I am writing to express the 
support of the Government of Canada, and to seek the support of 
your government for the joint venture between Terra Nova Fishery 
Co. Ltd. (TNF) and the Shanghai Fisheries General Corporation 
(SFGC) to produce seal products for export to China. The 
government of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador also 
strongly supports the project. 
  "We share the concern of your government regarding the 
unfounded allegations that seals will harvested for the sole 
purpose of using the male sex organs to make sexual stimulants. 
  "It has been common practice for the more extreme groups 
(campaigning against seal hunting) to make sensational 
allegations to stir up controversy and attract media attention." 
  The letter pointed out that the proposed venture is fully 
consistent with Canada's commitment to the conservation and 
rational management of marine resources based on the principle 
of sustainable development. 
  There is a long-established commercial seal hunt in Canada 
which is closely regulated, the letter said. 
  Canada encourages full use of harvested seals and would 
oppose any project to kill seals only for a small part of the 
animal, the letter went on. 
  The joint venture involves the harvesting and use of the 
whole seal, the letter noted. It conforms to the licensing 
requirements and regulations of the Governments of Canada and 
the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Equally, it is fully 
in accord with international conservation requirements. 
  Baker emphasized that the harp seal is not regulated by the 
convention because it is not endangered or threatened, and 
therefore no CITES permit would be required for export of harp 
seal products from Canada. 
  At the end of the letter, Baker said he hoped that the 
Chinese Government would consider this project favorably and 
approve the joint venture.

country could learn a lot from China. 
  Muzenda made his remarks in a meeting with Chinese 
Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Tian Zengpei, who arrived in 
Harare yesterday for a two-day working visit to Zimbabwe, the 
last leg of his tour of southern Africa. The Chinese 
vice-minister has already visited South Africa, Namibia and 
Mozambique. 
  "Zimbabwe got support from China in its fighting for 
independence and freedom and now China also made a lot of 
efforts for Zimbabwe's developments after independence," said 
Muzenda. 
  Tian Zengpei told Muzenda that China was impressed with the 
way Zimbabwe had tackled its economic problems and its role in 
peace-keeping missions. 
  Tian later held talks with his counterpart Nathan 
Shamuyarira. They discussed international issues, especially 
southern African situation and bilateral problems. Both sides 
expressed their satisfaction at the present friendly relations 
between the two countries and hope to find new areas and ways of 
cooperation in promoting the two countries' relations.

  [Text] Abidjan, 4 Mar (XINHUA) -- Today Ivorian President 
Henri Konan Bedie hailed Ivorian-Chinese relations as 
"developing with remarkable results." 
  Bedie made the above statement when accepting credentials 
from new Chinese Ambassador to Ivory Coast Liu Lide [0491 4539 
1795]. 
  Bedie said: "When reviewing the past decade since Ivory 
Coast and China established diplomatic relations, we can only 
feel happy and cannot ignore the fact that diplomatic relations 
between the two countries have been developing remarkably." 
President Yang Shangkun's visit to Ivory Coast in July 1992 has 
broadened bilateral exchanges. Because of these contacts and 
the thorough understanding of each other's wishes and interests, 
the Ivorian and Chinese Governments have signed agreements to 
broaden cooperation in various fields. 
  Bedie also highly commended Chinese-aided projects in Ivory 
Coast. He expressed the hope that Ivory Coast and China will 
"expand and consolidate bilateral cooperation." When commenting 
on Ivorian-Chinese trade issues, he said he hoped that Ivory 
Coast and China will strengthen trade relations and gradually 
attain a balanced foreign trade account between the two 
countries.

  [Text] United Nations, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- The UN Security 
Council adopted a resolution today to empower UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to set up a UN Mozambique Action 
(UNMA) special police detachment, with the number of the members 
of the detachment limited to 1,144. 
  According to Butrus-Ghali's suggestion, this special police 
detachment will begin work as part of the UNMA. In 
Butrus-Ghali's opinion, there is a need for the UNMA to take 
measures to help the Mozambican police improve their ability to 
protect civilians and their property, and to supervise law 
enforcement by the Mozambican police. 
  the Mozambican Government and the Mozambique National 
Resistance signed the "Mozambique comprehensive peace agreement" 
in October 1992 in Rome, Italy, and agreed to hold general 
elections this October. Regrouping and disbanding the two 
factions' troops to create conditions for holding general 
elections and the election preparatory work are under way in 
earnest. 
  Butrus-Ghali held that establishing a special police 
detachment to supervise law enforcement by the Mozambican police 
will help build voter confidence and prevent irregularities. 
  Li Zhaoxing, China's permanent representative to the United 
Nations, spoke prior to putting the resolution to a vote. He 
said that the international community, including the United 
Nations, should continue to try its best to help the Mozambican 
people realize the goal of holding the general elections as 
scheduled so as to help Mozambique return to the path of 
rebuilding its homeland and restoring its economy.

  [Text] Washington, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Talks between 
Bosnian Muslims and Croatians on a Muslim-Croat confederation 
are reaching the "final stages," Croatian Foreign Minister Mate 
Granic said here today. 
  Granic, in talks with the Bosnian Government in the fourth 
day, said the parties could be signing a preliminary agreement 
this afternoon on the confederation, which will then be linked 
to the Bosnian Serbs to form a two-republic Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  However, U.S. officials appeared less optimistic. 
  "They are still engaged in talks and we are relatively 
hopeful there might be something this afternoon," one officials 
said. 
  "They may get there and they may not," he said. 
  The plan, initiated by the United States, would require 
economic ties between the Muslim-Croat federation to the 
Croatian Republic, the reason why the Granic was here. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton and visiting British 
Prime Minister John Major said they would work together "for a 
resolution of the crisis" in the Balkan republic where ethnic 
war had raged for 22-months, killing tens of thousands of 
civilians. 
  They said a "joint civil planning mission" would be sent to 
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, to help revive the city's basic 
facilities.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic said today that his "Serb Republic of Bosnia" 
will not join a Muslim-Croat federation. 
  He told reporters that only those who do not know politics 
would think that Bosnian Serbs will accept the federation. 
  Karadzic insists on an independent Serbian country, 
established in Bosnia or an allied country, and made up of 
Bosnian Serbs and other Serbs. 
  He added that during World War II the Croat-Muslim 
federation, under the protection of Germany, killed tens of 
thousands of Serbs. 
  Karadzic said the three warring parties must make 
compromises 
to reach a final agreement and settle boundaries. 
  He stressed that 33.3 percent of the territory was enough 
for 
the Muslims, and that the Serbs would like to exchange part of 
the territory in dispute with the Croats. 
  He also said that the West, which has been biased against 
the 
Serbs, would make a mistake to push the Serbs closer to Russia, 
a traditional ally.

plan for national economic and social development in 1994 has 
set the following targets:

the primary industry, 10.7 percent for the secondary industry, 
and 11 percent or slightly higher for the tertiary industry. 
  -- Total investment in fixed assets is expected to reach 
1,300 billion yuan. That breaks down into 875 billion yuan for 
state- owned enterprises and institutions, and 425 billion yuan 
for collective enterprises and institutions and the private 
sector. 
  -- The deficit for 1994 is expected to reach 66.9 billion 
yuan. Counting the principal and interest of internal and 
external debts and external loans for key projects due to be 
paid back in 1994, total internal and external debts for this 
year will amount to 129.2 billion yuan. 
  -- Banks will grant 470 billion yuan in new loans. 
  -- Total retail sales are expected to reach 1,600 billion 
yuan in value. 
  -- Imports and exports are expected to reach 200 billion 
U.S. 
dollars in value, with 100 billion U.S. dollars for exports and 
the same amount for imports. 
  -- Inflation will be controlled under ten percent for the 
whole of 1994. 
  -- Efforts will be made to improve the economic efficiency 
of 
enterprises. That will include increasing the sales ratio of 
their products, boosting their ratio of profits and taxes to 
capital, improving their labor productivity, increasing their 
capital liquidity, and raising their fuel efficiency. 
  -- The natural population growth rate is to be controlled at 
about 1.3 percent for the year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Chen Jinhua, minister 
in charge of the State Planning Commission, delivered a report 
on the 1994 plan for national economic and social development at 
the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress (NPC) in the Great Hall of the People today. 
  In his speech, Chen set the following six tasks: Developing 
rural economy, improving operation of large- and medium-sized 
state- owned enterprises, optimizing investment structure, 
opening wider to the outside world, expanding scientific, 
technological and educational undertakings and improving the 
people's livelihood continuously. 
  He said that China will continue to strengthen the 
agricultural base, invigorate the rural economy and increase 
peasants' income, all of which "has an important bearing on the 
nation's economic development and social stability," he said. 
  The country will make every effort to obtain a good harvest 
and retain a steady, high and increasing output of such 
principal products as grain, cotton and oil bearing crops, he 
said. 
  China is planning to turn out 450 million tons of grain, 
4.85 
million tons of cotton and 17.65 million tons of oil bearing 
crops. 
  He urged localities to protect arable land, slash the 
financial burden on farmers, raise purchasing prices of grain 
and cotton, develop highly efficient farming, step up 
construction of agricultural infrastructure, boost investment in 
the sector, accelerate application of scientific and 
technological advances to agriculture, expand township 
enterprises and help the poverty- stricken rural areas. 
  "Irrational economic structure and poor efficiency are 
currently the prominent problems of the economic development of 
China," he said. 
  He urged industries to focus on optimizing the structure and 
improving performance and to maintain an effective growth rate 
through deepening of the reform, opening of new markets, 
strengthening of management and accelerating technological 
progress. 
  "The current volume of total investment in fixed assets is 
already large," he said. It is necessary to bring this runaway 
investment growth under strict control by focusing the work on 
optimizing investment structure and improving economic returns 
of investment. 
  He said that, of the total investment in fixed assets in 
state- owned enterprises and institutions this year, 485 billion 
yuan will go to capital construction, 250 billion yuan to 
updating of technology and 80 billion yuan to development of 
real estate. 
  In line with industrial policies, China will "increase 
investment in the construction of infrastructure, basic 
industries and key industries, use the additional state 
investment this year mainly in projects for agriculture, water 
conservancy, transport, telecommunications, energy, necessary 
raw and semi-finished materials, electronics, science and 
technology and education," he said. The government will 
increase investment in the development of natural resources in 
the central and western regions of China. 
  He also urged the country to open wider to the outside world 
and vigorously and effectively use foreign funds, resources, 
technologies and markets. 
  He said that the country should realize economic growth on 
the basis of scientific and technological progress and the 
development of education. He urged governments at all levels 
to vigorously promote advances in industrial technology, 
develop key scientific and technological projects and key 
industrial projects that are important to economic and social 
development, quicken the commercialization, industrialization 
and internationalization of China's own high and new 
technologies, strengthen the infrastructure for scientific 
research and develop a strong contingent of technical personnel. 
  He said that the government should keep education in a 
strategic position, strengthen elementary education, increase 
investment in education and improve the living conditions of 
school teachers. 
  He called for continual improvement of the living standards 
of the people on the basis of economic growth and increased 
labor productivity. 
  "To meet the need of continued reforms and maintain social 
stability, we will gradually establish a multi-form, multi-tier 
social security system," he said. 
  He pointed out that promoting all-round progress in social 
undertakings is an important task of macro-controls by the 
state. This year, the government will formulate an outline 
program for a nationwide development of social undertakings to 
guide work in this regard, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- It is necessary to 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic controls if China is to 
fulfill its reform and development goals in 1994. A senior 
government official said today. 
  Addressing the ongoing session of the National People's 
Congress, Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning 
Commission, said that the main task of macro-controls is to 
maintain an overall balance of supply and demand. 
  "To fulfill this task, we must use all means to increase 
effective supply and prevent overall social demand from rising 
too rapidly," he told the NPC deputies. 
  "First, we will exercise strict control over investment in 
fixed assets," he said. 
  Banks must strictly abide by state plans on loans for fixed 
assets investment and should refuse to finance any new projects 
not approved by the State Council or the State Planning 
Commission, or any projects outside state plans. 
  "Second, we will rationally control the growth of consumer 
demand," he said. 
  Third, it is necessary to continue to keep money supply and 
credit under control, and tighten budgetary restraint, he said. 
  Chen Jinhua stressed that macro-controls should focus on 
controlling the margin of overall price rises. 
  "There will be intense pressure with regard to price hikes 
this year, " he said. 
  "Therefore, while pushing ahead with price reform, we must 
use every possible means to keep the margin of price increases 
within the planned range as a macro-control target," he said. 
  He listed the following measures to attain that goal: 
  -- Working hard to increase effective supplies of goods and 
making every effort to promote the production and supply of 
daily necessities; 
  -- Carefully organizing the implementation of price 
adjustment measures formulated by the state; 
  -- Removing obstacles in goods circulation and marketing; 
  -- Setting up and optimizing a reserve system for grain, 
cotton, cooking oil, meat, sugar and other major farm products 
as well as risk funds for grain and non-staple foods, in order 
to effectively regulate market volumes and keep prices fairly 
stable; 
  -- Improving the market monitoring and controlling system; 
and 
  -- Strengthening market regulation and tightening 
supervision 
over prices and market order. 
  Chen Jinhua said that all departments and local authorities 
must respect the authority of the state macro-control system and 
improve the overall balance of economic activities so as to 
avoid violent economic fluctuations. 
  Moreover, it is also necessary to strengthen monitoring of 
economic trends and make forecasts and warnings more accurate, 
he said, adding, "we will deepen reform of the planning system."

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Opening wider to the 
outside world and making efficient use of foreign funds, 
resources, technology and markets will be one of the major tasks 
in the 1994 plan for national economic and social development, a 
senior government official said today. 
  The tasks were spelled out by Chen Jinhua, minister in 
charge 
of the State Planning Commission, in a report he delivered to 
the annual session of the National People's Congress [NPC] on 
the implementation of the 1993 plan for national economic and 
social development and on a similar draft plan for 1994. 
  In his report, Chen stressed the need to make full use of 
the 
favorable international climate to further expand foreign trade 
and economic and technological exchanges. 
  In the area of foreign trade, he said, "through the 
restructuring of the foreign trade and foreign exchange systems, 
we shall promote an increase in exports and allow a reasonable 
flow of imports to achieve a balance between foreign exchange 
revenues and expenditures for the year." 
  Chen Jinhua spelled out the following policies to attain 
that 
goal: 
  -- As China's export strategy, it is necessary to 
unswervingly increase the number and types of markets, succeed 
by putting quality first, and open up new markets while 
maintaining and developing existing ones; 
  -- It is necessary to continue to improve the mix of export 
products, accelerate a switch from exporting semi-processed 
goods to intensive-processed goods and promote the export of 
high- and new- tech products; 
  -- It is necessary to integrate technology, production and 
trade, and vigorously expand the export of mechanical and 
electrical products and complete sets of equipment that are 
competitive on the international market, rely heavily on modern 
technology, and have a high added value and good export 
potential; 
  -- It is imperative to speed up the establishment of a 
quality certification system; 
  -- It is necessary to encourage and support stronger large 
and medium-sized enterprises with good credit to move into 
foreign markets with quality products and good after-sale 
services; 
  -- It is imperative to develop integrated trade companies in 
the form of enterprise groups for different industries to engage 
in international trade; 
  -- It is necessary to strictly implement the system of 
making 
settlements and sales in foreign exchange for exports, raise the 
settlement rate for exports and improve the system of tax 
refunds on exports; and 
  -- It is imperative to strengthen control over imports and 
optimize the import mix. 
  Chen Jinhua said, "we shall continue to severely crack down 
on smuggling. We shall exercise strict control over the outflow 
of foreign currency in investment and capital accounts outside 
the country and tighten supervision over enterprises located 
abroad." 
  He pledged to continue expanding international tourism and 
increasing foreign exchange revenues from non-trade sources. 
  He said that it is necessary to diligently check trade and 
non- trade collection and payment of foreign exchange and 
strengthen supervision over and examination of the collection 
and payment of foreign currency to prevent leaks resulting from 
arbitrage and evasion of state control over foreign currency and 
from capital drain. 
  "We shall continue to operate in an efficient way special 
economic zones, the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, open coastal 
cities and economic and technological development zones, and 
open up more central cities in border regions, along the Chang 
Jiang river and in the interior," he told the NPC deputies. 
  Speaking of the utilization of foreign funds, he said that 
it 
is necessary to further better the investment climate in China, 
expand the scope of projects using foreign funds, improve the 
performance and quality of projects using foreign funds, and 
make efficient use of foreign funds. 
  He outlined a series of policies concerning the use of 
foreign funds: 
  -- It is necessary to absorb more direct foreign investment 
in line with the country's capacity to provide supplementary 
funding and increase the proportion of foreign investment 
committed to projects; 
  -- It is imperative to guide the orientation of foreign 
investment in accordance with the state's industrial policies, 
directing more foreign investment towards infrastructure and 
basic industries, key projects and technology upgrading in 
existing enterprises, in particular towards projects that make 
foreign- exchange-earning products; 
  -- It is necessary to support the central and western parts 
of the country to use foreign capital to develop local resources; 
  -- Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative enterprises 
should strictly abide by the principle of sharing both benefit 
and risk, and work to achieve a balance of payments in foreign 
exchange; 
  -- State-owned enterprises must evaluate their assets before 
they sell stock rights or use existing assets to establish joint 
ventures or cooperative enterprises with foreign businesses so 
as to prevent the loss of state assets; and 
  -- It is imperative to strictly control the use of 
international commercial loans, continuing to keep it under 
mandatory planning control. 
  With regard to foreign debt, Chen Jinhua stressed the 
importance of encouraging and supporting localities, 
departments, and enterprises with heavy foreign debts to 
establish a system of debt repayment financing to ensure that 
foreign debts be repaid on schedule.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- China has drafted this 
year's state budget according to the principle of tightening 
control over expenditures so as to maintain a basic balance 
between total supply and total demand and alleviate inflationary 
pressure. 
  This remark was made today by Minister of Finance Liu 
Zhongli 
when he submitted his report on the implementation of the state 
budget for 1993 and on the draft state budget for 1994 to the 
ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]. 
  When analyzing the state financial situation, Liu said, 
market demand will remain huge this year. While continued 
reforms and economic development have created favorable 
conditions for state finances, two years of high economic growth 
have resulted in serious "bottlenecks," inflationary pressures, 
and an acute shortage of funds, he said. 
  Under these circumstances, he said, China will continue to 
strengthen and improve macro-controls, strive to improve the 
economic performance of enterprises and make revenue increases 
commensurate with economic development. 
  In expenditures, the country will act according to its 
capacity, ensure investment in key state projects and exercise 
strict control over investment in general fixed assets and 
expenditures for consumption. 
  The finance minister said, in the implementation of the 
state 
budget for 1993, both revenues and expenditures exceeded 
budgeted figures by a big margin. While revenue and 
expenditures in local finances increased considerably in 1993, 
those in the central finances failed to reach budgeted figures. 
Moreover, although revenues in local finances increased 
substantially, turnover tax revenues in central finances were 
much less than the budgeted figure, thereby aggravating the 
difficulties of central finances. 
  Total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan 
and 
total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan, 
resulting in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan. The deficit was 
not in excess of the budgeted figure. Local budgets were 
balanced. 
  The Ministry of Finance has adopted a different method for 
calculating the deficit starting this year. Income from debts 
will no longer be included in total revenues, and debt service 
will no longer be included in total expenditures. Domestic and 
foreign debts due for repayment will be serviced by issuing 
treasury bonds. Such an adjustment only changes the way of 
calculating the debt and will not affect the actual size of the 
deficit. 
  The budget for 1994 shows that state revenue totals 475.995 
billion yuan and expenditures amount to 542.914 billion yuan, 
representing 7.7 percent and 15 percent increases over the 1993 
figures respectively. This leaves a deficit of 66.919 billion 
yuan, which reflects the real deficit. 
  If the deficit is added with 48.081 billion yuan for 
servicing domestic and foreign debts and 14.245 billion yuan of 
foreign loans to be invested in key state construction projects 
this year, total debts for 1994 will come to 129.245 billion 
yuan. 
  Liu explained that though China has appropriately reduced 
investment in fixed assets, the high expenditures base for 1993 
made it necessary to increase essential expenditures on 
agriculture, education, science and technology and other key 
areas. Total expenditures are also affected by wage increases 
for employees of administrative departments and public 
institutions, increased subsidies following the introduction of 
a single exchange rate system and other policy related factors. 
These factors altogether contributed more than 50 billion yuan 
to total expenditures. In addition, because of price rises, 
army wage reform and higher living expenses, this year's 
national defence expenditures have been appropriately increased. 
  Liu noted that since the reform of finance and the taxation 
system were put into force at the beginning of this year, the 
experience of the past two months and more has shown that the 
reform plan is correct, that it has been implemented smoothly by 
and large and that no major problems have arisen. However, we 
must remain sober-minded and be on our guard. The key to the 
success of this reform lies in achieving a consensus of views 
and in concerted action. Any problems can be reported to the 
higher authorities. Financial and taxation departments at all 
levels must take the interests of the whole into consideration, 
and they should not go their own way, overstep their authority, 
formulate their own rules and regulations, distort the reform 
plan or lead the reform astray in implementation.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Following are figures 
and facts contained in the report on the implementation of the 
state budget for 1993 and on the draft state budget for 1994 
delivered by Finance Minister Liu Zhongli today to the current 
session of the National People's Congress [NPC]. 
  -- In the draft state budget for 1994, revenues in the 
central budget total 332.91 billion yuan, an increase of 3.8 
percent over the 1993 figure; and total revenues in the local 
budgets that are prepared by the central government are 417.479 
billion yuan, an increase of 6.8 percent over the 1993 figure.

129.245 
billion yuan, an increase of 39.361 billion yuan over the 1993 
figure. 
  -- Expenses for productive capital construction totaled 
73.187 billion yuan in 1993; and this year the expenses are 
planned for 60 billion yuan. 
  -- Non-productive capital construction expenditures were 
19.519 billion yuan in 1993; and this year the expenditures are 
planned for 19.486 billion yuan. 
  -- Expenses for building the state power amounted to 102.406 
billion yuan in 1993, including administrative expenses of 
54.033 billion yuan and 43.248 billion yuan for national 
defense; and this year the expenses for building the state power 
are planned for 119.199 billion yuan, including administrative 
expenses of 61.359 billion yuan and 52.04 billion yuan for 
national defense. 
  -- Subsidies to make up for losses in productive enterprises 
totaled 20.727 billion yuan and subsidies to compensate for

rates are greater than the growth in revenue. 
  -- Starting this year, covering the deficit will depend 
entirely on debts without borrowing bank loans. 
  -- On January 1, 1994, China began to institute a 
revenue-sharing system based on a rational division of 
responsibilities and rights between the central and local 
authorities. 
  -- This year the country will improve the grain reserve 
network, establishing a natural disaster relief fund at the two 
levels of the central and local governments, appropriately 
raising the purchasing prices of grain and cotton when the new

changes. 
  -- The management of tax collection will be improved and no 
taxes may be contracted, and no tax rates may be arbitrarily 
altered. Governments at all levels and every government 
department may reduce or exempt taxes only in cases as 
stipulated in the tax laws.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- Finance Minister Liu 
Zhongli submitted his "Report on the Implementation of the State 
Budget for 1993 and on the Draft State Budget for 1994" to the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] 
today. His report said that, generally speaking, the 1993 state 
budget was well implemented. 
  Liu Zhongli said in the report: Total state revenues in 1993 
came to 511.482 billion yuan (including the income of 69.384 
billion yuan from domestic and foreign debts), up 23.2 percent 
over the previous year and fulfilling 113.1 percent of the 
budget. Total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion 
yuan (including the spending of 33.735 billion yuan in payment 
of principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts), up 
21.2 percent over the 1992 figure and fulfilling 112.5 percent 
of the 1993 budget. This resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion 
yuan, which was not in excess of the budgeted figure. While 
this central deficit of 20.5 billion yuan was within the budget 
limit, the revenues and expenditures in local budgets were 
balanced. 
  According to Liu Zhongli's analysis, the over fulfillment of 
revenues by a big margin was mainly due to three factors: 
First, the national economy's sustained, rapid growth caused an 
increase in revenues. Second, improved macroeconomic regulation 
and control measures yielded positive results and remarkably 
reduced revenue losses. Third, the central authorities decided 
to implement in 1994 the tax assignment system, under which the 
central government will reimburse local governments a certain 
amount of tax revenues based on their 1993 figures. The new 
system aroused the local governments' enthusiasm for revenue 
collection, and they took a number of measures to strictly 
collect taxes, manage revenues, and prevent tax evasion. As a 
result, revenues increased by a big margin in the fourth quarter. 
  Liu Zhongli said: Expenditures far exceeded the budgeted 
figures. It was mainly because of the principle of balance 
between revenues and expenditures. Under the principle, local 
governments, after delivering to the state the contracted amount 
of revenues, are permitted to spend more if they collect more. 
So, the large increase in local revenues led to a corresponding 
increase in local expenditures. The increased local 
expenditures show that most were reasonable increases, necessary 
to meeting the needs of reform, construction, and other 
undertakings. However, we should also see that the problems of 
starting unauthorized projects and wasting administrative and 
operating funds remained quite serious. A small number of 
localities even recorded false spending. These problems were 
also an important cause for the expenditures exceeding budgeted 
figures.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- While delivering the 
"Report on the Implementation of the State Budget for 1993 and 
the Draft State Budget for 1994" today at the Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress, Finance Minister Liu 
Zhongli stressed the need to control total expenditures and to 
ensure key expenditures. 
  Liu Zhongli said: To basically maintain a balance between 
total social supply and demand and to alleviate inflationary 
pressure, we should still adhere to the principle of tightening 
control over expenditures in preparing this year's state budget. 
In preparing financial expenditures, we must consider our 
financial capability, ensure funds for key projects, and tighten 
control over investment in general projects. He stressed: This 
year, in addition to continuing to increase investments in 
agriculture, education, science and technology, infrastructural 
facilities, and other key areas, and in addition to ensuring a 
necessary increase in funds for national defense and judicial 
and public security departments, we should give priority to 
ensuring expenditures for wages and the state's grain storage 
expenses. By no means should we allow using workers' living 
expenses to launch new projects. 
  Liu Zhongli said: Localities who are still holding out 
workers' wages should decidedly stop or postpone the 
construction of projects using funds for other purposes; units 
that are still holding out workers' wages are not allowed to buy 
sedans or other high-grade consumer products. He stressed that 
finance departments at all levels must place great importance on 
this issue. 
  Liu Zhongli also called for strictly controlling the scale 
of 
fixed asset investment. He said: Except for those projects 
that have been approved and of which construction has to be 
carried out, no new projects should be launched. The 
construction of projects for which funds are not secured and of 
which the economic efficiency is not definite should be 
decidedly stopped or postponed. 
  Liu Zhongli pointed out in his report: Currently, wasting 
funds is a quite serious problem. Many units demand high 
standards for interior decoration and new equipment; the 
practice of sightseeing in the name of attending meetings and 
using public funds for dining and wining continues despite 
repeated banning. In particular, many units lack effective 
control over their organizational size; as a result, their 
personnel expenses take up a large portion of their development 
funds. Therefore, this year, we should focus on reducing 
personnel, automobile, and meeting expenses; forcefully promote 
the good tradition of working hard and living a frugal life; and 
urge the vast numbers of cadres and the masses to combat waste 
and excessive spending. At the same time, as the price reform 
deepens, we will gradually reduce financial subsidies -- the 
total subsidy amount must not exceed the budgeted amount. We 
should deepen the reform of institutions' financial management 
and should continue to encourage and support them in increasing 
income within the bounds of established policies and laws and in 
implementing the comprehensive revenue-expenditure planned 
management involving all revenues and expenditures. We should 
resolutely and thoroughly implement the policy of separating 
revenues from expenditures. Income from leasing lands and 
selling public houses should be included in the revenues under 
budgeted management so that unified budget management can be 
exercised.

  [Text] Beijing, Mar 11 (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] held its second 
meeting here at the Great Hall of the People this morning and 
heard the report on the implementation of the 1993 national 
economic and social development plan and the draft plan for 1994 
delivered by Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State 
Planning Commission; and the report on the implementation of the 
1993 state budget and the draft state budget for 1994 delivered 
by Finance Minister Liu Zhongli. 
  In the report delivered at the request of the State Council, 
Chen Jinhua said: Generally speaking, the 1993 plan for 
national economic and social development was successfully 
implemented. China's social production continued to increase 
rapidly; its key projects construction and technological 
transformation strengthened; its foreign trade and economic and 
technological exchanges expanded further; business in its 
domestic markets was brisk; its science and technology, 
education, and other social undertakings developed vigorously; 
and the livelihood of its urban and rural people continued to 
improve. 
  He said: In 1993, we scored major successes in the national 
economy. At the same time, there were still prominent 
contradictions and problems in our economic life. These 
problems, which occurred in the midst of progress, aroused the 
serious concern of governments at all levels. Vigorous measures 
have been taken or are being taken to resolve them. 
  Chen Jinhua put forward six major tasks for this year's 
national economic and social development: 1) persistently 
attaching prime importance to agriculture and developing the 
rural economy in an all-around way; 2) running well large and 
medium state-owned enterprises by vigorously readjusting their 
structures, improving their management and operations, and 
raising efficiency; 3) maintaining a reasonable amount of 
investment in fixed assets and optimizing the investment 
structure; 4) opening wider to the outside world and actively 
and effectively using foreign capital, resources, technologies, 
and markets; 5) earnestly shifting economic construction onto 
the path that relies on scientific and technological progress, 
and further developing educational undertakings; and 6) 
improving the people's livelihood continuously and developing 
various social undertakings. 
  Chen Jinhua stressed the need to strengthen and improve 
macroeconomic regulation and control to fulfill the 1994 
national economic and social development plan in an all-around 
way. For this purpose, the report points out: The basic point 
of departure in carrying out macroeconomic regulation and 
control is to maintain balance and unity between reform, 
development, and stability. The main task of macroeconomic 
regulation and control is to maintain a rough balance between 
the total demand and total supply in society. We must exert 
efforts to control the size of the increase in the general level 
of commodity prices. The macroeconomic regulation and control 
system needs to be continuously improved in the course of 
in-depth reform. 
  In the report delivered at the request of the State Council, 
Liu Zhongli said: Total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 
billion yuan (including income of 69.384 billion yuan received 
from domestic and foreign debts), covering 113.1 percent of the 
budget and up 23.2 percent compared to the previous year. Total 
state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan (including 
33.735 billion yuan spent to pay for the principle and interest 
of domestic and foreign debts), equalling 112.5 percent of the 
budget and up 21.2 percent over the 1992 figure. This resulted 
in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not in excess of 
the budgeted figure. 
  Liu Zhongli said: In accordance with the provisions of the 
original contract financial responsibility system, localities, 
based on the principle of achieving a balance between revenues 
and expenditures, were allowed to spend more from increased 
revenues after fulfilling the contracted task under the system. 
As a result, the large increase in local revenues brought about 
a corresponding increase in expenditures. This was the primary 
reason why total state spending considerably exceeded the 
budgeted figure. 
  Liu Zhongli pointed out: Overall, the 1993 state budget 
was well implemented. Under the unified leadership of party 
committees and governments, fiscal and taxation departments at 
all levels have done much work to ensure the continuous 
deepening of reform as well as a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. He then said: We are now 
in an important period in which the economic structure is being 
transformed and the economy is developing rapidly. Not only is 
the contradiction between the supply of funds and the demand for 
funds very sharp, but management in various sectors urgently 
needs to be improved. To solve these problems once and for all, 
we will comprehensively reform the fiscal and taxation systems 
this year according to the decisions and unified arrangements of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council. We will 
seize this opportunity to further improve fiscal and taxation 
management and gradually establish fiscal and taxation operating 
mechanisms, meeting the requirements of the socialist market 
economy so that fiscal and taxation management will be 
standardized and legally institutionalized, and so the country's 
financial situation will be improved as soon as possible. 
  Liu Zhongli stated: This year's state budget is again 
drafted according to the principle of tightening control over 
expenditures so as to maintain a basic balance between total 
supply and total demand, and to alleviate inflationary 
pressures. The guiding ideology is to implement in an all-round 
manner the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third 
plenary session of the party's 14th Central Committee; to ensure 
the smooth progress of reform of the fiscal and taxation systems 
as well as other major economic reforms; to continue to 
strengthen and improve marcroeconomic regulation and control; to 
actively develop financial sources, pay attention to improving 
enterprise efficiency, and make the growth of financial revenue 
commensurate with economic development; to persistently act 
according to our capacity; to readjust the expenditure 
structure; to appropriately increase investment in agriculture, 
education, science and technology, infrastructure, and other 
major projects; to maintain a necessary increase in expenditures 
for national defense, judicial, procuratorial, and public 
security departments; to strictly control investment in general 
fixed assets and expenditures for consumption; and to promote a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy as well as all-round social progress. 
  Liu Zhongli added: According to the general plans of the 
party Central Committee and the State Council, this year we have 
conducted a major reform of the fiscal and taxation systems and 
the system of profit distribution in state-owned enterprises. 
After reforming the fiscal and taxation systems, the size [kou 
jing 0656 1777] of the budget has somewhat changed. According 
to the guiding ideology for drafting the budget and its changed 
size, we have made initial arrangements for the 1994 budget: 
state revenues total 475.995 billion yuan (exclusive of income 
from domestic and foreign debts), up 7.7 percent over last year 
in terms of comparable items; expenditures amount to 542.914 
billion yuan (exclusive of repayments for principal and interest 
of domestic and foreign debts), an increase of 15 percent over 
last year in terms of comparable items. This leaves a deficit of 
66.919 billion yuan. 
  Liu Zhongli called on fiscal and taxation departments at all 
levels to seize this opportune time, seek truth from facts, 
change their work style, and work hard to ensure the success of 
reform of the fiscal and taxation systems and implementation of 
the budget. To this end, he pointed out: It is necessary to do 
solid work to ensure the desired results will be achieved in the 
reform of the fiscal and taxation systems. Efforts should be 
made to improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and 
control and to promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the economy. We should seize this opportune time 
to reform the fiscal and taxation systems as well as to improve 
and strengthen the levying and management of taxes. We should 
improve the method of issuing treasury bonds to make it a 
success. We should keep the total amount of expenditures under 
control and make certain there are funds for key projects. 
  At the invitation of the NPC Standing Committee, members of 
a 
Finnish Parliament delegation led by its speaker Riitta 
Uosukainen, which was on a goodwill visit to China, attended 
today's meeting as observers. 
  The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Wang 
Bingqian, Sun Qimeng, Wang Guangying, Tomur Dawamat, Wu Jieping, 
Ma Wanqi, Wang Chaowen, Mao Zhiyong, Bai Qingcai, Liu Fusheng, 
Ruan Chongwu, Li Zemin, He Zhukang, Liu Suinian, Huanjue Cenam, 
Jia Zhijie, Yan Haiwang, Cheng Weigao, and Pu Chaozhu. Wang 
Bingqian presided over today's meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- The ongoing Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) held its 
second meeting here today, hearing reports on the country's 
economic and social development as well as the state budget. 
  At the meeting presided over by Wang Bingqian, an executive 
chairman of the session Presidium, Chen Jinhua, minister in 
charge of the State Planning Commission, delivered a report on 
the implementation of the 1993 plan for national economic and 
social development and a similar draft plant for 1994. Liu 
Zhongli, minister of finance, made a report on the 
implementation of the 1993 state budget and a draft state budget 
for 1994. 
  Chen Jinhua said in 1993 China's social production continued 
to increase rapidly, with its gross domestic product (GDP) 
reaching 3,138 billion yuan, up 13.4 percent over the previous 
year. Investment in fixed assets nationwide reached 1,182.9 
billion yuan, up 50.6 percent over the previous year, or 22 
percent with inflation taken into account. 
  Chen listed major macro-control targets for the 1994 
national 
economic and social development plan, which, he said, has taken 
into consideration both requirements for a sustained, rapid and 
healthy economic development and the necessity to create a 
relaxed environment for implementing various major reforms to be 
carried out this year. 
  Liu Zhongli told more than 2,800 deputies that total state 
revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan, up 23.2 percent 
over the previous year, while total state expenditures amounted 
to 531.982 billion yuan, up 21.2 percent over the 1992 figure. 
This resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not 
in excess of the budgeted figure. 
  While revenues and expenditures in local finances increased 
considerably in 1993, those in central finances failed to reach 
budgeted figures. Moreover, although revenues in local finances 
increased substantially, turnover tax revenues in central 
finances were much less than the budgeted figure, thereby 
aggravating the difficulties of central finances, Liu said. 
  Therefore, he added, this year's state budget has again been 
drafted according to the principle of tightening control over 
expenditures, with a view to maintaining a basic balance between 
total supply and total demand and alleviating inflationary 
pressures. 
  Under the circumstances, the guiding ideology for drafting 
the 1994 state budget has been to continue to strengthen and 
improve macro controls, work hard to open up new revenue 
sources, improve the economic performance of enterprises and 
make revenue increases commensurate with economic development, 
the minister noted.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Zhao Wei (6392 5898) and Zhang Sutang </F>
(1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] officially opened in 
Beijing on 10 March. Observant people have noticed that this 
year's NPC session had been moved up five days from last year's. 
  The opening date of the annual NPC session has been moved up 
for several years in a row. According to Zhou Chengkui, 
spokesman for the NPC Standing Committee's General Office, this 
reflects the continuous improvement of the people's congress 
system. 
  During an interview, Zhou Chengkui said: The first session 
of the eighth NPC was held seven days earlier than the seventh 
NPC, and the opening date of the current session was advanced 
five days from that of last year. If possible, the opening date 
may be moved up progressively in the future. 
  It is understood our country's fiscal year coincides with 
the 
calendar year, commencing on 1 January and ending on 31 
December. According to our country's legally prescribed 
procedures, the government implements the state's annual budget 
only after the NPC has examined and approved it. In the past, 
if the NPC session was held in March or April, it would be 
considered early. Under such circumstances, budget plans were 
implemented long before they were approved. 
  Zhou Chengkui stated: To redress this situation, the NPC 
Standing Committee decided to move up the NPC session 
progressively, following a period of deliberations and 
preparations and against the backdrop of the country's gradual 
standardization and modernization of its statistical work and 
other endeavors. The decision was aimed at achieving an ideal 
date for the session--holding the NPC session in January of each 
year. He explained: We have to go through a certain process 
before attaining this goal. One of the reasons is that it is 
still quite difficult, due to technical and other reasons, to 
complete the compilation of statistics on the previous year's 
national economic performance by January of each year. 
  Chengkui added: This problem will be solved in a 
step-by-step manner after the market economic system has been 
established, and as the method of compiling statistics becomes 
increasingly modern. Also, our country's statistical work will 
become more perfect if the opening date of the NPC session is 
gradually moved up. 
  These correspondents were advised of the growing 
institutionalization, standardization, and codification of the 
NPC system in recent years. This point is corroborated by the 
formulation and implementation of the rules of procedure for the 
NPC Standing Committee and for the NPC, by the annual briefings 
given by relevant State Council departments to the NPC Standing 
Committee on issues of public concern, and by supervisory 
efforts in the wake of the implementation of various laws. 
Constantly moving up the NPC session also symbolizes the 
improvement and refinement of this system.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Public figures from 
Hong Kong said here today that they support the Chinese 
Government's stand on Hong Kong issue and will make their best 
to cooperate with the mainland to ensure a smooth transfer of 
power in Hong Kong. 
  Hong Kong deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC) and members of the Eighth National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (NPC) [as 
received] expressed their stand while attending the current NPC 
session and the second session of the CPPCC National Committee. 
  Delivering a government work report this morning, Premier Li 
Peng expressed the hope that the Preliminary Working Committee 
for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region will unite with the largest possible 
number of Hong Kong compatriots in preparing for the 
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
its first government and its legislature. 
  Tsang Hin Chi, Liu Yiu Chu, Tsang Yok Sing and Tsui Sze Man, 
members of the Preliminary Working Committee, said that the 
committee will live up to the expectation of the whole nation 
and make every effort to lay down a sound foundation for a 
smooth transition. 
  Tsang Hin Chi, vice-chairman of the Chinese Chamber of 
Commerce in Hong Kong and chairman of the Goldlion (Far East) 
Co., Ltd., said the British Government has adopted an 
uncooperative attitude on the issue of the political structure 
in Hong Kong when the British colonial rule will come to an end 
in Hong Kong soon. In such a case, it accords with the will of 
the people to accelerate work pace of the Preliminary Working 
Committee, which is confronted with an arduous task and great 
responsibility. 
  Solicitor Liu Yiu Chu said the Preliminary Working Committee 
is confident in its work no matter what happens. 
  They said Premier Li Peng's remark on Hong Kong issue in his 
report shows China's determination and ability to resume the 
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
  Tsang Yok Sing, member of the CPPCC National Committee and 
chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong 
Kong, said that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten tabled to the 
Legislative Council the remaining parts of his political reform 
bill on March 9. This is a another serious and uncooperative 
step that the British Hong Kong authorities have taken to insist 
on their stand of violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration, 
the convergence with the basic law and agreements and 
understandings reached between China and Britain. 
  He said that the Preliminary Working Committee is proceeding 
in a planned way. Whatever attitude and step the British side 
and British Hong Kong authorities will adopt will have no impact 
on the work of the Preliminary Working Committee which started 
its work under the non-cooperation of the British side from the 
very beginning. 
  Tsui Sze Man, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC 
National Committee, exposed British Hong Kong authorities' 
hypocrisy in spreading "accelerating democracy." The 
Preliminary Working Committee will listen to opinions of Hong 
Kong people, unite with all the forces that can be united with 
and make contributions to the smooth transition and maintaining 
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by staff news team: "Latest Amendment to </F>
Li Peng's Report"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- Premier Li Peng's 
government work report has been prepared since the end of last 
year. The original draft was amended several times. By 
extensively soliciting views from all quarters, it became a 
draft that reflects all their views. A few days ago, the report 
was issued to members of the National People's Congress [NPC] 
and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who 
would be attending the sessions. It should be noted that there 
were four new additions to the work report when when Li Peng 
read it today. 
  First, there were the contents on helping the poor, which 
read: "Conscientiously carry out the poverty assistance plan. 
The plan is intended to help poverty-stricken areas -- 
especially former liberated areas, minority nationality areas, 
and border areas -- solve the problem of food and clothing for 
some 80 million people and to help them out of poverty in the 
seven years from now to the end of this century. This is the 
unshirkable duty of governments at all levels. We believe that 
this plan surely will be ardently supported by people across the 
country." This was inserted into the paragraph on agriculture 
and the rural areas in the second part of the work report and 
obviously was related to the National Poverty Assistance 
Conference, which preceded the NPC session. One can see from 
this that the central authorities have attached more importance 
to the issue. 
<H5>  Regulating the Widening Income Gap </H5>
  Pertinent to the above were the added remarks regarding 
improving the people's living standards in the second part of 
the work report, in light of the widening gap between rich and 
poor in China today. They read: "In the meantime, it is 
necessary to carry out necessary regulation of the excessively 
widening income gap through a policy of rational distribution 
and the regulatory role of tax revenue." 
  Exactly 100 characters were added to the paragraph on the 
Hong Kong issue in today's work report, namely: "In keeping 
with the Basic Law and the decisions of the NPC standing 
committees, the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region [SAR] has begun its work. Its tasks are formidable and 
its responsibilities are great. I hope the PWC will unite Hong 
Kong compatriots to the greatest possible extent and will make 
all good preparations for setting up the Hong Kong SAR and its 
first government and legislature in such a way that it will live 
up to the expectations and earnest trust of people across the 
country." 
  The emphasis of the remarks naturally stresses the work of 
the PWC and surely will draw the exceedingly great attention of 
the Hong Kong community and media. Here one can see the Chinese 
Government's firm position on the British uncooperativeness and 
confrontation. 
<H5>  On the Human Rights Issue </H5>
  In today's work report, the largest proportion and weight 
were added to the paragraph on human rights, in that the 
following remarks were added in the last paragraph of the 
seventh part (on diplomacy): "China attaches importance to 
human rights and is willing to participate in discussions on the 
human rights issue with the international community on the basis 
of mutual equality. However, it never allows anyone to interfere 
with China's internal affairs on any pretext. The Chinese 
Government supports the UN Human Rights Commission in its recent 
denouncement of some countries that exert pressure on developing 
countries. 
  "Deputies, I am going to announce to every one of you a 
piece 
of information which I have just received. Last night, the UN 
Human Rights Commission once again voted against and thwarted an 
anti-Chinese resolution proposed by some countries! This fully 
demonstrates that there is no popular support for the use of the 
human rights issue against China. Here, on behalf of the 
Chinese Government and people, I express my heartfelt to the 
various countries that uphold justice and that support China!" 
  We can say this was China's good counterattack against the 
pressure and interference of the West over the human rights 
issue. It was made on just grounds and it was reasonable and 
restrained. It also demonstrates the poise of a great country.

<F P=106> [By reporters Li Shangzhi (2621 1424 1807) and He Ping (0149 </F>
1627): "To Be Pragmatic Is Important -- An Account of Listening 
to the Government Work Report as Visitors"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (XINHUA) -- Applause again sounded 
in the Great Hall of the People. 
  As the spring breeze is blowing over the vast land of China, 
Premier Li Peng, faced by the deputies to the Second Session of 
the National People's Congress [NPC], once again walked to the 
platform of the 10,000-seat auditorium to begin delivering his 
seventh government work report since his assumption of the 
premiership. 
  His report went from reviewing the domestic work last year 
to 
spelling out the basic principles for work this year; from 
maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy to accelerating the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure; from developing science and 
technology, education, and culture to strengthening the building 
of socialist democracy and the legal system; and from promoting 
the peaceful reunification of the motherland to expounding on 
China's foreign affairs work.... 
  Condensed in his 16,000-character report were the part 
reviewing the domestic work of the past year, the part on future 
prospects, the part on domestic and foreign policies, and the 
part on principles and tasks. 
  People will notice, through a comparison, that this year's 
government work report, because it concentrated on the main 
points and was concise, was the shortest government work report 
in the past 15 years. 
  A person in charge of the government work report drafting 
group explained the reason: One of the reasons for shortening 
the work report is that the national major policies and 
principles have been clearly defined. In particular, the basic 
principles for party and national work this year mapped out by 
the party Central Committee, as well as the general situation 
characterized by "seizing opportunities, deepening reform, 
opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability," provided a good foundation for the 
drafting of the work report. Therefore, the government work 
report, which was more concise than past reports, while focusing 
on the implementation of the important guidelines of the Central 
Committee, concentrated on the major tasks to be carried out by 
the State Council this year. It did not list the 1993 
achievements of each ministry and its tasks for 1994. 
  Although the work report was concise, it was rich in 
content. 
On the basis of the basic principles for party and national 
work and in the interest of the whole party and national work, 
the report, from the angle of government work, put forward a 
series of measures concerning the correct handling of the 
relationships between reform, development, and stability. 
  -- "Development is the last word." Development requires a 
rational growth rate. Neither an excessively high growth rate 
nor an excessively low growth rate can realize our projected 
targets. In his report, Premier Li Peng proposed that the gross 
domestic product will increase by 9 percent this year. At the 
same time, he stressed the "importance of raising economic 
performance." Authoritative sources commented that this is a 
positive and steady growth rate. This shows that the government 
is becoming more mature in understanding the laws governing 
economic development. 
  For today's China, whether the economy can develop 
significantly depends, in the final analysis, on the intensity, 
depth, and breadth of reform and opening up, as well as on the 
acceleration of the drive for building a socialist market 
economic system. The 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee produced a 
general blueprint and an action program for this purpose. The 
government work report, therefore, did not simply repeat this 
point but highlighted tasks in six areas in light of the demands 
outlined in the government work report, the distinctive aspects 
of this year's situation, and the reform plans, which had been 
basically introduced, on financial, taxation, banking, 
investment, and foreign trade systems. It also urged 
governments at all levels to "devote greater efforts to reform," 
to combine breakthroughs in key areas with package reform, and 
to make substantial progress in reform of the economic system. 
  Whether in reform or development, we cannot proceed without 
a 
stable and relaxed environment; otherwise, discussion of 
anything is out of the question. It is evident that the many 
reform and development measures enumerated in the report are 
sound strategies for maintaining stability because they are 
designed to control inflation and the scale of investment, to 
appropriately increase the purchase prices of grain and cotton, 
to alleviate peasants' burdens, to increase peasants' incomes by 
all means, to relieve all state-owned enterprises of their 
obligations to contribute to construction funds for key energy 
and transportation projects and to regulatory budget funds, to 
allocate special funds for reorganizing bankrupt enterprises and 
for reassigning their workers and staff members, to control 
price increases and stabilize foodstuffs prices in urban and 
rural areas, to continue to battle corruption in a deep-going 
and sustained manner, and to intensify efforts to improve public 
order in a comprehensive way. All this will serve the sole 
purpose of creating a good environment for reform and 
development. 
  Reform, development, and stability are complementary, and 
none of them is dispensable. This is the result of summing up 
and reviewing our past experience, as well as a six-character 
dictum for carrying out all of our tasks successfully. 
  As in the case of government work, the report reflected a 
practical style throughout. 
  -- In the past, any discussion of economic work invariably 
entailed an attempt to use increases in output value as an 
important criterion for evaluating performance. This year's 
report, however, replaced the phrase "output value" with the 
formulation "added value." 
  Authoritative people are of the opinion that the main 
difference between the two phrases lies in the fact that the 
phrase "added value" excludes the prices of intermediary inputs, 
such as raw and semifinished materials and energy. This helps 
avoid such deficiencies as the repetitive calculation and 
transfer of prices, overcomes the tendency to unduly stress 
output value, and places greater emphasis on efficiency in our 
country's economic development. Moreover, it reflects the end 
result of social production more truthfully. 
  --While realistically outlining our achievements, the 
report frankly pointed out shortcomings and inadequacies in our 
work and truthfully set forth contradictions and difficulties: 
The investment scale for fixed assets is overextended; 
commodity prices have increased by a relatively large margin; 
the problem of an irrational economic structure remains salient; 
some state-owned large and medium enterprises face considerable 
difficulties in production and management; public order in some 
localities is bad; the fight against social ills is not forceful 
enough; a handful of government functionaries engage in corrupt 
practices such as embezzlement, bribery, favoritism, and fraud; 
and formalism and bureaucratism exist in government 
departments...[ellipses as received] 
  Only a people's government has the courage and magnanimity 
to 
confront deficiencies and acknowledge difficulties instead of 
eschewing problems and disguising contradictions; only a 
people's government can improve its work, promote what is 
beneficial, and eliminate what is harmful with the support and 
under the supervision of the general public in order to better 
serve the people. 
  -- Compared to previous reports, this year's report placed 
greater emphasis on spiritual civilization. Past government 
work reports subsumed science and technology, education, and 
culture on the one hand, and democracy and the legal system on 
the other, either under the section dealing with economic 
construction or the section dealing with social development. 
This year's report specifically discussed issues in these two 
areas under two independent sections, thus giving greater weight 
to such issues than in the past. This shows that in keeping the 
general situation under control, government departments place a 
greater premium on the coordinated development of the economic 
base and the superstructure, paying more attention to overall 
social progress. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic concept of 
"carrying out two tasks simultaneously and attaching equal 
importance to both" is being implemented further. 
  After the drafting work began in mid-December of last year, 
the government work report submitted to the Second Session of 
the Eighth NPC for examination and approval was discussed and 
revised many times by the State Council's executive meetings and 
by meetings of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and 
its Standing Committee. Various localities and departments, as 
well as people in all circles, were canvassed extensively. 
Premier Li Peng even held five rounds of informal discussions 
to hear the views of officials in charge of various democratic 
parties; people with no party affiliation; people in scientific 
and technological, educational, and cultural circles; and some 
comrades from public security and judicial departments at the 
grass-roots level, enterprises, and institutions. The range of 
opinions canvassed was broader than before. People can see that 
the party's fine tradition of promoting democracy and drawing on 
all useful ideas is being expanded during the new period. 
  At the end of its delivery, the report was greeted with 
warm, 
prolonged applause from deputies, who represent 56 
nationalities, in a gesture of trust and support.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Leaders of Fujian, 
Qinghai and Sichuan Provinces expressed full support for various 
policies spelled out in the government work report delivered by 
Premier Li Peng this morning. 
  In a panel discussion to examine the report, Fujian 
Provincial Governor Jia Qinglin said, "The government work 
report reflects the spirit of seeking truth from facts, as well 
as the interests and wish of the people of various 
nationalities. It also spells out guiding principle for our 
work." 
  He said that governments at all levels must follow the 
guideline of seizing the current opportunity for development, 
deepening reforms, opening China wider to the outside world, 
promoting economic development and maintaining social stability. 
  Moreover, they must also properly handle relations between 
development, reform and stability, he noted. 
  The report stresses the need to speed up the establishment 
of 
a socialist market economic structure, and that fully conforms 
to reality in coastal Fujian Province, he said. 
  Over the past few years, Fujian has sought to create a 
market 
economy and to adopt internationally accepted practices in its 
economic activities, he said. 
  "This year we shall conscientiously implement a serious of 
new reform measures formulated by the central government, while 
taking supplementary measures so as to make breakthroughs in key 
areas," he said. 
  Qinghai Governor Tian Chengping also expressed support for 
the principles, goals and tasks put forward in the government 
work report. 
  He said that reform in the next stage is a Herculean task 
since it is expected to achieve breakthroughs in key fields. 
Reform of enterprises, finance, monetary and investment sectors 
calls for consensus of all localities and departments throughout 
the country and all of them are expected to make concerted 
efforts for the common goal. 
  Continued reform will also inject vitality in economically 
backward Qinghai Province and promote its development, he said. 
  Tian also mentioned economic disparities between interior 
regions and coastal provinces. He expressed the hope that the 
state would establish a special organ in charge of developing 
western regions. It is necessary to work out a specific goal and 
program, announce concrete support policies and increase 
investment in infrastructural construction in the western 
regions, he said. 
  Upon hearing the government work report, Li Ziliu, mayor of 
Guangzhou City, pledged that his city will carry out the new 
taxation system to the letter. 
  He said a guideline in the government work report is to 
handle well relations among reform, development and stability. 
The guideline is imperative for Guangzhou, a pioneer in China's 
reform and opening to the outside world. 
  Xie Shijie, secretary of Sichuan Provincial Committee of the 
Communist Party of China, said that he feels "The achievements 
are great, the task is arduous, the responsibility is great and 
the goal is promising" after hearing the report. He said 
Sichuan will further expand opening up to promote its 
development.

Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporters Li Shangzhi 
(2621 1424 1807) and He Ping (0149 1627): "Work With One Heart 
and Struggle in Unison"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the morning of 10 
March, the hour hand of the clock approaches "9." The Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] will soon 
open at the Great Hall of the People. The magnificent meeting 
hall is all lightened up; all NPC deputies are waiting for the 
arrival of the solemn moment. In the capacity of the executive 
chairman of the Second Session of the Eighth NPC Presidium and 
as executive chairman of today's session, Chairman Qiao Shi will 
preside over the session's opening ceremony. As soon as he 
entered the lounge, he cordially shook hands with and extended 
his regards to Vice President Rong Yiren, and then sat down next 
to Ann Tse Kai, vice chairman of the Eighth National Committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC]. He asked Ann Tse Kai with concern if she could get 
used to life in Beijing since she just arrived from Hong Kong, 
and then talked about resuming sovereignty rights over Hong 
Kong. Qiao Shi said: On the Hong Kong issue, our stand is 
consistent. The responsibility for the breakdown of the Sino- 
British talks on the Hong Kong issue is totally on the British 
side. We are firm and unshakable in resuming sovereignty rights 
over Hong Kong in 1997. 
  Speaking of the Second Session, Qiao Shi said: "This year's 
work and objectives have been clearly defined. According to the 
responsibility entrusted to the NPC by the Constitution, we 
should quicken the pace of legislation, strengthen supervision, 
regularize the socialist market economic system, and ensure that 
the state's major policies are smoothly and thoroughly carried 
out." 
  At 0850, General Secretary Jiang Zemin entered the lounge 
and 
sat down next to CPPCC National Committee Chairman Li Ruihuan. 
They talked about stepping up building socialist spiritual 
civilization. While they were chatting, Qian Qichen, vice 
premier of the State Council and foreign minister, approached 
Jiang Zemin and said: "The UN Committee on Human Rights has 
vetoed an anti-China resolution tabled by some countries." 
Jiang Zemin said: "Trying to make human rights an issue cannot 
win people's support. We should justly and forcefully refute 
them." Premier Li Peng, who had just come into the lounge, 
added: "I plan to make our stand clear on this particular issue 
in today's government work report." Jiang Zemin said: "Good!" 
  Turning to the Second Session, Jiang Zemin said: "Currently, 
the general situation is very good and the major principles and 
policies have been laid down. The key problem now is for people 
of all nationalities to work together with one heart and in a 
down-to-earth manner." 
  Premier Li Peng, who was about to step up to the podium to 
deliver a report on the government's work, smilingly told 
reporters: "Comrade Xiaoping has always favored short and solid 
reports. This year's report gives prominence to the theme of 
reform, development, and stability, and we have tried our best 
to make the report realistic. Comrades and friends from all 
sectors have offered many valuable opinions on the draft report; 
I am very grateful to them. I also hope that, during the Second 
Session, all NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members 
will speak freely and offer more opinions on the report." 
  "Reform is the driving force, development is the goal, and 
maintaining stability is the first priority. The general 
guidelines and principle for this year's work have been set; so, 
as long as we can properly handle the relationships between 
reform, development, and maintaining stability, and as long as 
we work with one heart and one mind, we will be in an 
impregnable position," added Li Ruihuan. 
  The atmosphere in the lounge was warm. Zhu Rongji, Liu 
Huaqing, Hu Jintao, and other comrades also cheerfully chatted 
with comrades sitting next to them. 
  Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun, who also is executive chairman of 
the Second Session Presidium, arrived at the Great Hall very 
early to inspect the preparatory work for the opening ceremony. 
He also inspected the podium's audio system. At the lounge, he 
asked Zou Jiahua: "At which delegation are you going to hear 
deputies' opinions?" Zou Jiahua replied: "I am a member of the 
Sichuan Provincial delegation." "The Sichuan delegation is a 
big one," Tian Jiyun said. "Sure, Sichuan's population accounts 
for 10 percent of the country's," Zou Jiahua said. The two 
leaders then discussed how to take effective measures to further 
improve large and medium state-owned enterprises. 
  Seeing Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, coming toward him, Wu Bangguo, secretary 
of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, stepped toward him and 
told him: "The day before yesterday, we relayed the Third 
Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission 
guidelines to lower levels; these guidelines are being further 
carried out." They said the anticorruption struggle must be 
carried out continuously and in a penetrating manner in the new 
year. 
  "You have been doing very well in Shandong!" said Wang 
Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, to Jiang 
Chunyun, secretary of the Shandong Provincial CPC Committee. 
"It is very kind of you. There is still a lot we need to learn 
from our fraternal provinces and municipalities," Jiang Chunyun 
said modestly. 
  Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin, who also is executive chairman of 
the Second Session Presidium, asked reporters to make sure they 
file more reports on the NPC's legislative work because it is an 
important assurance for building and refining the socialist 
market economic system, for accelerating economic development, 
and for promoting social progress. 
  The bell is ringing for the opening ceremony. 
  While walking to the meeting hall from the lounge, the 
leading comrades still enthusiastically chatted with each other. 
The discussions of those attending the Second Session -- some 
of them may have or may not have seen each other often, some are 
and some are not CPC members, some are with the central 
authorities and some are from various localities, and many are 
from different posts and fronts -- focused on one [as published] 
subject: reform, development, stability, and striving for new 
victories in the new year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Enactment of a 
securities law for China is expected late this year, according 
to economist Li Yining. 
  Li, who is attending the ongoing session of the National 
People's Congress (NPC) here as a deputy, said that a draft of 
the law, which has been submitted to the NPC Law Committee for 
revision, is expected to be submitted again to the NPC Standing 
Committee for deliberation in April. 
  Li, who is also an economics professor of Beijing 
University, 
said that, despite repeated changes, the soon-to-be-enacted law 
will always contain three principles: A tying of rights and 
interests with shares, unified management of the securities 
market, and opposition to such practices as illegal trading, 
inside trading and procurement of shares through the abuse of 
power. This, he said, is to ensure open and fair operation of 
the securities market. 
  The Securities Law will have at least two "Chinese 
characteristics," Li said, although, for the most part, it will 
be compatible with internationally accepted practices. 
  The first characteristic will be that companies to issue 
shares will be subject to approval by competent authorities as 
well as to commonly-accepted practices. 
  The second will be a clear division between A-shares and B- 
shares. "the securities authorities will formulate special 
regulations on B-shares," Li Yining said. 
  According to Li, such stipulations are necessary because 
China so far has a very small number of certified public 
accountants for auditing. 
  Also, the inconvertibility of the Chinese yuan makes it 
impossible for the two types of shares to merge, he noted. 
  "As China's economy grows and the Chinese currency becomes 
convertible with the passage of time, a revision of the law is 
possible after its enactment," he said. 
  The ultimate goal is to make the new law compatible with 
internationally accepted practices and enable the Chinese 
securities market to adapt to the global securities market," he 
said.

the sessions of the National People's Congress, NPC, and Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, CPPCC, in Beijing -- 
From the "Morning News" program] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] After a whole day of news 
gathering yesterday, I was impressed most of all by the emphasis 
given by the highest party and government leaders to maintaining 
stability. Two developments I found out about support this view. 
  At a brief meeting with leaders of the provinces and 
municipalities yesterday [8 March] morning, General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed the importance today of properly 
handling the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. Reform and economic development should be carried 
out under the precondition of stability. Meanwhile, it is 
necessary to develop the economy by constantly advancing reforms 
to bring about long-term stability. 
  On the other hand, the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee adopted a 10-character 
policy -- democracy, realism, unity, stability, and motivational 
atmosphere -- after examining a plan on the coverage of the NPC 
and CPPCC sessions, adding two characters for stability to last 
year's eight-character policy. Meanwhile, the Central Committee 
also called for the two democratic sessions to be permeated with 
an atmosphere promoting the free discussion of views. [passage

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- A corner of the main 
lobby of the Great Hall of the People here became the busiest 
part of the huge edifice half an hour before the opening of the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) at 
9:00 AM [0000 GMT] today, as NPC deputies crowded around two 
data service counters there requesting information. 
  Set up in the southern side of the lobby are a statistics 
counter and a legal documents counter manned with 20 workers and 
equipped with seven computer terminals. 
  When the bell rang for the session to start in the hall's 
main auditorium, the desks had provided services for more than 
100 deputies. 
  The two data service counters were set up by the State 
Statistical Bureau and the Legislative Affairs Commission of the 
NPC Standing Committee. The first has a data bank of rural 
social and economic statistics of China's 2,300 counties 
(cities), and the latter a data bank of state laws and decrees, 
international business conventions, and the market practices and 
norms of the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and France. 
  This is the third year that such services have been provided 
for NPC deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, according to 
Jin Zhaofeng, an official of the State Statistical Bureau. 
During last year's session, he said, about 1,000 deputies 
obtained data from the services. 
  Deputies have become increasingly eager to get information, 
he said. The service counters are expected to serve more 
deputies during the current session than before, he said, basing 
his prediction on his first day's experience. 
  Deputies are more selective about data than before, he said, 
and their selection reflects their concerns. For example, he 
said, many deputies asked for statistics concerning economic 
gaps between China's east and west, income disparities between 
southern China and northern provinces and such hot issues as 
China's growing migrating population of rural laborers seeking 
jobs. 
  Li Yangkai, a deputy from Liaoning Province and a senior

he said. 
  Tong Meijun, a member of the CPPCC National Committee and a 
research fellow of the economic and technological center of the 
Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, has visited the law-decree 
counter several times. She said she wanted to collect relevant 
laws and regulations of developed countries, which will serve as 
reference when her enterprise is transformed into a joint-stock 
company. 
  A deputy from Hunan Province said the services are valuable 
since many bills and suggestions to be raised by deputies 
involve legal issues. 
  Some journalists covering the session, including reporters 
from Hong Kong and Macao and foreign correspondents, also 
collected information from the counters.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- The central 
government has over the past 10 years set aside huge amount of 
money to support Tibetan students to study in inland provinces, 
which has helped train a large group of capable personnel for 
the economic construction of the Tibet Autonomous Region. 
  So far more than 12,000 Tibetan children have been enrolled 
in 86 state-funded secondary schools or classes in 26 provinces 
and autonomous regions of the country, according to a deputy to 
the current session of the Eighth National People's Congress. 
  Yang Chuantang, vice-chairman of the Tibet autonomous 
regional government, said today that more than 1,000 graduates 
of such schools have returned to work in Tibet and have been 
playing an important role in the region's economic construction 
and some have become leaders at various government levels. 
  Moreover, Yang noted, some 500 graduates have been enrolled 
in universities both in Tibet and in inland areas. 
  Yang said that such a way to get more Tibetan children 
educated has also greatly eased educational problems in 
agricultural and pastoral areas of the region where children 
have difficulties to go to school.

  [Text] Hefei, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Anhui Province, in east 
China, with a population of 59 million, has become one of the 
provinces with the fastest economic growth speed. 
  According to the latest statistics, the province's gross 
domestic product last year amounted to 94 billion yuan, and the 
rate of growth was the third highest in the country. 
  Its gross industrial output value last year was the seventh 
greatest in the country, and its agricultural output value fifth. 
  Anhui, whose rate of growth of foreign trade ranks sixth in 
the country, has caught national attention, a provincial 
official in charge of economic development said. 
  The official attributed the good result to the hard efforts 
of its citizens who have taken an active part in the reforms, in 
a down-to-earth manner. 
  Last year saw Anhui's state-owned enterprises spend 17.17 
billion yuan on fixed assets, an increase of 42.6 percent over 
the previous year, and 6.26 billion on technical transformation, 
also up 42.6 percent. 
  Infrastructure facilities which were completed last year 
included a railway running from Hefei, capital of the province, 
to Anqing, an ancient city on the bank of the Chang Jiang River; 
a furnace with a capacity of 2,500 cubic meters in the Ma'anshan 
Iron and Steel Complex; and advanced program control telephone 
exchanges in every county town in the province. 
  Construction of a number of key national capital projects is 
in full swing. Included are a Chang Jiang River highway bridge 
in Tongling City and the Tongling Cement Plant. 
  Anhui, which took the lead in China's rural economic reform, 
has paid attention to developing quality and efficient 
agriculture, and encouraged the surplus rural labor force to set 
up more rural industrial enterprises or go to cities to contract 
for construction and other work. 
  Anhui's agricultural output value last year totalled 41.7 
billion yuan, an increase of 8.5 percent over the previous year, 
exceeding the average annual increase rate of 2.8 percent in the 
1986-90 period. Its gross output value generated by rural 
industrial enterprises last year also set a record. 
  By carrying out the enterprise reform, a number of key state 
enterprises have rejuvenated themselves. 
  At present, 15 prefectural centers and cities have opened 
securities markets, paving the way for enterprises to collect 
funds for modernization. 
  In addition, Anhui is building an economic belt from Wuhu 
City on the banks of the Chang Jiang River to Hefei and 
Huangshan, one of China's tourist attractions, while improving 
transport facilities to link the province to other parts of the 
country as well as the outside world. 
  The improved investment conditions have helped the province 
to boost its foreign trade and attract more foreign investment. 
  Anhui's import and export volume topped 1.2 billion U.S. 
dollars last year, an increase of 15 percent over the previous 
year. 
  Included were exports totalling 960 million U.S. dollars, up 
16 percent. 
  The official said: "With abundant natural resources and 
convenient transport facilities, Anhui has become a favored 
place for overseas investment." 
  Business people from Taiwan and Japan and elsewhere are 
streaming into the province, which has concluded dozens of 
contracts on the technical transformation of old enterprises and 
improvement of urban infrastructure facilities. 
  A survey shows that the provincial government approved the 
establishment of 1,040 overseas-funded enterprises last year.

  [Text] Suzhou, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Singapore financial 
groups have streamed into Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, to invest 
since China and Singapore joined hands to build an industrial 
park there in May last year. 
  Suzhou, an ancient garden city, has developed into an 
economically-booming city in east China. 
  At present, Singapore companies have concluded letters of 
intent and agreements on more than 50 contracts on cooperative 
projects with the Suzhou city government. 
  With a sum of three billion U.S. dollars, these projects 
involve the fields of tourism, energy development, 
transportation, electronics, machinery, textiles, chemicals and 
the service trade. 
  A local official noted that banking and economic entities 
from the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and 
Austria and Taiwan have contacted the Singaporean government to 
express their wishes to participate in the development of the 
industrial park.

  [Text] Jinan, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Shandong, an economically 
advanced coastal province in east China, is boosting its 
export-oriented economy in an all-round way. 
  "Opening further to the outside world may help us raise the 
quality of our economy as a whole, and is the key to speeding up 
our modernization process," Zhao Zhihao, governor of the 
province, said. 
  "Shandong will further improve its investment conditions and 
strive to hook up with the international economy," he states. 
  The governor acknowledged that although Shandong has made 
rapid progress in the development of its export-oriented economy 
over the past few years it still lags behind some other coastal 
provinces. 
  The province exported 5.9 billion U.S. dollars worth of 
goods 
last year, only one fourth of that for Guangdong, an 
economically-booming province bordering on Hong Kong, and about 
the same as Jiangsu and Fujian Provinces. 
  "The latter might surpass us this year if we remain at the 
same pace of economic development," the governor said. 
  The provincial government pledged to accelerate the 
development of markets, raise economic efficiency, adjust the 
industrial structure, and improve transport and 
telecommunications facilities. 
  According to Song Fatang, deputy governor of the province, 
Shandong will carry out a package of reforms involving the shift 
of mechanism in large and medium-sized enterprises, banking, 
circulation, share-holding system and macro-control of the 
economy. 
  It will encourage more enterprises to follow the 
international patterns in production and sell their products on 
the international market, while helping them to import advanced 
managerial expertise, technology and equipment, invite talented 
people to work in the province and absorb foreign capital. 
  In addition, Shandong plans to employ the joint-stock system 
in its construction of capital projects to attract foreign 
investment. 
  It will soak up more overseas capital for its capital 
projects by way of issuing bonds and stocks or borrowing. 
  While concentrating on the development of agriculture and 
industry, Shandong will pay attention to the service trades. 
  It will streamline its export product mix, with the focus on 
the export of finished industrial products -- machinery and 
electrical appliances in the main. 
  Meanwhile, the province is exerting more efforts for the 
development of such key industries as motor vehicles, iron and 
steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals, and trying to form 
enterprise groups, corporations and trans-national companies. 
  Song called on transportation departments to construct more 
local railways, highways and ports to pave the way for rapid 
economic development. 
  He encouraged the departments to use more foreign investment 
in the construction of infrastructure facilities by issuing 
stocks and taking out loans.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Rong (2621 2837)] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 19 Feb (XINHUA) -- Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju 
emphasized: As the suburbs of a large metropolis, Shanghai's 
rural areas have three major tasks of development -- namely, 
stepping up the building of the "green vegetable project," 
accelerating their urbanization, and speeding up the reforms of 
their various structures and systems. 
  He made these remarks at a recent rural Shanghai work 
meeting. 
  Huang Ju said that in Shanghai's urban agricultural 
development, it is particularly important to pay attention to 
the "vegetable basket project" with emphasis being placed on 
growing green vegetables. According to him, the new project has 
the following major contents: While ensuring 150,000 mu of 
year-round vegetable crops, an additional investment of 250 
million yuan shall be made to increase the area of greenhouse 
cultivation to 25,000 mu in three years and to bring the area of 
landscaping garden cultivation [as received] up to 15 to 20 
percent of the total area of vegetable crops. The planned 
year-round vegetable and nonstaple food bases shall remain 
unchanged for 10 to 15 years. Huang Ju emphasized the need to 
seek new operational mechanisms for vegetable and nonstaple food 
production and marketing. He said that with the new mechanisms, 
the state-run food market should play the major role of 
stabilizing market prices while organizing and encouraging 
peasants to participate in commodity circulation. 
  More and more importance is being attached to the 
urbanization of Shanghai's rural areas. Huang Ju told the 
meeting that Shanghai's suburban areas will be turned into 
"second-class cities" step by step over the next two or three 
years. He said: This concept means that the urbanization of 
Shanghai's rural areas will be greatly accelerated. An 
important precondition for the urbanization is to do a good, 
high-standard job of regional planning. The "second-class 
cities" should be accompanied by a number of urban centers, each 
with a population of 200,000 or so. In terms of planning, the 
urban centers should meet the standards of modern cities, and 
their building plans should include industrial-district 
construction, infrastructure construction, and the development 
of tertiary industry. 
  In conclusion, Huang Ju said that Shanghai's suburban areas 
should make efforts to further deepen reforms and strive to make 
new breakthroughs this year. He pointed out several tasks: to 
actively carry out experiments on modern enterprises, to strive 
to establish 1,000 new cooperative shareholding companies this 
year, and to have 100 townships and towns complete inventories 
of their collective assets; to actively explore a new production 
and marketing system and to build a number of high-standard 
district markets for agricultural products; and to carry out an 
experimental reform of the agricultural land-use system and to 
separate ownership from the right to sign contracts and the 
right to manage.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 5 (CNS)--A wave of going abroad 
which resulted from rapid economic development and lasted for 
several years in Shanghai is now in decline while at the same 
time a trend of returning home from studying abroad is on the 
rise. Statistics show that the number of returnees received by 
the municipality increased by 19 percent in 1993 when compared 
with 1992. Students studying abroad at their expense registered 
a drop of 40 percent in 1993 over the year before. 
  Young people in Shanghai have been level-headed in handling 
the matter of going abroad in recent years, according to a 
service centre for returnees from studying abroad. The number 
of people going overseas for further study or for professional 
study was not in decline but those who went abroad to work and 
to learn a foreign language registered a sharp drop in numbers. 
People who went overseas to use their talents and students who 
finished their professional studies abroad have returned home 
with their eyes on Shanghai and its development and the Pudong 
New Zone. 
  Following the implementation last year of a preferential 
policy on student returnees from overseas, Shanghai has received 
a growing number of them. A total of 95 people returning from 
studying abroad have to date been given preferential treatment 
by the service centre there to open enterprises. During the 
short period of six months, nearly 40 returnees were given a 
license to begin operating a business and already a number of 
high technology companies have made a contribution to the 
building up of the municipality.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The Municipal 
Government of Shanghai, China's largest economic center, is 
encouraging foreign business people to participate in 
transforming its old urban districts. 
  "Anyone who makes an investment in this field will gain the 
land-use right in accordance with the measures concerning the 
leasing of state land-use rights, and enjoy preferential 
treatment," said a municipal official. 
  Shanghai has 35 million sq m [square meters] of dilapidated 
housing and other old buildings where 1.46 million households, 
about 60 percent of the total households in the city, take 
shelter. 
  These edifices, which generally lack kitchen and toilet 
facilities, account for one third of the total residential areas 
in the metropolis. 
  "To enable all its residents to have a living space 
averaging 
10 sq m per capita by the end of this century, the municipal 
government plans to raise funds through various channels to 
speed up the transformation of the old urban districts," the 
official said. 
  He noted that foreign business people are welcomed to join 
in 
the transformation in forms of joint ventures, co-operation or 
with sole foreign investment.

Feng Yizhen (7458 0076 3791)] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 19 Feb (XINHUA) -- Shanghai's cellular 
communications has entered a new period of accelerated 
development. Last year, Shanghai increased its exchange capacity 
for cellular telephone communications by 40,000. Shanghai's 
investment in cellular communications this year will double that 
of last year's and the exchange capacity will increase three 
times. 
  Shanghai opened China's first public cellular telephone 
network in July 1982. It was only in 1992 that the subscribers 
to the cellular phone system surpassed 10,000. Last year, the A 
and B exchange capacity reached 60,000 and the number of 
subscribers increased to 30,000, thanks to four months of 
stepped-up efforts made by the staff members and workers at the 
Shanghai Municipal Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau. 
  At present, the number of subscribers to the two Shanghai 
cellular networks totals 44,890. Starting this year, Shanghai 
will provide additional cellular phone services, including the 
offering of telephone rambling service [dian hua man you ye wu 
7192 6114 3355 3266 2814 0523] in cooperation with neighboring 
Jiangsu and Zhejiang, as well as transfer call service, and busy 
transfer call services.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Millions of farmers in 
east China's Zhejiang Province, one of the richest regions in 
the country, no longer regard their offsprings as their only 
support in their old age. 
  They have turned to insurance. 
  By the end of 1993 retirement insurance schemes had spread 
throughout the province, with over 1.85 million people paying 
premiums totalling 900 million yuan. 
  So far, nearly 75,000 rural residents are drawing old-age 
pensions worth 30 yuan to 250 yuan a month. 
  The insurance categories have been greatly expanded since 
the 
provincial insurance company started to offer services for the 
elderly in 1985. 
  Now people can take out insurance policies for injury, crop 
failure and illness. 
  Zhejiang farmers' income is on the top list in the country's 
rural areas. Their annual income averaged 1,746 yuan at the end 
of last year.

appropriated more than 11.6 billion yuan last year to improve 
its highway and port facilities. 
  During the year, 150 km of express highways were built and 
more than 1,690 km of ordinary highways upgraded. 
  Individual counties and townships, using their own 
initiative 
to pool money, built 3,346 km of roads within their own 
territories and asphalted 2,650 km of concrete roads. 
  By the end of last year the total length of highways in 
Guangdong had reached 67,490 km, an increase of 11,600 km over 
1992. As a result, the province has 37.8 km of highways per sq 
km, ranking among the top in the country in this regard. 
  In addition, last year the province built 22 new bus 
stations 
and 49 new berths which are able to handle 7.47 million more 
tons of goods each year. 
  This year the province plans to pour 12 billion yuan (about 
1.38 billion U.S. dollars) into further upgrading its key 
highway and shipping facilities.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in a 
mountain village in south China's Guangdong Province are making 
a fortune by raising soft-shelled turtles in a local hot spring. 
  This method can generate a profit rate of 100-200 percent, 
about 10 times higher than by traditional turtle breeding. 
  Farmer Wang Zhunduo, 29, said that the 50,000 young 
soft-shelled turtles he is raising can be sold for no less than 
three million yuan (about 345,000 U.S. dollars) by the end of 
this year, when they are fully grown. 
  Local official Zhong Juntian said a farmer raised 
soft-shelled turtles on more than 20 mu (about 1.4 ha [hectare]) 
of land and incubated another 100,000 soft-shelled turtle eggs 
last year, earning more than two million yuan (about 230,000 
U.S. dollars). 
  The rearing of soft-shelled turtles first started in 1992 in 
the village, which boasts abundant geothermal energy resources. 
The spring water there, of the HA.K-HCO [expansion not given] 
type, is 78 to 91 degrees Centigrade and is rich in trace 
elements. 
  Experts said the new method of raising soft-shelled turtles 
in spring water has greatly shortened their growth period. Such 
turtles can grow up to 800 g [grams] within a year, compared to 
500 g over three to four years in the past. 
  They said the new method has also reduced the death rate of 
young soft-shelled turtles during the winter hibernation season 
from around 80 percent to one percent. 
  The stable temperature of the spring water keeps 
soft-shelled 
turtles actively growing all the year round, the experts said, 
adding that spring water also ensures high egg-laying and 
incubation rates. 
  In addition to a total of 120 mu of open spring water area, 
the village has artificially developed another 150 mu and 
constructed a spring water farm. And the open area is expected 
to expand to 300 mu by the end of this year. 
  Counting at the current price level, every ha devoted to the 
raising of soft-shelled turtles can generate three million to 
4.5 million yuan (about 345,000 to 457,000 U.S. dollars) in 
output value, with a net profit of more than 1.5 million yuan. 
  Local farmers are planning to build enclosed farms for 
raising soft-shelled turtles. These farms will be lit up at 
night in order to speed up the growth period. 
  Zijin County, to which the village belongs, has decided to 
spread soft-shelled turtle fries to all its territory after they 
have spent the winter season in spring water.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Foreign funds continue 
to pour into Shenzhen, one of the earliest special economic 
zones in south China's Guangdong Province, official reports say. 
  In 1993, more than 1.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign 
funds were actually put to use in Shenzhen, doubling the figure 
for the previous year. Foreign-funded enterprises reported an 
export volume of more than 5.6 billion U.S. dollars, an increase 
of 25 percent and accounting for more than 70 percent of the 
city's total. 
  Over the past 14 years, the city has utilized nearly six 
billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign funds. 
  In recent years, foreign investors have been encouraged to 
invest in the city's energy, transportation, and high- and 
new-tech industries. 
  The foreign-funded enterprises in the city are in good 
performance and a sample survey showed that some 80 percent of 
them are profitable. 
  A total of 370 foreign-funded enterprises increased their 
registered capital and extended terms of operation last year, 
according to a city office in charge of foreign investment.

  [Text] Guangxi's national economy continued its rapid 
growth in January 1994, following the rapid growth last year. 
This is demonstrated by the following: First, the area for 
farming grain, edible oil, and sugar cane is stable, with some 
expansion. Statistics show that the region's grain-growing areas 
will increase by 1.7 percent over last year, the area planted 
with edible oil crops is expected to increase by 10 percent, and 
the area planted with sugar cane will basically be maintained at 
last year's level or with a slight increase. 
  Second, there is a strong momentum in the growth of 
enterprises in townships and towns. In January, the operational 
turnover of enterprises in townships and towns was 6.08 billion 
yuan, up 1.5 times over the same period last year, and the sum 
of taxes collected was 142 million yuan, up 1.1 times over the 
same period last year. 
  Third, industry was thriving in both output and marketing. 
In January, industry at and above the township level had an 
output value of 6.05 billion yuan, up 33.5 percent over the same 
period last year, with an increase ranking eighth across China. 
The marketing output was 5.03 billion yuan, up 62.1 percent 
over the same period last year, with an increase ranking third 
across China. In January, Guangxi's industrial production took 
on a marked characteristic of heavy industry growing faster than 
light industry, and non-state-owned enterprises growing faster 
than state-owned. 
  Fourth, retail business was thriving. Fifth, the developing 
trend of foreign economic relations and trade continued to look 
optimistic.

<F P=106> [By Duan Jianzhou (3008 1696 3166), Wu Quanhai (0702 0356 </F>
3189): "Henan Provincial Branch of Bank of China Strengthens 
Management of Funds Involving Foreign-Funded Enterprises, Five 
Cases of Financial Fraud Detected and Blocked"] 
  [Text] Bank of China Henan Branch handles business 
strictly according to laws, regulations, and customary 
international practices, and it is strengthening the management 
of funds involving foreign-funded enterprises. In 1993, it 
effectively blocked five cases of financial fraud involving 
foreign-funded enterprises and prevented losses of $45 million 
to the state. 
  While conducting international financial business, Bank of 
China Henan Branch discovered that in recent years cases of 
financial fraud involving foreign-funded firms had developed 
from the past pattern of using lost, stolen, and altered foreign 
banknotes, travelers' checks, and credit cards to the current 
pattern of forging payment vouchers or credit documents 
involving large amounts of money, that the amounts of money 
involved in fraud became larger, and that the objects of fraud 
had changed from a small number of foreign-related shops and 
individuals to state enterprises and units, government organs, 
and even specialized banks. These illegal activities have 
seriously disrupted the financial order and economic environment. 
  Last June, a person named Song, who was chairman of the 
board 
of directors of a certain company in Hong Kong, met some 
personnel who worked in certain units in Zhengzhou and was 
introduced to others by a woman who said she worked in Shenzhen. 
He said he had gathered world-renowned consortia and banks to 
invest in Henan. They suggested that the provincial branch of 
the Bank of China should issue a long-term letter of credit, 
which should be valid for 180 days and amount to $20 million. 
They said that for each dollar of the letter of credit, they 
would be willing to pledge 9.6 yuan as security, and that they 
would use a certificate of ownership of real estate in Zhengzhou 
as a mortgage for the uncovered portion. Bank of China Henan 
Branch carried out an investigation and discovered that this 
Hong Kong company had pledged a mortgage of 148 million yuan at 
the Henan Province branch of the People's Construction Bank of 
China,in return for two letters of credit amounting to $15 
million. Because the mortgage money was not specified as a 
mortgage when it was handed over to the Henan Provincial Branch 
of the People's Construction Bank of China, the Hong Kong 
company wanted to use the loophole and withdraw the mortgage 
money, which it wanted to use as a mortgage at the Bank of China 
Henan Branch. These people carried out frequent activities in 
the relevant provincial government departments, and some 
influential provincial government officials even went to the 
provincial branch of the Bank of China to lobby for them. Bank 
of China Henan Branch thought that in light of such a situation, 
it should do business strictly according to regulations all the 
more. Bank of China Henan Branch proposed four ideas according 
to customary practice in the international community. One of 
these was for a foreign trade enterprise recognized by the Bank 
of China to serve as a guarantor, or for the company to deposit 
an amount of foreign exchange equalling the amount of the letter 
of credit as security, but these four ideas were rejected by the 
company. Eventually, it was verified that it was a case of 
fraud involving the use of long-term checks to cash money for 
use as investment funds. Bank of China Henan Branch promptly 
notified other branches and its headquarters, so blocking this 
serious case of foreign-related financial fraud. 
  The other four cases of foreign-related financial fraud 
detected and blocked by Bank of China Henan Branch all involved 
cashing money for use as investment funds. Last April, a Hong 
Kong businessman said that he wanted to pool funds with the 
Zhengzhou Zhongyuan Steel Rolling Mill with a long-term credit 
of $5 million, which he said was available to the mill if it 
would pay several tens of thousands of yuan in handling costs 
and which he said could be cashed at any bank for several tens 
of millions of yuan. Bank of China Henan Branch inquired about 
the case through the Luxembourg branch of Bank of China, as well 
as the Los Angeles Branch of Daiwa Bank, only to discover that 
it was a plan by the Hong Kong businessman to practice fraud 
with a counterfeit bill of exchange. Before this, Bank of China 
Henan branch also helped Luoyang's China Savings Company, the 
Sanmen Gorge branch of the Bank of China, and Zhengzhou Diantong 
Company to detect false drafts used by foreigners for fraud, 
which amounted to $25 million in these four cases.

  [Text] Changsha, March 9 (XINHUA) -- In central China's 
Hunan Province, farmers now earn most of their extra cash from 
breeding livestock and fish. 
  According to local officials, exports of livestock made up a 
half of the province's total exports of farm produce last year, 
and local farmers earned 60 percent of the added income of the 
whole year from the breeding industry. 
  In 1978 the output value of the province's breeding industry 
only accounted for 15 percent of its total agricultural output. 
But last year the output value of the sector climbed to 20.614 
billion yuan, accounting for 36.6 percent of the province's 
total agricultural output value. 
  The officials attributed the rapid development of the 
breeding industry to the country's reform, the wide application 
of agro-technology, enhanced circulation and local geographical 
advantages. 
  To promote an overall development of rural industry, the 
province this year plans to continue to treat the breeding 
industry as an important measure for developing high-efficiency 
agriculture and increasing the income of farmers, with the 
purpose of making local farmers become prosperous quickly. 
  Besides setting concrete targets for the number of pigs 
slaughtered, the total output of meat and the output of aquatic 
products, the province also aims to earn 24 billion yuan from 
the breeding industry in 1994, making it account for about 40 
percent of the province's total agricultural output value.

<F P=106> [By reporter Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Feb (XINHUA) -- Guided by the 
"supply-oriented" policy which the Taiwan authorities came up 
with early this year for Taiwan's economic development, relevant 
departments in Taiwan have drawn up the "Plan for New Scientific 
and Technological Development Zones in the Taiwan Region," the 
"Medium and Long-Range Industrial Zone Development Plan," and 
the "Water Resources Development Plan" in an effort to 
revitalize Taiwan's economy which has become potentially more 
worrisome each year. 
  After six months of research, Taiwan's "Council for Economic 
Planning and Development," maintaining that the high output 
yielded by scientific and technological industries can create 
more jobs, increase incomes, and create more business 
opportunities, has come up with these plans: 1) Expanding the 
Xinzu [Hsinchu] Scientific and Industrial Park in northern 
Taiwan to cover parts of Xinzu and Miaoli Counties; and building 
a new, 300-hectare scientific and industrial park in Guiren 
[Kuijen] township in Tainan, southern Taiwan, and making it a 
high-tech zone for the development of biotechnology, precision 
instruments, and aviation and space industries. 2. Establishing 
one software industrial zone each in Taibei [Taipei], Taizhong 
[Taichung], and Gaoxiong [Kaohsiung]. 3. Establishing one 
scientific and technological industrial zone each in northern 
Xinzu in northern Taiwan, in Yunlin County in central Taiwan, 
and in Annan district in southern Taiwan. 
  On this basis, Taiwan's "Economic Affairs Ministry 
Industrial 
Bureau" has come up with the "Medium- and Long-Range Plan for 
the Development of Industrial Zones in the Taiwan Region." 
Included in the plan is the establishment of additional 
software industrial zones, a center in Gaoxiong for disposing of 
industrial wastes in southern Taiwan, and a center in the 
Zhanghua [Changhua] Industrial Zone for disposing of industrial 
wastes in central Taiwan in order to reduce pollution caused by 
industrial wastes. According to the "Industrial Bureau," the 
plan is meant for bringing about an even development in Taiwan, 
and correcting the shortcomings of uneven economic development 
caused by the establishment of the majority of 
scientific-technological industrial zones in the north. 
  Of the 140 industrial zones with a total area of 30,761 
hectares designated to be developed, the development of 78 with 
a total area of 13,108 hectares, has been completed; and nine 
industrial zones with a total area of 5,687 hectares are being 
developed. Since land acquisition has become increasing 
difficult in Taiwan, relevant authorities in Taiwan are 
encouraging land owners and private enterprises to take part in 
the development of industrial zones so the construction process 
can be expedited. 
  Moreover, in view of the fact that Taiwan's water resources 
are deteriorating and water shortages have become increasingly 
serious, the "Council of Economic Planning and Development" has 
completed its "Plan for the Development of Water Resources," 
deciding that, during the next 20 years, 381.4 billion Taiwan 
dollars will be raised for the construction of 18 dams with an 
estimated effective capacity of 187,000 tonnes [figure as 
received], which is precisely the total capacity of the existing 
40 dams in Taiwan. These dams will be developed by stages to 
provide the water needed for daily and industrial consumption. 
On the average, these dams will be able to increase water 
supply by 3.28 billion tonnes of water annually. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan is continuing with its six-year "national 
construction plan," focusing on 12 construction projects, 
including the renovation and construction of secondary and 
primary school facilities, the construction of parks and sports 
facilities, the construction of local and community cultural 
software and hardware facilities, the development of new urban 
areas and "national housing" projects, the construction of new 
roads and parking lots in residential areas, the construction of 
business districts, the construction of north-south expressways, 
a mass transit system in the Gaoxiong Metropolitan district 
(traffic improvement project), the construction of subways in 
Taizhong and Tainan cities, and the construction of garbage 
incinerators and landfill yards.

<F P=106> [News commentary by station editor Yu Xin: "The Two Sides </F>
of the Taiwan Strait Accelerate Scientific-Technological 
Exchanges and Cooperation" -- from the "News and Current Events" 
program] 
  [Text] Recently, President of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences [CAS] Zhou Guangzhao went to Taiwan to attend a 1994 
meeting between the two sides of the Strait on material, and 
iron and steel manufacturing science and technology. Both sides 
further realized that each side had its respective advantages 
with regard to resources and technology, and that if they could 
strengthen cooperation it would be beneficial to promoting their 
development. 
  In recent years, exchanges between the two sides of the 
Strait have been very active. In 1992, seven mainland 
scientists, including Tan Jiazhen, made their first visit to 
Taiwan, opening the door for two-way exchanges between 
scientists of the two sides, and receiving much attention from 
people of social and scientific circles in Taiwan. The recent 
visit to Taiwan by 24 scholars and experts, led by President 
Zhou Guangzhao, to attend the industrial science and technology 
meeting resulted in substantial exchanges. Addressing the 
meeting, Wu Dayou [Wu Ta-you], the outgoing president of 
Academia Sinica, said: The two days of discussions between more 
than 20 experts from the mainland and Taiwan's experts on topics 
from specific fields marked a well-planned, profound, and 
meaningful exchange. 
  Taiwan's first comprehensive research institute was 
officially inaugurated on 1 February. Its president Liu Taiying 
[Liu Tai- ying] said his institute's goal is to strengthen 
scientific, technological, and cultural exchanges among people 
of Chinese origin all over the world, and between the two sides 
of the Strait, adding that in March the institute will sponsor a 
1994 seminar on industrial science and technology cooperation 
between the two sides of the Strait. Liu Tai-ying said: The 
mainland will send at least 70 scientific and technological 
experts to Taiwan. The institute hopes to reach an agreement 
with the mainland on enhancing exchange of industrial scientists 
and technicians between the two sides. This goal will be 
included in the institute's working plans. 
  To gain a further understanding of the sea areas in the 
South 
China Sea and to use the knowledge thus gained as a foundation 
for carrying out regional exploitation and research in the South 
China Sea in the future, in April this year Taiwan will dispatch 
10 oceanographic scientists to join mainland scientists on the 
CAS's oceanographic experimental ship to begin a month-long 
survey of the South China Sea. This will be the first time for 
oceanographic scientists of the two sides to participate in a 
joint survey of the South China Sea. Joint cooperation by the 
two sides in surveying the South China Sea is of great 
significance. 
  A rapid economic growth rate definitely depends on science 
and technology. The planned exchange between scientists and 
technicians of the two sides to exploit each other's strong 
points, thus forming a mechanism to supplement each other's 
shortcomings, will be a great stimulus to the economic 
development of the two sides. Sun Yunxuan [Sun Yun-suan], 
senior advisor to Taiwan's Presidential Office, and honorary 
president of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], noted: 
Because the mainland has attached importance to research in 
basic sciences from the start, it is ahead of Taiwan in heavy 
industries such as electrical engineering, machinery, and 
materials. On the other hand, Taiwan has attached importance to 
increasing national income. Because the domestic market is 
small, it has attached importance to international market 
competition for its industrial products by developing consumer 
industries, light industries, and other industries related to 
daily life and information. The focus of development of the two 
sides is different. Each has its strong points. There are 
great prospects for mutual aid and mutual interest in the future. 
  Exchanges between the two sides have expanded to the field 
of 
science and technology. So an academic meeting is no longer 
called an economic and trade seminar because it is a seminar 
directly involving the materials, iron and steel, insurance, and 
navigation industries. Scientific and technological circles of 
the two sides have agreed that it is necessary to accelerate 
scientific and technological exchanges to invigorate the 
national economy. The time is ripe for the scientific and 
technological circles of the two sides to increase the exchange 
of visits. Zhou Guangzhao's visit to Taiwan demonstrates that 
the Taiwan side is gradually easing restrictions on visits by 
officials from the mainland. However, obstacles to personnel 
exchanges still remain. Many mainland scholars were absent at 
the cross-Strait scientific and technological meeting held in 
Taiwan. It was regrettable that when Wang Fosong, vice 
president of CAS, applied to go to Taiwan, his application was 
rejected by the Taiwan side on the grounds that he is a member 
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

  [Text] Taipei, March 11 (CNA) -- a scheduled meeting 
between the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Beijing 
counterpart Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
(ARATS) may be postponed, a SEF spokesman said Friday [11 March]. 
  The meeting, originally scheduled for March 21, may be 
postponed because of scheduling conflicts with the plenary 
session of the National People's Congress and Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing, the 
spokesman said. 
  The meetings would interfere with the schedules of ARATS 
personnel, including ARATS Standing Vice Chairman Tang Shubei 
who is a member of the CPPCC. 
  A final decision on when the talks will be held will be made 
at a later date, the spokesman noted. 
  Meanwhile, SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Chao 
Jen-ho said Thursday that both sides may sign agreements on 
repatriation of hijackers, illegal immigrants and fishery 
disputes in the next round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks. 
  Chao said that during the previous three rounds of talks, 
SEF 
and ARATS have worked toward agreement on the issues and may 
reach agreement during the coming round of talks. 
  Chao also said that if the negotiation teams have time, they 
will also discuss cross-strait anti-crime cooperation, judicial 
assistance, protection of intellectual property rights and the 
rights of Taiwan businessmen on the mainland. 
  In related news, SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu, said Thursday 
that 
if the proposed talks go smoothly, a second meeting between Koo 
and his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan could probably come at 
the end of June or early July. 
  Koo and Wang met in Singapore in April, 1993, marking the 
first high-ranking contact between the two sides of the Taiwan 
Strait after more than four decades. 
  Koo said it is beneficial for both sides to increase 
contacts 
and he said that protection of rights of Taiwan businessmen 
would be the focus of his meeting with Wang. 
  Koo added that the he would also like to discuss 
cross-strait 
technology exchanges with Wang.

  [Text] Taipei, March 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan will lift import 
restrictions on 16 agricultural products from certain nations 
and regions within the next six years, Chairman Sun Ming-hsien 
of the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday [10 March]. 
  Sun made the statement while briefing reporters on the March 
21- 25 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks 
between Taiwan and South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, 
Hungary, Chile and South Korea in Geneva. 
  Sun noted that the countries had long expressed their 
concern 
about Taiwan's prohibitions on agricultural imports from their 
countries. 
  As a result, the COA has agreed to remove the prohibitions 
within six years to facilitate its entrance into the world trade 
body. 
  Currently, Taiwan allows the import of bananas, pineapples, 
guavas, mangoes, oranges, mandarin oranges, lemons, grapefruit, 
grapes, lichee, papaya, plums and longan from the US as well as 
peach and persimmon imports from Europe and the US. 
  Taiwan also allows imports of apples from the US and Canada, 
but prohibits apple imports from Japan and limits apple imports 
from other countries. 
  The restriction has triggered protests from New Zealand and 
Australia.

  [Text] Taipei, March 10 (CNA) -- Chang Hsiao-yen, minister 
of the cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC), 
said Thursday [10 March] that the commission will place emphasis 
on coordinating the economic strength of all Chinese and 
strengthening service to overseas Chinese communities. 
  Chang made the remark during a meeting of the Legislative 
Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. 
  The combined assets of Chinese traders could rival those of 
the United States, Japan, and Germany, he stressed. Chang 
quoted the economist magazine which reported that Chinese 
businessmen outside Mainland China hold US$1.5-2.0 trillion in 
liquid assets. 
  Taiwan's economic development could provide a sound basis 
for 
business links between domestic and overseas Chinese traders, he 
elaborated. 
  Moreover, he noted, the commission must do its part to boost 
cooperation with overseas Chinese in order to deter Beijing's 
"united front" tactics, which has drawn more than US$6 billion 
worth of investment to Mainland China. 
  And to meet the growing demand for Chinese-language 
instruction among overseas Chinese, the OCAC will set up "Taipei 
schools" in areas with large overseas Chinese communities. 
  The minister said he has visited 112 Overseas Chinese 
communities in the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, 
Holland, Spain, South Africa, the Philippines, Thailand, Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Japan since he assumed his office a year ago, 
and is planning to go to Canada, Australia, and Latin America in 
the near future.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429)] 
  [Text] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui went on a "holiday 
diplomacy" tour during the Spring Festival season. Under the 
pretext of "going on holiday," he took dozens of senior 
officials with him and visited three countries in Southeast 
Asia, namely, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Though 
all the host countries had cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan 
and established diplomatic relations with Beijing, and 
undertaken to adopt the "one China" policy, President Ramos, 
President Suharto, and King of Thailand Phumiphon went so far as 
to ignore Beijing's objection and insisted on meeting with Li 
Teng-hui, making Beijing very frustrated. According to informed 
sources in Beijing, in order to prevent the spread of Taipei's 
"holiday diplomacy," the CPC authorities have instructed 
relevant departments to work out countermeasures, which should 
include the review of its reunification tactics. 
<H3>  Li Kills Three Birds With One Stone by Carrying Out "Holiday 
Diplomacy" </H3>
  Informed sources said that a recent "restricted publication" 
circulating among high-ranking cadres ran a commentary on Li 
Teng- hui's "holiday diplomacy." This commentary believes that 
Li Teng- hui's "holiday diplomacy" is a materialization of 
Taiwan's "southward policy" (formulated to encourage Taiwan 
businessmen making investments in the mainland to channel their 
funds to Southeast Asia, in a bid to break the mainland's 
blockade with economy as an open sesame and expand Taiwan's 
diplomatic space) and an implementation of the "wild geese 
formation theory" (a Japanese economist's theory highly 
recommended by Li Teng-hui, which maps out an Asian economic 
scenario with Japan, the most advanced country, in the lead, 
followed by the "four little dragons" and then Southeast Asian 
countries, with the Chinese mainland and North Korea taking up 
the rear). To conduct "holiday diplomacy" toward Southeast Asia 
had been decided by the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee 
last December according to a motion made by Lien Chan, premier 
of the Executive Yuan, for a shift in diplomatic strategy. Lien 
Chan pointed out: South East Asian nations are now in need of 
money and technology, and Taiwan is capable of providing various 
kinds of assistance in this respect. "Taiwan has an exchange 
reserve of $80 billion. Can we not knock open the gate to 
Southeast Asia with it?" He argued that the time is ripe and 
Taiwan should not continue to give up what is within reach and 
seek after something unreachable, but should switch over from 
marching into Latin America to marching into Southeast Asia 
(countries surrounding China). Lien Chan not only put forward 
the motion, but also practiced it. He took the lead and went to 
Malaysia and Singapore to conduct "holiday diplomacy" toward the 
end of last year and at the beginning of this year, to open a 
way for Li Teng-hui and gain some experience. This effort made 
possible the instant success of Li Teng-hui's "holiday 
diplomacy" during the Spring Festival season, which fulfilled 
the purpose of "killing three birds with one stone:" It 
expanded headroom for Taiwan's diplomatic activities in the 
international arena, opened up new prospects for Taiwan business 
investment and development, and reduced Taiwan business 
dependence on the mainland market to prevent the increase of 
such dependence that might put Taiwan authorities in a passive 
position politically. 
<H5>  Host Countries Ignore China's Objection </H5>
  The sources continued: The CPC authorities showed grave 
concern over Li Teng-hui's "holiday diplomacy" from the very 
beginning. Before Li went on the "holiday," the Chinese foreign 
ministry spokesman said: Taiwan authorities are attempting to 
develop "substantive relations" with some countries on the 
pretense of "holiday-making," trying to create "two Chinas" in 
the international arena. The Chinese Government and the Chinese 
people are firmly against it and will never accept it. If the 
governments of the countries that have diplomatic relations with 
China accept Li Teng-hui's visit, regardless of the capacity and 
way in which this visit will be made, it will severely hurt the 
feelings of the Chinese people and impair the friendly and 
cooperative relations the countries concerned have maintained 
with China. Obviously, China hoped that the countries concerned 
would treasure their relations with China as their priority and 
guard against the political stratagem of the Taiwan authorities 
to avoid disrupting and damaging their friendly and cooperative 
relations with China that had been hard to come by. But the 
host countries ignored China's statement and went ahead to 
receive Li Teng-hui. 
  After Li went on his "holiday," the Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman again said: "The so-called 'holiday' diplomacy of Li 
Teng-hui is in essence an attempt to practice `two Chinas' or 
`one China, one Taiwan.' Practicing `two Chinas' or 'one China, 
one Taiwan' is a violation of the fundamental interests of all 
Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots, and is therefore 
doomed to failure. Countries that have diplomatic relations 
with China should strictly observe the principles of the 
communiques signed when such relations with China were 
established and the undertakings they made at the time. Any 
breach of the principle of diplomatic relations and the 
undertakings given at the time will naturally have a damaging 
effect on bilateral relations." 
  In the meantime, China canceled the arrangements for a 
National People's Congress delegation to visit the Philippines 
and Thailand, annulled an agreement on the import of timber from 
Indonesia, and froze the anti-tank weapons to be exported to 
Thailand. But the host countries turned a deaf ear and a blind 
eye to it. Moreover, THE NATION, an English language paper of 
Thailand which had enjoyed quite a good relationship with China, 
published a special article entitled "Risking the Danger of 
`Holiday Diplomacy'" on 20 February. The article pointed out: 
All Southeast Asian nations understand that reiterating the 
"one China policy" every evening may ensure a good night's 
sleep, but it does not give a "full stomach." The special 
article quoted a senior official of the Thai foreign ministry as 
saying that this is a "win-win" situation: Taiwan may declare 
to the world that it has conquered the last wall of the 
Southeast Asian nations, while Thailand may reap benefits from 
Taiwan investment. 
  The attitude of the host countries inspired Li Teng-hui. He 
was determined to carry on with "holiday diplomacy." Li has set 
the next targets of "holiday diplomacy" as India, Bangladesh, 
and Burma and then Japan and the United States. There are 
political personalities in both the United States and Japan 
saying that Li Teng-hui's "holiday diplomacy" is acceptable. In 
view of this, when he was visiting Japan in late February, 
Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji issued a warning in Tokyo: "The 
Taiwan issue is a very sensitive question between China and 
Japan. I believe the Japanese Government will observe the 
principle of the Sino-Japanese joint declaration and will never 
do anything that would hurt the feelings of the Chinese people." 
But how the future unfolds remains to be seen. 
  The sources also said: Because Li Teng-hui's "holiday 
diplomacy" came to the fore after Beijing took the initiative to 
give in and make it possible for the "Tang-Chiao meeting" to 
reach an understanding, the CPC finds itself in a state of 
attending to one thing while losing sight of another and feels 
that it has been misled by the "Tang-Chiao meeting." 
Furthermore, the three countries playing host to Li Teng-hui 
went so far as to go their own way and ignore Beijing's 
objection, which has deeply convinced the CPC authorities that 
they cannot change the predicament they are in if they fail to 
break "holiday diplomacy." Therefore, CPC authorities have 
instructed the relevant departments to work out a 
countermeasure. Some think tanks based in big cities, such as 
the Institute for International Strategic Studies, have recently 
recommended tactics for dealing with Li Teng-hui's "holiday 
diplomacy," including short-term and long-term actions. 
<H5>  Think Tanks Recommend Countermeasures </H5>
  The proposed short-term actions include the above-mentioned 
objections and cancellations of visits. 
  The long-term actions refer to the formulation of some 
proposals for dealing with Taiwan and Hong Kong [as published] 
and solving the problem thoroughly. 
  One of the proposals is to use military means to attain 
reunification. The provider of this proposal believes that 
Taiwan is a free trade zone with scarce resources and relies on 
importation for raw materials. Once a blockade is imposed at 
sea, Taiwan's economy will dry up within three months. The 
purpose of the blockade is to push Taiwan into talks with the 
mainland on reunification. If the talks are held when the 
blockade is imposed, the process of reunification can be greatly 
shortened. If this move is made after Hong Kong and Macao 
return to China, the reunification of the two sides may come 
true at the turn of century. Then one can say the 21th century 
will be the century of Chinese people! 
  The second proposal is: first economy, then politics; 
first nongovernmental contacts, then official contacts. 
The key point here is to create a situation in which Taiwan's 
economy depends on the mainland and its politics cannot avoid 
being swayed by it. 
  The third proposal is to take both political and 
military measures at the same time. That means 
strengthening dialogue in politics while looking for an 
opportunity in military sense (e.g. taking the island back if 
and when Taiwan declares independence). It is unwise to wait 
till the advanced weapons that the United States and France sell 
to Taiwan have arrived, otherwise it will be even more difficult. 
  Taiwan studies experts in Beijing pointed out: Though CPC 
authorities have so far adhered to the stand and principle of 
"one China, coexistence of two systems, high degree of autonomy, 
and peaceful reunification" on the Taiwan issue, they have never 
promised not to use force of arms. It is believed that the 
shock caused by Li Teng-hui's "holiday diplomacy" will spur the 
CPC to further review its new tactics for reunification. This 
is a noteworthy new development. Beijing, 2 March 1994

  [Text] Taipei, March 10 (CNA) -- The GATT working party 
screening Taiwan's membership application will postpone its 
fifth meeting from April to mid-May, Vice Economic Affairs 
Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said Thursday [10 March]. 
  "The change in meeting schedule is not expected to delay 
Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT)," Sheu noted. 
  Taiwan applied to join the Geneva-based world trade 
regulatory body in 1990 as a separate custom territory. The 
GATT working party has already met four times to discuss 
Taiwan's membership bid. 
  Sheu said as Taiwan has not yet completed bilateral trade 
consultations with many GATT contracting parties, the 
postponement of the working party's fifth meeting will not have 
an adverse impact on Taiwan's GATT admission. 
  Taiwan is scheduled to hold bilateral tariff-reduction talks 
with six GATT contracting parties -- South Africa, Australia, 
New Zealand, Hungary, Chile and Turkey -- in Geneva starting 
March 21. Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of 
Foreign Trade will act as chief negotiator for the talks.

  [Text] Taipei, March 11 (CNA) -- The Executive Yuan 
Thursday [10 March] introduced further amendments to the 
Wildlife Conservation Law which stipulate longer prison terms 
and heavier fines for violators. 
  After two days of debate, yuan members completed new 
amendments to the Wildlife Conservation Law which introduce 
tougher measures to crackdown on illegal trade in wildlife in 
Taiwan. 
  The amendments stipulate that those found guilty of hunting 
or killing protected wild animals face prison terms of up to 
five years and fines as high as NT [New Taiwan] $1 million 
(US$37,037). Repeat offenders face up to seven years in prison 
and fines up to NT$2.5 million (US$92,592). 
  Previously, prison terms for such violations ranged from six 
months to three years, and most sentences were commuted to small 
fines. 
  The amendments also stipulate that persons who abuse animals 
and display protected wildlife, either publicly or privately, 
will be fined NT$300,000 or sentenced to less than one year in 
jail. 
  Medicine shops which sell products labeled as containing 
endangered species preparations but actually containing legal 
substitutes also face fines of between NT$100,000 and 
NT$500,000, the draft said. 
  The amendments will be sent to the Legislative Yuan next 
week 
for approval. 
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that 
pressure from the United States Government to boost wildlife 
protection is mounting as US lawmakers and conservationists have 
become "impatient" and "disappointed" at Taiwan's efforts to 
crack down on illegal trade in rhino horn and tiger parts and 
the late enactment of an efficient Wildlife Protection Law. 
  Senator Jack Fields (R-Vt.) said Thursday in Washington that 
he and a number of other senators will soon send a letter to 
President Bill Clinton demanding trade sanctions against 
Mainland China, Taiwan and Korea for their illegal trade in 
endangered animals and products. 
  Fields said the letter will also ask Taiwan for cash 
donations to help preserve rhinoceroses and tigers. 
  President Clinton has until March 25 to decide whether to 
impose trade sanctions against Mainland China and Taiwan for 
illegal trade in rhino horn and tiger parts in violation of the 
international Convention of International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES).

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 11 (AFP)--Chinese Premier Li 
Peng's slip of the tongue that China, rather than Britain, was 
to blame for the breakdown in Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 
political future hit the local newspapers here Friday. 
  "Is it an innermost thought?" the independent 
Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao asked in a headline over a 
story reporting the gaffe made by the Chinese premier as he read 
his lengthy government work report. 
  Li corrected himself immediately, saying it was the British 
side that was to blame for the breakdown of the 17th round of 
Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's democratization process. The 
British colony reverts to China's rule in 1997. 
  Another Chinese-language newspaper, the Hong Kong Daily 
News, 
described Li's slip as "extremely intriguing," while the 
Taiwan-run United Daily News noted that Li did not apologize for 
his slip up. 
  However, his mistake elicited the briefest of smiles from 
the 
British ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, who attended the 
opening of the National People's Congress in Beijing Thursday. 
  McLaren, who headed the British team in the now broken-off 
negotiations with Beijing over Governor Chris Patten's electoral 
reforms, said later it was "a Freudian slip." Meanwhile, a Hong 
Kong government spokesman declined to comment, saying "it is 
inappropriate." The major Beijing-run newspapers Wen Wei Po and 
Ta Kung failed to report on Li's gaffe. 
  The talks collapsed in acrimony in November, and the Patten- 
backed reform package was introduced on Wednesday in the 
colony's Legislative Council. China threatened to sack the 
legislature, apparently resigned to the fact that there would be 
no cooperation with Britain on the transition to 1997.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by political </F>
editor Chip Tsao, in Australia; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Tsao] You have mentioned on many occasions the 
importance of implementing the Joint Declaration after 1997. 
China sees ruling Hong Kong after 1997 an internal, domestic 
issue. How can the Joint Declaration be secured by Britain 
after the transition in 1997? 
  [Patten] Nobody is arguing for an extension of sovereignty, 
nor extending British influence. It's very curious to suggest 
that fair elections are a way of extending British influence. 
Equally, it is a complete contradiction of the meaning of the 
Joint Declaration to say that Britain has no moral 
responsibility and no interest in Hong Kong after 1997. 
  First of all, until 2000, there will be meetings between the 
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) and Chinese officials about transition 
issues, and that is an agreement made with Britain and China. 
  Secondly, since the Joint Declaration is a treaty signed 
between Britain and China, Britain plainly has an interest in 
ensuring that it is properly implemented. It's a treaty lodged 
at the United Nations and also a treaty between Britain and 
China. We have a moral responsibility to ensure the freedoms 
and values of Hong Kong are maintained and will continue after 
1997. 
  It's a moral responsibility and a practical concern but I 
totally accept it doesn't involve any aspects of sovereign 
action. 
  [Tsao] But it is a declaration, not a treaty. It is called 
a declaration, not even an agreement. 
  [Patten] It is a recognised treaty lodged in the UN like 
other international treaties. China is obliged to abide by it. 
Equally, since we are the other name on the document, we have a 
continuing interest in it being implemented. 
  [Tsao] Can you define what you mean by continuing interest? 
Would it be regarded as a challenge to China's sovereignty over 
Hong Kong? China has its own glossary on the words and terms of 
the Joint Declaration, especially on words like "freedom" and 
"election." It is the basis of endless arguments between the 
two sides. 
  [Patten] We can't do anything which involves sovereign 
intervention in Hong Kong, but we certainly would, if we 
believed the Chinese were breaking their solemn undertaking of 
the Joint Declaration. We'll certainly raise it internationally. 
  For example, freedom of speech. There is no amount of re- 
interpretation which can turn freedom of speech into brutal 
intervention by Government in the affairs of newspapers or 
broadcasting organisations. If China means, by elections, 
arranging things so that you get the result you want, then China 
should say that. But "elections" in the Joint Declaration were 
never meant to imply that. Look at the debates that took place 
after the document (was signed) in which people talked about a 
steady development of representative government. 
  China can't go back on that now and make words which appear 
in the Joint Declaration have meaning which they have never 
borne. I'd prefer to believe China means to keep her word 
rather than speculate about arrangements that we'd need to 
follow if China wasn't keeping her word. 
  I believe China has given her word to Hong Kong, Britain, 
and 
the international community. But if it was apparent that China 
wasn't doing so, then I'm sure there are a number of options 
which would need to be followed by Britain. 
  [Tsao] During your trip to Australia, the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans was the only cabinet 
minister who expressed strong support publicly for your 
democracy package. Did you not see this as a disappointingly 
solitary voice when compared to the reaction you received after 
you announced the dem-ocracy package in 1992. 
  [Patten] I have said at the outset that I haven't travelled 
principally to Australia just to persuade Australians to throw 
their hats in the ring on the issue of political development. I 
am in Australia to encourage more people to do more business in 
Hong Kong and to give a reassurance to Australian businesses 
that are already in Hong Kong. 
  But, if you look at the support that we've had this week, it 
seems to me difficult to argue that (support) has been in any 
way diminished. I think every major Australian newspaper has 
had a leading article supporting what we've been doing (in Hong 
Kong). 
  We've had the support of every level of government, from the 
states as well as the federal government; from right across the 
political spectrum. I was giving evidence to the Foreign 
Affairs Joint Committee yesterday and the support, or the 
understanding [of the issues], is very considerable indeed. 
Hong Kong has good friends around the world and some of our 
best friends are in Australia. 
  [Tsao] Do you think that your Australian visit will be seen 
as an attempt to gather international support for your reforms? 
  [Patten] Intelligent, rational discussion isn't advanced by 
taking the frequently repeated propaganda of pro-Beijing 
newspapers, or of United Front activists, as representing the 
truth and a sensible view of the world. All this propaganda 
about internationalisation is ridiculous. 
  Every time anybody from Hong Kong travels abroad, those 
propaganda bugles play their tune about internationalisation. 
It's a very curious argument. Are we to believe that when 
Chinese officials go abroad and are asked about Hong Kong, they 
don't set out their views and thoughts about Hong Kong? Of 
course they do. 
  Given that, everywhere I've been, there's been a recognition 
that resolving successfully the argument between China and 
Britain is a matter for China and Britain. But equally, 
everywhere I've been and places I haven't been, people take an 
active interest in what happens in Hong Kong. They do it 
because Hong Kong is such a regional and global asset. Those 
are the realities. No amount of propaganda from the New China 
News Agency (Xinhua) or from the communist newspapers in Hong 
Kong is going to change that. 
  Sir Leon Brittan (Vice-President of the European 
Commission) is to visit China this month to express concerns 
that British business may suffer discrimination in trade with 
China because of the Hong Kong democracy debate. 
  Is it not likely an EU (European Union) consensus may be 
difficult to negotiate because Europe does not have a united 
position on this matter. 
  [Patten] First of all, it's not for me to talk about British 
trade with China. It's not one of my responsibilities. 
Secondly, Chinese officials keep on saying there is no 
relationship between politics and trade. I assume when they say 
that they mean it. 
  Were they to behave in a different way, it would have 
profound implications for the China-European Union Cooperation 
Agreement and it would have profound implications for China's 
application to join the GATT. 
  It would also have distorted some other arguments China is 
having around the world about trade issues. 
  I don't believe China will be well advised to ignore what 
the 
Chinese leader and other Chinese officials have said. [sentence 
as published] As for Sir Leon's visit, I know very little about 
that. The visit has been long planned. 
  [Tsao] You've spent more than 10 days in Australia, 
including a private holiday. Have you, since you left Hong 
Kong, being in a more relaxed mood, come to a firmer idea about 
when to table the rest of your bill and in what form? [Patten] 
Nothing I've thought or done in Australia during my leave has 
changed the decision about the legislative process made before I 
came. 
  We still want to return to the negotiating table with China. 
Realistically, that seems less and less a possibility. When the 
present bill is concluded, we'll have to move on to the last 
remaining legislative brick and place that in the wall. 
  That will depend on the timing of that and crucially, when 
the present bill emerges from the Legislative Council. 
[sentence as published] 
  It's worth noting the present bill has been in the 
Legislative Council [Legco] for nearly two and a half months and 
there are about four months until Legco rises for the summer 
recess. 
  There's a recognition that if we were able to get talks 
going 
again, we'd have to go into a more intensified form of 
negotiation -- like a week or two -- to sort things out during 
prolonged negotiations. I wish time was on our side, but it's 
not. 
  [Tsao] Although there is still no official response from 
China to your latest proposal on the airport project, some 
peripheral pro- Chinese voices have called for additional 
injections of funding, over and above the $6bn reportedly 
offered by the Hong Kong government to China. 
  There is plenty of money left in the government reserve. Why 
is the Government still so financially cautious given that the 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) requires that $25bn be left to 
the future special administrative region (SAR) government. 
  [Patten] We've put forward, in good conscience and with 
considerable sincerity, a financial package which appears to me 
to include all the points that China put to us last year. I 
hope China can react positively and quickly, but I don't think I 
can react to the reports of the so-called friends of China. 
  I just hope some of those socalled friends of China would be 
friends of Hong Kong. 
  [Tsao] You have encouraged Australian companies to compete 
in bidding for projects in the new airport plan. 
  You have also assured them there will be fair treatment from 
the government on assessments of tenders. 
  But China claims unofficially that some British companies 
have been given favourable treatment when contracts have been 
granted for the Chek Lap Kok project. 
  [Patten] That's, of course, a load of rubbish. Of the large 
projects, about 60 percent have been won by Japanese-led 
consortia. That paranoia should be put on one side. 
  [Tsao] Equally pressing is the issue of the Final Court of 
Appeal. Legco has reached a consensus on the agreement between 
the two governments. When will there be a resolution, so that a 
Final Court of Appeal, which is acceptable to Legco, will be put 
in place? 
  [Patten] We're working on draft legislation for the Final 
Court of Appeal. 
  We then have to put it to legislators. I hope they will take 
a swift decision. I don't think there is any chance of being 
able to renegotiate the settlement made in the JLG [Sino-British 
Joint Liaison Group]. 
  [Tsao] You've always said Legco's opinions should be 
listened to and respected, yet they clearly rejected this 
agreement. 
  [Patten] We'll have to see what they say when they're 
presented with the actual legislation. If Legco says we prefer 
no Court of Appeal rather than one which reflects the agreement 
then we'll have to take account of that. That's an obligation. 
  We've have no other alternative. The Legislative Council has 
the responsibility of legislating.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Chen Jinhua, minister 
in charge of the State Planning Commission, said here today that 
China's 1993 plan for national economic and social development 
was carried out satisfactorily. 
  "Various reforms designed for the establishment of a 
socialist market economy were proceeding in a planned way and 
have achieved substantial progress," Chen said. 
  The past year has seen the nation opening wider to the rest 
of the world and the national economy developing in a sustained, 
rapid and sound way with all-round social progress achieved, he 
said. 
  In a report he delivered at the ongoing session of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), or parliament, Chen reviewed 
China's implementation of last year's economic plan and set 
forth this year's growth targets. 
  The minister said the country's national economy developed 
at 
a rapid pace in 1993. 
  The country's gross domestic product (GDP) last year reached 
3,138 billion yuan, up 13.4 percent over the previous year and 
eight percent higher than the planned growth rate. 
  The year's GDP growth rate breaks down into four percent for 
the primary industry, 20.4 percent for the secondary industry, 
and 9.3 percent for the tertiary industry. 
  The rural economy saw overall growth last year, with the 
output of grain and oil bearing crops hitting an all-time high. 
  Last year, grain output reached 456.4 million tons, 13.8 
million tons more than in 1992 and 103.1 percent of the planned 
figure; and the output of oil bearing crops amounted to 17.61 
million tons, 1.2 million tons more than in 1992 and 106.7 
percent of the planned figure. 
  Township and village enterprises reported continued vigorous 
growth, and their development accelerated in the central and 
western regions of the country, he said. 
  The nation's industry produced a total added value of 1,414 
billion yuan, up 21.1 percent over the previous year. This 
growth rate breaks down into 22.2 percent for heavy industry and 
19.9 percent for light industry. 
  The output of major products continued to grow last year. 
During the year China produced 1.141 billion tons of coal, 144 
million tons of crude oil, 820 billion kwh of electricity, and 
88.68 million tons of steel. 
  In 1993 total investment in fixed assets nationwide was 
1182.9 billion yuan, 147.9 percent of the planned figure and up 
50.6 percent over the previous year. Allowing for price rises, 
the growth rate was 22 percent, he said. 
  There were big increases in investment for transport and 
telecommunications sectors, he said. 
  Economic, trade and technological exchanges with foreign 
countries continued to expand last year, he said. 
  The country's imports and exports reached 195.8 billion U.S. 
dollars in value, up 18.2 percent over 1992. Exports were worth 
91.8 billion U.S. dollars, up eight percent, and imports 104 
billion U.S. dollars, up 29 percent. 
  Use of foreign funds increased substantially last year, Chen 
said. The amount of foreign capital actually used during the 
year reached 36.77 billion U.S. dollars, up 91.5 percent over 
the previous year. Of this amount, 25.76 billion U.S. dollars 
was in the form of direct investment from foreign businesses, 
1.3 times the previous year's. Foreign loans actually used 
amounted to 10.8 billion U.S. dollars, up 36.5 percent. 
  "The pattern of investment by foreign businesses improved, 
with increased investment in long- and medium-term projects," he 
said. 
  "Investment from big overseas companies and financial groups 
increased. And the focus of investment is gradually shifting 
towards infrastructure and basic industries, and more 
investments are flowing to central and western China," Chen said. 
  In 1993 the total value of retail sales amounted to 1,223.7 
billion yuan, up 26.1 percent over the previous year, or 11.6 
percent after allowing for price rises. 
  Supplies of goods were "ample with a wide variety 
available." 
supplies of more than 90 percent of goods "match or exceed 
demand," he said. 
  He described the lives of the people as continually 
improving. During the year, per-capita income of urban residents 
averaged 2,337 yuan, up 10.2 percent over the previous year 
after taking inflation into account. Rural residents received a 
per-capita income of 921 yuan, up 3.2 percent over 1992 with 
inflation taken into account.

<F P=106> ["Law on the Protection of Investments of Taiwan Compatriots </F>
in the PRC"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- Law on the Protection of

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 10 (CNA) -- Taiwan is lagging behind 
many advanced countries in economic recovery, an economic 
planner said Thursday [10 March]. 
  K.C. Li, a department chief with the Council for Economic 
Planning and Development (CEPD), said Taiwan's index of leading 
economic indicators, which measures economic prospects three 
months ahead, rose a mere 1.6 percent in February, lower than 
America's 3.8 percent, Japan's 4.6 percent, Germany's 6.4 
percent, Britain's 9.2 percent and France's 2.8 percent. 
  The leading indices of the 12-member European Union [words 
indistinct] Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development surged 6.5 percent and 4.9 percent respectively in 
February, Li reported. 
  "All these figures show that the Taiwan economy is not 
recovering as fast as industrialized countries," Li noted. 
  He said one major reason behind Taiwan's slow recovery is 
that local enterprises still hesitate to make new investments. 
  Li pointed out that although a government economic forecast 
released earlier this year optimistically predicted that private 
investment would grow 13 percent in 1994, machinery imports 
declined 0.9 percent in the January-February period as compared 
with the year-earlier level. Machinery imports are used to 
gauge a country's investment activity. 
  Li said relatively high interest rates have undermined 
investment willingness here. Taiwan's prime lending rate now 
stands at 7.75 percent, 2 to 3 percent higher than that in many 
other countries. 
  Difficulties in land acquisition have also discouraged 
investment, Li said. According to a recent CEPD survey, 758 
private companies have been forced to shelve their investment 
plans since last August because of difficulties in acquiring 
needed factory land. 
  As part of its effort to encourage private investment, Li 
said, the government has decided to release at least 2,382 
hectares of industrial land in the near future for local 
manufacturers to house their new plants. 
  Li added he remains cautiously optimistic about Taiwan's 
economic prospects for the year. Global trade is expected to 
grow 5.4 percent this year, higher than 1993's 2.6 percent 
growth. "This is good news for Taiwan's export-oriented 
economy," Li observed. 
  He further said the New Taiwan [NT] dollar depreciated by an 
average of 6.36 percent against the US dollar, the Japanese yen 
and the Deutsche mark in the past few months. The NT dollar is 
expected to remain weak in the months ahead and this will help 
boost Taiwan's export competitiveness, he added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Public figures at 
various levels here today voiced their strong criticisms 
following Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's tabling of his 
remaining political reform package to the Legislative Council on 
Wednesday [9 March]. 
  They saw the action taken by the British Hong Kong 
authorities as a further step to deliberately sabotage the 
Sino-British cooperation over the Hong Kong issue. They urged 
local residents to make concerted efforts with the Chinese side 
to ensure a smooth transition of the territory in 1997. 
  Chris Patten's remaining political reform package regarding 
the 1994-1995 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong was tabled to 
the Legislative Council yesterday afternoon. The first part of 
his reform bill was introduced last December. 
  Both parts of Chris Patten's so-called democracy reform bill 
were tabled under the circumstance where no agreement was 
reached between China and Britain despite the fact that the 
Chinese side had made its utmost efforts in the past 17 rounds 
of the Sino-British talks over the Hong Kong issue. 
  The Chinese side has repeatedly warned that any unilateral 
action taken by the British side in this aspect before an 
agreement is reached between the two sides is in gross violation 
of the joint declaration, the Basic Law as well as the 
agreements and understandings reached between the two countries. 
  Wong Siu-yee, a local member of the Urban Council, said that 
the real intention of the British side by unilaterally tabling 
Patten's reform bill was to continue the British influence over 
the territory, which it took away from China by armed forces in 
the late 19th century, after it is returned to China in 1997. 
  Another local public figure, Rita Fan, said that the British 
side claimed, on the one hand, that the door for the 
Sino-British talks was open, while, on the other hand, it had 
slammed the door by taking unilateral actions. 
  Fan, a female member of the Preliminary Working Committee, 
said that one can not entirely depend on the cooperation of the 
British side in the other fields as Britain has taken an 
uncooperative attitude towards the political issues. 
  Wong Siu-lun, a professor from the Sociology Department of 
Hong Kong University, said that under the situation in which the 
basis of the Sino-British cooperation over the Hong Kong issue 
has been ruined by the British side, the Chinese side should 
work closely with the local residents and be prepared for the 
long-term development of the future special administrative 
region.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor, and Shiny Li in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji's tax reform 
program has suffered a major setback as opposition forces have 
succeeded in partly stretching the timetable of the ambitious 
policy under the excuse of maintaining social stability. 
  State-run large and medium-sized enterprises were given 
preferential treatment by having the rate for unified corporate 
tax reduced, while the most controversial value added tax (VAT) 
on land and property was expected to be delayed, Chinese sources 
said. The unified corporate tax introduced at the beginning of 
this year stipulates that all firms in China should contribute 
33 percent of their earnings to the state coffers without any 
exception. The state regulations on the implementation of value 
added tax on land and property is scheduled to be published next 
month. 
  However, the most controversial tax reform package in more 
than four decades of the communist rule in China has met strong 
opposition from the central planners and the business community, 
especially business people from the fastgrowing southeast 
regions. Chinese sources said both central planners and 
reformist regional officials joined hands to block the reform, 
although they stood on quite a different ground. 
  In his government work report presented to the second 
plenary 
session of the Eighth National People's Congress yesterday, 
Premier Li Peng apparently sidestepped the implementation of the 
reform policy and failed to report on the timetable to introduce 
the VAT on land and property sales. Mr Li mentioned that the 
government was to introduce the tax reform package, but failed 
to detail implementation of the fundamental restructuring 
program in China. The government would "reform the tax system, 
institute a turnover tax with value added tax as the main 
component, introduce a uniform income tax on domestically funded 
enterprises," Mr Li said in the report. This was the only 
account on the tax reform. 
  "Mr Li apparently gave himself room for amending the reform 
package and adjust the timetable for implementation," a Chinese 
economist said. 
  Obviously due to the pressures from the coastal regions, 
especially the special economic zones and coastal open cities in 
which foreign-funded firms have been enjoying tax exemption and 
holidays, Mr Li applied the uniform corporate tax only to 
domestic firms. Initially, the uniform corporate tax would 
apply to all firms no matter what status they enjoyed. 
  Central planners represented by Mr Li and his deputy and 
former planning minister Zou Jiahua wanted to give state-run 
firms better treatment, such as a lower tax rate or holiday, 
while coastal officials hoped to keep their preferential status 
to woo overseas investors, China analysts said. Despite having 
different targets in mind, both camps joined hands to block the 
reform package. Chinese sources said central planners had 
worked out measures to reduce tax rates for loss-running state 
firms. 
  Late last month, a central document jointly issued by State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economy and the State Planning 
Commission said some state firms with poorer performance or 
lower profits would be given a lower rate of 27 and 18 percent 
in the corporate tax. This would be within a two-year period as 
a transitional measure to the 33 percent uniform corporate tax. 
Some enterprises would have tax rebate for those reduced tax 
payment until the end of 1993, if they obtained approval by 
governments at the provincial level and were examined by the 
Finance Ministry and State Administration for Taxation. For the 
sake of supporting old state-run industries, the document said 
they would not be asked to submit after-tax profits, provided 
the central department approved. 
  The document also rolled back a reform policy on investment 
to allow direct investment in enterprises by the government. 
"Central and regional governments would inject more capital 
into those firms listed by allowing financial injection by the 
government instead of loans from banks in a move to increase the 
firm's capital," Chinese sources quoted the document as saying. 
  However, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli yesterday sidestepped 
rumours that Beijing was to delay the VAT on land and property. 
"I have not learnt such a message so far," Mr Liu said. 
"However, all regulations and decrees issued by the State 
Council should be implemented. The state regulation on the 
implementation of value added tax is being worked out now," he 
said. Mr Liu's remark apparently confirmed the implementation 
of the policy, originally scheduled for the beginning of next 
month, would very likely be delayed.

  [Text] China will tighten macro-level control over the 
economy to ensure a "stable environment" for its bold drive for 
a socialist market economy, according to a report by State 
Planning Commission (SPC) Minister Chen Jinhua. The report on 
economic and social development, to be tabled by Mr Chen at the 
National People's Congress (NPC) this morning, laid down a 
detailed strategy to introduce macro-level adjustment and 
control over the economy through economic and legal tools, as 
well as "the requisite state fiats". 
  The preservation of social stability is a must in the 
process 
of further seeking economic growth and pushing forward the 
reform programme for a market economy, Mr Chen said in his 
29-page report. "Nothing can start without a stable social 
environment," he said. Adjustment and control over the economy 
must be strengthened and further improved to ensure targets of 
economic and social development for 1994 will be realised, said 
Mr Chen. 
  The major targets listed by Mr Chen included: 
  -- GNP growth rate of nine percent. 
  -- Total fixed asset investment of 1,300 billion yuan 
(HK$1,154 billion) for 1994. 
  -- A deficit forecast of 66.9 billion yuan. Together with 
domestic and foreign debts and loans, total debts will reach 
129.2 billion yuan this year. 
  -- A ceiling of 470 billion yuan for new bank credit. 
  -- A total value of imports and exports of US$200 billion 
(HK$1,544 billion). Imports of US$100 billion and exports of 
US$ 100 billion. 
  -- An increase in retail prices will be kept within 10 
percent. 
  Speaking yesterday, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli explained 
that the total estimated deficit was much higher as a result of 
the introduction of a new budget auditing system in order to 
keep inline with international practice. He put the estimate of 
deficit at about 30 billion yuan based on last year's accounting 
method which is significantly higher than the 20.5 billion yuan 
deficit last year. The country's financial situation, described 
by Mr Liu as "severe" in his budget, will also be reported on at 
today's NPC session. 
  The macro-adjustment and control was to "mutually 
coordinate" 
and "harmonise" with the need to maintain "reform development 
and stability". Although "development is the rigorous test of 
reason", the SPC head said the pursuit of development should 
have "new ideas". The crux is to focus on optimising economic 
structure, speed up technological improvement, strengthen 
management and boost efficiency," he said. "Only by doing this 
can development help create a better economic environment for re 
form and be beneficial to social stability." Mr Chen maintained 
that the enforcement of major fiscal, taxation, investment, 
foreign trade and enterprise reforms should be closely 
monitored. Any new problems should be solved promptly, he said. 
All regions and departments should make efforts to contain 
inflation by co-ordinating all economic and legal tools and the 
necessary administrative measures, he said. 
  The senior official, seen as a close ally of Vice-Premier 
Zhu 
Rongji, indicated that the major task of macro-adjustment and 
control was to balance the overall supply and demand. The task 
must begin with strict control over fixed assets investment, he 
said. In addition to the ban on fixed assets projects, Mr Chen 
ordered banks at all levels to strictly follow the loan plan for 
such projects. Inter-bank loans should be scrutinised and any 
illegal raising of funds should not be allowed to revive, the 
official said. The focus of real estate should be placed in 
co-ordination with the Government's housing reform, he said, 
warning against any move to expand capital investment under the 
disguise of building more residential flats. 
  Mr Chen revealed that the SPC and relevant departments and 
regions would tighten up supervision over the planning of 
projects of some special "popular products and projects". This, 
he maintained, will avoid blind and repetitive construction 
plans and maximise the use of resources. On the demand side, Mr 
Chen has vowed to strictly control the growth of the level of 
wages. Unregulated payment of bonus and subsidies will be 
stopped, he said. The central Government would also promote 
frugality and resolutely oppose the prevailing phenomenon of 
extravagance, he said. Mr Chen said the central bank would be 
strengthened to control on the growth of money supply and 
credit. The revamp of the fiscal order will continue, he added. 
  In the face of the high inflation last year, the SPC chief 
admitted that the inflationary pressure this year remained 
strong, citing plans to readjust the prices of daily necessities 
including energy, grain and cotton. A series of measures have 
to be taken to ensure price rises are being kept at an 
acceptable level. These included the increase of supply by 
boosting the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, sugar and 
meat; cracking-down against illicit raising of prices; and the 
establishment of a comprehensive supervisory and controlling 
mechanism on prices. 
  Mr Chen disclosed that the State Council had decided to 
launch two nationwide inspection on prices in the first and 
second halves of this year to crack down on price hoarding and 
activities that disrupt market order.

  [Text] A top government think tank has expressed fears 
that the country might not be able to keep annual growth to the 
target of nine percent which would worsen inflation, already 
showing signs of upsurge in the past few months. 
  Director of the State Council's Development Research Centre 
Professor Sun Shangqing said the annual rate of economic growth 
this year might go beyond 10 percent following double-digit 
growth in the past two years. Last year's economic growth was 
13.4 percent but Premier Li set a target of a nine percent 
growth rate for 1994. 
  Professor Sun, seen as a close adviser to Vice-Premier Zhu 
Rongji, stressed that the growth rate of nine to 10 percent was 
appropriate, adding that this was already a "very fast" pace. 
"If we fail to control the growth of fixed-assets in vestment 
the economy will over heat again, causing inflation," he said. 
"This is detrimental to the investment environment and the 
livelihood of the people." 
  In addition to capital investment the head of the top think 
tank indicated that price reforms this year would further push 
up prices. But he stressed that inflation was inevitable in the 
transitional period from a planned economy to a market economy. 
"Inflation is acceptable as long as it is within the limits 
that the public can bear. I'm always against inflation. But 
inflation at a transitional period is inevitable. That does not 
mean I support it," said the professor. 
  Professor Sun said the central Government's huge deficit 
would also make an impact on inflation. "That's why our major 
task this year is to strictly control expenditure while boosting 
revenue. "Of course, there will be dissenting views. But 
[everybody] has to put the general good above his own 
interests," he said. Although some regions wanted a faster pace 
of growth, Professor Sun said any moves to pursue an 
unrealistically fast growth rate that was not suited to the 
regions' capabilities would be prohibited under the macro- 
control and adjustment drive. "We hope that delegates can come 
to a consensus and make collective efforts to keep total 
fixed-assets investment this year to 1,300 billion yuan 
(HK$1,154.4 billion)," said the director. 
  Professor Sun also defended the need to stress the vital 
significance of maintaining stability this year, saying that 
this was the "pre condition" for development. "We did not talk 
a lot about stability last year because the situation was 
different. We already had a 13.4 percent rate of growth last 
year. Maintaining social stability is in the interest of all 
the people," he said. 
  Professor Sun denied suggestions that the country was 
already 
in danger of stagnation despite a surge of prices in the first 
two months of this year. "The most important thing is that 
people from all walks of life are aware of the fact that our 
pace of growth has already been too high. We should now pay 
greater attention to improving efficiency," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Chiang Che-wen (3068 0772 2429): "Zhu Rongji </F>
Braves Wind and Waves, and Jiang Zemin Invites Party Organ 
Officials to a Banquet for a Special Purpose"] 
  [Text] Reiterate Reason for Controlling Total Credit 
  With 1993 just ending, the CPC hierarchy has begun to feel 
unprecedented pressure on the issue of stability. Around the 
Lunar New Year, prices of basic necessities including grain, 
edible oil, and so on rose and fluctuated by 20 to 30 percent in 
various localities across the country, which elicited 
pessimistic sentiments about the economic prospects for 1994 and 
a premonition of uneasiness among mainland people. The 
phenomenon of panic purchasing, which has seldom been seen in 
recent years, suddenly emerged again. Given the emergency 
measures adopted by the CPC hierarchy and the temporary 
stability of commodity prices, the dark economic shadow cast on 
people's minds by the earlier fluctuations cannot be removed. 
  Moreover, the "Decisions Concerning Several Issues on the 
Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted 
by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
last year were partially put into practice at the start of this 
year. However, mainland people are still unfamiliar with most of 
the contents of the "Decisions." In various localities, people 
were resentful or felt puzzled to varying degrees about the 
policies made according to the "Decisions." Some local 
officials in the economically developed regions or provinces are 
dissatisfied with the value-added tax and revenue-sharing 
systems and think that these policies, which are aimed at 
intensifying the controlling ability of the central authorities 
and weakening the financial powers and resources of localities, 
will substantially retard their economic development speed. In 
many areas, people once again started an investment craze by 
taking the opportunity of relaxed macroeconomic regulation and 
control by the central authorities to seek more loans to expand 
local economic development, which has intensified inflationary 
pressures on the mainland considerably. 
  Furthermore, millions of workers and staff members 
throughout 
the country who work in large and medium state enterprises, 
two-thirds of which are bogged down in the predicament of open 
or hidden losses, feel uneasy and greatly dissatisfied in the 
face of soaring prices. Since the end of last year, social 
security conditions on the mainland have deteriorated again, 
with the proportion of serious cases increasing and the 
phenomena of organized crime worsening.... 
  The CPC hierarchy is very worried about the above situation. 
For this reason, while stressing the importance of intensifying 
social security, cracking down on various criminal activities, 
stabilizing commodity prices, and properly arranging the masses' 
lives, it recently decided to reiterate those policies and 
measures practiced by the central government since last June to 
stabilize the economy, rectify the monetary order, strictly 
control the total amount of credit, reinforce supervision and 
management of finance, and intensify central macroeconomic 
regulation and control. In addition, it particularly stressed 
the need to "continue exercising strict management by mandatory 
planning in granting loans for investment in fixed assets." 
<H5>  The CPC Recently Put Forth a "20-Character Principle" </H5>
  Additionally, the CPC hierarchy also held an unprecedentedly 
large-scale national propaganda and ideological work meeting in 
the second half of January to make "work arrangements" for 
controlling social opinion and preventing the media from 
engendering social disturbances. 
  It is thus obvious that the work focus of the CPC hierarchy 
has now been put entirely on "stability." The guiding policy 
ideology of "accelerating both reform and development" has 
faded. Apart from retaining the former wording of "sustained, 
rapid, and healthy" economic development, it has lately put 
forth a "20-character principle:" "Seize the opportunity, 
deepen reform, open the door wider, promote development, and 
maintain stability." This is the overall requirement for work 
this year, so various tasks should be carried out to serve and 
meet this requirement. Meanwhile, authoritative personalities 
in economic circles feel that basic stability should be 
maintained in five areas--prices, speed, agriculture, money, and 
society. 
  Since the second half of last year, Zhu Rongji, State 
Council 
vice premier and concurrently president of the People's Bank of 
China, has been widely criticized and complained about by local 
officials because of the measures he adopted to stabilize the 
economy and intensify central macroeconomic regulation and 
control. However, he has broken silence and become very active 
recently, and his position and views have been highlighted again. 
  Models of Decentralization and Centralization 
Originated From Third Plenary Session 
  Within the CPC hierarchy, there is generally no divergence 
of 
views on the issue of "whether or not the central capability in 
macroeconomic regulation and control should be augmented and 
whether or not the central committee should have powerful 
authority." The CPC hierarchy has been deeply worried about 
this issue over the past few years. During the last 10 years or 
so, every upsurge of economic development on the mainland has 
been generated from the practice of various policies and 
measures to repeatedly decentralize or delegate power to the 
lower levels, and every standstill or slowdown in economic 
reform and development has been caused by centralizing or 
withdrawing power from the lower levels. As a matter of fact, 
all such moves, decentralization, centralization, and the 
delegation or withdrawal of power, no matter how they are looked 
upon, comprise the basic content of reforms, anti-reforms, 
development, and stagnation on the mainland over the past 10 
years or so. The problem is: the centralization, 
decentralization, and the withdrawal and delegation of power 
were all carried out under the precondition that the political 
and economic structures generally remained unchanged, so that 
decentralization and the delegation of power to the lower levels 
became a special means to mitigate crises in the old structures 
and to display their structural functions, while centralization 
and the withdrawal of power became an act of intensifying and 
supporting the old structure by amassing achievements scored 
through decentralization and the delegation of power to the 
lower levels. The "mutually complementary" effect which was 
unexpectedly obtained from these two opposite and contradictory 
actions in the old structure caused interest groups in the CPC 
and its administrative officials at various levels to expand. 
This has enabled them to form "common interests" on a greater 
scale and caused their motive of relying on the old structure to 
gain more interests through decentralization. As a result, the 
old structure has been able to maintain its existence for a long 
period of time. 
  However, within the original structural framework of 
decentralization, centralization, and the delegation and 
withdrawal of powers, the mainland's economic development has 
been unable to avoid and overcome the malpractice of big 
fluctuations, haphazard expansion, and rigid uniformity. The 
major development of factors of a market economy obtained from 
the decentralization of power cannot be transformed into any 
wealth in the old structure through the centralization and 
withdrawal of power from the lower levels, nor can it continue 
to form factors for healthy economic development under the model 
of decentralization and the delegation of powers to the lower 
levels. Therefore, a model of combined decentralization and 
centralization emerged in the "Decisions" passed by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Starting 
from the overall transformation of the economic structure, the 
CPC attempted to create and provide a brand new structural 
framework for the mainland's economic development. Under this 
framework, a modern enterprise system would be instituted as a 
supporting point, which would be propped up by a market system, 
taxation, finance, state macroeconomic regulation and control, 
and a social insurance system; the administrative division of 
power would be determined by the scale of assets comprising the 
market; and a new power structure would be established under the 
conditions of a market economy. 
<H5>  Zhu Rongji Braves Wind and Waves </H5>
  Therefore, when we assess economic reform on the mainland 
today, we can no longer use criteria such as whether it is 
decentralization, centralization, and the delegation and 
withdrawal of powers. Instead, we should have our eyes on 
whether or not it is beneficial to fostering the main body of 
activities in a market economy and effectively allocates 
resources in accordance with the laws governing the market 
economy. Judging from these new criteria, the decentralization 
and delegation of power to the lower levels is not necessarily 
tantamount to reform, and the centralization and withdrawal of 
power from the lower levels is not necessarily tantamount to 
anti-reform either. In fact, the withdrawal of powers in 
unrestrained and arbitrary fund-raising, the arbitrary 
establishment of projects, and arbitrary investments, which 
concentrates energy on several infrastructure facilities which 
have a significant bearing on the national economy and the 
people's livelihood, may even be more conducive to the 
establishment of a market economy structure. Of course, powers 
withdrawn from the lower levels should not be held in the hands 
of the relevant government departments as they were in the past 
under the planned economy. Rather, they should be concentrated 
in the hands of enterprise organizations which are responsible 
for activities, such as state investment and development banks, 
and so on. In short, it will not do to follow the beaten track 
of seeking interests through the decentralization of powers on 
the strength of the old structure to spur economic development. 
However, the complexity of the issue lies in the fact that, 
under the situation where the current market economy system on 
the mainland is unsolid and the institutions of the market 
economy are relatively weak, in order to achieve comparatively 
rapid economic growth, the administrative decentralization of 
power is still regarded by most provinces, cities, and 
localities as the only effective measure to choose. Therefore, 
since the second half of last year, Zhu Rongji has adopted a 
series of policies to rectify the monetary order and intensify 
macroeconomic regulation and control. As he has totally blocked 
financial resources obtained by localities before, he was 
universally criticized and resented. Moreover, the new taxation 
system proposed in the "Decisions" has also considerably reduced 
the local revenues of many localities. This evoked the 
dissatisfaction of local governments even more intensely so that 
Zhu Rongji was condemned for "taking the old path of the planned 
economy" and "retrogressing in reform." 
  At present, government departments in various localities 
are still the principal planners and organizers of local 
economic activities, and are still handicapped by the 
"decentralization of powers is equal to reform" model. They do 
not understand very well the complete series of new measures for 
the establishment of a market economic structure put forward in 
the "Decisions," and, therefore, are not very enthusiastic about 
the above policies. At present, when the CPC hierarchy is 
reiterating such measures as "continuing to rectify the monetary 
order and reinforcing management of investment in fixed assets 
by mandatory planning," they inevitably sharpen conflicts 
between the central and local authorities, and Zhu Rongji is 
precisely braving the wind and waves in these conflicts. If 
conflict continues to grow, economic and political turbulence on 
the mainland is unavoidable, and the person running the greatest 
risk is none other than Zhu Rongji. 
<H3>  CPC Bedeviled by Large Numbers of Unemployed Personnel in 
State-Owned Enterprises </H3>
  Increased inflationary pressure is regarded by the CPC 
hierarchy as the most important factor affecting stability, and 
several dozen million staff and workers in the vast number of 
state-owned enterprises on the mainland are the people who are 
most seriously victimized by inflation. Because two-thirds of 
state-owned enterprises have had production suspended or 
semi-suspended due to known or hidden losses, the vast number of 
staff and workers are in low spirits and resentful as they have 
lost wage income and have found no way of becoming rich, thus 
becoming the most unstable social force in mainland society at 
present. Since the CPC's rectification of the monetary order 
and the intensification of macroeconomic regulation and control 
last year, loss-making enterprises and the vast number of 
workers in them were the first to be adversely affected. The 
shortage of circulating funds has caused more than half of the 
mainland's large and medium state enterprises to land in the 
predicament of being tied up by enormous "debt chains" amounting 
to 370 billion yuan, and several dozen million enterprise staff 
and workers are receiving less than a half of their original 
wages to live on. With the price surges facing the mainland at 
present, staff and workers in these enterprises are almost 
unable to support their families. The CPC hierarchy is worried 
about inflation, but in fact it is worried that workers from 
these loss-making enterprise workers in the cities may take to 
the streets to create trouble. If workers adopt an antagonistic 
attitude toward the government, this will become one of the most 
acute contradictions on the mainland now. 
<H3>  Corruption Deepens Misunderstanding Between Officials, 
Civilians </H3>
  Naturally, economic problems should be resolved through 
economic measures. However, under the present circumstances 
where there are still no effective policies to resolve economic 
contradictions rapidly, the use of political means is 
indispensable. However, it is precisely in this aspect that 
many measures adopted by the CPC hierarchy have been barely 
satisfactory. Since the second half of last year, various 
fields of endeavor, including the anticorruption campaign, 
controls on the press, emphasis on building spiritual 
civilization, the crack down on criminal activities in society, 
and so on have all been political measures taken by the CPC to 
coordinate with stabilizing the economy and eliminating unstable 
social factors. Judging from their current actual effects, 
however, these political measures have not had marked results. 
This is manifested by the lack of good relations of mutual 
trust, understanding, and support between the government and the 
people like in the past. For this reason, the government is 
bent on preventing the people from "creating trouble," and the 
people regard government cadres as "corrupt officials" who are 
"degenerate and incompetent," "imperious and despotic," and 
"scrambling for power and profit." There are a lot of barriers 
between officials and civilians but very few channels for 
straightening out misunderstandings between them, with 
grievances constantly accumulating and their removal becoming 
increasingly difeels deeply that it has limited advantageous 
resources to tap and exploit while using political means to 
alleviate contradictions in economic development. 
  One of the barriers between mainland officials and civilians 
is the corruption among quite a number of officials. Although 
the CPC hierarchy has conducted an anticorruption campaign on a 
grand scale since the second half of last year, and has really 
exposed and handled a number of cases involving government 
officials who took bribes and perverted the law, it has failed 
to win more faith and understanding from the masses. This is 
due to a lack of transparency in the course of handling cases. 
As the results are not publicized (in most cases), and 
adjudication according to the law is not strictly conducted, the 
way cases are handled has been castigated by the public. People 
ask: "How many cases involving corrupt acts by officials have 
there been after all? How senior are the officials involved in 
corrupt deals? How many option struggle should be waged, but a 
certain yardstick should be applied to avoid causing harmful 
social effects which indicate `the overall decay of the 
Communist Party and its cadres.'" 
  These stipulations did not come up to the masses' 
expectations of the anticorruption struggle, so they have not 
won more understanding, trust, and support from the masses. 
This being the case, the reform propositions and programs 
introduced by the CPC and its appeal to the masses to maintain 
social stability do not have adequate basic social conditions, 
and its call on the masses to participate in the building of 
spiritual civilization has become a mere formality of making 
empty talk. 
<H3>  Officials, Civilians Have No Channels for Mutual 
Understanding, Exchanging Views </H3>
  Another barrier between officials and civilians is the lack 
of channels for mutual understanding and the exchange of views. 
The mainland's press and propaganda media are under direct 
official control so they can only "give lectures," "instill the 
party's views," and "provide guidance" to the masses; more often 
than not, the "reflection of the people's voices" is restricted 
to giving support and endorsement to the policy decisions of the 
ruling party and government, while the substantial volume of 
divergent voices and views from the masses representing 
different interest groups are rejected. Officials and civilians 
cannot exchange views and reach consensus through the public 
opinion media, hence the masses can only build up an opinion 
atmosphere centering around matters with which they are 
concerned in a covert sphere, which runs counter to the opinions 
of the ruling party and government. Then, the authorities only 
conduct "self-propaganda and self-performance" without any 
audience or spectators in a public arena for public opinion. In 
this way, they have lost an effective means to eliminate 
unstable social factors in a timely manner. 
  As viewed from the mainland's political structure, the 
organizations of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] and so-called "multi-party cooperation" are 
at most a number of "CPPCC branches" of the ruling party. They 
have no unique political program, sound organizational system, 
and political function of running for elections, voting, and 
directly engaging in administrative affairs. The composition of 
aging personalities has long lost its ability to "participate in 
the deliberation and administration of state affairs," and the 
social strata they previously represented have been unable to 
conduct an effective flow of political views with the ruling 
party through them. As for the people's congress being the 
"fundamental political system" directly controlled and "led" by 
the ruling party, the election of deputies is subject to strict 
official selection. Hence, deputies do not represent the 
electorate, and the level of their participation in the 
deliberation and administration of state affairs is low. At 
ordinary times, they can "keep in step with the central 
authorities," but when a major political event takes place, they 
can simply do nothing. Around the time of the 4 June incident 
in Beijing in 1989, the insignificance and impotence of the 
people's congress system fully proved that it could not be a 
political organization capable of ensuring social stability on 
the mainland, and that the people's will cannot really form 
harmonious unity with that of the ruling party through this 
organization. 
<H3>  Politburo Standing Committee Broke Rule To Fete Party Organ 
Officials </H3>
  To sum up, the only measure the CPC hierarchy can choose to 
surmount the predicament of social instability encountered by 
the mainland's economy and development at present is to mobilize 
all traditional means to strive to "provide against possible 
trouble." A source on familiar terms with the CPC hierarchy 
disclosed a few days ago that the phrase, "birds startled by the 
mere twang of a bow-string," is the most accurate expression 
used to describe the general mood of the mainland people and 
senior personalities in the CPC. In the case of the people, the 
"frightened birds" are worried about inflation and price surges 
this year, and the "frightened birds" among senior CPC 
personalities fear that the masses will stir up large-scale 
turmoil and social unrest. Against this background, the CPC 
hierarchy recently decided to continue practicing the policy of 
"rectifying the monetary order and stabilizing the economy" 
introduced in the second half of last year, appropriately slow 
down the pace of large-scale economic structural reform, curb 
ever-expanding investment in fixed assets, conduct some basic 
work and break through monetary structural reform first, and, at 
the same time, allocate large amounts of funds to properly 
arrange the lives of staff and workers in urban loss-making 
state enterprises so that they can have a happy Spring Festival. 
  At the national propaganda and ideological work meeting held 
in the second half of January, the CPC hierarchy promulgated 
various policies to control media opinion, intensify the 
management of the cultural market, and called for press circle 
to "closely center around the themes and avoid making noises, 
engaging in controversies, or committing mistakes to do a good 
job of maintaining social stability." Before the above 
meeting began, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee specially summoned the leading cadres 
from RENMIN RIBAO for a talk, and broke the rules by laying on a 
banquet for them. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin greeted them 
by cupping one hand in the other and saying: "Would you be kind 
enough to do propaganda work well this year? When public 
opinion work is properly performed, we can set our minds at ease 
in resolving reform and development issues. This is what the 
central authorities are most concerned about and have heeded 
seriously." This remark is regarded as "words uttered at a 
moment of desperation." 
  According to the latest analysis by a mainland economist, 
the 
CPC hierarchy is now caught in a dilemma: The economy must be 
stabilized at the expense of the growth rate, which will evoke 
universal dissatisfaction from local government officials and 
which will affect the CPC's authority. However, the 
encouragement of growth and the relaxation of macroeconomic 
regulation and control will trigger off higher inflation, 
thereby infringing upon the people's immediate interests and 
engendering social unrest. To tackle this dilemma, the CPC 
hierarchy lacks advantageous political capital to handle various 
contradictions, so it can only intensify the functions of the 
traditional political structure. As a result, the contradiction 
where political structural reform lags behind economic 
structural reform will become ever more conspicuous. In this 
regard, people should not be blindly optimistic about the 
situation on the mainland this year.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "China Plunges Into World Economy"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- China has entered into 
a new stage of its economic development by adopting 
international practices following 15 years of opening-up and 
reform. 
  Historic changes have taken place in China's economy since 
its opening to the outside world. The country now ranks 11th in 
the world, making up two percent of the world's total trade 
volume. But 15 year ago it followed 31 other countries, 
accounting for no more than one percent of the world's total 
trade volume. 
  China's imports and exports hit 195.8 billion U.S. Dollars 
last year, five times over the 1978 figure. They now occupy 
about one-third of the country's gross national product (GNP) 
and one-fifth of the country's GNP comes from its exports. 
  To standardize its trade regulations in line with 
international practice, China has sped up foreign trade reforms. 
  Now licence is required on only 138 varieties of commodities 
before they can be exported, 52 percent less than the figure for 
1978. At present all but 16 varieties of special exports can be 
freely exported. 
  As for imports, China has lowered its import tariffs twice 
following its elimination of the import adjustment tax. The 
tariff rate is now 7.3 percent lower than that of 1978. 
  China is also learning from foreign countries' experience in 
economic, financial and business management. A shareholding 
system is being established in its state-run enterprises. A 
financial system in the framework of the central bank, 
specialized banks and commercial banks is also being built in 
the country. Price reforms are continued for the establishment 
of a unified and open market system. 
  The unified exchange rate system China has adopted since 
January this year is helping the country to achieve even more in 
its opening-up to the outside world. 
  China has made itself an ideal place for foreign investment 
through opening up its huge potential market and implementing 
international practices. 
  China has so far drawn foreign investment from more than 100 
countries and regions. Six percent of the country's total 
industrial output value comes from its foreign-venture 
enterprises, and their imports and exports make up more than 
one-quarter of the country's total imports and exports. 
  By the end of 1993, 167,500 foreign investment enterprises 
had registered for operation in China. Moreover, foreign 
investment now ranges from finance, real estate and insurance to 
retail sales, foreign trade and business information services. 
  China has encouraged its enterprises to compete with foreign 
enterprises overseas. Some Chinese enterprises have set up 
branch ventures in foreign countries, bought foreign 
enterprises, partaken of shareholding in foreign enterprises and 
issued stocks abroad. 
  By June 1993, China had set up 4,453 enterprises with a 
total 
investment of more than five billion U.S. dollars in other 
countries and regions. Meanwhile, contract labor service 
cooperation has been expanded to more than 160 countries and 
regions. 
  So far, China has opened to the outside world a total of 
500,000 square kilometers of its area, including 339 cities and 
counties with a total population of 320 million.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "New Reform Measures for Profit and </F>
Tax Distribution in State-Owned Enterprises Will Be Adopted To 
Make It More In Line With International Practice"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (TA KUNG PAO)--Recently, the State 
Council announced a series of reform measures to regulate the 
profit distribution relations between the government and 
state-owned enterprises. All the measures will be put into 
effect starting this year. The Ministry of Finance believes 
this move tallies with the requirements of building a socialist 
market economic structure, conforms with the international 
practice, and can help enterprises compete with each other on a 
fair and equal footing. 
  Major measures are as follows: 
  --Rates of income tax collected from domestic-funded 
enterprises will be standardized at 33 percent, while the 
regulatory business tax levied on state-owned large and medium 
enterprises will be abolished. 
  However, in consideration of the poor economic efficiency 
and 
inability to submit more profits to higher authorities, the 
Ministry of Finance has introduced two preferential tariff 
rates: Enterprises with an annual tax and profit amounting to 
less than 30,000 yuan can enjoy a reduced tax rate of 18 
percent, while enterprises with an annual tax and profit of 
between 30,000 and 100,000 yuan can enjoy a reduced tax rate of 
27 percent. 
  --The practice of repaying loans before paying taxes will be 
abolished. Enterprises are required, without exception, to use 
their own retention funds to repay the principal of loans they 
have borrowed for fixed assets investment and no deduction will 
be made before they pay tax. 
  --A system of after-tax profit distribution on state-owned 
assets investment will be set up gradually, featuring 
distribution of dividends in proportion to shares, allotment of 
profits according to capital ratio, and submission of after-tax 
profits. In view of the realistic situation in enterprises and 
according to the state industrial policy, enterprises' task of 
technical transformation, and other realistic conditions, the 
Ministry of Finance is considering the possibility of putting 
into effect in most fully state-owned old enterprises (with the 
dividing line drawn at 31 December 1993) a practice by which 
such enterprises will not submit profits to higher authorities 
after paying income tax; at the same time, income tax paid by 
enterprises with narrow profit margins will not be returned to 
the paying units. 
  --Budget readjustment funds levied on state-owned 
enterprises 
by key construction foundations, including energy and 
communications foundations, will be abolished. The increased 
financial revenue should be earmarked primarily for the 
repayment of enterprise fixed assets investment loans. 
  --Loans borrowed by enterprises long ago can be dealt with 
on 
a case-by-case basis. We need to study and resolve the issue of 
"changing allocation of funds into loans" in line with the 
structural reform of the investment system. Those enterprises 
which really lack the ability to repay can be allowed to 
postpone their repayment upon examination and verification by 
the banks. Meanwhile, banks can check their bad debts through 
careful examination and verification and then offset them with 
reserves for bad loans according to relevant stipulations; at 
the same time, they can also raise the rate of extraction of 
their bad debt reserves. 
  --Farming [bao shui 0545 4451] of taxes as well as tax 
exemptions not stipulated in the state's Taxation Law will be 
abolished. 
  --Preferential tax policies granted to foreign-invested 
enterprises will remain unchanged.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Luyan (0491 7627 3601): "What Does </F>
Tax Reform Mean to Foreign Enterprises?"] 
  [Text] According to a decision adopted by the National 
People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, the provisional 
regulations on the value-added tax, consumption tax, and 
business tax will apply to foreign-invested enterprises and 
foreign enterprises in China as of 1 January this year; 
meanwhile, the combined industrial and commercial tax is to be 
rescinded. The introduction of the new tax system applying to 
foreign enterprises has caused various repercussions at home and 
abroad. What does this tax reform actually mean to foreign 
enterprises? This we need to analyze, meticulously and 
thoroughly. 
  Since 1979, China has applied different tax systems to 
foreign enterprises and Chinese enterprises. The reason for 
this practice was that preferential treatment was offered to 
foreign business firms purely to stabilize their tax system, 
given the higher tax rate in China after the reform and opening 
up and the fact that a tax reform was in progress. In this 
connection, the combined industrial and commercial tax which was 
first introduced in 1958 on a trial basis has been applied to 
foreign enterprises. As for Chinese enterprises, the 
value-added tax, product tax, and business tax have been applied 
to them since 1984. As a result, Chinese enterprises and 
foreign-funded enterprises in China have been bearing different 
tax burdens for many years past and increasing amounts of tax 
have been duplicated through different channels. This was 
unfavorable to export trade for foreign enterprises and had an 
adverse effect on economic development, therefore, a tax reform 
became a must. 
  The new tax system, molded in accordance with international 
common practice, is to introduce a regulated circulating tax 
system with value-added tax as the core and the consumption tax 
and business tax as auxiliaries. This new system has embodied 
the principle of fairness in terms of the tax burden, and that 
of competition on an equal footing, and has maintained the 
continuity, rationality, and stability with regard to the tax 
system concerning foreign interests. 
  Specifically speaking, after the tax reform, taxes 
concerning 
foreign interests will be divided into 12 categories, namely: 
Value-added tax, consumption tax, business tax, resource tax, 
tax on value added to land, stamp duty, slaughter tax, urban 
landed properties tax, levy on vehicle and ship licenses, 
enterprise income tax, personal income tax, and contract tax. 
Of these taxes, only the tax on value added to land is new. 
The circulating taxes, consisting of the value-added tax, 
consumption tax, and business tax which can be traced to the 
field of production and commodity circulation, are a major tax 
category accounting for a large proportion of tax revenue. A 
special feature of the value-added tax under the new tax system 
is to prevent duplicated tax and to make sure that the sum total 
of tax income from all channels equals the total amount of all 
taxes levied on commodities. The basic rate of the value-added 
tax is 17 percent and a unified 13-percent low rate has been set 
for all the taxes on daily necessities, products for 
agricultural use, and cultural goods, in contrast to the 14.5 
percent rate for the former combined industrial and commercial 
tax. The main purpose of the consumption tax is to adjust the 
consumption structure and to guide the public's consumption 
pattern, with high tax rates applying only to tobacco, alcohol, 
cosmetics, and jewelry. The business tax rate generally ranges 
from 3 to 5 percent, except for certain show business items, let 
alone the fact that the former combined industrial and 
commercial tax actually contained a part which represented 
business tax. Findings from a survey conducted among thousands 
of foreign enterprises in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, 
Tianjin, Guangzhou, Dalian, and Wuhan indicate that, after the 
new tax system was introduced, the tax burden decreased or 
remained the same in most foreign enterprises, with a small 
number of foreign enterprises' tax burden increasing slightly 
and the general level of tax contribution by foreign enterprises 
throughout the country remained unchanged. Thus, the state's 
financial revenue is ensured without increasing the burden on 
enterprises. 
  Some people have queried whether the tax reform will give 
rise to a new imbalance since the new regulations only apply to 
foreign enterprises founded after 1 January 1994, while the old 
regulations will continue to apply to those which had already 
been founded on or before 31 December 1993. To be honest, we 
must say that this is an objective fact. However, we should 
approach this issue from a comprehensive viewpoint. Any tax 
reform must have a definite effective date and must not be made 
indefinitely retroactive. Otherwise such a reform can hardly be 
carried out. Also, we apply the old regulations to old 
enterprises just because they were established in light of the 
results of past feasibility studies and investment return 
estimations based on the old tax system. If the new tax system 
was applied indiscriminately to both old and new enterprises, it 
would unfavorably affect old enterprises. Therefore it is 
necessary to give some preferential treatment to the latter 
within a certain grace period. 
  In order to retain continuity of tax related to foreign 
interests, the spirit of a unified tax system but no less 
preferential treatment has been pursued in the tax reform. The 
regulations governing exports remain unchanged in principle. No 
circulating tax will be levied on exports by foreign enterprises 
except for a few products where state regulations provide for 
it. Goods imported by foreign enterprises within the quota 
corresponding to the scale of their investment projects will be 
subject to tax exemption, including machinery, equipment, and 
component parts which enterprises need for daily operation, as 
well as raw and processed materials which are needed for 
manufacturing products to be exported. Goods which are imported 
with special permission are subject to tax reduction or 
exemption. No circulating tax is to be levied on goods imported 
by foreign-funded enterprises operating in special economic 
zones [SEZ] and on products manufactured and marketed in SEZ's, 
except for such items as mineral oils, tobacco, and alcohol, on 
which the circulating tax is levied at a 50-percent discount. 
The preferential policy regarding the circulating tax remains 
unchanged for bonded zones. Financial institutions operated 
with foreign capital, or jointly run with Chinese and foreign 
capital, set up in SEZ's and the Pudong new zone with approval, 
will be exempt from circulating tax for five years from their 
day of inauguration. As for those foreign enterprises which 
have yet to be established for which approval was already 
obtained before 31 December 1993, since they will have to pay 
all the value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax under 
the new tax system--which implies that they will have to pay 
more--the extra tax amount thereby incurred by them will be 
returned, within a period of not more than 5 years, with the 
approval of the tax authorities. Therefore, the new tax system 
will not affect foreign enterprises significantly. 
  By and large, the current tax reform is an integrated 
structural reform of overall significance. Domestically 
speaking, the reform is for the purpose of unifying the tax 
system, making the tax distribution fairer, improving the 
investment environment in the country, and suiting the needs of 
the establishment and development of the socialist market 
economy. Internationally speaking, it will enable China to meet 
the requirements of international common practice. Nowadays, 
almost none of the countries in the world are simultaneously 
applying two different tax systems to domestic tax payers and to 
foreign ones respectively. Article 3 of Chapter 2 of the GATT 
has specially provided for domestic taxes and equal treatment to 
citizens and aliens alike under domestic regulations. This 
article not only demands that the tax burden on foreign-funded 
enterprises be equal to that on domestic enterprises but also 
that restrictions on the operation of foreign-funded enterprises 
be relaxed so that they enjoy rights equal to domestic 
enterprises. Thus, whether viewed from internal or external 
concerns, unification of the tax system is necessary for the 
development of foreign-funded enterprises.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Foreign Privateers Lose Trade </F>
Licences"] 
  [Text] Hundreds of Sino-foreign business licences have 
been revoked in a crackdown on joint-venture fraud, according to 
local newspapers. Foreign investors have been lying about their 
capital investments, falsifying their accounts, over-charging 
for out-of-date fixed assets and changing the nature of their 
businesses without official permission. Local authorities in 
Guangzhou and Shenyang have revoked over 100 licenses, said the 
Shanghai-based XINMIN EVENING NEWS. Beijing and Taiyuan, 
capital of the northern Shanxi Province, have also cracked down, 
according to the GUANGMING DAILY and BEIJING DAILY. 
  Local systems will be established to improve supervision and 
control of joint-venture financing. And the crackdown will help 
to protect the legal rights and interest of local Chinese and 
foreign investors. Many joint ventures exist in name only, 
according to XINMIN EVENING NEWS. Many investors fail to meet 
their financial commitments years after being granted business 
licences, and some leave China without saying goodbye. 
  The administrative crackdown officially takes these 
companies 
off the map, the newspaper added. It is hoped that project 
approval and management loopholes will now be closed, the 
Shanghai paper said. Licence applications will have to be backed 
up by company market research. The lure of the fast buck has 
led many ventures into trouble, said GUANGMING DAILY. 
  The administrative move signals the re-establishment of 
governmental macro-economic control over Sino-foreign ventures, 
as the country becomes a global investment hot spot, said the 
State Administration for Industry and Commerce. There are 
174,056 joint ventures and their foreign trade accounted for one 
third of the country's total imports and exports last year.

  [Text] Yinchuan, March 11 (XINHUA) -- The "Three North" 
(northeast, northwest and north China) afforestation project 
carried out over the past 15 years has begun to produce great 
economic benefits for the areas involved. 
  The "Three North" forest belt extends from the Ozbel 
mountain 
pass in China's far northwest to Binxian county in northeast 
China's Heilongjiang Province, with 13 provinces, municipalities 
and autonomous regions involved. 
  Statistics reveal that the "Three-North" areas have been 
blessed with an annual increase of over three billion kg of 
grain harvest thanks to the trees that protect farmland in these 
areas, which used to suffer from serious soil erosion and 
sandstorms. 
  The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the 
State Council decided in late 1978 to build the giant forest 
belt in the northern part of China, which is designed to protect 
42.4 percent of China's landmass. 
  According to the plan, beginning from 1978, China is to take 
72 years to plant 35.6 million ha of trees and raise the forest 
cover percentage from 5.05 percent to 14.95 percent in the areas 
involved. 
  Over the past 15 years, with 3.232 billion yuan from the 
central government and related departments, local farmers have 
put in 1.5 billion work days and have planted about 13 million 
ha of trees, enclosed six million ha of hillsides and drifting 
sand to facilitate afforestation, besides carrying out aerial 
seeding on 60,000 ha of land and planting 5.5 billion trees. 
  Moreover, trees have been planted along 11 million ha of 
farmland in the Three-North areas. The efforts have greatly 
improved the ecological environment in the localities involved 
and enabled a steady and high output in rural and pastoral areas. 
  Because of the building of the forest belt, the output of 
forage grass has increased by 20 percent in pastoral areas, 
which are able to feed two million more head of sheep a year. 
  The afforestation drive has also played a positive role in 
controlling soil erosion on the loess plateau, according to 
forestry officials. 
  Local forestry departments have listed the work of combining 
afforestation, industry and trade as an important step for 
deepening reform. 
  Incomplete statistics show that more than 3,000 industrial 
"green" projects have been established in the Three-North areas, 
creating 90.5 million yuan in extra income a year. 
  Li Jianshu, director of the Three-North Forest Belt 
Construction Bureau under the Ministry of Forestry, attributes 
the success to the fostering of a selfless spirit among workers, 
the adoption of a multi-channel fund-raising system and wide 
application of practical scientific techniques. At the same 
time, flexible policies have been adopted to encourage more 
individuals to plant trees in addition to government and 
collective efforts.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (AFP)--Three Chinese dissidents, 
including the leading pro-democracy campaigner Wang Dan, left 
Beijing early Friday [11 March] at police behest, just hours 
before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, a relative of Wang said. "Wang Dan left at 9:00 
a.m. (0100 GMT) and headed for southern China," the relative 
said by phone, adding that the dissident would "probably be away 
for a week." 
  Wang, a former leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, 
was accompanied by fellow dissidents Zhou Duo, 46, and Min Qi, 
41, who also took an active role in those demonstrations, the 
source said. 
  Police had interrogated Wang several times in recent days, 
in 
the runup to the Christopher visit but also a meeting of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp 
parliament, which began Thursday. Wang on Thursday had said he 
had no intention of leaving Beijing, and issued a statement 
calling on the parliament to debate human rights. 
  Christopher, who was winding up a visit in Tokyo Friday 
before heading for Beijing, said human rights would be given top 
priority in his talks with Chinese leaders. He said on Thursday 
he did not have "any plans...at the present time" to meet 
pro-democracy activists. 
  The United States has told China it needs substantial 
progress in the field of human rights before it can renew 
most-favoured-nation trading status, which enables many Chinese 
exports to escape customs duty to the U.S. market. The decision 
is due in around three months. Wang was jailed for four years 
after the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and released in February 
last year. His family did not give any details Friday about his 
hurried departure from Beijing. 
  In another development, the Chinese authorities threw a 
police cordon around the U.S. embassy in Beijing, deploying 
dozens of police in uniform and plain clothes, an AFP reporter 
saw. 
  The exceptional move appeared to be part of efforts aimed at 
preventing all demonstrations during the high-profile NPC 
session and Christopher's visit. Besides Wang, at least seven 
other dissidents have been detained for interrogation, three of 
whom have been jailed. In addition, a Taiwanese journalist, 
working for the United Daily News [LIEN HO PAO] of Taipei, was 
detained and interrogated for three hours late Thursday after he 
met with teachers from the People's University of Beijing. 
  The journalist, Lai Chin-hung, who is in Beijing to cover 
the 
NPC, said he had no intention of leaving the city Friday.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (AFP)--Wang Fucheng, secretary 
general for the China Association for Human Rights, was arrested 
Friday [11 March] by police in Shanghai, a spokesman for the 
group said. 
  "Wang was arrested early this morning for no apparent 
reason," spokesman and fellow dissident Yang Zhou said by 
telephone. Yang is a founder of the Peace Charter movement 
which was started in November last year. 
  Wang, 39, a private businessman who has long been involved 
in 
promoting human rights, spent three years in prison from 1979 
for "counter-revolutionary" activities during the Democracy Wall 
movement in 1978-79. Chinese authorities' crackdown on 
dissidents has coincided with the opening of the annual National 
People's Congress (NPC) on Thursday and a visit to China by US 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher scheduled to begin later 
Friday. Several dissidents have been arrested in recent days 
and three of them were sent to prison. 
  Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations 
which culminated in the Tiananmen Square massacre in the 
capital, was forced to leave Beijing on Friday along with two 
other dissidents. Dissident Wei Jingsheng has also left for the 
countryside by order of the authorities.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Beijing by staff reporter Tu </F>
Fu-liang (2629 4395 5328): "Ministry of Justice Says That 
Beijing Will Handle Xi Yang Case Leniently"] 
  [Text] Answering Hong Kong reporters' questions about MING 
PAO reporter Xi Yang, who has been detained for over five 
months, Chinese Justice Minister Xiao Yang said that if Xi 
Yang's performance is good, he will be treated leniently in 
keeping with the legal provisions of the authorities. But he 
did not give any further explanation. 
  Xiao Yang, who attended the National People's Congress [NPC] 
session as a nonvoting member yesterday, answered two questions 
by reporters regarding the Xi Yang incident as he was about to 
leave the session site. 
  [Reporter] What is the situation regarding Xi Yang? 
  [Xiao Yang] It has already been made known to the outside. 
  [Reporter] Will he be released? 
  [Xiao Yang] If his performance is good, he will be treated 
leniently in keeping with our legal provisions. 
  Moreover, he also said the authorities would consider 
whether 
or not to release the pro-democracy activist Wang Juntao, who is 
now ill in prison, ahead of time in keeping with the law and the 
actual situation. 
  He said that Wang Juntao is now in "very good" condition and 
that the authorities are treating his hepatitis B in line with 
their humanitarian policy. 
  On the other hand, seizing the opportunity afforded by the 
opening of the NPC and Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] sessions in Beijing, representatives of the 
Hong Kong Journalist Association [HKJA] went to the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch to deliver an open letter to the NPC deputies and 
CPPCC delegates from Hong Kong yesterday, urging them to help in 
this matter and to inform the quarters concerned so that they 
would handle the Xi Yang case in a fair, open, and just manner 
and allow Xi Yang's family, employer, and lawyer to contact him. 
  In the letter, the HKJA specifically pointed out that it has 
been over five months since Xi Yang was arrested and detained on 
27 September and that it has been over two months since the 
court began to handle his case. However, so far, there has been 
no news about his trial or a verdict. According to the PRC Code 
of Criminal Procedure, a court of law should pronounce judgment 
one month after it begins to handle a public prosecution or must 
do so not more than one and a half months at the latest. In 
view of this, the period since Xi Yang was turned over to the 
court has already exceeded that for ordinary public prosecutions. 
  Three representatives of the HKJA went to the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch yesterday but only HKJA chairman, Li Yuet-wah, was 
allowed in to deliver the letter. The two staff at the XINHUA 
Hong Kong Branch who received the letter, however, did not 
clearly promise to hand the letter to the NPC deputies and CPPCC 
delegates from Hong Kong. Li Yuet-wah quoted the XINHUA staff as 
saying that the case "would be handled according to procedure." 
Asked what procedure would be followed, the staff answered: 
"Some time has to be spent in order to handle the matter." 
  HKJA Executive Committee member Fang Su said: For nearly 
half a year since Xi Yang was detained, he has only been allowed 
to see his father on one occasion when they talked about things 
unrelated to his case. At the end of last year, a court 
official said that Xi Yang did not want to hire a lawyer but the 
HKJA doubts this. Moreover, Xi Yang has since been isolated and 
has not been able to see his employer or lawyer. 
  Fang Su said: The HKJA sent letters to the CPPCC delegates 
and NPC deputies from Hong Kong, the Preliminary Work Committee, 
and Hong Kong affairs advisers, asking for help in the matter 
and got some positive response, including the fact that some 
CPPCC delegates have relayed the matter to the relevant quarters 
on many occasions in the hope that the Xi Yang case can be 
handled leniently. 
  He added that for more than five months since Xi Yang was 
arrested and detained, people in the press circles have been 
very much concerned about him. 
  The HKJA urged the persons concerned to help again in line 
with their humanitarian spirit and the spirit of rule of law by 
relaying to the quarters concerned its requests which include 
respecting Xi Yang's proper legal rights; allowing him to see 
his family and the delegates and deputies and to contact his 
lawyer; conducting a trial in a fair, just, and open manner; 
allowing his family and representatives of his employer to 
attend at his trial; and allowing Hong Kong and overseas media 
to listen to and report the trial proceedings.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Linda Lee report from Beijing, from the "News </F>
at Eight" -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] China's pro-democracy campaigner, Wang Dan, left 
Beijing early this morning, just hours before the arrival of 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. A family member 
said Wang Dan left at 9 a.m. with two friends. He was said to 
have left in a rush to southern China, for probably a week. 
Wang has been detained by police several times over the past 
few weeks. It is believed he was warned by the authorities to 
leave Beijing during Christopher's visit. The dissident's home 
is still being guarded by security police, who tried to stop our 
camera crew from taking pictures outside. [Video shows 
medium-distance shot of a six-story housing block, followed by a 
closeup of the sign hanging beside the entrance; it reads: 
"Guest House of the Museum of Chinese Revolution; no security 
police can be seen, nor is any intervention in the filming 
shown.] 
  Another well-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, also left the 
Chinese capital last week. The reason given by his secretary 
was that he was not feeling well. The Chinese justice minister 
declined to say whether the dissidents will be allowed to meet 
with Christopher. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] The highest councils of the Chinese Communist Party 
are holding emergency sessions to deal with what could be the 
most potent challenge to the administration since the June 4, 
1989, crisis. 
  In a gesture of defiance seven internationally known 
intellectuals sent a letter yesterday to President Jiang Zemin 
and National People's Congress Chairman Qiao Shi demanding that 
Beijing release "all citizens detained because of their thoughts 
and expression of opinion". Not doing so, the appeal warned, 
would "exacerbate contradictions and spawn irrevocable turmoil". 
  The petition, which has been made available to the Hong Kong 
and foreign media, also expressed "deep dismay and worries" over 
the recent spate of detentions of dissidents in Beijing, 
Shanghai and other cities. The campaign is led by Xu Liangying, 
74, a professor of philosophy of science at the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences, who is known as "the conscience of China". 
  The other six signatories are Professor Xu's wife, Wang 
Laidi, a history professor at the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences, Jiang Peikun and his wife Ding Zilin, both aesthetics 
professors at People's University Liu Liao, a physics professor 
at Beijing Normal University; poet Shao Yanxiang; and novelist 
Zhang Kangkang. 
  The open letter, entitled An appeal for the improvement of 
human rights in our country, said "the right of the freedom of 
thought and the expression of opinion is an inalienable right of 
modern man which brooks no interference". The petition warned 
Beijing that "the search of modernisation becomes illusory if 
human rights are dropped [from the agenda]". We appeal to the 
authorities bravely to put an end to China's practice over 
thousands of years of punishing people for their thinking, 
speech and writings." 
  Chinese sources said party leaders were alarmed because 
similar petitions for human rights and political reform in early 
1989 snowballed into the pro-democracy movement in May and June. 
One of the earliest such petitions was organised in February 
1989 by Professor Xu. It was signed by 40-odd dissidents, 
including astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and philosophy professor Bao 
Zunxin. "The authorities have been behaving in an abnormal way 
in the past months by detaining so many people," the professor 
said from his home yesterday. "They should immediately release 
all prisoners of conscience listed by international watchdogs 
such as Asia Watch." Professor Xu added he and his friends had 
no plans to hold demonstrations or to form political parties. 
"If the authorities are clear-headed, they will not take any 
action against us, but I myself am prepared for the worst," he 
said. 
  The open letter came on the heels of efforts on Wednesday by 
labour activist Liu Nianchun to form an unofficial labour union 
with 120 members. 
  Meanwhile, American Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
who is due to arrive in Beijing today to press for an 
improvement in human rights, indicated last night he had 
cancelled plans to meet dissidents for tear of triggering 
"retribution" against them.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (AFP)--Seven intellectuals have 
sent a letter to President Jiang Zemin and the president of the 
parliament, Qiao Shi, demanding that they release political 
prisoners, professor Xu Liangying said Friday [11 March]. 
  Xu, 74, a researcher at the Academy of Sciences, said by 
telephone that he and the other six mailed their appeal to the 
two leaders Thursday. 
  Their petition was accompanied by a letter telling them to 
"pay serious attention to this question, which involves the 
future of the state." "Only respect for human rights and the 
guarantee of legal rights for all citizens can maintain social 
stability," the letter said. "If not," it added, 
"contradictions in the heart of society will become so severe as 
to risk leading to chaos, or even to an uncontrollable 
situation." The senders included a writer, a poet and five 
professors. 
  "Recently, several interrogations and arrests have occurred 
in Beijing and Shanghai for ideological or speech reasons...and 
international opinion was shocked," they wrote. "China, as a 
permanent Security Council member and founding member of the 
United Nations, must set an example and respect human rights 
principles." 
  "Therefore, we call for the authorities to courageously put 
an end to the custom, several thousand years old, of condemning 
someone for his ideas, his speech or his writing, and to free 
all citizens imprisoned for this purpose." 
  The signatories included Xu's wife, Wang Laili, a history 
professor at the Academy of Social Sciences and Ding Zilin and 
his wife, Jiang Peikun -- both philosophy professors at the 
People's University of Beijing. Liu Liao, a professor of the 
capital's Normal School, also signed, as did poet Shao Yanxiang 
and writer Zhang Kangkang. 
  Xu, who knows Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi personally, declared 
that he did "not expect to have problems with the police because 
of this letter, which is aimed at reducing tensions within 
society." He added, however, that the telephone of Ding Zilin 
and his wife was cut off Thursday and that their home had been 
"surrounded by lots of people."

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Two hijackers, Zhang 
Daxing and Chen Jiangfu, were recently tried by the Intermediate 
People's Court in Hangzhou city, capital of Zhejiang Province, 
and given different imprisonment terms, according to the Supreme 
People's Court here today. 
  The two were convicted of trying to hijack a plane from 
China 
Eastern Airlines. Chief criminal Zhang Daxing, a self-employed 
businessman, was sentenced to life imprisonment with his 
political rights deprived for life, and his accomplice Chen 
Jiangfu, a self- employed tailor, was sentenced to ten years 
behind bars with his political rights deprived for one year. 
  On January 28, 1994, Zhang Daxing, a native of Taicang 
county 
in Jiangsu Province, and Chen Jiangfu, a native of Wujin county 
in Jiangsu, bought air tickets from Shanghai to Hangzhou for the 
following day. 
  Zhang told Chen his intention and detailed plan to hijack 
the 
passenger plane to Taiwan and showed him a letter of blackmail 
to be used in the move. 
  On January 29, the two men got on the airplane, flight 5513, 
of China Eastern Airlines. Soon after the plane took off, Zhang 
got up and declared with the letter that the plane was hijacked, 
threatening to explode it if it refused to fly to Taiwan. 
  Meanwhile, Chen kept an eye on people on board, following 
Zhang's orders. 
  The two hijackers were subdued and arrested after the 
airplane landed at the airport in Hangzhou. 
  They were convicted by the Hangzhou Intermediate People's 
Court in its first ruling according to law. They pleaded guilty 
and did not appeal to the higher people's court. 
  A spokesman of the Supreme People's Court pointed out today 
that hijacking civil airplanes is a grave crime as it endangers 
the safety of passengers and their property, adding that 
criminals should be sternly punished according to law.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Liu Huisheng (0491 2585 3932) and reporter </F>
Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- According to 
information provided by the Supreme People's Court, the Hangzhou 
city Intermediate People's Court recently passed sentence, in 
accordance with the law, on two criminals who hijacked a China 
Eastern Airlines plane. Zhang Daxing, the principal criminal, 
was sentenced to life imprisonment and stripped of his political 
rights for life, while his accomplice Chen Jiangfu was sentenced 
to 10 years' imprisonment and stripped of his political rights 
for one year. 
  In December 1993, Zhang Daxing, a self-employed industrial 
and commercial businessman from Jiangsu's Taicang county who was 
doing business in Shanghai, asked Chen Jiangfu, a farmer from 
Jiangsu's Wujin county who wanted to start his own household 
tailoring business in Shanghai Municipality's Baoshan County, to 
go out with him under the pretext of doing business. On 28 
January 1994, after purchasing air tickets for the 
Shanghai-Hangzhou flight for the following day, Zhang Daxing 
told Chen Jiangfu about his plot to hijack the aircraft to 
Taiwan and showed him a blackmail letter he had written earlier. 
  On 29 January 1994, Zhang Daxing and Chen Jiangfu boarded 
China Eastern Airlines flight 5513 for Hangzhou. Shortly after 
the plane took off, Zhang Daxing got up and forced the flight 
crew to change the plane's course to Taiwan using the blackmail 
letter and threats to blow up the plane. Meanwhile, Chen 
Jiangfu followed Zhang Daxing's orders and kept an eye on the 
people on board. In the course of dealings between the flight 
crew and the two criminals, the plane landed at Hangzhou's 
Jianqiao Airport and the two criminals were arrested on the spot. 
  In trying the case, the Hangzhou City Intermediate People's 
Court uncovered the facts and decided that Zhang Daxing and Chen 
Jiangfu used threats to hijack the aircraft, disregarding state 
law. There was sufficient clear evidence to prove that they had 
hijacked the aircraft. To safeguard normal aviation order and 
protect the safety of passengers and property, it is necessary 
to strictly punish criminals who hijack aircraft. In accordance 
with the relevant stipulations of the "Decision of the National 
People's Congress Standing Committee on Strictly Punishing 
Criminal Elements Who Hijack Aircraft" and the "Criminal Law of 
the People's Republic of China," the Hangzhou City Intermediate 
People's Court passed initial judgment on principal criminal 
Zhang Daxing and his accomplice Chen Jiangfu. Zhang Daxing and 
Chen Jiangfu pleaded guilty and accepted the verdict. As they 
did not file an appeal within the legally prescribed period, the 
initial judgment of Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court 
became legally binding. 
  A spokesman for the Supreme People's Court said: Hijacking 
civil airplanes is a grave crime as it seriously endangers the 
safety of passengers and their property. The crime must be 
severely punished in accordance with the law. He said: The 
judicial organs will definitely continue to severely punish 
without leniency plane hijackers who defy the law and take such 
risks.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Speaking Up For Xi"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese authorities' silence over the fate of 
Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang continues to cause concern. He has 
been tried--in secret but is still awaiting a verdict on a 
charge of "espionage regarding state secrets on banking." And 
more than five months after his arrest, he has still not been 
allowed to receive visits from anyone except his father--who 
only saw him once last November. Since then, he has 
communicated with no one, including his employer, Ming Pao 
chairman Yu Pun-hoi. 
  The Hong Kong Journalists' Association's petition to local 
deputies to the National People's Congress and the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference to speak up on his 
behalf is therefore as welcome as it is timely. 
  Xi's treatment may be in accordance with Chinese law. But it 
falls far short of what Hong Kong people expect of their own 
legal system and fails to offer any reassurance that similar 
cases will not be treated with equal high-handedness after 1997. 
China's definition of espionage is not clear. For all Hong 
Kong media are aware, Xi may have been doing no more than a Hong 
Kong journalist regards as normal professional research. The 
harsh punishment handed out to a Chinese journalist who leaked a 
speech by President Jiang Zemin to a reporter from the Express 
is an indication of the different weight the two cultures place 
on particular kinds of information. 
  If our delegates to the CPPCC and NPC are brave enough to 
speak out publicly on Xi's behalf, they will be doing themselves 
and Hong Kong's interests more good than if they waste their 
time putting forward sycophantic motions supporting what China 
is already known to be planning for the territory after 1997. 
  There are indications that China may be influenced by 
whether 
the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher raises Xi's case 
on his visit to Beijing this week. If so, it is vital that the 
importance of the case be impressed on Mr Christopher and his 
advisers as soon as he arrives on Chinese soil. 
  That message will come across louder and clearer if some of 
Hong Kong's most pro-Beijing voices are prepared to make a 
public stand on Xi's behalf than if the territory remains silent 
and cravenly accepts he is guilty as charged even before the 
verdict has been handed down.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Kuo Hung-chih (6753 1347 </F>
3112): "Unwilling To Serve as a 'Political Vase," CPPCC Fights 
For More Real Power"] 
  [Text] "Political consultation should not remain at the 
level of making one's position known!" "The Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] is very important when 
the session is held, but it disappears once the session is 
over!" "The CPPCC should give more "belated advice!" "The 
Government Report should be discussed by the CPPCC first!" "We 
always visit upper houses of other countries when we make 
overseas trips, the upper houses have voting rights but we do 
not. To take part in political consultation, it is necessary to 
have voting rights!" 
  Compared with past terms of the CPPCC, the Eighth CPPCC is 
really different in many aspects. Former CPPCC chairman Li 
Xiannian assumed office when he was 79. His membership of the 
CPC Central Committee was forfeited before he took the CPPCC 
chairmanship, and the CPPCC work was equivalent to a transition 
to retirement. However, incumbent chairman Li Ruihuan is only 60 
and he is also a member of the Political Bureau Standing 
Committee of the CPC Central Committee, which holds real power. 
For him, the CPPCC chairmanship is not, in any sense, a 
transition to retirement. Li Ruihuan still has a promising 
political future, but he does not really lay hold of any part of 
the party, government, or military systems, so he is very eager 
to rely on the base of the CPPCC to bring his political 
influence into play. 
  Last year when he took over the CPPCC chairmanship, Li 
Ruihuan made a speech which was full of fighting will at the 
closing ceremony of the First Plenary Session of the Eighth 
CPPCC and vigorously stated that it was necessary to give play 
to the CPPCC's functions. His remarks were greeted with warm 
applause by members who were present. At that time, many people 
predicted that Li Ruihuan would reform the CPPCC. After a 
year's time, the CPPCC cannot break away from its constraints in 
the political structure and is still an organization for 
"political participation and consultation" without real power, 
but it is striving for more real power step by step. 
  In the past, special committees under the CPPCC were only 
some united front organizations without real functions. 
However, over the past year, Li Ruihuan reinforced the staffs 
and enhanced the functions of the 15 CPPCC special committees 
and devoted efforts to studying policy proposals. Policy 
proposals put forward by the CPPCC are not legally binding on 
government departments, but when the CPPCC special committees 
started showing their strength, government departments did feel 
the pressure. 
  This year, what CPPCC members have taken delight in talking 
about is that a report submitted by the CPPCC Economic Committee 
last June was accepted by government departments and it formed a 
part of macroscopic regulation. Li Luye, spokesman of the 
current session, also pointed out that over the past year, there 
was a growing trend that study reports submitted by the CPPCC 
were accepted by government decision-making departments. 
  Under all these conditions, many CPPCC members have shown a 
strong intention to strive for legal status similar to that of 
upper houses in foreign countries. If the CPPCC can make a 
breakthrough on this, it will certainly be a great revolution in 
the CPC's constitutional system. As far as the reform of the 
constitutional system is concerned, a considerable number of 
factors are involved, and it cannot be achieved overnight, but 
CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan is undoubtedly a key factor in 
determining the result of the reform. If he merely treats the 
CPPCC as a stepping-stone, it will not be easy to achieve 
success in the CPPCC's structural reform. Yesterday, at the 
CPPCC group discussion, CPPCC member Zhao Jing said that he 
hoped Li Ruihuan would work not only at the CPC Central 
Committee office but also regularly at the CPPCC office. 
  Li Ruihuan must devote more efforts to the CPPCC if the 
"vase" is really to be removed.

<F P=106> ["Special article" from Beijing by staff reporter: "The </F>
Greatest Two-Line Struggle in Zhongnanhai Since Deng Xiaoping's 
Southern Tour"] 
  [Text] Although an "arrangement" has been made for Wei 
Jingsheng to leave Beijing and Beijing is carrying out 
large-scale arrests of political dissidents for questioning, a 
high-level CPC official disclosed that a two-line struggle--the 
greatest since Deng Xiaoping's southern tour--is taking place in 
Zhongnanhai. Supported by all kinds of factors, hardliners are 
gaining the upper hand and will, under the precondition of 
"stability" overwhelming everything, take a strong attitude on 
the Taiwan and Hong Kong issues and toward the United States. 
This informed source revealed that "some people in Zhongnanhai 
do not sleep well every day" and that all kinds of 
contradictions are causing a change in policy. 
  A week ago, Wei Jingsheng told a friend that the CPC's 
policy 
on political dissidents will not change, nor would the human 
rights record change much. This high-level CPC official also 
revealed that the CPC's attitude toward "Wei Jingsheng and the 
like" has not changed and that it will continue to release 
political dissidents who "have given a good account of 
themselves." What has caused the CPC to change its plan and 
strategy in a week? 
  The United States has always regarded the treatment meted 
out 
to pro-democracy activists, including Wei Jingsheng, Wang 
Juntao, Chen Ziming, and Wang Dan as a criterion to appraise the 
CPC's human rights record. Has the high-level CPC leadership 
suddenly "become ferocious" regardless of the connection between 
Chinese-U.S. political and economic relations on the one hand 
and U.S. concern for Wei Jingsheng et al and the treatment of 
political dissidents on the other? Is the CPC ready to take a 
hard-line policy? Has it worked out a complete plan to resist 
U.S. pressure? 
  The high-level CPC official revealed that a silent two-line 
struggle is taking place for top-level power and that the 
participation of the gerontocrats has made this struggle for 
power and the two lines and policies even more complicated. He 
pointed out: No conclusion can be made now and no one has won 
or lost the struggle; as this struggle involves a wide range of 
aspects, it is very difficult to say whether or not there will 
be personnel changes or whether or not someone "will be hit by 
an arrow and fall off his horse?" The hardliners have gained 
the upper hand in counterattacking U.S. human rights pressure. 
This could possibly involve China's foreign policy. 
  On whether or not local officials, who maintain delicate 
relations with the central authorities, are involved in this 
two- line struggle, the high-level CPC official said that most 
local leaders with real power are taking a "wait-and-see" 
attitude until the "situation is clear." 
  Viewing the CPC's strong attitude on the Hong Kong issue, 
its 
leap in economic reform, its liveliness in diplomatic relations, 
its response to U.S. human rights policy, as well as economic 
and trade pressure, and its way of handling inflation and social 
problems, we can explicitly see the change from "fluctuation" to 
"aggravation" in the high-level CPC two-line struggle. The CPC 
official indicated that this struggle started at the beginning 
of this year and became more intense after Lunar New Year. 
Surrounded by pressures from all sides, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
is seeking more cooperation and support. On the other hand, the 
conservative forces' activities are also noteworthy. 
  As learned, apart from using "strong words" in finally 
revising the section on the Hong Kong issue in the government 
work report to the upcoming National People's Congress, the 
section on diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan 
will also be strongly worded. 
  This informed source in Beijing said that Deng Xiaoping's 
health will have a major impact on this struggle. After a video 
showing of Deng Xiaoping's public appearance, conservatives were 
overjoyed and became active in engaging in foreign economic and 
trade relations. The change in policy toward Wei Jingsheng et al 
is an advance indication of the adoption of a hard-line 
attitude. Some people believe that Deng Xiaoping's condition is 
worse than thought, while Chen Yun's condition is much better. 
No one knows who will win in this power struggle. 
  This high-level CPC official said that "some people in the 
Central Committee are really worried about Deng Xiaoping's 
health. Deng Xiaoping's condition is worse than last year." 
  There is a close connection between Chinese-U.S. relations 
and Wei Jingsheng et al's behavior as well as political 
dissidents' contacts with organizations outside China, this CPC 
official indicated. The CPC will not allow these people to form 
organizations or undermine social "stability," still less will 
it allow them to collaborate with hostile forces outside the 
borders. Of course, it will not allow these people to harm 
"state interests." 
  Under this hard-line policy, even if Christopher arrives 
with strong human rights pressure, the CPC will not yield to 
this pressure; it will only make concessions on the Korean 
peninsula issue, nuclear arms control, and some economic and 
trade restrictions unless "there is a major internal change." 
And this depends on these two weeks. 
  A Western observer said that the feeling in Beijing in March 
this year is similar to that in the spring of 1989. The 
people's resentment against speculating officials, bribery, and 
corruption is high, commodity price hikes are out of control, 
inflation is serious, the peasant issue is worsening, the gap 
between rich and poor is widening, and there are more problems 
in state-owned enterprise reform and the worker issue--all these 
are pummeling Beijing. Whenever the CPC faces internal 
pressures, it generally assumes a posture of being strong on 
foreign policy, carrying out retrenchment in the economy, and 
becoming conservative in politics. The Wei Jingsheng case is the 
prelude to a big case. 
  The high-level CPC official said that the upcoming sessions 
of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference could possibly reflect many 
problems, such as the Hong Kong issue, attitudes toward the 
United States, the agricultural question, the relationship 
between the central and local authorities, imbalanced 
development, and setbacks in five reforms; but these are not the 
focal points facing the high-level CPC leadership, the focal 
point lies in Zhongnanhai.

on PRC leadership activities from 3 March to 11 March 1994. The 
source is noted in parentheses after each report. 
  Li Peng Message Greets Sale of Zhou Enlai CD's -- In his 
message to a meeting held in Beijing on 2 March marking the 
distribution and sale of cassettes and CD's on Zhou Enlai, 
Premier Li Peng said: "The tapes and CD's, known as the `Voice 
of Great Men,' will enable us to hear the cordial voices of Mao 
Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and other proletarian revolutionaries of the 
older generation. This is a very significant matter. I believe 
the `Voice of Great Men' will play a positive role in 
encouraging us to undertake the great cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics." 
  According to the announcer, the CD contains 15 speeches made 
by Zhou Enlai from 1949 to 1975. (Beijing Central Television 
Program One Network in Mandarin 1100 GMT 2 Mar 94) 
  Li Lanqing Meets Military Provision Work Conference 
Delegates 
-- During a meeting with delegates to the Eighth National 
Conference on Military Provision Work in the Great Hall of the 
People on 2 March, Vice Premier Li Lanqing called on all 
localities to ensure the supply of military provisions 
qualitatively, quantitatively, and in a timely banner. (Beijing 
Central Television Program One Network in Mandarin 1400 GMT 2 
Mar 94) 
  Liu Huaqing Writes Name of Medical Equipment Room -- A 
magnetic oscillatory diagnosis instrument, the largest in Asia, 
has been put into operation at the Navy General Hospital. Liu 
Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, wrote 
the name Magnetic Oscillatory Diagnosis Instrument Laboratory. 
According to the announcer, the equipment was imported from 
Israel. (Beijing Central Television Program One Network in 
Mandarin 1400 GMT 2 Mar 94) 
  Deng Xiaoping Writes Name of New Book -- Volumes three and 
four of the new book Chinese Female Journalists, the 
name of which was written by Deng Xiaoping, were recently 
published by the XINHUA Publishing House. According to the 
announcer, "Chinese Female Journalists" introduces the growth 
and experiences of Chinese female journalists from various 
angles during the past 50 years. (Beijing Central Television 
Program One Network in Mandarin 1400 GMT 4 Mar 94) 
  Li Lanqing Speaks at Military Provision Work Conference -- A 
new system of supplying provisions to the military will be 
introduced in China beginning 1 April, according to a decision 
of the just- concluded Eighth National Conference on Military 
Provision Work. Speaking at the conference, Li Lanqing, member 
of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier 
of the State Council, pointed out: "Military provisions supply 
work is a serious political task. Guaranteeing the supply of 
military provisions is of great significance to promoting 
stability, improving military building, and guaranteeing state 
security." 
  According to the conference, provisions for the military 
will 
be purchased at negotiated prices instead of government-set 
prices, and price differential subsidies will be jointly shared 
by central and local finances. (Beijing Central People's Radio 
Network in Mandarin 1030 GMT 8 Mar 94) 
  Wu Bangguo Addresses Shanghai's Anticorruption Meeting -- 
The Shanghai municipal party committee and people's government 
held a municipal meeting of leading party and government cadres 
on 8 March to convey the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session 
of the CPC Central Committee's Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection, Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech, and the 
State Council's anticorruption work conference. Wu Bangguo, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and 
secretary of Shanghai municipal party committee, spoke at the 
meeting. 
  In his speech, Wu Bangguo called on cadres to undertake 
Shanghai's anticorruption task in a lasting, in-depth, and more 
effective manner by comprehensively implementing the party's 
basic line. Wu Bangguo stressed: Although Shanghai has made 
temporary progress in anticorruption, it is wrong to assume the 
task can now be slowed. Instead, the task should be further 
consolidated and developed. In the entire process of reform, 
opening up, and economic development, the task of building a 
healthy party style and clean administration must always be 
adhered to. (Shanghai People's Radio Network in Mandarin 2300 
GMT 8 Mar 94) 
  Yang Shangkun Inspects Guangdong Province -- While 
inspecting 
Guangdong Province during the Spring Festival period, Comrade 
Yang Shangkun hoped Guangdong people would continue to carry 
forward their spirit of arduous struggle and take the lead in 
reform, opening up, and economic development. Accompanied 
separately by Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Guangdong provincial party 
committee, and deputy party secretary Huang Huahua, Yang 
Shangkun inspected Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Guangzhou, and Foshan as 
well as heard work reports by local party and government leaders. 
  Yang Shangkun said China will introduce many major reform 
measures this year. He asked all those concerned to study new 
issues, overcome new problems, summarize new experiences, and 
actively undertake their tasks more effectively due to the wide- 
ranging measures, constrained time, and heavy tasks. Yang 
Shangkun visited and heard work reports on the Guangzhou 
Economic and Technological Development Zone on the occasion of 
its 10th anniversary. He praised the zone's speedy development 
and called for improvement in water and power supply, 
transportation services, and raw material production as well as 
increased nationalization in production. Yang Shangkun also 
wrote inscriptions to encourage several other enterprises when 
he visited them. (Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 
0800 GMT 9 Mar 94) 
  Jiang Zemin's Inscriptions for Heroic Soldier Arouse Great 
Enthusiasm -- Inscriptions written by Jiang Zemin and other 
military leaders for heroic soldier Xu Honggang have aroused the 
public's great enthusiasm. Li Guoyun, a section chief from the 
General Staff Headquarters, said Jiang Zemin's call to emulate 
Xu Honggang's deeds is a demand of the times which also meets 
the people's wishes. The socialist market economic system urges 
soldiers to nurture and mold themselves with the party's fine 
traditions and thoughts of serving the people. Yang Chuanjiang, 
a deputy of the National People's Congress from Yunnan, said the 
inscriptions will propel spiritual civilization to a new stage. 
Beijing teacher Li Lan said educators should attach importance 
to teaching Xu Honggang's deeds in order to train more qualified 
personnel for society. (Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin 1100 GMT 9 Mar 94)

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Yue (0491 6390): "Chinese Workers and Staff </F>
Members Are Increasingly Dissatisfied"] 
  [Text] Reform in China this year will be focused on 
enterprise reform, taking the institution of a modern enterprise 
system as the objective. It is beyond all doubt that taking 
vigorous action regarding state-owned enterprises will be an 
inevitable necessity for in-depth reform, hence action is 
imperative under the circumstances. 
  What worries people, however, is that before the beginning 
of 
wide-scale reform, the dissatisfaction of enterprise staff and 
workers has burst out in many ways. If the policymakers do not 
realize this soberly and take effective measures to cope with 
it, the pace of reform very soon will be held up by this 
continually spreading dissatisfaction, and the grand and dynamic 
reform will die away without being noticed. 
  A survey indicates that the dissatisfaction of enterprise 
staff and workers has vented itself in many ways. The following 
are just a few examples: 
<H5>  It Is Difficult To Maintain Basic Living Conditions </H5>
  First, the excessively sharp increase in commodity 
prices has aroused dissatisfaction among staff and workers. 
In the first half of 1993, controls on the prices of grain and 
edible oil were lifted for the first time in several decades in 
more than 1,300 counties among 90 percent of provinces and 
cities throughout the country. In the meantime, the state 
adopted a policy of combined regulation and relaxation of the 
prices of some essential means of production, whereby the state 
has successively lifted control of factory prices for steel 
products, partially unified the allocation of coal, and made 
appropriate adjustments to the prices of some heavy oil 
products. This move caused prices to rise by 13.9 percent in 
June 1993 over the corresponding period in 1992, more than 
doubling the rise of 6 percent originally set for the whole 
year. Enterprise staff and workers were weighed down by the 
pressure of this price surge much more than indicated by the 
figures released by the authorities. 
  The overly rapid price surge has affected the basic lives of 
staff and workers and has aroused their intense dissatisfaction. 
According to a survey conducted by the Henan Provincial 
Federation of Trade Unions among 10,000 staff and workers across 
the province in September 1993, 41 percent of them felt that the 
price surge had caused their families' living standards to 
decline. 
  Second, the poverty of staff and workers became an 
increasingly conspicuous problem. The findings of an 
authoritative survey show that among the ranks of staff and 
workers in China, more than 5 percent of personnel who have 
retired or are still working (totalling about 8 million) now 
live in poverty. If their dependents are included, the total 
population of impoverished staff and workers and their families 
is approximately 20 million. The salaries of some staff and 
workers are unsecured, and for several consecutive years, a 
small number of them have received only scores of yuan each 
month to live on. Some enterprises could not even afford to pay 
this sum as basic living expenses. Take the Xinjiang production 
and construction corps as an example. In the five divisions of 
this corps in northern Xinjiang, nearly half the staff families 
have less than 50 yuan per head to live on. 
  Under circumstances in which basic livelihood can hardly be 
maintained, some people have had to live on borrowed money and 
grain or to sell their own furniture and clothing; others were 
forced to divorce, commit suicide, or steal. Owing to 
livelihood problems, instances of presenting petitions, staging 
demonstrations, and collectively appealing to the authorities 
for help have occurred frequently. 
  Third, the income of staff and workers has declined 
substantially in the name of reducing material benefits. 
As China has a large population but a weak economic foundation, 
there originally were few and relatively low-level welfare 
services. Some enterprises, however, improperly reduced welfare 
services in the name of reform. As a result, some units 
arbitrarily distributed money or things to staff and workers, 
which led to sharp increases in welfare expenditures on the one 
hand, but on the other, necessary welfare services were 
neglected. Moreover, some units turned former welfare 
facilities -- such as nurseries, cafeterias, bathrooms, and 
barbershops -- into profit-making commercial service networks, 
but did not increase the income of staff and workers 
correspondingly. This has directly sapped their revenue. 
  Fourth, encroachment on the rights and interests of 
staff and workers has occurred frequently. According to a 
survey, 615 staff members and workers were fired, laid off, or 
dismissed from 178 enterprises in Shijiazhuang between April and 
December 1992, and 30 percent of them were relieved of their 
posts without being gived any explanation or without trade 
unions being advised in advance of the reasons for the 
termination of their services. 

<H3>    Staff Members and Workers Gradually Feel Doubtful About 
Reform Measures </H3>
  Fifth, unfair distribution and the wide gap between 
rich and poor engender resentment and dissatisfaction. 
There are still 6 to 7 million poor families among the urban 
staff members and workers, with the income of high salary 
earners being 10 times higher on average. Even among the 
residents in cities and towns, the gap between the 10 percent of 
high income earners and the 10 percent of low income earners is 
close to 5 times. Certainly, there are irrational portions in 
this high income. According to a survey of the tax department, 
the amount of tax evasion in China has reached approximately 100 
billion yuan per year, of which the individual sector accounted 
for more than 90 percent, and more than 80 percent of private 
enterprises evaded taxes. The drastic widening of the income 
gap in society has led to serious psychological imbalance in 
quite a number of staff members and workers. 
  Other phenomena -- including acute employment 
contradictions, 
housing difficulties, default in the payment of salaries, the 
lack of protection due to child-birth, old age, illness, and 
death, and so on -- are causes of intense dissatisfaction among 
staff members and workers. 
  The ever-growing dissatisfaction and psychological imbalance 
have aroused doubt or even resentment among some staff members 
and workers toward the reform and open door policies, so that 
their support for reform has declined noticeably. 
  An opinion poll conducted during the Seventh Five-Year Plan 
indicated that more than 80 percent of staff members and workers 
gave their support to reform, with the highest percentage 
reaching 95, whereas the latest survey shows that only 72 
percent of staff members and workers support reform. 
  Overcome by dissatisfaction, staff members and workers have 
sought countermeasures to gain benefits and avoid losses, which 
has exacerbated social disorder and bred a hidden peril to 
reform and development. Over the past few years, sudden 
incidents stemming from material interest problems have 
increased notably. In this connection, people must not take it 
lightly in the course of instituting a modern enterprise system.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Xiao Rui (5135 3843): "How Premier Li </F>
Peng's `Government Work Report' Was Drafted"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- This is a 
crucial year, in which China will advance toward the 
establishment of a socialist market economy structure. A 
comprehensive, pragmatic, and highly manipulative "government 
work report" will produce a positive impact on China's reform, 
opening up, stability, and development this year. 
  The "government work report" delivered by Li Peng at the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress today 
was drafted after extensively heeding opinions of various 
sectors and collecting information from various quarters. 
  On 13 January this year, the "government work report" 
drafting group was officially set up, composed of 12 members 
from seven comprehensive departments comprising the State 
Council's Research Center, the CPC Central Policy Research 
Center, the State Commission for Restructuring Economy, the 
State Economic and Trade Commission, the State Planning 
Commission, the People's Bank of China, and the State 
Statistical Bureau. In a small, quiet building on picturesque 
Yuquanshan, located in the western suburbs of Beijing, the 
drafting group worked painstakingly for more than 20 days. At 
first, they set to writing separately, and afterward worked 
together to have the draft report completed in mid-February. 
  What is worth mentioning is that all the members of the 
drafting group are from authoritative comprehensive departments, 
and most of them have outstanding theoretical achievements and 
practical work experience. They have active minds and are of 
relatively high quality. Owing to their day-to-day work, they 
are more familiar with the overall conditions of China's society 
and some problems that temporarily exist. 
  These drafters are: Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the 
State Council's Research Center; Huang Jian, deputy head of the 
Comprehensive Group of the above center; Shen Bonian, head of 
the Financial and Economic Group of the above center; Guo 
Zhenying, head of the Industrial and Communications Group of the 
above center; Huang Shouhong, research fellow of the 
Agricultural Group of the above center; Zou Ping, deputy head of 
the Cultural and Educational Work Group of the above center; Li 
Jiange, deputy director of the Policy and Legislation Department 
of the State Economic and Trade Commission; Lin Zhaomu, deputy 
director of the Research Center of the State Planning 
Commission; Peng Sen, deputy director of the Comprehensive 
Department of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy; Wu 
Xiaoling, deputy director of the Structural Reform Department of 
the People's Bank of China; Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the 
State Statistical Bureau; and Zheng Xinbiao, deputy head of the 
Cultural and Educational Work Group of the Central Policy 
Research Center. 
  During the drafting process, the draft "government work 
report" was repeatedly discussed and revised at the State 
Council's executive meetings, as well as at meetings of the CPC 
Politburo and its Standing Committee. In addition, the drafting 
group extensively solicited the opinions of various localities, 
departments, democratic parties, personalities without party 
affiliation, and representatives from various grass-roots units. 
Premier Li Peng called discussions five times to listen to the 
revised proposals from various sectors. Therefore, the report 
read by the premier today should be said to have fully 
represented the will of all strata, quarters, and personalities 
from various circles. It has defined the keynotes and charted 
the course for China's reform this year. 
  An authoritative source said: The themes of Premier Li 
Peng's "government work report" are to deepen reform and 
maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
What attracts people's attention is that he particularly 
stressed the necessity of handling the relationships among 
reform, development, and stability. 
  Development is the only way for China to attain a lasting 
good order, and is the ultimate goal that comes up to the 
expectations of the people. Reform is the motive force for 
achieving rapid development, and stability is a guarantee for 
reform and a prerequisite for development. The three aspects 
are closely related to one another. 
  Careful people may have discovered that this year's 
"government work report" is concise, to the point, relatively 
short, and unadorned. 
  A person in charge of the drafting group said that one of 
the 
reasons for the shortness of this year's report is that major 
policies and principles have been defined. The drafting group 
strove to be concise in writing and focused on the major tasks 
to be grasped by the State Council this year. Hence, the report 
does not list in detail all achievements scored by various 
departments last year and the tasks to be performed this year.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO correspondent He Jiazheng (0149 0502 2973) </F>
and XINHUA correspondent Chen Yun (7115 5366)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- At a discussion session 
this afternoon at the Huairentang Hall with participants of a 
special seminar for managers of large state enterprises, State 
Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said: During the current 
transition from the old system to the new system, there are many 
contradictions and problems which require a process of breaking 
in. The role of large and medium state enterprises is to do 
everything possible to smooth and shorten the break-in process. 
He added: China's reforms will be promoted if large state 
enterprises carry out the central government's reform programs 
and measures in an exemplary manner. 
  The "Special Seminar for Managers of Large State 
Enterprises," cosponsored by the Organization Department of the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Economics and Trade 
Commission, was inaugurated on 21 February. At the seminar, 40 
managers from 40 large state enterprises from all across the 
country studied in depth the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the major reform 
programs to be launched by the central government this year, as 
well as discussed the difficult and crucial points related to 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system. 
  Vice Premier Li Lanqing chaired today's discussion. He began 
the discussion by saying he was very happy to attend and listen 
to views on behalf of Premier Li Peng. Then Zhao Zongnai, 
deputy director of the Organization Department, gave a briefing 
on courses studied at the seminar. He was followed by Vice 
President Li Yunmao of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, 
President Chen Jie of the Beijing Peony Electronics Group, Party 
Secretary Gao Rumao of the Datong Mining Bureau, Deputy Party 
Secretary Xu Kaicheng of the Jinshan Petrochemical Corporation, 
and Deputy Party Secretary and Vice President Zhao Guangjie of 
the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who gave reports on their 
understandings gained from the study. 
  After listening to speeches by seminar representatives, Zou 
Jiahua praised the Organization Department and the State 
Economics and Trade Commission for cosponsoring the seminar 
which has benefited its participants. He said: During the 
great historical period of reform and establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure, many of the previous 
measures for a planned economy are no longer in use and are 
replaced by brand new rules and regulations. Therefore, our 
primary task is study; managers of large and medium state 
enterprises in particular must study diligently. Enterprise 
managers should first study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics; second, new 
rules, regulations, and policies; and third, new knowledge and 
skills. In organizing study classes, it is necessary to 
mobilize all forces that can be mobilized to manage classes, 
including party schools, educational academies of cadres, and 
training centers of various departments, local governments, and 
enterprises. Particular attention must be paid to managing 
short-term intensive study and training classes oriented to 
entrepreneurs of the new period. We must comply with General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin's instruction on more time for study and 
less time for socializing, never relaxing our efforts at study 
regardless of work schedules. This is the basic requirement of 
entrepreneurs in the new period. 
  Zou Jiahua stated: Presently the State Council is selecting 
100 enterprises for pioneering the reforms, and is studying 
measures to further improve the external environment of 
enterprises. However, they should pay greater attention to 
their internal environment, continue to implement the 
"regulations" for changing the operating mechanisms of 
enterprises, and strengthen their internal management. The new 
measures for the reforms adopted by the government aim at 
helping state enterprises transform their operating system, 
enabling the enterprises to utilize their advantages to take 
part in market competition. Party organizations and leading 
cadres at all levels in enterprises should enhance their 
confidence, increase ideological work, and unite and lead the 
vast numbers of workers and staff to work hard together so that 
our large state enterprises will shine once again in market 
competition. 
  Wen Jiabao was present at the discussion.

<F P=106> [Report: "Results of Latest Opinion Poll in Beijing </F>
Indicate 55 Percent of Respondents Believe Political Stability 
Is Needed To Ensure Success of Reform; 59 Percent Are Most 
Concerned About Reform of Housing System"] 
  [Text] In a recent opinion poll conducted in Beijing, more 
than half the respondents believed that what was most needed to 
ensure the success of reform was a stable political environment, 
while about one-third of respondents thought that building the 
legal system was most needed, while housing reform and medical 
insurance reform came first on the list of livelihood items 
demanding improvement about which respondents were most 
concerned. 
  This poll, cosponsored by "Beijing Nine-Day Technology Park" 
and the State Statistical Bureau, was held at the end of last 
month. From 20 neighborhood committee districts in Beijing, 
1,000 resident households were selected at random and given a 
questionnaire. The results indicated that 55 percent of the 
respondents believed that a stable political situation was most 
needed for the success of reform; 34 percent of the respondents 
believed that building the legal system was most needed. On 
these two points, public opinion was in line with the 
understanding of the central authorities. Among all respondents, 
76.7 percent believed that the main threat to the reform was 
corruption, while 51.7 percent put bureaucracy as the main 
threat. 
  As to which reform the public was most concerned about, 59 
percent of the respondents thought it was reform of the housing 
system and 56 percent thought it was medical insurance reform. 
The levels of concern over other reform items were in the 
following order: the pension system (36.7 percent), the 
development of law (25 percent), the political system (23 
percent), education (21 percent), labor employment and the 
personnel system (19 percent), government organs (15 percent), 
unemployment insurance (13.5 percent), and state-owned 
enterprises (12 percent). Even people working in state-owned 
enterprises put the level of concern over pension reform in 
third place, next only to medical insurance and housing reforms. 
  In addition, on economic matters, 76 percent of the 
respondents believed that the mainland's economic development 
was very fast or relatively fast; 61.6 percent believed that the 
mainland's economic growth rate should be kept within a certain 
limit, which indicated that the concept of maintaining balanced 
development has taken root in people's minds after several 
twists and turns. Those who believed that China would become an 
economic power in the world within 20 years took up 45 percent 
of all respondents and 14.7 percent of them believed it could be 
achieved within 10 years.

<F P=106> [By Tsung Lan-hai (1350 5663 3189): "Fourth Plenary Session </F>
to be Held in March"] 
  [Text] Whenever the CPC faces a persistent internal 
controversy, especially at the senior level, a plenary session 
of the party to foster consensus seems to be the customary 
thing. Faced with many difficulties in reform in the new year, 
the party finds itself with many different opinions which it has 
to address urgently, so it has made necessary preparations for a 
grand meeting in March, and therefore news about convening the 
Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have 
come from the party. 
<H3>  CPC Central Committee Plans to Convene Fourth Plenary 
Session in Early March </H3>
  On 3 February, the CPC Central Committee General Office 
telephoned various ministries, commissions, and offices under 
the central authorities, the party committees of various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and various 
arms of service and the party committees of major military 
regions, telling them that the CPC Central Committee planned to 
convene the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, that various party committees should usher in the 
plenary session with actual work results, and that they would be 
kept informed of the exact date of the session. 
  Ding Guangen, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee, disclosed during a meeting with party and government 
leaders from Guangdong on 5 February that the Central Committee 
planned to convene the Fourth Plenary Session on 5 March or so, 
and that the session would last for three or four days. 
  A newsletter from the CPC Central Committee, dated 5 
February, disclosed that Jiang Zemin said when meeting non-party 
celebrities that the CPC Central Committee planned to convene 
the Fourth Plenary Session to strengthen understanding, unify 
thinking, and standardize action regarding some important issues 
at this time. He earnestly hoped non-party persons could offer 
ideas, proposals, and criticisms concerning the current work by 
the Central Committee, for non-party persons have a unique 
understanding of many conditions. 
<H3>  Hu Jintao: Usher in the Fourth Plenary Session With 
Consensus </H3>
  The Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee also disclosed 
that the theme at the Fourth Plenary Session is to further 
foster consensus and standardize action on maintaining a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy; to unify thinking on how to expedite the building of 
the socialist market economy, and on how to establish an 
integral and open market system which is characterized by 
orderly competition; and to summarize work in strengthening 
construction of leading party groups of various levels and the 
work in self-construction of party members, in particular, the 
issue of the recent anticorruption drive within the party will 
be addressed and new arrangements will be made. In addition, 
the session will also have to examine the topics to be discussed 
and adopted by the second session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress. 
  Hu Jintao said at a work meeting of the Secretariat in early 
February: The party's essential work must be to get rid of 
interference from controversies on nonessential topics within 
the party; and it is necessary to usher in the Fourth Plenary 
Session with unified understanding, unified thinking, and 
standardized action. 
  People are waiting to see if the Fourth Plenary Session can 
solve the contradictions and difficulties faced by the party.

<F P=106> [Report by Guo Yunling (6753 0336 5376): "State Council </F>
Gives Written Reply to the `National Program for Water and Soil 
Reservation'"] 
  [Text] Recently the State Council gave an official, 
written reply to the "National Program for Water and Soil 
Conservation," agreeing in principle to carry out the water and 
soil conservation work in accordance with the second 
proposition. This means that China now has a fundamental basis 
to go by in carrying out the work. 
  Soil erosion in China, which is enormous in magnitude and 
covers vast tracks of territory, has inflicted great harm on the 
country. It has brought about long-term low yields and poverty 
to localities, and even is endangering the subsistence of the 
masses of people in some localities. Moreover, the running down 
of silt in large quantities has caused floods and waterlogging 
along the lower reachers of rivers. To work out this national 
program for water and soil conservation, the Ministry of Water 
Resources organized national forces to conduct large amounts of 
investigation and study, scientific experiments, and observation 
analyses. 
  In its reply, the State Council stressed: To do a good job 
in water and soil conservation has a bearing on economic and 
social development and on ecological environmental improvement, 
and helps China shake off poverty and gain prosperity. It also 
has a bearing on the development and harnessing of rivers and 
lakes, as well as on the state's construction in the energy, 
railway, communications, and mining industries, and other areas 
of endeavor It is a basic national policy that will yield 
success in our time and will bring benefits throughout the ages. 
Therefore, we should uphold it for a long time. The reply 
pointed out: Water and soil conservation is a systems 
engineering undertaking. It must adhere to the principle of 
"prevention as the key factor, overall planning, comprehensive 
prevention and control, suiting measures to local conditions, 
and stressing better management and efficiency." Effective 
efforts should be made to ensure the prevention, protection, and 
supervision of soil erosion, and to ensure law enforcement work. 
The policy should be implemented whereby those who harness 
rivers and lakes and those who manage and protect them will reap 
the benefits therefrom. While devoting our primary efforts 
toward bringing the Huang He and the Chang Jiang under control, 
we also should pay close attention to checking soil erosion in 
other rivers and to the water and soil conservation work in the 
key soil erosion prevention and protection areas, supervision 
areas, and control areas at all levels. 
  The "National Program for Water and Soil Conservation" puts 
forward two propositions on soil erosion control, of which the 
second one suggests a a more rapid pace of control. The State 
Council's reply agreed in principle to carry out the water and 
soil conservation work in accordance with the second proposition.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Li Tao </F>
(2621 3447) and XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of 
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central Committee, Secretariat member, and Central Party School 
president, pointed out today at the opening ceremony for a new 
session of the Central Party School: China's reform, opening 
up, and modernization drive have entered a new phase of 
development. The new situation, the new tasks, and the new 
practice require the whole party to attach greater importance 
than anytime in the past to ideological education and 
theoretical studies; they require the leadership at all levels 
to study and master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and to constantly improve 
their understanding and leadership skills. 
  Attending the opening ceremony were students of the 16th 
class for leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level, 
the 22d class for cadres at the prefectural and department 
levels, classes for ethnic cadres from Xinjiang, classes for 
young and middle-aged cadres, classes for backbone theoretical 
and propaganda cadres, and personnel from branch schools at 
organs directly under the central committee and at state organs 
as well as from military units, 2,600 in all. 
  After analyzing the current situation at home and abroad, Hu 
Jintao pointed out: The majority of comrades taking course here 
are leading cadres in their respective fronts. Regardless of 
his position or the sector in which he is exercising leadership, 
every one of them needs to approach problems from a strategic 
high plane and from an overall point of view. The fact that 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping is good at using the Marxist stand, point 
of view, and method to approach to deal with problems from an 
overall strategic perspective is dominantly demonstrated in his 
works. Leading cadres at all levels must study and master them. 
Realistic analysis and understanding of the situation is a 
precondition and a basis for correct decision-making, for 
putting the interests of the party's work first, and for 
executing well the various tasks. Only by keeping closely in 
mind the current situation at home and abroad; by learning how 
to approach problems from an overall strategic perspective will 
we be able to be farsighted, to get a clear understanding of the 
situation, to have a good grasp of the overall situation, and to 
implement well the party's basic policy for this year in an 
all-round manner. 
  In his speech, Hu Jintao elaborated on the importance and 
urgency for leading cadres to take the lead in studying theory. 
He pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is the Marxism of 
contemporary China, and it serves as the spiritual pillar and 
scientific guide for our triumphant march forward. The party is 
leading people of all nationalities in the great practice of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In our march 
forward, there will inevitably be some complicated problems and 
difficulties which we have never encountered before. Especially 
in the process of accelerating the establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure, complex, deep-rooted problems will 
become even more pronounced with each passing day. Only by 
studying the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics will we be able to unify our understanding; have 
a good grasp of the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability; properly handle all sorts of contradictions in 
society; approach problems from an overall point of view; make a 
correct assessment of the situation; constantly improve our work 
in terms of adherence to principles, systematic approach, 
farsightedness, and creativity to ensure the smooth progress of 
reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. 
  Hu Jintao stressed: While studying the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must study theory and 
basic knowledge of the socialist market economy. We should, 
first of all, study -- in a comprehensive and systematic manner 
-- pertinent expositions contained in Deng Xiaoping's works and 
grasp its essence. Anyone interested in the theory of socialist 
market economy must read the report to the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee. We must study the principles, 
policies, and measures of reform formulated by the Central 
Committee for the establishment of a socialist market economy. 
We must also study basic knowledge of the socialist market

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 7 (CNS) -- Vice Minister of the 
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, Mr. Wu Jie, 
recently made an inspection tour of Zhuhai and Shenzhen where he 
said that scientific management over the economy in these 
special economic zones was the vital key to their build-up. 
  There were still many arduous tasks facing these zones, Mr. 
Wu said, such as the transfer of government functions, 
construction of legislation and the operation of the market 
economy. The personnel system still was not able to meet the 
demands of the market economy and spiritual civilization also 
faced a long-time task. These zones, therefore, had to exercise 
scientific management in order to meet the demands of the market 
economy. 
  Reform and work in various sectors in these zones, he said, 
should go forward at the same pace. For example, emphasis 
should not be only placed on a single item but should be put on 
the coordination of industrial structure and its promotion; it 
should not only be put on the economic build-up but on reform 
for the administrative system as well as the construction of 
morality, culture and ideology and not only on the introduction 
of foreign capital and opening to the outside world but on the 
restructuring of the economy. 
  Relevant departments and their staff should, Mr. Wu said, 
make full use of all the policies implemented in such zones, 
striving for realization of the strategic goals set for the 
zones by Deng Xiaoping.

  [Text] Wuhan, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Women now "hold up half 
the sky" in the designing of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway line, 
which is being busily worked on. 
  According to officials at the No.4 Institute of Surveys and 
Design of the Ministry of Railways, 529 of the 1,440 engineers 
and technicians involved in the surveys and design are women. 
  The institute, based in this provincial capital of central 
China's Hubei Province, is responsible for the overall design of 
the trunk railway line linking south and north China. 
  Some 125 woman engineers and technicians have been appointed 
as leaders in charge of professional designing -- about half of 
the leading technicians for the design of the whole 
Beijing-Kowloon Railway line. 
  Chen Dajing, a woman engineer in her 50s, worked 448 extra 
hours last year, completing the design of 22 bridge culverts and 
re- checked the designs for 19 other bridge culverts, fulfilling 
her set task six months ahead of schedule. 
  According to engineers in charge of the construction, China 
will use 105 items of new technology and equipment in the 
construction of this north-south trunk rail line, which are 
expected to greatly increase work efficiency and ensure the 
quality of the railway project.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "State Plans Massive Assault </F>
on Pollution"] 
  [Text] The government plans to develop eight major 
environmental projects in the next three years in a bid to 
control industrial pollution by the turn of the century. 
  The schemes will be supported by international financial 
organizations including the World Bank, the Asian Development 
Bank and Global Environmental Facilities (GEF). 
  Up to $1.2 billion is needed to launch the projects which 
will treat water and air pollution and dispose of solid waste, 
said an official from the Foreign Economic Co-operation Office 
of the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA). 
  The prevention of acid rain and studies on the environment 
are also high on the list of the planned projects, the official 
said. 
  NEPA is due to get grants of $200 million to $300 million 
from GEF to control greenhouse gases and to protect 
bio-diversity. 
  The agency is now selecting suitable projects around the 
country. Its reports will be sent to the international 
organizations for further evaluation. 
  NEPA officials hope the eight projects will solve 
environmental problems which damage people's health, like 
pollution in Lake Dianchi in Yunnan Province and Lake Chaohu in 
Anhui Province. 
  They also hope the projects will check the spread of acid 
rain in the south of the country. 
  In recent years, China has worked more and more with 
international organizations on the environment. 
  And by the end of last year, NEPA had set up 21 Sino-foreign 
environmental protection projects. 
  The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank had loaned the 
agency $1.14 billion by 1993 and, together with the GEF, they 
had granted China $65.61 million for environmental protection 
and research. 
  The funding helped environmental protection schemes in 
Shanghai and in Liaoning Province, research in Hangzhou Bay, and 
studies on urban infrastructure throughout China. 
  It also helped to promote local environmental protection 
work 
and improve NEPA's administrative capacity, said Xie Zhenhua, 
the agency's director. 
  Co-operation between China and the international agencies 
has 
enabled the country to obtain advanced environmental protection 
facilities and improved its environmental information network.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Cao Min: "Zou Demands Major Industrial </F>
Safety Drive"] 
  [Text] Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua has called for a nationwide 
campaign to protect workers following a horrific increase in the 
number of people killed in industrial accidents last year. 
  More than 60,000 people died in thousands of incidents 
across 
the country between January and October. 
  And Zou described the toll in lives and damage as 
unprecedented. 
  Governments at all levels should make every effort to stem 
the rise, he said on Tuesday to the third national 
tele-conference on industrial safety since July. 
  He also called for new laws to protect workers and to punish 
firms which put them in danger. 
  Protecting workers has an important role in China's economic 
development, said Zou, adding that governments and enterprises 
must do all they can to solve any problems. 
  "While the workers are making contributions to our country, 
we must bear responsibility for their safety," said Zou. 
  The tragic rise in the number of accidents was particularly 
marked in foreign-funded firms and collectively-run mines. 
  Zou called for new laws on industrial safety to be drafted 
as 
soon as possible and for the powers of watch dog groups to be 
strengthened. 
  And he stressed that any accident caused by negligence or 
bureaucracy must be punished severely. 
  Safety inspections should be carried out regularly, he said, 
adding that they should target accident black spots such as 
foreign- funded or township enterprises. 
  He also hoped the press could improve public awareness of 
the 
importance of industrial safety by high-lighting major accidents 
which claim many lives or cause severe damage. 
  Labour Minister Li Boyong blamed the accident figures on 
poor 
discipline, management, and operation and lack of proper 
supervision. 
  Li also accused some managers of going for higher output at 
the expense of their workers' safety. 
  He also attacked the illegal practice of dismantling firms 
safety supervisory departments as they restructured their 
managements.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhong He: "New Laws Regulate Religions"] </F>
  [Text] A seminar last week praised two new laws as 
important steps to set up a framework to govern religion. 
  Speakers at the meeting, sponsored by the State Council 
Religious Affairs Office and Legal Daily, saluted the 
Regulations for Management of Religious Sites and Regulations 
for the Management of Religious Activities of Aliens in the 
Territory of the People's Republic of China, signed by Premier 
Li Peng on January 31. 
  They said the laws demonstrate China's respect for the 
religious freedom of foreigners. 
  The rules guarantee foreigners the right to participate in 
religious activities and meet with Chinese religious personnel. 
But they also stipulate that foreigners should not interfere 
with Chinese religious groups or affairs. 
  Zhao Puchu, chairman of the China Buddhist Association, said 
authorities constantly solicited opinions from religious 
associations while drafting the regulations. He also urged the 
State Council to speed up drafting its basic law on religion. 
  The first article of the law on religious sites protects 
holy 
activities and spiritual areas, Zhao said. 
  Ding Guangxun, chairman of the China Christian Council, said 
the two laws will not cause any big changes in religious 
practice. 
  "They will not affect religion, for they add nothing new nor 
detract from anything we now have," he said. 
  "Foreigners must not recruit religious followers, appoint 
religious teachers, or conduct any other proselytizing 
activities among the Chinese people," Ding said quoting the 
eighth article of the law. 
  But, he added, Christians may continue to go to Chinese 
churches and lectures and exchange ideas. 
  Ding stressed the two laws must be translated properly to 
avoid misunderstandings. 
  Zhang Jiyu, deputy secretary-general of the China Taoist 
Association, said he hoped the laws will help prevent some local 
governments from infringing upon the rights of Taoist temples. 
  Shu Huaide, chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic 
Association, said the regulations will ensure the integrity of 
the church and promote understanding between believers and 
others. 
  Zhang Shengzuo, director of the Bureau of Religious Affairs, 
urged government officials and religious leaders to study the 
laws. 
  Those attending the meeting also offered suggestions on how 
to implement them. 
  Zhao Puchu said officials should carefully register 
religious 
sites. The government, he said, should not only register 
authorized temples, but also those where monks and nuns live and 
hold regular religious services. 
  Furthermore, authorities should clearly define what is 
considered "other religious activities" in the eighth article of 
the law pertaining to foreigners, he added. 
  An Shiwei, chairman of the China Islamic Association, 
pointed 
out that several mosques have been moved in the past 10 years 
during urban reconstruction. 
  "We should make sure that their property rights are not 
violated." he said. 
  China has 16 million Muslims, 6.5 million Protestants, 3.8 
million Catholics and 6 million Tibetan Buddhists. More than 
60.000 religious sites have been approved. 
  China also has 200,000 clergymen and 47 colleges for 
religious studies.

<F P=106> [By Karl Wilson, foreign editor] </F>
  [Text] In what will no doubt come as a shock to many of 
his followers, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, 
has admitted for the first time that his moderate approach to 
his homeland's independence from China has been a failure. 
  In a statement to mark the 35th anniversary of the Tibetan 
uprising in 1959 the Dalai Lama said: "I must now recognise 
that my approach has failed to produce any progress either for 
substantive negotiations or in contributing to the overall 
improvement of the situation in Tibet. Moreover, I am conscious 
of the fact that a growing number of Tibetans, both inside as 
well as outside Tibet, have been disheartened by my conciliatory 
stand not to demand complete independence for Tibet. Because of 
my statement, some Tibetans have come to believe there is no 
hope at all for the Tibetan people regaining their basic rights 
and freedoms. This, and the lack of any concrete results from 
my conciliatory approach towards the Chinese Government over the 
past 14 years, has caused disillusionment and underminded the 
resolve of some Tibetans." 
  The Dalai Lama said that in his negotiations with China to 
try and "restore freedom, peace, and dignity" to Tibet he had 
always sought to be guided by "realism, patience, and vision." 
  "For the past 14 years, I have not only declared my 
willingness to enter into negotiations but have also made 
maximum concessions in a series of initiatives and proposals 
which clearly lie within the framework for negotiations as 
stated by Deng Xiaoping in 1979 that `except for independence of 
Tibet, all other questions can be negotiated.' The ideas put 
forward in my Five Point Peace Plan for Tibet in 1987 and the 
Strasbourg Proposal in 1988 envisage a solution which does not 
ask for the complete independence of Tibet." 
  On both occasions the Chinese government refused to enter 
into negotiations with the Dalai Lama. "The issue," he said, 
"is not my return to Tibet but the survival of Tibet's six 
million people, its culture and civilization. I have made it 
clear that the negotiations must centre around ways to end 
China's population transfer policy, which threatens the very 
survival of the Tibetan people, respect for Tibetan's 
fundamental human rights and entitlement to democratic freedom, 
the de-militarisation and de-nuclearisation of Tibet, the 
restoration of the Tibetan people's control over matters 
affecting their own affairs, and the protection of Tibet's 
natural environment. 
  "I have always emphasised that any negotiation must comprise 
the whole of Tibet, not just the area which China calls the 
'Tibet Autonomous Region.'" Many exiled Tibetans have been 
critical of the Dalai Lama's moderate stance over the years and 
what many have considered his appeasement of China. 
  Tibet was incorporated into the People's Republic of China 
in 
1950. Nine years later the Dalai Lama and up to 60,000 of his 
followers fled into exile in India after a bloody revolt against 
Chinese rule. The Dalai Lama has maintained that since China's 
"occupation" of Tibet 1.2 million people have died. Others have 
described China's rule over Tibet as tantamount to cultural 
genocide. 
  "I had hoped that my middle-way approach would eventually 
create an atmosphere of mutual trust, conducive to fruitful 
negotiations, and exert a restraining influence on the 
repressive Chinese policies in Tibet," he said. "But the 
Chinese Government has rejected my overtures one after another 
and has consistently attempted to confuse the real issue. 
Meanwhile, the magnitude and gravity of the situation inside 
Tibet has dramatically escalated. 
  "Developments in Tibet have been marked by an 
intensification 
of the Chinese policy of suppression, the marginalisation of the 
Tibetan people in their own country, the gradual extermination 
of our unique culture and religion, and the destruction and 
exploitation of Tibet's environment," he said. 
  The Dalai Lama's initiatives for Tibet have been largely 
endorsed by the international community. China, however, 
maintains that Tibet is an integral part of the PRC. "I have 
left no stone unturned in my attempts to reach an understanding 
with the Chinese," he said. 
  The Dalai Lama said he would "remain committed to finding a 
peaceful and negotiated resolution to the issue of Tibet." He 
called for increased international political and economic 
pressure on China to "resolve the problem of Tibet peacefully 
and amicably".

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Let the Lei Feng Spirit Shine at </F>
Every Post"] 
  [Text] The third national seminar on the "drive for people 
in all walks of life to perform their duties in Lei Feng's way 
to develop new practices" opened yesterday. The deeds achieved 
in the drive to learn from Lei Feng by representatives of 
advanced units and individuals of 14 "window industries 
[representative and key industries]" across the land, which are 
vivid and touching, have reproduced and raised to a higher level 
the Lei Feng spirit, thus making positive contributions to 
advancing socialist culture and ideology. 
  As we face arduous tasks to accomplish the promotion of 
reform and economic construction, there is all the more need to 
use the Lei Feng spirit to unite and encourage the broad masses 
to work hard to make greater achievements and, on the other 
hand, to educate and stimulate the people to advance the pure 
and get rid of the evil, encourage healthy trends, and strive 
for social progress. 
  The "drive for people in all walks of life to perform their 
duties in Lei Feng's way to develop new practices," which was 
created by the people in the campaign to learn from Lei Feng, is 
very popular. Facts show that injecting the Lei Feng spirit 
into every ordinary work post to achieve socialist modernization 
and into every step the people take to attain their ideals, is a 
good and effective way of deepening the campaign to learn from 
Lei Feng in the new period and should be continued for a long 
time. 
  What is important in emulating Lei Feng is perseverance and 
practical results. To achieve this, we must have our feet 
planted firmly in our own work posts and give expression to the 
ideological principle of serving the people heart and soul in 
our work. The common characteristics of many people who have 
distinguished themselves in learning from Lei Feng are that they 
dedicate themselves wholly to their work, willingly do and dig 
into any job they are assigned, study hard, honestly perform 
their duties, work in a down to earth manner, and engage 
themselves in unostentatious hard work so that they can put on a 
first-rate work performance. We must advocate this spirit. It 
is of great practical importance to improve the work style of 
all trades through the campaign to emulate Lei Feng. Certain 
unhealthy trends usually find expression in professional 
characteristics. We must find out where the shoe pinches and 
conduct education on professional ethics in line with actual 
conditions so that we can encourage standing up for what is 
right and resisting what is wrong and inject the Lei Feng spirit 
into the work style of all walks of life and achieve substantial 
results. 
  It is necessary to integrate the drive with our efforts to 
comprehensively raise the general public's moral, cultural, and 
ideological levels to nurture a new generation. The fact that 
people cherish the memory of Lei Feng and wish that he would 
come alive again under the new situation reveals their hopes for 
fostering high social standards. The Chinese youth volunteers 
activities [zhong guo qing nian zhi yuan zhe huo dong 0022 0948 
7230 1628 1807 1959 5074 3172 0520], which have recently been 
organized in more and more urban and rural areas across the 
land, are welcomed by the masses. The masses are glad to see 
more and more people helping those in difficulty, taking 
pleasure in helping others, or enthusiastically promoting public 
welfare, which has resulted in the gradual formation of a 
mightily healthy trend. We should carry on such activities 
intensively, perseveringly, and in a down-to-earth manner and 
work unremittingly for the elimination of extreme individualism, 
mammonism, hedonism, and all sorts of objectionable phenomena. 
  The deeds of Comrade Xu Honggang, who rose gallantly for a 
just cause and risked his life for another, have aroused a 
strong echo in all walks of life. This reflects the love the 
masses cherish for heroes and the value they attach to a good 
social atmosphere. Every trade, area, and department should set 
a number of people up as advanced models who give expression to 
the Lei Feng spirit, to encourage other people to make progress 
in expanding the contingent of advanced elements. Propaganda 
departments must vigorously disseminate the deeds of advanced 
models and spread the use of advanced experience to cultivate a 
social climate of emulating and trying to catch up with advanced 
elements and to carry on the campaign to learn from Lei Feng 
intensively and perseveringly. 
  Party committees at all levels must sum up the experience 
created in the drive and strengthen their leadership of the 
drive. Leading cadres at all levels in particular, should set 
an example and take the lead in learning from Lei Feng. We are 
convinced that through the efforts of every member in society, 
the Lei Feng spirit will bear richer fruits in the new 
historical period and shine more brilliantly in the various work 
posts.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin met and had a cordial talk with Oliver Foot, 
president and executive director of Orbis International -- the 
world's only flying eye hospital -- here this afternoon. 
  During the meeting Jiang expressed appreciation of fruitful 
cooperation between Orbis and China, hoping that Orbis will make 
greater contributions to the work of the prevention and control 
of blinding diseases in the world. 
  Foot said the flying eye hospital has conducted the most 
successful cooperation with the Chinese Ministry of Public 
Health and run training courses on ophthalmology in Taiyuan, 
Shanxi Province, since its founding in 1982. 
  He told Jiang that Orbis has decided to present the Chinese 
government with the DC-8 special plane that the hospital once 
used, as an exhibit and a symbol of peace, cooperation and 
friendship. 
  "We welcome your decision," Jiang said. 
  Up to now, the hospital has helped restore the sight of more 
than 8,000 blind people. More than 7,000 eye doctors have been 
trained by the hospital. 
  Chen Minzhang, Chinese minister of public health, 
participated in the meeting.

  [Text] Washington, March 13 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
Administration is considering a proposal that Congress lift its 
ban on military aid to Pakistan in exchange for halting 
production of nuclear weapons materials. 
  The proposal would allow Pakistan to take possession of 
dozens of F-16 fighter planes it has already paid for but never 
delivered because of a Congress amendment, according to the NEW 
YORK TIMES today. 
  The amendment bans military aid to Pakistan unless the U.S. 
President can certify that Pakistan neither has nuclear weapons 
nor is trying to develop them. 
  U.S. officials were quoted as saying that the proposal is 
part of a policy to stem the spread of nuclear arms in South 
Asia. 
  The proposal implicitly recognizes that the U.S. has failed 
to prevent Pakistan from developing the ability to build a 
nuclear weapon and now is trying constrain the country's nuclear 
program, the newspaper said. 
  Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said that her 
country would not give up its nuclear program despite pressure 
from the United States.

  [Text] Moscow, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister of 
Bosnian Muslim-led Government Haris Silajdzic left here this 
afternoon after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev on Bosnian settlement. 
  Silajdzic, who arrived in Moscow this morning from France, 
held two hours of talks with Kozyrev. 
  Calling the talks "fruitful," the Russian foreign minister 
said, "an encouraging progress emerged in the recent past in 
settling the bosnian crisis in several spheres." 
  "It is important now not to lose and to develop the positive 
impetus and to try to consolidate it," Kozyrev stressed, summing 
up the results of his talks with Silajdzic. 
  Silajdzic, in turn, expressed his satisfaction with the 
results of the talks, noting that "prerequisites have emerged in 
the recent past to settle the Bosnian conflict." "This moment 
must not be lost," the prime minister stressed. 
  He said the Russian side can play a constructive role in 
promoting the talks on Bosnia, stating he favored "a more 
balanced policy for Russia on some aspects of the Yugoslav 
crisis." 
  In February, Russia's "go-between" efforts resulted in 
relaxing the air strikes crisis over Sarajevo, the capital of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "We hope that Russian battalion stationed around Sarajevo 
will play a positive role and will help preserve Sarajevo as a 
multinational city," Silajdzic said. 
  Turning to the achieved understanding on the formation of a 
Croatia-Muslim confederation, he stressed that its 
implementation is impossible without Serbs' agreement. 
  Bosnian Serbs leader Radovan Karadzic visited Moscow last 
week. His talks with Russian leaders resulted at least in a 
major accord on opening the Tuzla airport provided Russian 
observers are sent here. 
  The Bosnian prime minister also stressed, "we shall have a 
new version but all the same it will be based on the main thing 
-- territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Later today, Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic, who 
also 
is deputy prime minister of the Croatian Government, is due to 
arrive in Moscow for talks on Bosnian settlement.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Muslim leader 
Alija Izetbegovic said today that the Washington agreement 
reached between Croats and Bosnian Muslims is not aimed at any 
third party, including Serbs. 
  The agreement is the result of the interests of the Muslim 
and Croatian nationalities, Izetbegovic said over Croatian 
television. 
  This was the first explicit comment made by the Muslim 
leader 
on the preliminary accord signed in Washington on March 1, under 
which Bosnian Muslims and Croats will found a federation to be 
turned later into a confederation with Croatia. 
  But Izetbegovic stressed the integrity of Bosnia and ruled 
out the possibility of allowing Bosnian Serbs to take away part 
of the land to Serbia. 
  The federation accord obviously means the recapture of lost 
territory, he said. 
  The Muslim leader described the agreement as a major step 
toward peace and said that what is at issue now is how Serbs 
will act accordingly. 
  He reiterated his expectation that peace may come in late 
autumn.

  [Text] Ankara, March 10 (XINHUA) -- High-ranking officials 
from countries taking part in the mandate for anti-Iraqi 
Coalition Forces in northern Iraq met here today to discuss the 
ongoing operation. 
  Deputy foreign ministers from Turkey, France, the United 
States and Britain reviewed the implementation of the operation, 
expressing their satisfaction with the work. 
  In a joint statement issued after the meeting, they 
reiterated "the commitment to the preservation of the 
independence, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq." 
  They also said they oppose all acts and efforts that may 
lead 
to the division and dismemberment of Iraq. 
  The statement, meanwhile, also called upon the Iraqi 
Government to lift the economic blockade and remove all 
restrictions imposed upon the northern part of the country. 
  The participants said that the future political structure of 
Iraq must be determined by the "entire people of Iraq" 
peacefully and democratically. 
  During the meeting, France, Britain and the United States 
voiced their full support for Turkey's right of self-defense 
against the violence of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party 
(PKK), which has been launching attacks on public and military 
targets of Turkey from their bases in Northern Iraq. 
  They said the territory of Iraq should not be a safe-haven 
for the "terrorists." 
  Forty-eight warplanes from the U.S., Britain and France, 
backed by support and transport aircraft, have been carrying out 
daily patrols over northern Iraq since the Gulf war ended in 
late February 1991. 
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Turkish Deputy 
Foreign Minister Ozdem Sanberk said turkey explained in detail 
the heavy economic losses it continues to face due to the 1991 
Gulf war and the U.N. sanctions against Iraq. 
  France, Britain and the U.S. promised to consult further for 
ways and means of alleviating the heavy economic burden on 
Turkey, which is trying to resume its border trade with Iraq.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) --Qian Qichen, vice premier 
and foreign minister, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher began their first round of talks here this morning. 
  Christopher and his party were greeted by Qian Qichen on 
their arrival -- by car from the China World Hotel, where they 
are staying -- at the Diaoyutai State Guest House's Fang Fei 
Garden at exactly 1000 [0200 GMT]. The two foreign ministers 
shook hands warmly and exchanged regards. 
  In warmly welcoming Christopher's visit to Beijing, Qian 
Qichen said, "When we met in Paris more than a month ago, I 
reiterated my invitation to you to visit China." He pointed 
out: Our talks in Paris went very well. Qian Qichen said that 
he was looking forward to exchanging views with him on Sino-U.S. 
relations and other issues. 
  In thanking Qian Qichen for his welcome, Christopher said he 
has found that Beijing has changed a lot in the past decade. 
  Christopher arrived in Beijing yesterday evening together 
with his 110-odd delegation, which includes his wife, Mary 
Christopher; Madame Davis, assistant secretary of state for 
international security affairs [title as received]; and Frank 
Wisner, under secretary of defense [for policy]. 
  Beijing is the last leg of Christopher's 10-day, 
three-nation 
Asia-Pacific tour. This is a relatively high-level Sino-U.S. 
contact since the leaders of the two countries met in Seattle 
last November and is the second meeting between Qian Qichen and 
Christopher since they met in Paris on 24 January. 
  Christopher, who is 69 and the senior U.S. diplomat, was 
assistant secretary of state for the Carter administration. He 
assumed the post of secretary of state for the Clinton 
administration in January 1993. He is prudent and is not fond 
of contacts with the media. His speciality is "shadowboxing 
using words."

Saturday as China slammed a senior U.S. official for holding an 
illegal meeting two weeks ago with the country's leading 
dissident. "The action constituted interference in China's

Minister Qian Qichen said in a clear reference to the meeting 
between Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John 
Shattuck and celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng in Beijing on 
February 27. 
  China was "deeply disappointed" by the incident, Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin quoted Qian as telling Christopher 
during talks here which Shattuck himself attended.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, vice 
premier of the State Council and concurrently foreign minister, 
held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at 
the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this morning. 
  Qian Qichen said: The meeting between President Jiang Zemin 
and President Clinton in Seattle last November marked a new 
phase of Sino-U.S. relations. Since then, a favorable momentum 
for improving relations between the two countries has emerged, 
with the two sides increasing contacts and expanding 
cooperation. More than a month ago, we met in Paris and 
discussed every aspect of Sino-U.S. relations. Both sides 
expressed their wish to make progress through active efforts. 
We hope that Mr. Secretary of State's current visit will 
achieve concrete results [ju ti cheng guo 0367 7555 2052 2654]. 
  Qian Qichen said: "We are deeply disappointed at some things 
which happened prior to Mr. Secretary of State's visit. A 
senior U.S. official came to China to prepare for the secretary 
of state's visit and took actions that interfered in China's 
internal affairs without regard for Chinese law. Thereafter, 
the U.S. media played up [da si xuan ran 1129 5127 8694 2676] 
the event, and U.S. government officials attacked China time and 
again in their remarks. All these acts clearly go against 
President Clinton's statement in Seattle in which he emphasized 
that the United States supports a strong, stable, and prosperous 
China; they also disrupt [gan rao 1626 2371] the secretary of 
state's current visit." 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: "Sincerity on both sides and a good 
atmosphere are needed for dialogue. I hope to conduct a frank 
[tan shuai 0982 3764] dialogue with the secretary of state in an 
atmosphere of mutual respect so as to enhance mutual 
understanding, reduce troubles, and avoid confrontation, and so 
that our dialogue will help improve Sino-U.S. relations and make 
Mr. Secretary of State's current visit a success." 
  Christopher elaborated to the Chinese side on issues of 
concern to the U.S. side. Qian Qichen said: China is a country 
that stresses the rule of law. We can only do what Chinese laws 
allow us to do. 
  Qian Qichen also elaborated to the U.S. side on issues of 
concern to the Chinese side, such as U.S. arms sales to Taiwan 
and the sanctions it has imposed on China. 
  On Sino-U.S. cooperation in the fight against drug 
trafficking, Qian Qichen noted: China and the United States 
have signed the "Sino-U.S. Memorandum on Cooperation in Fighting 
Against Drug Trafficking." In January of 1990, a U.S. court, 
without regard to China's judicial sovereignty and repeated 
representations, granted political asylum to Wang Zongxiao, a 
criminal in the Jinliyu drug smuggling case, who had gone to the 
United States to testify. This has erected an obstacle to 
bilateral cooperation in fighting drug trafficking. 
  In discussing most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, Qian 
Qichen said: Mutual extension of MFN status by China and the 
United States is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial 
arrangement made by the two sides according to agreements on 
trade relations between the two countries; it is the basis of 
normal Sino-U.S. trade relations. Disruption of this basis will 
ruin the development prospects for Sino-U.S. economic relations 
and trade. This will bring harm to both China and the United 
States. The Chinese side is firmly opposed to any linkage 
between trade and issues that have nothing to do with trade. 
  Christopher said: Both the United States and China are 
countries that shoulder global responsibilities. Both sides 
share common interests in maintaining peace and security. The 
two countries share each other's views or hold similar views on 
many global and regional issues. Mutually beneficial economic 
relations and trade between the two countries are expanding, and 
they are contributing to the prosperity of both countries. A 
strong, stable, and prosperous China conforms to the national 
interests of the United States. President Clinton hopes that 
the United States and China will build a more constructive 
relationship. 
  The talks proceeded in a frank [tan shuai 0982 3764] and 
businesslike [ren zhen 6126 4176] atmosphere. 
  Present at the talks were Vice Foreign Minister Tian 
Zengpei; 
Xu Huizi, deputy chief of staff of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army; U.S. Ambassador Stapleton Roy; Undersecretary 
of State Lynn Davis; and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner. 
  After the talks, Qian Qichen hosted a luncheon in honor of 
Christopher and his delegation.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with visiting U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher on issues related to 
Sino-U.S. relations at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse here this 
morning. 
  The talks proceeded in a "candid and business-like" 
atmosphere, sources from the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. 
  In the talks, Qian noted that the meeting between Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle 
last November marked a new phase of development in bilateral 
relations. 
  Since then, a momentum for improving bilateral ties has 
emerged, with contacts increasing and cooperation expanding. 
  Over a month ago, Qian recalled, he and Christopher met in 
Paris and discussed every aspect of the bilateral ties, with 
both sides expressing the wish for improving bilateral relations 
with joint efforts. 
  "We hope that your current visit would achieve positive 
results," Qian told Christopher. 
  However, "we are deeply disappointed at things which have 
happened prior to the visit of the secretary of state," Qian 
said. 
  A top U.S. Government official came to prepare for 
Christopher's visit, and in disregard of Chinese laws, the 
official took actions interfering in China's internal affairs, 
he said. 
  Following that, the U.S. media made a fanfare of the event 
and U.S. Government officials time and again attacked China. 
  All those acts clearly go against President Clinton's 
statement in Seattle that the U.S. supports a strong, stable, 
and prosperous China, Qian said, adding that it also constitutes 
a harrassment to the current visit by the secretary of state. 
  Qian stressed that dialogue needs a good atmosphere and 
sincerity from both sides. 
  "I hope to conduct dialogue with the secretay of state on 
the 
basis of candidness and mutual respect" so as to enhance mutual 
understanding, reduce troubles, avoid confrontation and make the 
dialogue conducive to the improvement of the Sino-U.S. relations 
and to the success of Christopher's visit, Qian said. 
  Christopher elaborated to the Chinese side issues of U.S. 
concern. 
  Qian responded that China is a country ruled by law. "We can 
only do what Chinese laws allow us to do," Qian said. 
  Qian also elaborated what the Chinese side is concerned 
about, such as U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the sanctions it 
has posed against China. 
  On Sino-U.S. cooperation in the fight against drug 
trafficking, Qian noted that the two sides have signed a 
memorandum on jointly fighting against drug trafficking. 
  He said that in January 1990, a U.S. court, in disregard of 
China's judicial sovereignty, granted political asylum to Wang 
Zongxiao, a criminal of the goldfish case, who had gone to the 
U.S. for the purpose of testifying. 
  This has imposed an obstruction to Sino-U.S. cooperation 
against drug trafficking, Qian said. 
  Discussing the most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status, 
Qian 
pointed out that MFN is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial 
arrangement reached according to the bilateral trade agreement. 
It is the basis of normal Sino-U.S. trade relations and the 
disruption of it would ruin the prospects of Sino-U.S. trade 
relations, Qian said. 
  "This would bring harm to both China and the United States," 
Qian noted. 
  He reiterated, "The Chinese side is firmly opposed to any 
linkage between trade and issues that have nothing to do with 
trade." 
  Christopher said that both the United States and China are 
countries that bear global responsibilities. 
  Both sides share common interests in maintaining peace and 
security and have identical or similar views concerning many 
regional and international issues, he said. 
  He said the mutually beneficial trade relations are 
expanding, which is contributing to the prosperity of both 
countries. 
  Christopher reiterated that a strong, stable and prosperous 
China conforms to the interests of the United States. 
  President Clinton hopes that more constructive relations 
would be developed between the U.S. and China, Christopher told 
Qian. 
  Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and Deputy Chief 
of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xu 
Huizi attended the talks. 
  On the U.S. side are Ambassador Stapleton Roy, 
Undersecretary 
of State for International Security Affairs Lynn Davis and 
Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner participated in the 
130-minute talks. 
  Following the talks, Qian hosted a luncheon in honor of the 
U.S. visitors.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Sino-U.S. relations 
have been established only on the basis of common interests 
instead of on the basis of ideology or concept of values, said 
Premier Li Peng. 
  The disputes between the two country must be settled 
properly 
through consultation on an equal footing in the spirit of mutual 
respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences, 
the Chinese premier stressed, adding that the problems can only 
be complicated by exerting pressures unilaterally. 
  The Chinese premier made the statements during his meeting 
with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his 
party here this afternoon. 
  Premier Li Peng said that China attaches importance to the 
current visit by Christopher, hoping that candid talks might 
help enhance mutual understanding. 
  Recalling Christopher's China visit a decade ago, Premier Li 
Peng said that great changes have taken place in China as well 
as in the world, but the changing international situation has 
not in any way change the importance of the Sino-U.S. relations. 
  On the contrary, he said, the changing international 
situation has called for the enhancement of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  China has always approached the Sino-U.S. relations from the 
global perspective and from the fundamental interests of the two 
peoples, Premier Li Peng told U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  He said that the Chinese Government attaches importance to 
the Sino-U.S. relations and has made tremendous efforts toward 
improving and developing such relations, adding that in my 
government work report to the National People's Congress session 
two days ago, he reiterated again this stand of the Chinese 
Government. 
  Premier Li Peng reviewed the bilateral trade, which has in 
recent years, grown rapidly, with the trade volume topping 27.65 
billion U.S. dollars, increasing 10 times over that of 1979. 
  He said that China's economy is developing in a sustained, 
fast and steady manner and the market has kept expanding. Its 
import is expected to reach 1,000 billion U.S. dollars in the 
next seven years. 
  At present, transportation, telecommunications and energy 
industries, for which U.S. is a strong power, constitute the 
priority sectors of China's development, the Chinese premier 
said. If the Sino-U.S. relations go well, with the man-made 
obstacles removed, it would mean a historic opportunity for U.S. 
economic circles. 
  On human rights issue, Li said that China and the U.S. have 
different concepts regarding human rights. 
  China is a developing country, Li said. The population of 
the developing world makes up four-fifths of the world's total. 
  It is not fair to impose the human rights concepts of a 
developed country on a developing country, Li stressed. 
  China will never accept the human rights concepts of the 
United States, the premier asserted. 
  For a developing country, human rights are, first of all, 
the 
rights to survival and development. A person must first survive 
before talking about rights, Li said. 
  The disputes between China and the United States concerning 
human rights can be discussed on the basis of equality so as to 
enhance mutual understanding, the Chinese premier said, but 
there should be no putting-on of pressure. 
  Li Peng said that it is a mutually beneficial arrangement 
for 
the two countries to maintain normal trade relations. 
  "To speak frankly, if China's most favored nation status is 
cancelled, the losses incurred to the United States would be no 
smaller than those to China," said the Chinese premier. 
  China mainly relies on its internal market and has a strong 
capability of self-reliance, he added. 
  "What the U.S. would lose is a vast market," Li said. "We 
hope the U.S. side would handle this issue properly." 
  Christopher expressed agreement with Li's remarks in his 
government work report about the importance of Sino-U.S. 
relations. 
  He said that President Clinton regards the U.S. relations 
with China as conforming to the national interests of the United 
States. 
  He told the Chinese premier that the U.S. can cooperate with 
China on a wide ranging issues, both global and regional, both 
bilateral and multilateral, and both in the areas of peace and 
security. 
  The United States and China are both permanent members of 
the 
UN Security Council and the U.S. side is willing to improve its 
relations with China, he said. 
  Christopher also briefed Li on U.S. views on human rights 
and 
MFN. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and 
Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei were present at the meeting. 
  Present on the U.S. side were Ambassador Stapleton Roy, 
Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs Lynn 
Davis and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xin Huaishi (6580 2037 2514)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- At a meeting with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher at Zhongnanhai this 
afternoon, State Council Premier Li Peng said: Sino-U.S. 
relations have been established only on the basis of common 
interests instead of on the basis of ideology and concept of 
values. 
  Li Peng pointed out: The existence of disputes between China 
and the United States is a reality. We believe that the 
disputes between the two countries must be settled properly 
through consultation on an equal footing in the spirit of mutual 
respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences. 
The problems can only be complicated by exerting pressures 
unilaterally. 
  Li Peng said: China attaches great importance to the current 
visit by Secretary of State Christopher, hoping that candid 
talks may help enhance mutual understanding and facilitate the 
improvement and expansion of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Recalling Christopher's visit to China a decade ago, Li Peng 
said: Great changes have taken place in the world over the past 
decade and so has China's appearance taken on an entirely new 
look. However, the changing international situation have not in 
any way changed the importance of Sino-U.S. relations. On the 
contrary, the changing international situation has called for 
the enhancement of Sino-U.S. cooperation in various fields. 
China has always approached Sino-U.S. relations from the global 
perceptive and from the fundamental interests of the two 
peoples. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to 
relations with the United States, and has made tremendous 
efforts toward improving and developing such relations. In my 
government work report two days ago, I reiterated the Chinese 
Government's positive desire for improving and developing 
Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Discussing Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations, Li Peng 
said: The Chinese and U.S. economies are strongly complementary 
to each other. Bilateral trade and economic relations have 
developed rapidly in recent years, with the trade volume 
reaching $27.65 billion, increasing more than 10 times over the 
figure for 1979. Chinese economy is developing in a sustained, 
rapid, and steady manner [chi xu kuai su ping wen 2170 4958 1816 
6643 1627 4489] and the market has kept expanding. China's 
imports are expected to reach $1,000 billion over the next seven 
years. At present, the transport, energy, and 
telecommunications industries, in which the United States is a 
strong power, constitute the priority sectors for China's 
development. If Sino-U.S. relations are improved [gao hao le 
2269 1170 0055], with the man-made obstacles in bilateral trade 
and economic cooperation removed, U.S. economic circles will 
find in China a historic opportunity for expanding Sino-U.S. 
economic and trade relations. 
  Touching on human rights issue, Li Peng said: China and the 
United States have different concepts regarding human rights. 
China is a developing country. The population of the 
developing world makes up four-fifths of the world's total. It 
is not fair to impose the human rights concepts of a developed 
country on a developing country. China will never accept the 
human rights concepts of the United States. For a developing 
country, human rights are, first and foremost, the rights to 
survival and development. He said: "Human rights, human rights! 
A person must first survive before talking about rights. The 
disputes between China and the United States concerning human 
rights can be discussed on the basis of equality so as to 
enhance mutual understanding, but there should be no application 
of pressure." 
  Turning to the most-favored-nation [MFN] issue, Li Peng: It 
is a mutually beneficial arrangement for the two countries to 
maintain normal trade and economic relations. To speak frankly, 
if China's MFN status is canceled, the losses incurred to the 
United States will be no smaller than those to China. China 
mainly relies on its internal market and has a strong capability 
of self-reliance. What the United States will lose is a vast 
market. We hope the U.S. side will handle this issue properly. 
  Christopher expressed agreement with Premier Li Peng's 
remarks on the great importance of Sino-U.S. relations. He 
said: President Clinton regards U.S. relations with China as 
conforming to the national interests of the United States. The 
United States can cooperate with China on a wide range of 
issues, both global and regional, both bilateral and 
multilateral, and both in the peace, security, and economic 
areas. The United States and China are both permanent members 
of the UN Security Council, and the U.S. side is very much 
willing [shi fen yuan yi 0577 0433 1959 1942] to improve its 
relations with China. 
  Christopher also briefed Li Peng on U.S. views on human 
rights and MFN. 
  Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and concurrently foreign 
ministers; Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei; U.S. Ambassador 
to China Stapleton Roy; Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis; and 
Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wiser were present at the 
meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (YONHAP) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng called a nuclear-free Korean peninsula a matter of greater 
interest to his country than to the United States in talks with 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher Saturday, advising 
against any other method than diplomacy and patience in solving 
the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  Li mentioned the issue first in the afternoon meeting with 
Christopher, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry told a 
press briefing. He quoted the premier as saying that hopes for a 
non- nuclear Korean peninsula are higher for China than for the 
United States and emphasized the international community should 
not mobilize any ther?iplomacy with patience to solve the 
problem. 
  Christopher, in response, rated Beijing's constructive role 
in realizing the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons, 
McCurry said. 
  The two countries noted with positiveness that the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection has resumed 
in North Korea, said the spokesman. 
  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin confirmed that 
the North Korean nuclear issue came up at the Li-Christopher 
meeting. He said the U.S. side registered concern at the 
situation but the Chinese officials delivered their position 
that the matter must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and 
cooperation.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin told visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher here today that better Sino-U.S. relations not only 
accord with the common desire of the Chinese and American 
peoples but meet the need of world peace and stability. 
  Jiang made the statement in a 70-minute meeting with Warren 
Christopher who is in the third day of his China visit. 
  Jiang noted that during the past 45 years, the Sino-U.S. 
relations have experienced many twists and turns, with both 
positive and negative experience to be drawn from. 
  Practice shows that the Sino-U.S. relations can move forward 
so long as both sides view things from a world-wide perspective, 
proceed from the fundamental interests of the two peoples, 
respect each other, transcend their differences in ideology and 
expand cooperation. This will bring benefit to the two peoples 
and is favorable to world peace and stability as well. 
  Otherwise, the bilateral ties will meet with difficulties 
and 
even suffer setbacks, he said. "We should all bear in mind the 
lessons in history." 
  Recalling his meeting with U.S. President Clinton in Seattle 
last November, Jiang said he had told Clinton that the Sino-U.S. 
ties is not only a matter of bilateral relations. It should be 
viewed in a world-wide perspective and in the context of the 
approaching 21st century. 
  China and the U.S. have common interests on many important 
issues, Jiang continued, stressing that the two sides should 
increase trust, reduce troubles, expand cooperation and avoid 
confrontation. 
  "President Clinton shared my views. We all agreed that the 
Sino-U.S. relations should be handled with a long-term point of 
view and considered in a broader perspective. The differences 
should be resolved through dialogue and one side should not 
impose its views onto the other," Jiang said. 
  He held that due to different social systems and ideologies, 
it is natural that China and the U.S. have differences on some 
issues, which should not become obstacles to the expansion of 
mutually beneficial cooperation. 
  As both China and the U.S. are sovereign states, they can 
discuss their differences on the basis of equality and mutual 
respect, and no one should interfere in the other's internal 
affairs, he said. 
  Concerning the issue of human rights, Jiang pointed out, 
"some people in the west are concerned not with the interests 
and welfare of the broad masses of the Chinese people but only a 
small number of people who attempt to subvert the Chinese 
Government and undermine China's stability. This in essence is 
not an issue of human rights but a political and legal issue. 
  The government of every country is bestowed with the 
responsibility and obligation of upholding law and order and 
maintaining political stability. It is groundless for some 
people to accuse the Chinese Government in this regard," Jiang 
stressed. 
  Christopher conveyed President Clinton's regards to 
President 
Jiang, saying that Clinton is determined to build a broader and 
more constructive relations between the U.S. and China. 
  The two sides should seize the opportunity and take positive 
actions to push forward the bilateral ties, said Christopher. 
  He also briefed Jiang on the U.S. views on human rights, the 
most favored nation status, proliferation of weapons and other 
issues. 
  Jiang asked Christopher to convey his good wishes to 
President Clinton at the end of the meeting which proceeded in a 
"frank and candid atmosphere," according to a Chinese official. 
  Among those present at the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, U.S. Ambassador to China 
Stapleton Roy and senior U.S. officials accompanying Christopher 
on the visit.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen expressed confidence Monday that Washington would renew 
Beijing's MFN status, while continuing to insist that Beijing 
would not give in to US pressure on human rights. "I believe 
that Sino-U.S. trade will continue," Qian told journalists after 
his second meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher who leaves here Monday at the end of a frosty 
four-day visit that has focused on the human rights issue. 
  "There is no such thing of China implementing U.S. orders 
and 
laws," said Qian, reiterating Beijing's opposition to 
Washington's linkage of improvements in China's human rights 
record to this year's renewal of Beijing's most-favoured-nation 
(MFN) status. 
  "China is opposed to linking MFN and human rights. China and 
the U.S. have different human rights concepts. It's worthless 
to put pressure on human rights," he said. 
  Despite Washington's warning and condemnation of a recent 
round-up of some 15 dissidents, the Chinese side has all along 
appeared confident that the United States would not dare 
jeopardise its lucrative commercial ties with China by 
withdrawing MFN. 
  Qian did not announce any major progress in resolving the 
two 
sides differences, saying only that they had signed an agreement 
setting out guidelines for the implementation of a 1992 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) on prison labour exports. 
Washington has complained that China has failed to observe the 
MOU. 
  Monday's agreement promises rapid arrangement of visits by 
U.S. teams to Chinese prisons suspected of producing goods for 
export. 
  The two sides also decided to establish a joint military 
commission to develop cooperation in this area, Qian announced.

surveys with regard to three MIA cases which occured during the 
Vietnam war.

"U.S. Human Rights Diplomacy Runs Into Snags in Beijing"] 
  [Text] When he was in Australia and Japan, U.S. Secretary 
of State Christopher, who is regarded in the United States as a 
hardliner toward China, kept telling people that the purpose of 
his visit to China was to "discuss the human rights issue." He 
probably thought that with the threat to rescind China's 
most-favored nation [MFN] trade status, China would make 
concessions to his human rights diplomacy, and thus he would be 
able to announce to the world that it was effective to use the 
human rights issue to engage in blackmail. He did not expect 
that his practice would never be effective with the Chinese 
people. Yesterday, the Chinese leaders bluntly told him that 
China would never accept the U.S. concept of human rights. The 
U.S. human rights diplomacy really has run into snags in China, 
a country with a population of 1.2 billion people. 
  The Chinese leaders pointed out that China and the United 
States have no common ideology and values, so it is natural that 
they hold different points of view on human rights. China is a 
developing country, and the population of the developing 
countries in the world accounts for four-fifths of the world's 
total population. It is unfair to impose the human rights 
concept of the developed nations on the developing countries. 
Moreover, the U.S. accusations concerning China's human rights 
problem were aimed merely at encouraging a very small number of 
criminal offenders, and it is a matter of certainty that China 
could not accept them. In fact, apart from the human rights 
issue, there remain differences between China and the United 
States in many aspects. It is ridiculous to require China to 
accept the U.S. position on every issue. There are indeed 
differences between the two countries, and this can be solved 
only through consultations on an equal footing and in a spirit 
of mutual respect, through efforts to seeking common ground 
while reserving differences. At the same time, China is willing 
to maintain and develop relations with the United States. It 
holds that to do so is in the common interests of both countries 
and is beneficial to both nations. 
  However, while pursuing its human rights diplomacy, the 
United States went so far to unreasonably link bilateral trade 
with the human rights issue in an attempt to force China to 
accept its human rights position. It threatened to rescind 
China's MFN trading status if China refused to do this. Indeed, 
they regard this as an effective "weapon," and have been 
wielding it again and again over the past few years. Some 
Americans wrongly thought that the MFN status was a great 
"favor" they gave to other nations. This practice of theirs was 
opposed, even by some of their allies. On 12 March, the head of 
the EU delegation in China reiterated: "The European Union does 
not agree with the practice of linking the human rights issue 
with trade." This time, the Chinese side frankly expressed its 
position to Christopher, and also put all its cards on the 
table. If the United States indeed rescinds China's MFN status, 
then it will only ruin the prospects for Sino-U.S. economic and 
trade relations. Thus, China will not be the only one to suffer 
losses, and the United States will suffer losses no less than 
those suffered by China. China's development will depend mainly 
on its domestic market, and China has strong capability for 
self-reliance. The United States, however, will lose a huge 
market. China has expressed its position very clearly, and it 
is the U.S. Government that should make the choice. It is 
believed that the Chinese Government has made good preparations 
against various possibilities and will not hold any unrealistic 
illusions. China has learned a good lesson from last year's 
"Yinhe" accident and the disgusting performance of some U.S. 
congressmen in opposing China's bid to host the Olympic Games. 
  At last year's Seattle meeting, U.S. President Clinton 
repeatedly said that the United States supports a strong, 
stable, and prosperous China. Facts show that the words and 
deeds of many U.S. officials went against this promise. They 
just tried by every possible means to create trouble between the 
two countries, and their purpose was simply to obstruct the 
appearance of a strong, stable, and prosperous China. It is a 
pity that this is only their fond dream.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China Upholds Sovereignty, United States </F>
Hesitates About What Move To Make"] 
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Christopher gave prominence 
to the human rights issue before and during his current visit to 
China, and announced that he had the support of more than 200 
U.S. senators and congressmen. He stressed that the human 
rights issue would be linked with the issue of China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] status. Before his visit, he sent 
Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck ahead of him to make 
arrangements and to contact a very small number of people who 
have attempted to undermine China's stability and to collect 
pretexts for not extending MFN. Christopher thought that as 
long as he wielded the human rights club, he would certainly be 
able to gain something from his visit to China, not only 
interfering in China's internal affairs but also opening up the 
Chinese market and creating a new model of diplomacy between the 
two countries by forcing China to swallow his bitter medicine. 
  However, China firmly adhered to its position and firmly 
rejected the U.S. concept of human rights. It reiterated that 
no one could interfere in China's internal affairs. 
  Qian Qichen, Li Peng, and Jiang Zemin successively met with 
Christopher. They mentioned that China and the United States 
face a historical opportunity for economic and trade 
cooperation, and also talked about China's own concept of human 
rights. On the issue of human rights, the two sides frankly 
expressed their own opinions and arguments. The three Chinese 
leaders expressed the same point of view, and firmly safeguarded 
China's sovereignty. Premier Li Peng pointed out: "China and 
the United States hold different concepts of human rights. It 
is unfair to impose the human rights concept of the developed 
countries on developing countries. China and the United States 
can discuss their differences on the issue of human rights on an 
equal footing, and no pressure should be exerted by one side on 
the other. If MFN is rescinded, China will not be the only one 
to suffer losses, and losses suffered by the United States will 
not be smaller than those of China. China mainly relies on its 
domestic market and has a strong self-sufficient ability. If 
Sino-U.S. relations are good, economic and trade cooperation 
between the two counties will be free from artificial 
hindrances, and U.S. business circles will have a historical 
opportunity for development." 
  Li Peng said China's imports would increase to $1,000 
billion 
over the next seven years, and many imported items will be in 
areas which are strong points of the United States. On the 
other hand, Christopher conceded that his visit to China was 
aimed at seeking a long-term and stable cooperative relationship 
with China. 
  Li Peng's arguments were mainly focused on the practical 
advantages of Sino-U.S. cooperation, and were quite convincing 
for the U.S. side. 
  President Jiang Zemin responded to Christopher's viewpoint 
about linking the human rights issue with trade from an overall, 
long-term, and strategic point of view. Christopher's current 
visit to the East is aimed at implementing President Clinton's 
diplomatic policy toward the East. The United States is trying 
to make use of the opportunity of Asia's vigorous economic 
development to build closer relations with various Asian 
countries. If Christopher forgot this strategic task, he would 
just have returned home with both hands empty. Therefore, 
President Jiang Zemin proceeded from a strategically 
advantageous position in his talks with Christopher by reviewing 
his meeting with President Clinton. He said: "Sino-U.S. 
relations are more than bilateral relations. We should approach 
our bilateral relations from a worldwide view and give 
consideration to future development, especially in the 21st 
century. China and the United States share common interests on 
many major issues. So both sides should increase mutual trust, 
reduce trouble, develop cooperation, and prevent confrontation. 
President Clinton expressed agreement with my opinion." How 
come the U.S. position endorsed by Clinton changed when 
Christopher came to China? Christopher did not respond to this 
point. 
  Jiang Zemin mentioned Christopher's personal experience of 
the process of normalizing Sino-U.S. relations during the Carter 
administration, and affirmed that he had good knowledge of the 
history of Sino-U.S. relations. In the past 45 years, Sino-U.S. 
relations have undergone innumerous twists and turns, and there 
have been both positive and negative experiences. "If both 
sides transcend ideology to develop cooperation, Sino-U.S. 
relations will advance. This is not only beneficial to both 
peoples but is also conducive to world peace and stability. If 
things go in the opposite direction, Sino-U.S. relations will 
encounter difficulties and setbacks." As far as human rights is 
concerned, Jiang Zemin pointed out sharply: Some people in the 
West are not really concerned about the rights, interests, and 
prosperity of the vast number of Chinese people; instead, they 
are only concerned about a small number of people who try to 
subvert the Chinese Government and undermine China's stability. 
"This is in essence a political issue and a legal issue rather 
than a human rights issue." China's viewpoint is identical with 
that held by other Asian countries. Even Lee Kuan Yew agrees 
with this. If these trouble-makers take power, China will be 
thrown into major chaos, and this would be unfavorable to the 
Chinese people. 
  On completing his visit to Beijing, Christopher did not 
smile, because even the American Chamber of Commerce was opposed 
to his diplomatic approach. He had thrown away a golden 
opportunity to promote Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations 
and had returned with both hands empty. An American businessman 
pointed out: Human rights should not be linked with MFN, which 
should be given to China unconditionally. If favorable tariff 
arrangements between the two countries are removed, U.S.-Chinese 
relations will regress. In that case, China's losses would just 
be temporary, but losses suffered by the United States would be 
long-term losses. 
  If the United States really wants to share in Asia's 
economic 
prosperity, President Clinton should actually honor his policy 
of supporting "a strong, stable, and prosperous China, which is 
in the national interests of the United States." If their deeds 
do not match their words and they still attempt to create 
trouble in China's political situation, then what they do will 
not be in the long-term interests of the United States; neither 
will this be favorable to peace, stability, and prosperity in 
Asia. After his debates with Chinese leaders, Christopher 
hesitated about what move to make. He did not express a clear 
position on MFN and behaved rather prudently. He needs to 
discuss with President Clinton to see whether the United States 
can actually use this card. It is certain that U.S. business 
circles will not support a diplomatic policy that will just harm 
the U.S. economy, because imposing sanctions against China is in 
fact an act of imposing sanctions against the United States 
itself.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (AFP) -- Two American journalists 
have been released after being held by police for six hours 
after interviewing the wife of a Chinese dissident, Western 
reporters said Saturday. 
  Nick Driver, of the US news agency UPI, and Matthew Forney, 
a 
correspondent with Newsweek magazine, were stopped by six 
uniformed police at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday as they left the 
home of the wife of dissident Liu Nianchun, 46, in the west of 
the capital. 
  Police said their car had collided with a telegraph pole 
when 
they parked their vehicle, bringing down telephone lines. The 
journalists did not deny this. But then about 30 police took 
turns interrogating them separately about their connection with 
the dissident and their conversation with his wife. 
  Before the Americans' release early Saturday at about 2 a.m. 
(1800 GMT Friday), police made them sign a document in which 
they agreed not to report what occurred during the course of the 
night. 
  The incident took place as US Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher was on an official visit to Beijing for talks on 
human rights. It also coincided with a crackdown by police 
against dissidents and activists which began at the start of the 
month. 
  According to a Human Rights Watch/Asia report Friday, Liu, 
who was jailed for three years in the 1980s, was one of those 
briefly detained and "may be in imminent danger of arrest." 
Liu, a longtime pro-democracy activist, called at the start of 
the week for the formation of an independent trade union, The 
League for the Protection of Working People. 
  The union's charter focuses on some of the negative 
consequences of rapid economic growth and calls, among other 
things, for the restoration of the right to strike and for the 
legalisation of independent workers' and peasant labour unions. 
  Liu is also a signatory of the Peace Charter issued by 
several dissidents in October 1993.

Detain, Interrogate Western Reporter"] 
  [Excerpts] The Chinese public security authorities have 
detained one more Western reporter, a female journalist with the 
BBC. She was the fourth Western journalist detained and 
interrogated within 48 hours. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday, the Chinese authorities detained and interrogated 
Carrie Gracie, a female journalist with BBC. She was taken away 
for interrogation when she was going to go out by car with three 
Chinese friends. 
  Before that, she had met and talked with some Chinese 
friends 
who were regarded as dissidents. According to reports by 
foreign news agencies, Gracie was taken away at 0200 in the 
early morning and the interrogation lasted until 0600. 
  According to one of her friends, the Chinese public security 
authorities mainly interrogated her about the content of her 
talk with her Chinese friends in the late afternoon. Finally, 
they said that she did not follow the law by carrying her 
reporter's identification card, and asked her to sign some 
papers before releasing her. Her three friends also were 
released after being interrogated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- China is confident of 
ensuring a steady transition of power and continued prosperity 
in Hong Kong despite Britain's uncooperative attitude, said Lu 
Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under 
the State Council. 
  He told a report meeting on the current situation organized 
by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China today that the fundamental reason for 
the differences on the political system in Hong Kong is that the 
British side has changed its policy on the Hong Kong issue and 
adopted an uncooperative and even antagonistic stance in an 
attempt to maintain its influence after 1997. 
  He noted that since the very beginning of the talks, the 
British side showed no sincerity and stubbornly stuck to its 
political reform bill that violates the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law of 
the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong and the relevant 
understanding and agreements reached between the two countries. 
  Not long ago, the Hong Kong Legislative Council, under the 
control of the British side, passed that package, thus shutting 
the door to talks, he said. 
  The British side went on to publish a white paper to 
disclose 
the detailed contents of last year's Sino-British talks without 
notifying the Chinese side, distorting facts and launching a 
round of fierce attack against China. 
  In reply, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman revealed a 
large 
number of facts to show that the responsibility for the 
termination of the talks between the two sides rests totally on 
the British side. 
  On the new airport issue in Hong Kong, Lu Ping said that the 
Chinese Government has always supported the Hong Kong 
Government's efforts to build a new airport. However, he said, 
the British side violated the memorandum of understanding 
reached between the two sides and passed a financial bill for 
the new airport which means a huge burden for the future Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Regional government. 
  At present, he said, the Chinese Government is negotiating 
with the British side on the fourth budget of the bill in a bid 
to solve the financial issue of the new airport on the basis of 
the memorandum of understanding so that the new airport will be 
completed as much as possible before 1997.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren stressed here today that Sino-Luxembourg cooperation 
enjoys "good prospects," while meeting with His Royal Highness 
Prince Henri, hereditary grand duke of Luxembourg, who arrived 
here Friday [11 March] on a six-day visit to China. 
  Since China and Luxembourg established diplomatic ties in 
1972, bilateral political and economic relations have been 
improved remarkably, Rong said. 
  Over the past one or two few years, Rong noted, the 
bilateral 
contacts have kept growing, and economic and trade cooperation 
gained new progress thanks to joint efforts of both sides. 
  Though far away from each other geographically and different 
in domestic situations, China and Luxembourg share the same hope 
for a peaceful international environment and to develop each 
other's economy and improve livelihood of the people, Rong said. 
  Rong noted that the development of bilateral friendship and 
cooperative relations is beneficial for both China and 
Luxembourg and it has a bright future. 
  After being briefed on China's economic development, Prince 
Henri said tremendous progress has been scored in China's 
economy since his last trip to China in 1988. 
  In spite of its size as a small nation, Luxembourg attaches 
great importance to the expansion of its relations with China, 
and the two countries should strengthen cooperation in various 
fields, he said.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Romanian 
President Ion Iliescu said here today that the construction of 
Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, has been "quite 
successful". 
  He noted that Romania is very interested in China's 
experience with special economic zones and willing to learn from 
such experience. 
  The Romanian president made the remarks in a talk with Wu 
Jie, Chinese vice-minister of the State Commission for Economic 
Restructuring, who, entrusted by the Chinese Government, came 
down to Shenzhen from Beijing to accompany Iliescu on his south 
China working visit. 
  Wu Jie conveyed greetings from Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
and premier Li Peng to Iliescu. 
  He said both Jiang and Li expressed a warm welcome to 
Iliescu 
on his south China tour and they wish his working visit a 
complete success. 
  Wu noted that Jiang and Li, who are very much interested in 
Sino-Romanian relations, expressed their satisfaction in the 
development of the two countries' ties. 
  He added that the two Chinese leaders would like to make 
joint efforts with the Romanian president to push forward 
Sino-Romanian ties in every field. 
  Iliescu expressed his thanks for the greetings from Jiang 
and 
Li. 
  Wang Zhongfu, vice-mayor of Shenzhen city, briefed the 
Romanian guests on the achievements of the city's economic 
construction. 
  Iliescu and his party arrived here last night. His current 
south China tour serves as the continuation of his China visit 
in 1991, during which he went back home ahead of schedule 
because of the Gulf War. They will also visit Zhuhai and 
Guangzhou.

  [Text] Taipei, March 12 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan said on 
Saturday [12 March] that the implementation of the Fair Trade 
Law has opened a new era of law and ethics for the Taiwan 
economy. 
  Addressing the opening ceremony of a three-day international 
seminar on fair trade at the Taipei International Convention 
Center, Lien noted that the Fair Trade Law has become an 
important part of Taiwan's strategy to promote economic 
liberalization and internationalization. 
  Fair competition will help ensure that all walks of life 
benefit from the results of economic development, and fair 
rules, which are the basis of economic ethics, will pave the way 
for fair competition, he stressed. 
  The premier expressed the hope that discussions at the 
international forum will help promote the planning and 
enforcement of Taiwan's fair trade policies, thereby effectively 
safeguarding a fair trade order for domestic enterprises. 
  Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the cabinet-level Fair Trade 
Commission, said that Taiwan's Fair Trade Law has had positive 
impact on regulating the domestic trading order since it took 
effect in February 1992. The commission is sponsoring the 
seminar. 
  Guests present at the opening ceremony included Finance 
Minister Lin Chen-kuo and legislators C.C. Lin, Y.C. Hung, C.C. 
Lo, and W.P. Chiang. 
  Gerhard Schricker, director of Germany's Max Planck 
Institute, delivered the keynote speech on "maintaining 
competition" following the ceremony. 
  Twenty officials, scholars, and experts from the United 
States, Germany, Britain, Italy, Sweden, Japan, Australia, and 
the European Union are joining 200 of their Taiwan counterparts 
at the forum. 
  Participants will focus on such topics as monopolies, unfair 
competition, international conciliation, and enforcement 
cooperation.

Executive Yuan Premier Lien Chan's Special Report Delivered at a 
Monthly Meeting Held by the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee 
on 10 January To Commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen"] 
  [Text] Chairman, Respectable Seniors, and Fellow Members: 
  Today, the Central Committee held a monthly meeting in 
January to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen. It is a great honor for 
me to be entrusted to deliver a work report on administration at 
the meeting, and to explain to respectable seniors my 
administration ideals and concepts as well as the orientation 
for our efforts. First of all, I would like to wish everyone 
present here a Happy New Year; may everything turn out as you 
wish. Meanwhile, I also hope that I shall be able to draw up 
new plans and usher in a new situation under the guidance of the 
president and all respectable seniors so as to make new 
contributions to the party and our country. 
  Looking back on the past decade, we may say that the period 
constituted a stage in which the Republic of China [ROC] made 
the fastest progress in history. In politics, we lifted martial 
law and the ban on political parties and newspapers, terminated 
the period of mobilization for suppressing the communist 
rebellion, held elections for all the members of the National 
Assembly, and amended the Constitution by stages. As a result, 
we have laid a foundation for a certain scale of party politics, 
and the breadth and depth of our democracy is catching up with 
that of the advanced countries in Europe and America. In our 
economic activities, oriented by the drive to liberalize and 
internationalize our economy, we stepped up capital construction 
and dedicated ourselves to upgrading the industries. As a 
result, the ROC has evolved from an economically developing 
country to a rising industrial country. In cross-strait 
relations, we lifted the ban on people's travel across the 
Taiwan Strait to visit their families, expanded cultural and 
economic exchanges between the two peoples, caused both sides of 
the Taiwan Strait to evolve from long-term separation to 
mutually beneficial exchanges, admitted the reality of 
separation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and their 
separate rules at present, insisted that the reunification of 
China should be achieved under the prospect of the establishment 
of a system in which all people are free and equally rich and by 
democratic and peaceful means, and, following this principle, 
opened up more space for international activities to maintain 
the position, rights, and interests that our country should 
have. In culture, the modern Chinese culture's capability to 
bring forth new ideas and to contain differences as well as its 
plurality blossomed in the garden of academic and creative 
freedom and condensed into a sense of living community. In 
addition, in society, the ideals of justice and fairness were 
gradually fulfilled in our policy and life and promoted social 
tranquility and harmony. The most striking mark was that per 
capita GNP increased from $3,167 in 1984 to $10,570 in 1993. 
This demonstrated the prosperity of the Republic of China [ROC] 
in a most truthful and objective way. This was a result of the 
implementation of the Three People's Principles by the 
Kuomintang [KMT] and the greatest gift it has presented to the 
nation. The period fully deserves to be praised as another 
"golden decade" in the history of the ROC. 
  Administration Ideals and Concepts 
  Of course, such drastic changes taking place in as short a 
period as 10 years would inevitably bring about numerous new 
problems due to the country's speedy operation [in various 
fields of endeavor]. For example, giving consideration to both 
democracy and rule by law at the same time, achieving harmony 
between the economy and culture, and making adjustments between 
fairness and efficiency remain tasks that require us to make 
continued efforts. However, what I would like to particularly 
mention here is that the principal objective that the ROC has 
been striving for more than four decades' to achieve on Taiwan 
is "modernization of the nation." By this we mean to establish, 
in politics, a democratic society based on the free will of all 
the people; to transform ourselves, in economic activities, from 
a society in which the traditional agriculture plays the 
dominant role into an advanced industrial country full of 
innovation and in which the development of science and 
technology plays the dominant role; and to enable the evolution 
of a peaceful society that encourages diverse development and 
contains various differences. At a juncture when the whole 
nation is making common efforts to achieve our objective, 
"modernization of the nation," I deeply feel that my 
responsibilities are heavy as I undertake the work of the 
Executive Yuan. 
  Looking ahead, I think the years to come are the most 
crucial 
period for our country. At present, the complete collapse of 
the Eastern European communist countries has changed the 
tradition of bipolar confrontation and, consequently, has 
reduced the risk of regional conflicts. Communist China's 
deepening economic reform is very attractive to capital in the 
Asia-Pacific Region. The success of the GATT Uruguay Round of 
talks, the forthcoming establishment of a new world trade 
organization, and the important progress made by economic 
conformity in Europe, America, and the Pacific Region show that 
the obstacles to cultural and economic exchange are gradually 
being eliminated. Every country in the world is going to vie 
with each other for leadership in an arena with fewer dividing 
lines and less protection. Each one strives to establish a new 
international order on the basis of freedom, human rights, and 
mutually beneficial economic relations and trade. It is very 
likely that the fulfillment of the ideal of a world village may 
accompany the advent of the 21st century. The last six years of 
the 20th century will precisely be the time for every country to 
improve its own condition, to warm up, and to be ready and 
waiting for a new era. We must seize this crucial period, 
smoothly accomplish our transformation tasks, and march to the 
sphere of "modernization" with one action so as to race against 
the advanced countries on a equal footing and from the same 
starting line. In other words, the next six years will be the 
most important period determining the future of our Chinese 
nation. This will depend on the extent of our efforts. As a 
ruling party, the KMT should, of course, undertake this great 
mission of our times. The government is bound by duty to 
shoulder the heavy responsibilities of administration. 
  It has been more than 10 months since I was ordered to take 
charge of the administrative work. I am deeply aware that our 
country is presently in a crucial period in which it will have 
to inherit the past and usher in the future, and that we must 
enhance the existing splendid achievements and accomplish all 
the projects designed to expedite the nation's transformation 
during this period. We must open the door for modernization when 
the 21st century arrives and lead the Chinese nation to 
regeneration. 
  Based on the understanding mentioned above, I think the 
Executive Yuan should achieve overall and forward-looking 
development in carrying out its work and should be a very 
capable government. Therefore, our administration ideals and 
concepts are: 
  -- widen our horizon and use a broad international outlook 
to 
determine the position and orientation for national construction; 
  -- achieve balanced development, eliminate unbalanced 
development, and strive for overall progress; 
  -- respect and condense the will of the people and promote 
unity among all the people; 
  -- and implement a forward-looking and practical policy on 
public utilities, look upon taking the rank of a modernized 
nation in the 21st century as our objective, work quietly and in 
a down-to-earth manner, and score some achievements for the 
country and people. 
  Overall Planning 
  The Executive Yuan will undertake overall planning to 
realize 
these ideals and concepts and to accomplish the major goal of 
national transformation. Today, I would like to deliver the 
following report, for your consideration, on several major 
trends in planning and administrative priorities: 
<H5>  Great Constitutional Achievements </H5>
  1. Within the bounds of rationality and legality, our great 
achievements in constitutional reform have inspired the healthy 
maturation of democratic politics and the implementation of 
local autonomy. 
  The ROC's progress in recent years in pursuing democratic 
politics on Taiwan is yet another achievement, after our 
country's economic development, and thus merits our attention. 
The quintessence of democratic politics is to consider people's 
interests and allow people to decide things in all matters. 
Instead of steering public opinion, the government's functions 
are to coordinate various interests through the application of 
professional knowledge and embody them in policies and practices 
that satisfy the requirements both of ideals and of practicality 
and find acceptance among the majority of people. Civil 
servants should go down to the grass roots and approach matters 
from a popular perspective. Policies are feasible only if they 
are supported by most people. 
  Next, we should maintain our stand on administering 
government affairs in strict accordance with the law. The law 
concedes that people's actions and activities are protected and 
inviolable; it is against the law to infringe upon them. Legal 
restrictions and prohibitions cannot be disregarded; tolerance 
in this respect amounts to negligence of duty. Administrative 
agencies are allowed to enforce, but not to violate, the law. 
To defuse public resentment, laws that are outdated, rigid, and 
out of step with society should be revised or abrogated 
according to legal procedures. 
  In addition, a democratic country must have a modern 
government whose hallmarks include "clean administration," which 
aims to expose and uproot embezzlement and malfeasance, and to 
guard against and eliminate government corruption and the 
practice of dispensing patronage. Other hallmarks are 
"efficiency," which means better organization, fewer personnel, 
streamlined operations, responsibility at various levels, 
improved administrative efficiency, and the efficient use of the 
country's resources; and "convenience for people," which aims to 
foster the concept of serving the people based on popular will. 
In 1993, the Executive Yuan formulated and implemented the 
"Plan for Administrative Reform," which calls on all 
administrative personnel to understand the country's situation 
and popular expectations, to renew their concepts by taking 
active and bold actions, not to be content with following the 
beaten path, and to attain the goal of streamlining 
administration and making things easy for people. Currently, we 
are going all out to implement the plan, which may yield 
practical results after a considerable period of time. 
  Personally, I do not think a modern government should manage 
everything. Except for a few undertakings requiring government 
planning and attention because people cannot or will not launch 
them, or because they are not fit for people to run, the 
government, with its limited financial resources, manpower, and 
functions, should mainly be responsible for steering courses, 
drawing up rules, and creating an environment in which people 
can tap their potential and realize their ideals, in order to 
strengthen people's affinity with the country, deepen their 
concern for society, and enhance their confidence in the 
government. Therefore, popular participation and implementation 
of local autonomy are the Executive Yuan's future administrative 
priorities. 
  We should improve the relationship between the "government" 
and "people" through all means. Specifically, we should start 
with local autonomy and allow people to express their views, 
through the "ballot" and "tax payment," on matters of immediate 
concern to them, and solve common problems, so as to realize the 
ideal of creating a responsible government through responsible 
people. We have now completed the drafts of the "Law on 
Provincial and County Autonomy," the "Law on Autonomy for Cities 
Under the Central Government," the "Law on Delineating 
Administrative Divisions," and the "Amendments to the Election 
and Recall Law." Following the completion of the legislative 
process, we can hold extensive elections aimed at implementing 
local autonomy and partially realize the ideal of constitutional 
reform. Democracy is the surging trend of the times. Dr. Sun 
Yat-sen said: "The tide of the world roars ahead. Those who 
swim with it will prosper, while those who swim against it will 
perish." Buffeted by the tide, we have no choice but to swim 
with it, and we cannot avert it. 
  Intensifying Economic Liberalization 
  2. We will continue to promote and strengthen the strategy 
of 
liberalizing the economic system, using our country's superior 
manpower to usher in a phase of economic development driven 
primarily by science and technology. 
  Over the past four decades, our country's economy has gone 
through an import substitution period in which the government 
exercised "internal control" and "closed the country off to the 
outside world," as well as an "export-oriented" period in which 
the government mainly pursued a planned laissez-faire economy; 
it has achieved splendid results in both periods. The global 
trend of liberalization, as well as our country's current 
environment and conditions reinforced by economic development, 
will inevitably lead to liberalization and internationalization, 
which can be achieved essentially through the improvement of 
human quality and competitiveness. 
  To improve human quality, we will reform education and 
intensify vocational training. In reforming education, we must 
take a more realistic approach toward rebuilding ethical, moral, 
and value standards to keep pace with current and future social, 
political, economic, and cultural development trends; to satisfy 
popular aspirations and demands for knowledge and advanced 
studies; and to accommodate the growing liberalization and 
openness of our society. In addition, we will ensure that "human 
resources" will contribute to economic development, quicken the 
pace of planning and instituting an educational system based 
chiefly on lifetime education, expand adult education, 
popularize education, effect flexible exchanges and operations 
within the educational system, adopt flexible and varied 
admission standards, and institute an educational system that 
caters to different special aptitudes. We have completed 
amendments to the "University Law," thereby giving universities 
room for independent academic development. We also have revised 
the "Law on Teachers' Education" and formulated the "Teachers' 
Law" to expand the channels for sourcing qualified teaching 
staffs. Along with the implementation of a teachers' licensing 
system, we will improve the qualifications of primary and 
middle-school teachers in the future. We will promote a system 
of tailoring technical and vocational education to professional 
licensing requirements and establish more technical colleges to 
clear the channels for technical and vocational school students 
to pursue advanced studies in order to accommodate future social 
demands stemming from industrial restructuring. We will also 
chart and promote the "Plan for Developing and Improving 
Technical Education in Junior Middle Schools -- Toward the Goal 
of 10-Year Compulsory Education." To search for effective 
measures to cope with various educational reforms, the 
government is actively making plans for the national educational 
conference scheduled for late June in hopes of drawing on 
collective wisdom, devising a grand scheme, and painting a 
completely new and magnificent picture for our country's 
education in the 21st century. Moreover, we will also reform 
our vocational training facilities, vocation types, and the 
substance and form of vocational training to improve pre-job 
training and strengthen retraining for people transferred to 
other jobs, in-service training, and training in secondary 
skills. To upgrade the technical levels of personnel engaged in 
economic construction and cater to the needs of industrial 
upgrading and economic internationalization and liberalization, 
we will also promote and implement a technicians' licensing 
system that integrates training, examination, and employment. 
  A very important task in increasing our economic 
competitiveness and improving all aspects of our investment 
climate is to accelerate industrial restructuring and upgrading. 
The Executive Yuan has formulated and is actively implementing 
the "Plan for Economic Rejuvenation"; it has adopted concrete 
strategies, which can be implemented immediately, to tackle such 
key factors as accelerating industrial upgrading and 
strengthening the operational structure of small and medium 
businesses, as well as various problems currently affecting 
private-sector investment. To attract domestic and foreign 
investment and create broad prospects for economic development, 
we are also devising plans to exploit Taiwan's special 
geographic and economic conditions in developing the Taiwan area 
into a multifunctional business center in the Asia-Pacific 
region; promoting the free flow of skilled manpower, capital, 
and commodities; and stimulating the exchange of information. 
Moreover, one of the important conditions for ensuring 
continuing growth in personal income in the wake of economic 
modernization is to permit flexible changes in the industrial 
structure. In terms of policy, the Executive Yuan will further 
push various production factors onto a more competitive path, in 
addition to intensifying efforts to promote established long- 
and medium-range plans for scientific and technological 
development, with a view to reinforcing our industrial 
technological prowess and creating an environment in which to 
develop industrial technology. In my opinion, this policy 
course carries vital importance for our country's shift toward a 
modern economic system. This is because for a long time after 
World War II, the West used currency, interest rate, and tax 
policies to upgrade investment levels, increase demand for 
essential goods, and attain the goal of full employment. Such 
investment policies, which primarily aimed to create demand for 
essential goods, were also implemented in our country. In view 
of our country's impending status as a modern state, however, 
the so-called "improvement of the investment climate" should be 
achieved by channeling various production resources toward 
development of the most competitive, vibrant, and creative 
industries through the operation of market mechanisms. In other 
words, in the future our economy as a whole must acquire an 
ability to repeat its pioneering process as well as a flexible 
ability to adapt to change, with a view to promoting industrial 
upgrading and attaining the goal of continuously readjusting the 
industrial structure. Such "supply-oriented" economic concepts 
are new ideas in the contemporary world. 
<H5>  Promoting the Southbound Policy </H5>
  A country's main production factors include land, capital, 
manpower, and intellectual property amassed in the course of 
scientific and technological development. Central to the 
introduction of "supply-oriented" improvements in the investment 
climate is the establishment of competitive markets for land, 
finance, manpower, and intellectual property rights. The next 
important step is to bring automatic regulatory and control 
mechanisms into full play through effective market operations, 
with a view to achieving the goal of introducing flexible 
changes in the industrial structure. Based on this concept, the 
Executive Yuan will adopt the following measures regarding the 
markets for various production factors: 
  -- While we certainly should stress the principle of 
"fairness and justice" concerning land utilization, we will 
emphasize the efficiency of land utilization and increase land 
supply so that enterprises can rent or buy land needed for 
manufacturing in accordance with the principle of 
competitiveness during the process of economic development. The 
Executive Yuan will formulate sweeping plans regarding land 
issues. 
  -- Regarding the financial market, we will place greater 
emphasis on the efficiency of financial markets, continue to 
lift government restrictions on setting up intermediary 
financial institutions in accordance with the trend of 
liberalization, and encourage more foreign intermediary agencies 
to compete in our country, with a view to further opening up our 
financial market. These administrative strategies have arisen 
from the prevailing situation. 
  -- Regarding the market for manpower, one of the main 
reasons 
for our country's miraculous economic development is the 
possession of excellent human resources. In the past, we 
allocated manpower to different industries in accordance with 
the principle of competitiveness and maintained harmonious 
relations between employers and employees on such issues as 
wages, dismissal, and job change while preserving flexibility in 
adapting to changes in the industrial structure. Maintaining "a 
competitive labor market and harmonious relations between 
management and labor" is indeed the greatest guarantee for our 
country to continually attract investment and effectively 
improve the investment climate. It is a matter that merits our 
attention. 
  In addition, liberalization is a world trend arising from 
changes in the international economic situation. This trend of 
change will inevitably link the ROC's "domestic market" with the 
"world market" more closely than ever. To meet the challenges 
posed by our forthcoming participation in the GATT, we must 
vigorously carry out adjustment of various systems. Therefore, 
the ROC will gradually open its domestic market to foreign 
investments, lift the policy on protectionism for the 
agricultural sector, and promote the management of government 
enterprises by the private sector. Gaining admission to the 
GATT is the primary goal of our vigorous efforts to participate 
in international organizations. The Executive Yuan will treat 
the promotion of the southbound policy which targets ASEAN and 
the expansion of our international economic relations and trade 
as well as the space for development as the specific objectives 
for its administration. 
<H3>  Treat 12 Construction Projects as the Focal Points of 
Administration </H3>
  3. We must join the forces of the government with those of 
the people to carry out the construction of various major 
projects and achieve balanced development of the country. 
  Our country has gone through the implementation of nine 
economic construction plans and continues to promote major 
construction plans, which involve 10 projects and 14 projects 
and the Six-Year National Development Plan. National 
construction is a continuous and endless job. The Executive 
Yuan reviewed and rearranged the Six-Year National Development 
Plan into 632 programs in the light of the needs of our country, 
our capabilities for actual implementation, and the government's 
financial resources, and then instructed relevant organs to 
conscientiously promote their implementation. However, the 
Executive Yuan will place more emphasis on achieving "balanced" 
development and on encouraging participation by the private 
sector in promoting the major national construction projects in 
the future. By "balanced" development we mean rationally 
allocating the government's financial resources to different 
departments and areas in order that both the central and local 
governments, both hardware and software, and both the economic 
sector and cultural circles may receive an allocation of 
resources. We encourage participation by the private sector in 
order that we may use the guidelines of the "Regulations on 
Encouraging the Private Sector To Participate in Major 
Communications Projects" to promote the construction of major 
national projects and, above all, rely on the forces of the 
private sector to help the government surmount the many 
difficulties it has encountered with respect to trained 
personnel and experiences. It is hoped that the private sector 
can cherish the breadth of vision of offering a present to 
society in return and can help the government promote all 
national construction projects. Looking ahead, the government 
will treat the following 12 construction projects as the focal 
points of administration in addition to making continued efforts 
to promote the Six-Year National Development Plan as well as 
relevant key construction projects, and will enlist the help of 
all people to draw up specific measures for their implementation: 
  (1) Renovate and install educational facilities at middle 
and 
primary schools. 
  (2) Build recreational areas as well as parks and sports 
facilities in cities. 
  (3) Install more cultural facilities, both software and 
hardware, in provinces (municipalities), counties (cities), 
townships and towns, and communities. 
  (4) Develop new cities and towns and build public housing 
units. 
  (5) Improve public transportation and carry out 
comprehensive 
construction of road systems and parking lots in and around 
communities. 
  (6) Build industrial and commercial complex areas. 
  (7) Speed up the construction of garbage incinerators and 
sites for garbage disposal by burying them underground. 
  (8) Step up the development and control of water resources. 
  (9) Build a south-north high-speed railway. 
  (10) Build a rapid transit system in the metropolitan area 
of 
Kaohsiung and build subways in the cities of Taichung and Tainan. 
  (11) Carry out construction of the next phase project of the 
second freeway and build an east-west superhighway. 
  (12) Make a plan for the construction of an east-west 
superhighway in central Taiwan. 
  Actively Promote Social Welfare Measures 
  4. Guided by the principle of giving consideration to both 
the soundness of the government's finance and justice and 
fairness in society, we must actively promote social welfare 
measures. 
  Justice and fairness in society is an issue to which any 
modern nation must pay close attention. Besides providing an 
equal right for everyone to have the opportunity for education, 
employment, and participation in government affairs, our country 
will adopt a policy to strive for equality in income through 
taxes on rent and disbursement transfers. Our basic practice 
regarding social welfare measures is to let the government look 
after those who need to be looked after. Therefore, beginning 
from the next fiscal year, we are going to increase living 
allowances for the elderly people who have only medium or low 
income; those elderly people whose income is less than 1.5 times 
the minimum living standard will be entitled to a monthly 
allowance of 6,000 new Taiwan dollars [NT$] and those elderly 
people whose income is in the bracket between 1.5 and 2 times 
the minimum living standard are entitled to a monthly allowance 
of NT$3,000. The government will continue to implement 
supportive measures for medical care, employment, and education, 
supplemented by launching projects to provide jobs by way of 
relief, by conducting vocational training, and by offering loans 
for people to start a business. The government will give 
priority to looking after elderly people who have no one to 
support them, people who are seriously disabled, patients 
suffering from chronic diseases, vegetables [zhiwuren 2784 3670 
0086], and so forth. The government will give better guidance 
to women, children, and youngsters and strengthen protection for 
them. In addition, we shall enlist the help of all the people 
and do our best to promote the system of "health insurance for 
all the people" as well as the "citizens' annuity" system. 
  The system of health insurance for all the people combines 
the existing medical care services for government employees, 
laborers, and farmers; expands the scope of the insured to cover 
all citizens; and is developing into a unitary health insurance 
system in which the insurance premium is equitably shared and 
which entitles all citizens to basic medical care. We are 
expediting the legislative procedures for relevant laws and hope 
to successfully implement the system by the end of this year. 
As regards the "citizens' annuity" system, we hope to gurantee 
that every citizen will be free from want when they are old by 
means of compulsory savings and through joint efforts by the 
government and people. The system is being planned by relevant 
organs and will be rearranged by the Council for Economic 
Planning and Development. We also hope that it will be 
completed this year. As these two systems are important 
administrative measures that have a bearing on the welfare of 
all the people, the Executive Yuan shall plan and promote them 
with utmost circumspection and, meanwhile, will call on the 
whole nation to support them. 
<H5>  Maintain Sound Finance </H5>
  Although our country is marching to join the ranks of 
advanced industrial countries, we must draw a lesson from the 
mistakes made by them in the past. The "welfare state" practice 
adopted by many advanced countries in Europe and America in the 
past has not only led to financial deficits from which they 
cannot extricate themselves, but it has ultimately resulted in a 
vicious circle, plunging both the economy and society into 
predicaments for which they can find no solution. A movement to 
make revisions to the welfare state is in the making in both 
Europe and America. It is really necessary for our country to 
understand this trend. Taxpayers are willing to look after old 
widowers, widows, and lonely people who are unable to look after 
themselves by paying taxes. However, according to Chinese 
cultural tradition, it is the children's duty to support and 
wait upon their parents, and working industriously is the way to 
live and become wealthy. The government must keep up the 
tradition. Therefore, I think it is an important responsibility 
of the government to maintain sound finance. Besides having 
made a five-year-long plan for the government's finance, we are 
gradually adjusting the order of priority for various government 
expenditures by increasing production-related expenditures and 
reducing consumption-related expenditures, and we shall see to 
it that taxpayers' tax burden is maintained under a reasonable 
ceiling. 
  As far as my colleagues in the administrative departments 
are 
concerned, the year 1994 makes them feel that they have heavy 
responsibilities and poses great challenges because we realize 
that a new face and new problems have cropped up in the 
environment at home and abroad which we must confront and 
resolve. When we inherit the achievements from the past and 
look ahead to the advent of the 21st century, all citizens look 
forward to the nation's modernization. Therefore, we must 
double our efforts, surmount every difficulty, and look forward 
to its fulfillment. I sincerely hope that all respectable 
seniors will not stint their criticisms.

<F P=106> [By Wang Tzu-yen (3076 1311 0917): "Lu Ping and Zhou Nan </F>
Fight `War of Words' in Shenzhen and Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Last Friday evening [4 March], Lu Ping, director of 
the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, attended 
the annual Hong Kong and Macao regional meeting of the 
International Rotary Club, at which he delivered a long speech 
with an emotional color. In a curious coincidence, Zhou Nan, 
director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, also made a speech at a 
ceremony held in Hong Kong on the morning of the same day, at 
which letters of appointment were conferred on regional affairs 
advisers. The next day, many newspapers in Hong Kong gave wide 
coverage to the content of Lu's speech. The media also made 
favorable comments and some people even described it as Lu's 
"most pleasant" speech since taking office. As for Zhou's 
speech, which was delivered along the "diplomatic line," other 
major newspapers, with the exception of some leftist papers, 
mentioned it only briefly. 
  It is extremely rare for the two senior Chinese leaders in 
charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs to fight a "war of words" 
on the same day. Viewed from the angle of reporting and the 
media, it is clear that Lu Ping has won this round. Most Hong 
Kong media, however, seem to treat Lu's speech in Shenzhen as a 
propaganda stunt aimed at reassuring Hong Kong people, but 
readers who are truly familiar with CPC internal operations 
should be able to see that Lu made the speech with something in 
mind and that it has profound significance. 
  First, in his speech Lu did not criticize or struggle 
against 
the British and Chris Patten with a "clear-cut stand" as Zhou 
Nan did. Instead of touching on the current Sino-British 
tensions and fierce argument, he talked glibly about the 
prospects and expectations entertained by the Chinese side and 
himself for Hong Kong's bright future, stressing that Hong Kong 
would continue to preserve its role as a bridge of capitalism 
beyond 1997. The moderate tone is clearly different from the 
tough approach taken by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, but tallies with the government work 
report delivered by Li Peng at the National People's Congress 
session. Obviously, Lu Ping's speech is more in keeping with 
the latest spirit of the Chinese leadership on the Hong Kong 
issue than Zhou Nan's. 
<H5>  Lu Ping Boldly Criticizes Chinese Officials </H5>
  Second, in Shenzhen, Lu Ping again raised the slogan of 
"Hong 
Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of 
self-government." Raised in 1982, when the Chinese side worked 
out their initial plan for recovering sovereignty over Hong Kong 
and regarded as a basic principle Deng Xiaoping's concept of 
"one country, two systems," the slogan has not been mentioned 
for a long time. After the 4 June Incident, the Chinese side 
talked only about "recovering sovereignty," but not of "Hong 
Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of 
self-government." However, when enunciating the specific 
embodiments of this policy in Shenzhen, Lu quoted many policies 
and principles that the Chinese side repeatedly stressed in 
those years and in the drafting of which he had a personal hand. 
  Of all in-service cadres in the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office and even in the entire Chinese Government system, Lu Ping 
was the longest-serving official involved in Hong Kong and Macao 
affairs. Although there are others more senior than he, they 
have "joined the ranks halfway," and although some have worked 
longer than he, they have either retired or have been 
transferred to other posts. In 1981, when China decided to 
study the issue of recovering sovereignty over Hong Kong, Lu was 
selected by Liao Chengzhi, then director of the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, and appointed head of a three-man research 
group, and so began to get involved in Hong Kong and Macao 
affairs. Since then, he has established an indissoluble bond 
with the Hong Kong and Macao region. The 13-character principle 
on recovering Hong Kong's sovereignty which was studied and 
worked out by the group later became China's basic policy in 
handling the Hong Kong issue and was incorporated into the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. However, most 
cadres now taking charge of the Hong Kong and Macao affairs, 
including Zhou Nan, do not quite understand the process in which 
these basic policies were deliberated and formulated. Nor do 
they know the careful consideration of the Chinese policemakers 
of the older generation. Perhaps for this reason, in his 
capacity as one experienced in this respect, Lu Ping boldly 
criticized some Chinese officials, "including some senior 
cadres," saying they do not quite understand the Basic Law and 
that "their statements do not tally with the Basic Law." 
  It has been learned that a substantial number of people in 
the Chinese hierarchy have always taken exception to the tough 
policy adopted by the authorities toward Hong Kong, holding that 
many of the current practices run counter to the policy when 
China originally planned to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
On many occasions they called on the top leadership to "set 
things to rights and make a thorough overhaul," but these views 
have never been accepted and even have been suppressed. The 
fact that Lu wittingly reaffirmed previous principles and 
policies in Shenzhen seems to show that the "non-mainstream" 
views have been accepted by the top leadership. 
<H3>  Two Major Leftist Papers in Hong Kong Delete Lu Ping's 
Statement </H3>
  What is strange, however, is that the two major leftist 
newspapers in Hong Kong dealt with the speeches of Lu Ping and 
Zhou Nan in a way that gives people much food for thought. 
Although WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO carried the full text of 
their speeches the following day, both put Zhou's speech on the 
front page, as if by prior agreement. Lu's speech, however, was 
placed in an non- prominent position on page four. WEN WEI PO 
even handled Lu's speech as an ordinary contribution by placing 
it after the opinion page. 
  What is more, the two newspapers deleted some of the content 
of Lu's speech. When saying that some statements by Chinese 
officials did not tally with the Basic Law, Lu explicitly said 
that some Chinese officials, "including some senior officials, 
do not quite understand the Basic Law, either." However, this 
remark was deleted by the two papers. Moreover, toward the end 
of his speech Lu Ping left the text of his speech to air his 
view on the post-1997 Hong Kong airport issue and the future 
political structure. Being quite liberal, this passage was 
quite acceptable to Hong Kong people, but it was deleted by the 
two papers altogether. 
  What is the reason behind this alteration? This writer dares 
not make a presumptuous judgment, but ordinarily the leftist 
papers must seek instructions from the propaganda department of 
the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY before dealing with such important 
manuscripts.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- On 10 March, Zhang 
Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, said 
that because the British Hong Kong authorities brought the 
second part of their constititional reform package to the 
Legislative Council, they had completely pulled up the rails for 
the through train and once again laid bare their true, 
perfidious features. He stressed that after the complete 
termination of British colonial rule in Hong Kong on 30 June 
1997, the Chinese side certainly will join hands with Hong Kong 
people in effecting Hong Kong's smooth transition according to 
the Basic Law and the relevant decisions made by the National 
People's Congress. 
  Zhang Junsheng made this statement when answering reporters' 
questions folloiwng a news conference about an international 
tourist festival in China this year. 
  Zhang Junsheng pointed out: Now, the British Hong Kong 
authorities may submit or pass whatever bills they like, and 
this is their business. He reiterated: As there is no 
agreement between China and Britain, the three-tiered political 
structure set up by the British Hong Kong authorities definitely 
will come to an end as a whole, together with the end of the 
British colonial rule on 30 June 1997. The Chinese Government 
will re-establish the three-tiered councils of the future 
special administrative region [SAR] government according to the 
Basic Law and the relevant decisions of the National People's 
Congress. The Chinese side and Hong Kong people will be 
completely able to do a good job in arranging Hong Kong's 
transition. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: In the past, the British side proposed 
the through-train arrangement, and the Chinese side accepted it. 
However, the British side now does not want to see any 
convergence or any through train by simply removing the rails 
for the through train. This once again has exposed their real 
feature of not keeping diplomatic promises. The behavior of the 
British side has wasted a lot of our time and energy, and also 
has caused a certain amount of concern to Hong Kong people. As 
the British side broke its promise and provoked an open debate, 
Hong Kong society was split and social shocks were caused; 
certain economic losses also were caused. 
  Zhang Junsheng reiterated that since the British side 
refused 
cooperation, we should join hands with Hong Kong people and work 
more intensively. We will be completely able to properly 
arrange Hong Kong's transition and set up the SAR Government.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Colonial Rule Is Going To End"] </F>
  [Text] There are still people who, in their flights of 
fancy, want to continue colonialism in an alternative form and a 
surrogate colonial rule with which to resist the return of the 
sovereignty over a land to its sovereign state when, globally, 
colonialism is on its way out. Britain is producing a Hong Kong 
version of "sunset imperial power" in a vain attempt to preserve 
its political and economic interests in Hong Kong. It signed 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, committing itself to 
cooperating and negotiating with China on the handover of 
political powers and a smooth transition in the latter half of 
the transition period. However, after he came to Hong Kong, 
Chris Patten reneged on the promise, refused to cooperate and 
negotiate as required by the provisions of Annex II, set up his 
own agenda, and deliberately created a situation which is not 
going to converge with the Basic Law. The presentation of 
Patten's package to the Legislative Council [Legco] shows that 
the British have determinedly turned their back on convergence 
and cooperation. 
  Premier Li Peng responded firmly to Britain's attempt to 
continue its rule in his Government Work Report to the National 
People's Congress [NPC]: "Britain's colonial rule over Hong 
Kong is going to end. This is something no force can resist." 
"Whatever the twists and turns, the Chinese Government and 
Chinese people are determined and capable of restoring 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintaining its long-term 
stability and prosperity." 
  The phrase demonstrates the solemn position of the Chinese 
government. What Britain is now pursuing in Hong Kong is 
colonial rule. This is a fact. If Britain is sincere in 
implementing the Joint Declaration and pursuing friendly 
cooperation, its interests thereby reside in the joint 
declaration. However, since Britain has refused to cooperate, 
naturally it has to be responsible for the consequences that 
flow from the refusal. 
  Colonialists do not have any political, legal, or moral 
right to dictate the future of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] or to continue its influence and 
extend its terms of rule by doing what is properly the SAR 
Preparatory Committee's work, that is, organizing the first 
government and legislature for the SAR. The Chinese Government 
will work firmly in accordance with the Joint Declaration. 
Britain's colonial rule over Hong Kong has to end. The council 
founded on the Letters Patent and Royal Instructions will die "a 
natural death" when the hour strikes. On 1 July 1997, China 
will restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong and the councils 
erected on Patten's package will end on the same day. China 
will form the first government, legislature, and the two 
municipal councils in accordance with the Basic Law and NPC 
resolutions. This is a changeover of sovereignty, not a change 
of government within a country. The Joint Declaration announced 
long ago that colonial rule would end. Nobody can resist this 
historical progress. 
  Before Patten's package was presented to the Legco, there 
was 
still a possibility of the convergence of the political systems. 
The Chinese Government still hoped that Britain would repent but 
Britain pushed the matter beyond the point of no return by 
presenting Patten's package to the Legco; there will not be 
cooperation in the transition of the political system and China 
does not entertain any illusions about Britain. China will not 
do anything useless. Since there is no possibility of 
cooperation, China can only open an effective road toward 
restoring sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintaining Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability. 
  The Chinese people are blessed with the courage of not being 
daunted by difficulties or rugged terrain. If the Chinese 
Government wants to restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong, it 
will have the ability, together with Hong Kong citizens, to 
achieve a smooth transition and form the SAR government and 
legislature to enable Hong Kong's prosperity and stability to 
continue. By pretending to enter into negotiations Britain has 
wasted China's valuable time for arranging for the SAR. Premier 
Li Peng's discourse in his government work report on the problem 
of Hong Kong indicated that the Chinese Government will count on 
the power of the Chinese people and rising national power, 
intensify and speed up the Preliminary Work Committee work, 
unify Hong Kong compatriots on a broad basis, and successfully 
pursue the early-phase preparations for the SAR government and 
legislature with one mind and through joint efforts. This 
historic task must see results before 1996. The Preparatory 
Committee must be created in 1996 to ensure that the political 
powers are effectively taken over. 
  The government work report is a great encouragement for all 
patriotic and Hong Kong-loving people. The Hong Kong people 
will not let their motherland down and will do their best to 
make the establishment of the SAR a glorious chapter in their 
history. Britain's attempt to resist China's restoring its 
sovereignty over Hong Kong will end in total failure.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 11 (AFP) -- One of Hong Kong's 
most influentual bankers called Friday for an end to the local 
dollar's peg to the U.S. greenback, saying it was a major cause 
of chronic inflation in the territory. Bank of East Asia Ltd. 
Chairman David Li said the 10-year-old peg should be replaced -- 
after consultations with China, which takes back Hong Kong in 
1997 -- with a trade-weighted basket of currencies. "Singapore 
does it. Taiwan does it. Even China does it," he said. 
  Inflation eased slightly to 8.5 percent for working-class 
households in 1993, and Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod 
has forecast a similar level for this year. But the British 
administration has its hands tied because the dollar peg 
surrenders monetary policy to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is 
preoccupied with kick-starting the U.S. economy out of recession. 
  The Hong Kong dollar was pegged at 7.80 per U.S. dollar in 
October 1983, when Sino-British talks on returning the colony to 
China in 1997 triggered a crisis of confidence and a flight of 
capital. With Hong Kong now an economic dynamo, the local 
dollar has consistently been on the strong side, but the Hong 
Kong government has repeatedly argued that the peg must stay to 
guarantee financial stability. Li, who also represents the 
banking industry in the Legislative Council, disagreed strongly 
with that view, saying: "Some of our very high power people 
have their heads in the sand." 
  In a speech to the conference organized by the FAR EASTERN 
ECONOMIC REVIEW magazine, Li said inflation was fast robbing 
Hong Kong of its competitive edge against Malaysia, Singapore, 
South Korea and Taiwan. "Inflation is the single greatest 
threat to our competitiveness," he said. "It is simply too 
high. Day after day, month by month, we are pricing ourselves 
out of the market."

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng and Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing 
today joined deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) in 
their discussions on the government work report made by Li Peng 
and exchanged with them views on matters deputies are interested 
in. 
  Vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen did not hear 
the discussions because he held talks with U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher today. He is in the Ningxia NPC 
delegation. 
  Today is the third day of the second session of the Eighth 
NPC and all delegations held discussions the whole day. 
  After he listened to deputies' speeches in the Beijing 
delegation, Premier Li Peng said that to achieve a due balance 
between reform, development and stability is becoming a common 
understanding of the NPC deputies and is extremely important to 
accomplish all tasks spelled out by the session and ensure a 
sustained, fast and healthy development of national economy. 
  Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji expressed his views on control over 
price hike during a group discussion of Hunan delegation. 
  In Sichuan delegation, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua joined in the 
discussion and made a speech. He said that in order to ensure 
healthy economic development, it is necessary to obtain a 
rational structure and obtain efficiency. This year great 
efforts should be made to try to make loss-making enterprises 
improve their performances. 
  Discussing with deputies in Henan delegation, Vice-Premier 
Li 
Lanqing said that this year the government will employ legal, 
economic and administrative means to keep price rise within a 
tolerable scope. 
  He also urged governments at all levels to pay close 
attention to farming and ensure enough plantation of grain and 
other farm crops. 
  During his discussion with deputies from Jilin Province, Li 
Tieying, State Councillor and minister in charge of the state 
commission for restructuring the economy, said that the current 
reform in China covers two important aspects -- enterprise 
reform and reform of the macro-economic structure. 
  Li said that in establishing a socialist market economy, it 
is imperative to take enterprise reform as a central link in 
which reform of major state-owned enterprises is the key. 
  Reform of the macro-economic structure is aimed at 
establishing a structure which can efficiently exercise control 
over national economy with economic law and means as the main 
lever instead of administrative lever.

Renjie (1776 0088 2638), and Wang Wei (3769 5588): "The Common

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng showed 
particular concern for the opinions of people's delegates about 
the "Government Work Report." As a Beijing delegation delegate, 
Li Peng arrived this morning at the Beijing Hall of the Great 
Hall of the People to participate in a forum with Beijing 
delegates attending the second session of the Eighth National

development, and stability, which represent the overall 
situation for doing a good job on various work. He expressed 
the belief that as long as we can maintain the mutual 
coordination of reform, development, and stability, and as long 
as we can bring about mutual promotion of reform, development, 
and stability, we will surely and victoriously accomplish 
various reform tasks and fulfill the economic development plan. 
  Doing a good job on the production and management of 
state-run large and medium-sized enterprises is extremely 
important to maintain the sustained development of the national 
economy. Therefore, Lui Yifeng, deputy director of the Economic 
and Technological Information Research Institute under the 
Beijing Chemical Engineering Group, offered his views to Premier 
Li Peng. He said: "The introduction of a new taxation system 
will benefit most state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises; but it will pose new problems to some enterprises, 
particularly poorly run ones. It is hoped that relevant 
departments will work out effective measures to help solve such 
problems as chained debts and wage reform at enterprises." 
  Zhang Zhanlin, head of the Liuminying Ecological Farm Ranch 
in Daxing County, straightforwardly touched on the issue which 
concerns farmers most: solving the issue of the inadequate 
reserve force for agriculture. He said: "Premier Li Peng's 
report has pointed out the farmers' innermost thinking, it 
proposed strengthening the position of agriculture, the 
foundation of the national economy, and a number of measures to 
comprehensively develop the rural economy. It is hoped that 
these measures will be genuinely implemented." 
  Qinghua University Professor Mei Zuyan said he greatly 
appreciated the following passage: "Various levels of 
governments should cut expenditures in other areas and try every 
possible means to do several concrete things for education." 
This, he said, reflects the government's plan to raise 
education to a strategic position and to give education priority 
development. He, however, hoped that the government would 
gradually increase investment in education. 
  Also taking the floor to speak at the meeting were Wang 
Bilin, Beijing Municipal No. 11 Middle School senior teacher; Li 
Bosheng, special-grade jade sculpture master at the Beijing Jade 
Workshop; Hu Dapeng, Municipal Individual Laborers' Association 
deputy director; and Hu Yamei, honorary president of Beijing 
Children Hospital. They proposed their respective suggestions 
to Premier Li Peng on such topics as attaching importance to 
education, promoting folk arts, developing the private economy, 
and reforming the medical care system. 
  Following the delegates' speeches, Li Peng said: "I thank 
you 
for your affirmation and support of the "Government Work Report" 
and the government's work. And I thank you for expressing your 
opinions and proposing suggestions." He said he would seriously 
study those opinions and suggestions and would try his best to 
meet with the delegates' demands and wishes, adding: "This is 
our unshirkable responsibility." 
  Li Peng said party and government leaders should not only 
assume the responsibility for correctly handling well the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability, but 
also need to help all to reach a common understanding over the 
correct handling of the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability, as they are very important in 
accomplishing the various tasks that will be set forth at the 
current NPC session and to bring about a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy. He said he is 
pleased with the delegates' reaching a common understanding and 
with their approval of and support for this year's basic policy 
for the whole party and for the nation's work. Li Peng pointed 
out the tasks of reform and development will be very arduous 
this year. At present, reform plans for major reform of the 
economic structure have been introduced, thus representing a big 
step forward for establishing a socialist market economic 
system. He called for the resolute implementation of various 
reform plans. He also called for adopting a cautious attitude, 
for the timely solving of problems once they surface, and 
ensuring the smooth progress of reform and development. 
  Li Peng jokingly said: "As I am also one of the Beijing 
delegation delegates, please allow me to express several 
opinions." Laughter immediately broke out upon his remark. 
  The first opinion that Li Peng advanced was related to 
commodity prices. He said prices constitute an important factor 
in maintaining social stability. Since implementing the reform 
and opening up policy, we have adopted a step-by-step approach 
with regard to reforming prices. Practice shows that our 
approach has been a success. Control over 90 percent of 
commodity prices have been lifted. Macrocontrol, however, is 
required over commodity prices that have been decontrolled. I 
hope more efforts will be exerted and more work will be done in 
this area so that increases in commodity prices will be 
controlled within the masses' tolerable limit. Regarding 
commodity price work, Li Peng pointed out the need to pay 
particular attention to solving well the "vegetable basket" 
problem for urban and rural citizens. It is necessary to ensure 
the supply of a vast variety of vegetables at reasonable prices. 
Commercial networks should be increased in urban areas. Steps 
should be taken to improve distribution systems. Urban areas 
should open their doors wider so as to facilitate vegetable 
growers to sell their produces and to help stabilize the prices 
of agricultural sideline products in urban and rural areas. 
  Another of Li Peng's opinion was related to the 
establishment 
of a labor market. According to him, labor force flow is an 
unavoidable phenomenon in the course of economic development. 
Labor force flow not only meets construction demands in 
economically developed areas, but also helps the masses in the 
economically not-so-developed areas to shake off poverty and to 
become better off. But he urged the creation of a positive 
guidance for labor force flow and for enhancing management over 
the labor market, so that the labor force will not flow in a 
blind and unregulated manner, but in a rational and orderly way. 
  Li Peng also raised the issue of attaching greater 
importance 
to improving citizens' housing conditions. He spoke about the 
great changes in the urban outlook of Beijing. He said everyone 
knows that Beijing is becoming a modernized metropolis. He 
expressed the hope that citizens will make new strides in 
housing reconstruction. He urged adopting the method of pooling 
funds from the government, work units, and individuals to 
accelerate the pace of housing construction, particularly in 
giving priority to building medium- grade residential housing. 
Li Peng also said that improving housing conditions is a 
practical issue which the broad masses show the biggest concern 
and which requires a speedy solution. 
  Li Peng said, as the country's capital, Beijing is the 
miniature and window of the great socialist motherland. In 
addition to doing a good job in building material civilization, 
people in Beijing should set an exemplary role in the building 
of spiritual civilization. It is necessary to make greater 
efforts to further do a good job in the comprehensive management 
of social order; to create a stable working and living 
environment for the citizens; to encourage healthy trends; to 
oppose unhealthy trends and bad practices; to adopt diverse ways 
and use healthy and uplifting spiritual products to enrich the 
cultural market and satisfy the masses' needs in daily life; and 
to help shape a healthy social trend. 
  Li Peng's opinions won warm applause from the delegates. The 
heart strings of the people's delegates drew a little bit closer 
to that of the Republic's premier...... [ellipses as received].

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin today called on the Chinese Army to strengthen its 
own building and better carry out its sacred mission of 
defending China's modernization program. 
  While examining a government work report with army deputies 
to the National People's Congress, he called on officers and men 
of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to make new contributions 
to China's reform, development and stability. 
  Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, said that new reform measures taken earlier this 
year in taxation, banking, investment, planning, foreign trade 
and enterprise reform are a "decisive battle" for the country's 
reform program and open policy implementation. 
  He said: "victory of this battle and establishment of a 
framework for a socialist market economic structure will provide 
a powerful guarantee for a sustained, rapid and sound growth of 
China's economy. 
  "We must have a secure and stable social and political 
environment to achieve this victory. 
  "Officers and men must be fully aware of their historical 
responsibilities and strengthen army building so as to better 
carry out their sacred mission of safeguarding China's security 
and unification, and defending its modernization drive." 
  Jiang Zemin, who is also the general secretary of the 
Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee, praised officers and men for 
having stood the test in the course of reform and opening up, 
and for their being of one heart and mind with the party Central 
Committee. 
  He also called for efforts to improve ideological work among 
officers and men in the course of creating a socialist market 
economy. 
  He stressed the importance of setting lofty ideals, 
observing 
discipline, seeking unity, subordinating personal interests to 
the overall interests of the nation and unswervingly following 
the party's basic line of taking economic development as the 
central task. 
  President Jiang described reform, opening up and the 
modernization drive as a "grand and arduous" undertaking, which 
requires the mobilization of all social sectors. 
  He said the undertaking makes it imperative to bring into 
full play the initiative and creativeness of all officers and 
men so that they will better contribute to army modernization 
and China's prosperity and long-term stability. 
  The most important task at present is to improve education 
among officers and men in Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, army building during the 
new period, party's basic line, army's functions and patriotism, 
he said. 
  Jiang also stressed the need to improve living conditions 
for 
officers and men, noting: "Army units at all levels must try 
their best to step up agricultural and sideline production." 
  It is an important guiding principle of the party to place 
equal emphasis on material progress and ideological and cultural 
progress, he noted. 
  He called on the Army to stand in the forefront of society 
in 
promoting ideological and cultural progress. 
  Army units at all levels must persist in strict training of 
soldiers and explore new ways for troop command, he said. 
  "We must further improve unity between the Army and the 
government and between the Army and the people," he said in 
conclusion.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin 
today called for attention to socialist ethics, discipline, the 
need to take national interests into account and the necessity 
to take the road of common prosperity. 
  "The further reform is carried out, the more extensively the 
pattern of interest sharing is adjusted, and the greater the 
market role is, the more vigorously we should advocate socialist 
ethics, discipline, attention to national interests as a whole, 
and common prosperity," he said. 
  Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese 
Communist 
Party Central Committee, attended a group discussion on Premier 
Li Peng's government work report by Shanghai deputies to the 
National People's Congress (NPC), of which he is one. 
  Joining the discussion, Jiang said that under the current 
good situation at home and abroad, it is imperative to seize 
opportunities for economic development. 
  "Meanwhile," he said, "we must keep sober-minded and be 
fully 
aware of challenges faced by China in the international 
community, as well as problems that have arisen at home amid 
continuous progress." 
  Jiang Zemin stressed the need to work even harder and more 
diligently. 
  He asked governments at all levels to devote their major 
attention to seizing development opportunities, deepening 
reforms, opening China wider to the outside world, promoting 
economic development and maintaining social stability. 
  The central authorities have decided on the focus of work 
for 
this year in order to achieve "a sustained, rapid and sound" 
development of the national economy, he said. 
  The key to successfully fulfilling the task, he said, is to 
correctly handle relations between reform, development and 
stability. 
  "We must pay close attention to maintaining a stable social 
and political environment, promote reform and development amid 
stability, and ensure long-term social stability through reform 
and development," he said. 
  The president described reform, development and stability as 
three closely interrelated "strategic pieces" on a chess board, 
saying that it is a leadership art to correctly handle relations 
among the three. 
  On agriculture, he stressed the importance of adhering to 
the 
following principles: 
  -- To strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the 
national economy; 
  -- To steadily increase the output of major farm products 
such as grain, cotton and cooking oil; 
  -- To alleviate farmers' financial burdens while increasing 
their incomes; 
  -- To vigorously develop rural enterprises; 
  -- To stabilize the household-based system of farming; and 
  -- To improve the work efficiency of village-level 
organizations led by village party branches. 
  Jiang praised large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises 
for their vital contributions to China's economic growth. 
  "These enterprises serve as the backbone of China's economy 
and will continue to play a leading role in expanding a 
socialist market economy," he said. 
  "Therefore, no matter what difficulties we may face, we 
should make every effort to improve the performance of 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises," Jiang said. 
  Speaking of difficulties being faced by many state-owned 
enterprises, Jiang said it is a major task of the party, the 
government and the society as a whole to help them overcome 
their difficulties and help invigorate them. 
  The fundamental solution is to deepen reform and 
unswervingly 
separate the functions of the government from those of the 
enterprise, accelerate a change of their operational mechanism 
and build a modern enterprise system, he said. 
  It is imperative to push such enterprises onto the 
marketplace where they should seek new ways to overcome 
difficulties. 
  State enterprises, in different types and with different 
conditions, can have diversified operational approaches and 
varied ways to invigorate themselves, Jiang said. 
  However, he said, it is a must to preserve and increase the 
value of state assets. 
  He expressed the hope that Shanghai will accumulate more 
valuable experience in state enterprise reform. 
  Jiang also emphasized the importance of socialist cultural 
and ideological progress. 
  Both material civilization and cultural and ideological 
progress are important aspects of China's modernization program, 
he said. 
  It will be a dangerous deviation for a country, a nation and 
individuals to emphasize only the material side to the neglect 
of the spiritual side, he said. 
  Jiang expressed his appreciation of remarkable achievements 
made by the people of Shanghai. 
  He reiterated that development of Pudong is a major policy 
decision of the central authorities, that development and 
opening of pudong is a firm strategy and that the central 
authorities' policy towards Pudong will remain unchanged. 
  Jiang also expressed the hope that Pudong will become a real 
"dragon head" for the Chang Jiang River valley. 
  Shanghai's development can never be separated from the 
support of other parts of the country and the latter's 
development also needs Shanghai's support. 
  Shanghai's working class and people should make continuous 
and fresh contributions to the development of other parts of the 
country, especially central and western regions, he said. 
  Rong Yiren, Chinese vice president and an NPC deputy in the 
Shanghai delegation, also spoke at the group discussion.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jiang Zemin by special </F>
correspondent Zhu Mei on 10 March in Beijing; from the "Morning 
News" program] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 10 March Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, president of the state, 
and deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC) elected from 
Shanghai, attended a group discussion with NPC deputies from 
Shanghai. He discussed state affairs with other NPC deputies. 
After the meeting, Jiang Zemin agreed to an interview with our 
station correspondent. The following is a related report from 
Beijing by special correspondent Zhu Mei: 
  [Begin recording] [Zhu Mei] From assuming the post of 
Shanghai mayor to becoming general secretary of the CPC Central 
Committee, Jiang Zemin has always showed great concern for the 
shopping basket issues of urban residents. He often said the 
situation can be determined from what is in citizen's shopping 
baskets. Jiang asked cadres at various levels to place the 
shopping basket issue on their important daily agendas. Today, 
he once again mentioned the topic of shopping baskets. 
  [Jiang Zemin] I am concerned about commodity prices. I had 
been in Shanghai for many years and roughly knew the prices of 
foodstuffs in all the markets. I am also (?interested) in 
commodity prices in Beijing. Regretfully, I cannot go there to 
ask about prices. However, family members often go to the Xidan 
Food Market. [words indistinct] Eggs were 2.8 yuan in Shanghai. 
Right? Now the price seems a little cheaper, something like 
2.7 yuan. Generally speaking, the masses still have complaints 
about commodity prices, feeling they are too high. However, now 
the capability and income level of the masses have also 
increased somewhat. [words indistinct] The residents are very 
concerned about the price of foodstuffs, such as preserved eggs, 
meat, and [word indistinct]. Their main concern is their 
shopping basket and (?food grain). 
  [Zhu Mei] In his talk, General-Secretary Jiang Zemin 
stressed the dialectics of speed of our country's economic 
development. 
  [Jiang Zemin] Development is the final word. This is 
totally correct. Comrade Xiaoping has made a series of 
important expositions on the issue of development. He asked us 
to seize opportunity in order to accelerate reform and 
development. In short, if you have conditions for development, 
you should be able to development in a relatively rapid manner. 
In areas lacking the conditions for development, you should 
create conditions for development; but you must not be too 
hasty, and must not insist on development if you clearly do not 
have the conditions for development. It will eventually create 
problems. I am talking about the situation of the entire 
country, including Shanghai. Every county and every district 
cannot develop in a balanced manner based on the same model. We 
all want to be rapid. Concerning speed, Comrade Li Peng put 
forward a figure of 9 percent. Of course this 9 percent cannot 
be applied to all locales because the situation in various 
regions is different. We cannot demand the same speed. We must 
not blindly seek output value and expand the scale of 
investment. We also must not solely depend on beginning new 
projects. In my opinion, Shanghai has very good conditions, 
including the quality of workers and level of management and 
market. The main conditions are all very good. Therefore we 
have great expectations. 
  [Zhu Mei] Comrade Jiang Zemin had in the past worked at 
large and medium enterprises for a long time. He has great 
expectations in the improvement of large and medium enterprises 
in Shanghai, and has established a modern system for socialist 
enterprises. 
  [Jiang Zemin] [Words indistinct] We should use a third eye 
to look at a book [as heard]. We should (?analyze the 
situation) from social and political angles. Whoever grasps the 
leadership of large and medium enterprise will have gripped the 
lifeline of the state. There is reason for it, because they are 
the backbone of the socialist ownership system. Therefore, we 
must do an effective job in developing state-owned large and 
medium enterprises, and must not fail in this work. We must 
only strengthen our efforts, and not weaken them. As to how to 
do a good job in this respect, I am willing to discuss this with 
you. For example, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee called for establishing a modern enterprise 
system. [words indistinct] The level of development of 
state-owned large and medium enterprises is different in various 
localities. For instance, the level of development in Shanghai 
is relatively high. Even in Shanghai, the situation is not the 
same. It is necessary to make an analysis. Under the 
leadership of the CPC, state-owned large and medium enterprises 
must still give full play to the administrative leadership of 
plant directors; party committees should adopt the role of 
political core. We should also develop the initiative of the 
broad masses of staff members and workers in production as the 
masters of the country. The trial of the joint stock system at 
selected units will not annul their position of being masters of 
the country; it will not annul their position. Therefore, we 
may have to give some assistance to state-owned large and medium 
enterprises which suffer from serious economic losses [words 
indistinct], but not those enterprises which have no future in 
development [words indistinct]. 
  [Zhu Mei] Jiang Zemin talks with zest about refined art, 
popular songs, cultural accomplishments, and other light 
subjects. 
  [Jiang Zemin] Concerning Shanghai's philharmonic orchestra, 
music, and related topics, in an earlier period there were [zui 
xin zu] and (?four great heavenly emperors) [si da tian wang]. 
In regards to them, we should give people guidance. So many 
people enjoy them, but are not allowed to watch. The 
Constitution has no such stipulation. In addition, some are 
fond of these things. Talking about popular songs, some are 
very good. But it seems a little bit too much if they indulge 
their passion in those things. If the great Chinese people do 
not know anything about Beethoven's 9th Symphony and (?happy 
song) [huan le song], [words indistinct] it is not good. I 
heard that our comrade (Min Huifen) has a large audience [words 
indistinct], and erhu [two-stringed bowed instrument] can be 
developed. Those things need support by (?performers), the 
state, and various departments. China is a nation with an 
outstanding culture; we also have several thousand years of 
history [words indistinct]. 
  [Zhu Mei] At 1745 this afternoon, soon after the discussion 
with the Shanghai delegation, Shanghai reporters immediately 
rushed toward Jiang Zemin. I was the first to step forward and 
make a request of the general-secretary. 
  [Zhu Mei] General Secretary Jiang, please say something to 
us. We are all from Shanghai. 
  [Jiang Zemin] Of course. I hope Shanghai will develop more, 
and people will have a happier life. As a resident of Shanghai, 
I am convinced Shanghai has much talent and outstanding 
conditions. For instance, Pudong is developing quite well. I 
repeatedly said last year that the principle and policy for 
Pudong will be implemented in a firm manner. I am very grateful 
to you for asking me to come here and speak. 
  [Zhu Mei] When a reporter asked the general secretary when 
would he see Shanghai's Yangpu Bridge, Jiang Zemin said: 
  [Jiang Zemin, in Shanghai dialect] I wish I could go there 
tomorrow. [background laughter] [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin, in its "National Hookup" program, 
broadcasts at 1100 GMT on 11 March a 7.5-minute announcer-read 
report over video on the second plenary meeting of the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) held at 
the Great Hall of the People on the morning of 11 March. 
  The video report begins with high-angled pan shots of the

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- As a National People's 
Congress [NPC] deputy elected in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee and state president, 
attended a group discussion by the Shanghai delegation this 
afternoon and discussed state affairs with them with great zest. 
He stressed: The further reform is carried out, the more 
extensively the pattern of interest sharing is adjusted, and the 
greater the market role is, the more vigorously we should 
advocate ideals, discipline, unity, and attention to national 
interests, the more we should promote the spirit of helping each 
other like passengers in the same boat, taking the interest of 
the whole into account, and the more we should adhere to the 
path of working together for common prosperity. He urged 
Shanghai's working class and the broad mass of cadres and people 
to continue carrying forward their fine tradition, play an 
exemplary role in this regard, and make still greater 
contributions to reform, development, and stability in Shanghai 
and the whole nation. 
  At this afternoon's group discussion, the deputies earnestly 
examined and discussed Premier Li Peng's "Report on the 
Government Work" and freely aired their views. As Zhang Zhongli 
and eight other deputies spoke, Jiang Zemin listened attentively 
and took notes. He; Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal CPC 
Committee secretary; Mayor Huang Ju; and Ye Gongqi, chairman of 
the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's 
Congress; chipped in from time to time. They talked cheerfully 
and humorously and the meeting hall was permeated with a warm 
atmosphere. 
  When he spoke, Jiang Zemin first pointed out: Taken 
together, 
the current international situation is good for China's 
development and the situation at home is excellent. The better 
the situation, the harder we should work to seize the 
opportunity and take advantage of it to develop our country. We 
must keep sober-minded and be fully aware of challenges faced by 
China in the international community, as well as problems that 
have arisen at home amid continuous progress. We should think 
of danger in times of peace and work even harder and more 
diligently. 
  Jiang Zemin said: The basic policy for and overall task of 
the party's and state's work for 1994 have been adopted. 
Everything we do must be subject to and serve the overall task 
of "seizing development opportunities, deepening reforms, 
opening up wider to the outside world, promoting development, 
and maintaining stability." The Central Committee has decided 
to make this the focus of work to achieve a sustained, rapid, 
and healthy growth [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 
1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. This 
overall task gives full expression to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
ideas of development. We must fully understand it and implement 
it comprehensively in our work. The key to successfully 
fulfilling this overall task of the party and state is to 
correctly handling relations between reform, development and 
stability. We must, on one hand, work hard to deepen reform, 
open up wider, and promote economic development; on the other 
hand, we must pay close attention to maintaining a stable social 
and political environment, promote reform and development amid 
stability, and ensure long-term social stability through reform 
and development. Reform, development and stability are like 
three closely interrelated strategic pieces on a chess board. 
When all three pieces are moved with skill and coordination, 
the national situation as a whole will be enlivened. A wrong 
move by one piece will put the two other in a tight spot, 
causing a setback to the overall situation. Correctly handle 
relations among the three represents an essential leadership art 
in our modernization drive. 
  Speaking on promoting agriculture and rural work, Jiang 
Zemin 
said: Years of experience has told us that to develop 
agriculture, there must be no wavering of the following in terms 
of guiding ideology and basic policy: 1) agriculture as the 
foundation of the national economy; 2) maintaining a steady 
increase in the output of major farm products such as grain, 
cotton, and cooking oil; 3) incremental increase in 
agricultural input; 4) alleviating farmers' financial burdens 
while increasing their incomes; 5) vigorously developing village 
and township enterprises, encouraging rural industries to 
subsidize agriculture, and creating jobs locally for the surplus 
rural work force; 6) the policy of stabilizing the 
responsibility system with the household contract linking output 
to payment as the main form, perfecting the system of unified 
management combined with independent management, developing a 
network of collectivized services, and continuously enhancing 
the economic strength of rural collectives; and 7) improving the 
work efficiency of village-level organizations led by village 
party branches. He also pointed out: Even a large industrial 
city like Shanghai should uphold, without wavering, the overall 
guiding ideology that takes agriculture as the foundation of the 
national economy. In addition to being self-sufficient in 
grain, the districts and counties in the outskirts must also do 
a good job in implementing the "shopping basket" project and 
ensuring an adequate supply of vegetables and other nonstable 
foodstuffs in the city. 
  Speaking of continuing the efforts to invigorate 
state-owned large and medium enterprises, Jiang Zemin stressed: 
After decades of work, China has developed an independent 
state-owned industrial system that is comprehensive in scope. 
This is a unique advantage of the Chinese economy. Thanks to 
this advantage, China has been able to steer clear of many of 
the problems that are unavoidable in the course of the 
development of a developing country. Large and medium 
state-owned enterprises have made vital contributions to China's 
economic growth. They serve as the backbone of China's economy 
and will continue to play a leading role in expanding a 
socialist market economy. Therefore, no matter what 
difficulties we may face, we should make every effort to improve 
the performance of state-owned large and medium enterprises. 
Their economic strength can only be increased, never to be 
weakened, because they are the lifeblood of China's socialist 
economy and because they are where China's working class is 
concentrated. It is true that a considerable number of large 
and medium state-owned enterprises are beset with many 
difficulties and urgent problems, and it is a major task of the 
party, the government, and society as a whole to help them 
overcome their difficulties and to quickly regain their 
vitality. The fundamental solution is to deepen reform and 
unswervingly separate the functions of the government from those 
of the enterprise, to accelerate a change of their operational 
mechanism, and to build a modern enterprise system. It is 
imperative to push such enterprises onto the market place where 
they should compete with one another and seek new ways to 
overcome difficulties. Government at all levels must also guide 
them and provide them with the needed support. He pointed out: 
State enterprises, of different types and under different 
conditions, can have diversified operational approaches and 
varied ways to invigorate themselves; they can become very 
creative on their own. However, this point should be made 
abundantly clear: They must, all in all, preserve and increase 
the value of state assets. This fundamental requirement must be 
adhered to unswervingly. He expressed the hope that Shanghai 
will accumulate more valuable experience in improving the 
performance of large and medium state enterprises to usher in a 
new situation. 
  Speaking of strengthening socialist spiritual civilization, 
Jiang Zemin said: The grand goal of rejuvenating China and 
accomplishing modernization has two aspects: a highly developed 
material civilization and a highly developed spiritual 
civilization. Socialism with Chinese characteristics calls for 
the development of both civilizations. By repeatedly stressing 
the need to persist in the principle of "giving equal emphasis 
on two fronts and doing well in both," Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
has reminded us again and again that while promoting material 
civilization, we must not overlook spiritual civilization. It 
would not be a comprehensive, correct implementation of the 
party's basic policy if a locality, by paying more attention to 
the former to the neglect of the latter over a long period, has 
successfully promoted the economy but has seen a decline in 
social conduct. The growth of social productive forces should 
be reflected both in the accumulation of wealth and the 
upgrading of the quality of workers. It will be a dangerous 
deviation for a country, a nation, and individuals to emphasize 
only the material side to the neglect of the spiritual side. 
The suggestion that I made at last year's NPC session that we 
need to promote the 64-character pioneering spirit [emancipate 
the mind, seek truth from facts, actively explore new ways, dare 
to innovate, work hard, press forward in the face of 
difficulties, learn from foreign countries, constantly improve 
ourselves, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and 
impatience, work together as one, keep the national interest in 
mind, be diligent and frugal, be upright and honest, work 
vigorously to make the country prosperous, and serve selflessly] 
has received widespread support. We all hope that this kind of 
pioneering spirit will become the order of the day throughout 
the whole nation and the whole society. It is hoped that we 
will, as a result of the efforts in promoting spiritual 
civilization, bring forth in large numbers builders of socialism 
with Chinese characteristics who are well educated, self- 
disciplined, and who have lofty ideals and moral integrity. 
  Jiang Zemin affirmed the achievements that Shanghai has 
made in its work and spoke of his hopes for the city. He said: 
In the past year, people in Shanghai have done good work under 
the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and 
government; its economic growth has been rapid, and the 
situation is heartening. It is hoped that the broad ranks of 
cadres and people in Shanghai will continue to exert themselves, 
guard against arrogance and impatience, and create still better 
performance in reform and opening up. He reiterated that 
development of Pudong is a major policy decision of the central 
authorities, that the development and opening of Pudong must be 
carried out unswervingly, and that the central authorities' 
policy toward Pudong will remain unchanged. He expressed the 
hope that Pudong will become a real "dragon head" that will 
bring about economic development in the Chang Jiang Valley and 
that Shanghai will serve as a conduit for China's march to the 
world and become a veritable international economic, financial, 
and trade center. He also said that Shanghai's development can 
never be separated from the support of other parts of the 
country and that the latter's development also needs Shanghai's 
support. Shanghai's working class and people should carry 
forward the fine tradition of subordinating regional interests 
to the national interest and make continuous and fresh 
contributions to reform, opening up, and China's modernization 
drive and to the development of other parts of the country, 
especially the central and western regions. 
  Vice President Rong Yiren, another NPC deputy elected from 
Shanghai, also spoke at the meeting. He said: China has 
undergone tremendous changes in the political, economic, and 
social sectors over the decades. The system of people's 
democracy is being perfected daily and the economy is growing 
steadily. Under this new situation, we should work with one 
heart and one mind and carry forward the spirit of hard work, 
plain living, and seeking truth from facts in order to turn 
China into strong, prosperous country.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a group 
discussion attended by National People's Congress [NPC] deputies 
from the Chinese Liberation Army [PLA] today, Liu Huaqing, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing 
Committee and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, 
stressed that all PLA commanders and fighters must have a clear 
understanding of the historical missions that they carry on 
their shoulders, must actively promote the modernization of the 
national defense, and must provide a powerful security guarantee 
for reform, opening up, and modernization. 
  Liu Huaqing said: The guidelines laid down by the 14th 
National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee have been successfully reflected in 
the basic policy and tasks for 1994 which Premier Li Peng has 
clearly outlined in his "Government Work Report." The "report" 
has especially stressed that seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening wider to the outside world, expediting 
development, and maintaining stability are the requirements of 
overall importance for the country; and that the relations 
between reform, development, and stability must be handled 
properly. Comrades in the armed forces must obey and serve 
these requirements of overall importance and contribute to 
reform, opening up, and economic development, as well as to 
safeguarding the motherland's security. 
  Liu Huaqing said: China is a socialist country, and our 
efforts to speed up the modernization of our national defense 
are totally for defensive purposes so that our motherland's 
territorial land, waters, and airspace will not be violated, the 
unification and stability of our country can be safeguarded, and 
people of all nationalities in the country can dedicate 
themselves to socialist modernization. The annual military 
budget of our big country is very low compared to countries of 
the world. While our military budget cannot be compared to 
those of the developed countries, it is even much lower than 
those of certain neighboring countries. 
  Liu Huaqing said: The Chinese people are a peace-loving 
people. We suffered immensely from foreign powers' aggression 
for more than a century, and the wounds of foreign aggression 
are keenly felt. The Chinese people, who have stood up, will 
absolutely not permit any aggressors to trample on our national 
sovereignty and interests, will never seek hegemony, and will 
never seize an inch of foreign territory. China will not embark 
on an arms race, nor will we join any military blocs or create 
spheres of influence. This is our consistent stand. For a long 
time to come, China will concentrate its efforts on developing 
production and improving the people's living standards. We will 
adhere to the party's basic line for 100 years without wavering. 
Not only is this in the interest of China, but it is also in 
the interest of Asia and the world as a whole. 
  Liu Huaqing noted: The armed forces made new headway in all 
fields in 1993. New successes were achieved in improving party 
members' conduct and in promoting honesty and administrative 
ethics in the armed forces. Many heroes with Xu Honggang as the 
model came to the fore. An upsurge of the troops' training 
occurred, and an unusually good situation in military training 
appeared. New headway was also achieved in defense science and 
technology research and in improving logistical support. 
  Liu Huaqing said: To intensify the modernization of 
national defense, we must follow the guidance provided by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and his thoughts on military 
construction during the new period, pay attention to quality, 
firmly follow the path of building crack troops with Chinese 
characteristics, and comprehensively build up our armed forces 
in accordance with the general requirement put forth by Chairman 
Jiang Zemin that the PLA must be "politically measured up, 
militarily toughened, outstanding in work style, strict in 
discipline, and powerful in defense." In order to improve the 
PLA's combat-readiness, current and future work will primarily 
be on strengthening its ideological and political construction, 
developing modern weaponry, training commanders and technical 
specialists with the skills needed in modern warfare, and 
bringing about the best combination of people and weapons 
through scientific organization and rigorous training. We still 
have some difficulties with regard to military budgets and 
military construction, we must therefore carry forward the "five 
types of revolutionary spirit" which Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
advocated and Chairman Jiang Zemin's "64-character pioneering 
spirit" [liberate the mind, seek truth from facts, actively 
explore, be brave in innovating, wage arduous struggle, proceed 
despite difficulties, learn from foreign countries, make 
persistent efforts to improve ourselves, be humble and prudent, 
guard against complacency and rashness, work with one heart and 
one mind, take the interests of the whole into consideration, 
work diligently and practice economy, be upright and honest, 
rouse ourselves to build a stronger nation, and make selfless 
dedication], wage arduous struggle, build the armed forces 
through diligence and thrift, strive to improve the economic 
efficiency of military projects, and proceed while overcoming 
difficulties. 
  Liu Huaqing said: The rock-solid Army-government and 
Army-people solidarity is important in enhancing social 
stability and ensuring national peace. We must always preserve 
this fine tradition under the new situation. He said: 
Army-government and Army-people relations have been developing 
satisfactorily in recent years. Projects to support the 
government, cherish the people, support the military, and give 
preferential treatment to military families are making progress 
and improving. Military and local authorities must bear in mind 
the overall interests of the country and take the initiative in 
promoting Army-government and Army-people solidarity, in 
consolidating and developing new Army-government and Army-people 
relationships, and contribute positively to expediting economic 
construction and social stability. The PLA must remain humble 
and prudent and respect local party committees and government 
under all circumstances. All officers and men in the armed 
forces must always bear in mind the code which requires them to 
serve the people wholeheartedly, and set an example in following 
the party's lines and general and specific policies and state 
laws and regulations. The PLA must actively support and take 
part in local economic construction projects, help the local 
people solve problems, correct conduct improper for party 
members, guard against the inroads of corrosion, advocate work 
ethics, establish a good image, and be brave in fighting social 
evils. We must rally even more closely around the CPC Central 
Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and work hard 
together with the people in the country to achieve new victories 
in reform, opening up, and modernization.
