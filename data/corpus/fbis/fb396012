  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, a top 
leader of China's armed forces, today urged officers and men of 
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to provide a "powerful 
security guarantee" for China's reform, opening up and 
modernization drive. 
  In a group discussion with PLA deputies about the government 
work report, Liu, vice-chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, said that PLA must also redouble their efforts to 
modernize China's national defense. 
  He said that PLA must help fulfill the overall task of 
seizing development opportunities, deepening reforms, opening 
China wider to the outwide world, promoting economic development 
and maintaining stability as outlined by premier Li Peng in his 
government work report. 
  The leader called on officers and men to make their due 
contributions to reform, opening up, economic growth and 
national defense. 
  He said, "ours is a socialist country. Our endeavor to 
modernize national defense serves solely to defend ourselves, 
defend our motherland's territory, territorial waters and 
territorial air space from being infringed, and maintain China's 
unification and stability." 
  The amount of China's annual military expenditure is very 
small in the world, said Liu, who is also a standing committee 
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party 
Central Committee. 
  "The Chinese people are a peace-loving people. They have 
suffered enormously from invasions by foreign powers over the 
past century," he said. 
  The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never allow any 
aggressor to stamp underfoot China's sovereignty and interests, 
he said, adding that they will neither seek hegemony nor want to 
occupy an inch of land of another country, he stressed. 
  "China will not pursue an arms race, nor participate in any 
military block or seek spheres of influence. This stand of ours 
has been consistent," he said. 
  For a long time to come, China will concentrate on 
developing 
its productive forces and improving people's living standards, 
he said. 
  "That conforms to the interests of China and those of Asia 
and the world at large," he said. 
  Liu said that last year the Army made new progress in 
military training, national defense research and logistic 
service. 
  Speaking of main tasks for the Army at present and in a 
period to come, the general said the Army should strengthen its 
ideological and political construction, develop modern arms and 
equipment, train commanders and professionals with skills needed 
in modern warfare and obtain the best combination of men and 
weapons through scientific arrangements and strict training in a 
bid to raise comprehensively the combat capacity of the Army. 
  The Army should carry on the fine tradition of hard struggle 
and building the Army thriftily and work hard to improve 
military and economic efficiency and march forward by overcoming 
difficulties ahead, he said. 
  He also urged the Army to firmly carry forward the fine 
tradition of maintaining unity between the Army and the 
government and between the Army and the people and make positive 
contributions to promoting economic development and social 
stability. 
  The People's Liberation Army should always be modest and 
prudent and respect local party committees and governments, Liu 
said, adding that officers and men of the Army should always 
keep in mind the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly 
and implement the party's policies and state laws and decrees in 
an exemplary way. 
  The Army should support and participate in local economic 
development and help local people solve difficulties, do good 
turns to them and bravely fight against social evils.

<F P=106> [By reporters Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900) and Fang </F>
Zhengjun (2455 2398 6511)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- In discussing and 
deliberating the "Government Work Report" with the Hubei 
delegation today, Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee 
of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman 
of the Central Military Commission, said emphatically: We now 
have a good opportunity to deepen reform and accelerate 
development. People across the country must seize the 
opportunity, take the overall situation into consideration, 
pluck up their spirits, and make concerted efforts to carry out 
China's economic construction. 
  During the discussion, Liu Huaqing listened attentively to 
the deputies' remarks and interposed from time to time. He 
showed great pleasure when Hubei Governor Jia Zhijie briefed the 
deputies saying that last year the province's gross domestic 
product exceeded 100 billion yuan; total industrial and 
agricultural output value topped 200 billion yuan; revenues rose 
above 10 billion yuan; and urban and rural residents' income 
registered a considerable increase. 
  Liu Huaqing said: For Hubei, which is situated in the 
hinterland of central China, the construction of the Three 
Gorges project -- to divert water from Danjiang reservoir to 
north China -- and the opening of Wuhan and Huangshi cities 
present a very good opportunity. If the province's 56 million 
people make concerted efforts to advance in an invigorated 
spirit and handle relations among reform, development, and 
stability well, accelerating Hubei's development looks very 
promising. 
  Liu Huaqing pointed out: The state has promulgated many new 
reform measures this year, which involve the readjustment of 
certain interests. This requires everyone to correctly handle 
relations between overall and partial interests, subordinate 
minor interests to overall interests, and foster the thinking of 
coordinating all the nation's activities as in a chess game. In 
the transition from the old to the new, some localities will 
encounter difficulties. The important thing is to take into 
consideration our actual conditions, display the spirit of plain 
living and hard struggle, be diligent and frugal, and work hard 
to overcome difficulties. 
  Liu Huaqing stressed the need to attach importance to 
building socialist spiritual civilization. He said: The drive 
to combat corruption and promote clean government launched in 
the entire party, army, and country last year was a great 
success. However, it has not achieved all our objectives. The 
drive to combat corruption and promote clean government is a 
long-term task. We must carry it out to the end and never relax 
our efforts. When speaking of social practice, Liu Huaqing 
pointed out: We must advocate new socialist practice and fine 
social ethics, and vigorously promote the spirit of plain living 
and hard struggle to change prevailing habits and customs. We 
must adhere to the principle of fostering both material and 
spiritual civilization, attaching equal importance to both. We 
must work hard to nurture a new generation of socialist people 
with ideals, morality, knowledge, and discipline.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, a top 
Chinese leader, today urged China's central province of Hubei to 
take advantage of the giant Three Gorges project on the Chang 
Jiang river to develop its economy. 
  Liu said, "for Hubei, the massive Three Gorges project on 
the 
Chang Jiang river, the project to divert water from its Danjiang 
reservoir to north China, and the opening of Wuhan and Huangshi 
cities, present good opportunities for an economic takeoff." 
  Liu, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, 
expressed the view at a group discussion by Hubei deputies to 
the National People's Congress now in session in Beijing. 
  He expressed the belief that Hubei can certainly achieve 
faster economic growth so long as its 56 million people work 
hard and properly handle relations between reform, development 
and stability. 
  According to Hubei Provincial governor Jia Zhijie, Hubei's 
gross domestic product topped 100 billion yuan last year. 
  New reform measures taken by the central government since 
the 
beginning of this year involve the readjustment of interests, 
and that makes it imperative to properly handle the interest of 
the whole and those of the part, Liu said.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video from the "Special News </F>
Program on the Second Session of the Eighth NPC": "Report on the 
Implementation of the State Budget for 1993 and the Draft State 
Budget for 1994" -- identified by caption -- delivered by 
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli to the second session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress (NPC) on 11 March] 
  [Text] Liu Zhongli's report is divided into three parts: 
1. The Implementation of the State Budget for 1993; 2. The Draft 
State Budget for 1994; and 3. Deepen the Fiscal and Taxation 
Reform, Relentlessly Increase Revenues and Cut Back 
Expenditures, and Strive to Fulfill the 1994 State Budget. 
<H5>  1. The Implementation of the State Budget for 1993 </H5>
  Total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan -- 
including 69.384 billion yuan income received from domestic and 
foreign debts -- covering 113.1 percent of the budget, a 23.2 
percent increase over the previous year. Total state 
expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan -- including 
33.735 billion yuan spent to pay for the principle and interest 
of domestic and foreign debts -- equaled 112.5 percent of the 
budget, a 21.2 percent increase over the 1992 figure. This 
resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not in 
excess of the budgeted figure. 
  Based on the double-entry system, revenues in the regular 
budget totalled 407.391 billion yuan, or 119.3 percent of the 
budgeted figure; and construction budget revenues -- not 
including income from domestic and foreign debts -- totaled 
107.264 billion yuan, or 122.5 percent of the budgeted figure. 
  The implementation of the 1993 state budget. Both revenues 
and expenditures exceeded the budgeted figures by a fairly large 
margin. According to our preliminary analysis, the 
overfulfillment of revenues by a large margin was mainly due to 
three factors: First, the national economy's sustained, rapid 
growth caused an increase in revenues accordingly. The rapid 
growth of the national economy and the commodity's circulation 
expansion brought about the overfulfillment of revenues of main 
tax categories closely related to economic growth. Revenues 
from the product tax, value-added tax, and business tax alone 
were 49.5 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Second, 
measures to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control yielded positive results and led to a marked drop in 
revenue losses. According to State General Administration of 
Taxation statistics, efforts to screen tax reductions and 
exemptions and to collect tax payments in arrears for the 
previous years brought about a 30 billion yuan increase. Third, 
in 1994, the central authorities decided to implement the fiscal 
tax assignment system, under which the central government will 
reimburse local governments a certain amount of tax revenues 
based on their 1993 figures. This new system aroused the local 
governments' enthusiasm for revenue collection, and they took a 
number of measures to strictly collect taxes, manage revenues, 
and prevent tax evasion. As a result, revenues increased by a 
large margin in the fourth quarter. However, some local 
governments, to inflate the base figure for the central 
government's reimbursement, resorted to illegitimate means and 
fraud by collecting taxes before the due date. We have urged 
local governments to examine and correct themselves, and we will 
organize forces to verify and handle cases in accordance with 
the State Council's requirements. 
  As far as increased expenditures were concerned, 
expenditures 
related to economic growth increased by a bigger margin. 
Expenditures needed for the development of various undertakings 
also increased by a larger margin. Of these increases, expenses 
on cultural, educational, science, and health undertakings were 
10.816 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Expenses on 
education alone were 6.463 billion yuan more than the budgeted 
figure. Expenses on urban maintenance and construction was 3.86 
billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Spending for wage 
adjustment of workers and staff of administrative institutions 
and units was budgeted at 4 billion yuan. In the course of 
implementation, however, because the margin of wage adjustment 
was higher than the originally estimated figure, in addition to 
an increase of personnel and changes in jobs and grades 
throughout the year, the actual spending was almost double the 
budgeted figure. Generally speaking, the implementation of the 
1993 budget was good. 
  Special mention should be made of the fact that although 
treasury bond sales were sluggish for some time last year, party 
committees and governments at all levels, as well as relevant 
departments, attached great importance and lent enthusiastic 
support to such sales. Financial departments at all levels also 
devoted massive manpower to providing services aimed at 
promoting sales, thereby ensuring completion of the task of 
issuing treasury bonds. This was of vital importance to the 
fulfillment of last year's budgetary tasks. 
<H5>  II. The Draft State Budget for 1994 </H5>
  The guiding principles for planning the state budget for 
1994 
are: Fully implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; ensuring smooth progress in financial, taxation, and 
other major economic reforms; continuing to tighten and improve 
macroeconomic regulation and control; actively building up 
financial sources; paying attention to improving enterprises' 
efficiency; ensuring that increases in financial revenue would 
match economic development; upholding the principle of acting 
within one's means; readjusting the revenue structure; 
appropriately increasing input in such key sectors as 
agriculture, education, science and technology, and 
infrastructure; maintaining needed increases in funds for 
national defense, public security, and judicial departments; 
strictly controlling ordinary fixed assets investments and 
nonproductive expenditures; and promoting sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development in the national economy, as well as overall 
social progress. 
  We have made initial plans for the 1994 budget in accordance 
with the guiding principles for budgetary planning and the 
changes in budget requirements. Excluding revenues from the 
repayment of domestic and foreign debts, total state revenues 
are set at 475.99 billion yuan, a 7.7 percent increase over the 
previous year and calculated on similar terms. Excluding 
expenses used to repay domestic and foreign debts, total state 
expenditures are set at 542.914 billion yuan, a 15 percent 
increase over the previous year and calculated on similar terms. 
The difference between revenues and expenditures is 66.919 
billion yuan [as heard]. An 7.7 percent increase over the 
previous year is planned for financial revenues in 1994; the 
percentage increase is not high. Calculated on comparable 
terms, this year's financial revenues will only increase 14.4 
percent over the previous year. The current revenue plan, 
therefore, is positive because it is based on a full 
consideration of factors leading to increased revenues, such as 
rapid economic development and improved management. 
  The draft state budget compiled according to the dual budget 
system follows: 
  Revenues in the regular budget total 448.911 billion yuan, a 
9.9 percent increase over the previous year. Revenues in the 
construction budget total 83.149 billion yuan, a decrease of 
22.5 percent from the figure fulfilled in the previous year. In 
the draft state budget for 1994, revenues in the central budget 
are set at 332.91 billion yuan, a 3.8 percent increase over the 
previous year. 
  The central budget compiled according to the dual budget 
system follows: 
  Revenues in the regular budget total 325.923 billion yuan, a 
6 percent increase over the previous year. Revenues in the 
central construction budget total 22.243 billion yuan, a 44.3 
percent decrease from the previous year. 
  To facilitate examination by fellow deputies, I would like 
to 
expound policy-related issues in compiling the draft state 
budget: 
  The question of debts in 1994. Domestic and foreign debts 
for 1994 are set at 129.245 billion yuan, a 39.361 billion yuan 
increase. The total debt volume accounts for 3.8 percent of the 
year's gross domestic product, a slight increase over the 
previous year. 
  The question of promoting rural economic development in an 
all-around way. Expenditures for aiding agricultural production 
and for paying various agriculture-related operational charges 
in this year's state budget total 37.8 billion yuan, a 17.4 
percent increase over the actual expenses in the previous year. 
Including other budgetary items used as agricultural expenses, 
the state's planned financial input in agriculture totals 52.3 
billion yuan, a 7 billion yuan increase over the previous year. 
  On the issue of further successfully running large and 
medium-sized state enterprises. This year's reform of the 
fiscal and taxation systems will focus on transforming 
mechanisms to seek unity of the taxation system for all 
enterprises. It will play a positive role in invigorating state 
enterprises' stamina for development and competitiveness. 
Meanwhile, our reform of the taxation system will scrap the 
regulatory tax for state enterprises and exempt them from 
payment of funds for construction of key energy and transport 
projects and for state budget regulating funds, thereby 
increasing their financial strength by over 14 billion yuan. 
  The issue of increasing investment in the focal points of 
science, technology, and education. This year's budget for 
culture, education, science, and public health expenses is more 
than last year by 17 billion plus, or 18 percent. 
<H3>  III. Deepen the Fiscal and Taxation Reform, Relentlessly 
Increase Revenues and Cut Back Expenditures, and Strive to 
Fulfill the 1994 State Budget </H3>
  Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the 
overall situation for the work of the whole party and the whole 
nation. Ensuring the smooth progress of reform of the fiscal 
and taxation systems and fulfilling the state budget for 1994 
are of crucial importance for the fiscal and taxation work to 
subordinate themselves to and serve the overall situation. We 
must successfully carry out the work in a down-to-earth manner 
to ensure that the anticipated results are achieved from reform 
of the fiscal and taxation systems. The main substance of this 
year's fiscal and taxation reform include reforming the current 
local fiscal contractual responsibility system to implement a 
tax assignment system on the basis of a rational division of 
power between central and local authorities, reforming the 
taxation system to establish an indirect tax system based mainly 
on the value-added tax, unifying enterprises' income tax and 
personal income tax while reforming state enterprises' profits 
distribution system, and improving and strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control to promote sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development. The central government 
must bring the issuance of bonds under control in accordance 
with the amount of debts approved by the state; local 
governments must adhere to the principle -- keep expenditures 
within the limits of income and maintain a balance between 
revenue and expenditure -- in making its budget, and are not 
allowed to make budgets that incur deficits. We must take 
advantage of the favorable opportunity offered by fiscal and 
taxation reform to improve revenues. We must improve the 
methods for the issuance of state treasury bonds to ensure 
fulfillment of the issuance tasks. As the amount of state 
treasury bonds to be issued this year is very large, it will 
have a direct bearing on the results of fiscal and taxation 
reform and on balance between revenue and expenditure. 
Financial departments at all levels must closely coordinate with 
the bank to ensure that priority is given to the issuance of 
state treasury bonds under the centralized leadership of local 
party committees and governments. Financial and banking 
departments at all levels must accumulate experiences, actively 
explore methods for the issuance of state treasury bonds under 
the conditions of a market economy, bring the total amount of 
expenditures under control, and guarantee the expenditures for 
key projects during the issuance of state treasury bonds. When 
making arrangements for financial expenditures, they must adhere 
to the principle of doing what one is capable of, ensure 
adequate funds for key projects, and curb expenditures for 
ordinary ones. This year, in addition to continuing to increase 
input into agriculture, education, and science and technology 
sectors and into infrastructure projects, in addition to 
guaranteeing the necessary increase in outlays for national 
defense, judicial, procuratorial, and public security 
departments, we must give priority to the expenditures for 
payment of wages and for state grain reserves. It is strictly 
forbidden to transfer wages for staff and workers to carry out 
new projects. Construction of projects arranged with financial 
funds by areas that delay payment of wages to staff and workers 
shall be resolutely postponed or stopped. Institutions that 
delay payment of wages to staff and workers are not permitted to 
purchase small cars or other expensive, luxurious consumer 
goods. Financial departments at all levels must attach a high 
degree of importance to the issue.

National Economic and Social Development and the Draft 1994 Plan 
for National Economic and Social Development" -- identified by 
caption -- delivered by Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the 
State Planning Commission, to the second session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress (NPC) on 11 March] 
  [Text] [Video shows close up shots of Chen Jinhua speaking, 
and close up shots of Qiao Shi, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu 
Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Rong Yiren, and others in the 
audience; video occasionally pans across the audience and cuts

  [Begin Chen Jinhua recording] Fellow deputies: At the 
request 
of the State Council, I now submit to this session the report on 
the implementation of the 1993 plan for national economic and 
social development and the draft 1994 plan for national economic 
and social development for your examination and approval, and 
also for suggestions and comments from members of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference and other observers. [end recording] 
  Chen Jinhua's report contains three parts: (1) The Basic 
Situation of the National Economic and Social Development in 
1993; (2) The Major Objectives and Tasks of the 1994 Plan for 
National Economic and Social Development; (3) The Need to 
Strengthen and Improve Macroeconomic Regulation and Control and 
Implement the 1994 Plan for National Economic and Social 
Development in an All-Around Way. 
<H3>  1. The Basic Situation of the National Economic and Social 
Development in 1993 </H3>
  Social production continued a rapid growth. The country's 
gross domestic product last year reached 3,138 billion yuan, up 
13.4 percent over the previous year and 8 percent higher than 
the planned growth rate. The rural economy saw overall growth 
last year, with the output of grain and oil bearing crops 
hitting an all-time high. Grain output reached 456.4 million 
tons, 13.8 billion kilograms more than in 1992 and 103.1 percent 
of the planned figure; and the output of oil bearing crops 
amounted to 17.61 million tons, 1.2 million tons more than in 
1992 and 106.7 percent of the planned figure. Cotton and sugar 
crop outputs decreased and fell short of planned targets due to 
reduced crop areas and pests. Crop cultivation was moving in 
the direction of good quality, high yield, and high efficiency. 
  The production of animal husbandry and fishery increased 
quite rapidly. Total meat output rose 10.2 percent over 1992, 
while the output of aquatic products increased by 14.6 percent. 
  Village and town enterprises reported continued vigorous 
growth, and their development accelerated in the central and 
western regions of the country. 
  The nation's industry produced a total added value of 1,414 
billion yuan, up 21.1 percent over the previous year. This 
growth rate breaks down into 22.2 percent for heavy industry and 
19.9 percent for light industry. Industrial economic efficiency 
was somewhat enhanced. The sales rate of industrial products 
rose from 95.5 percent to 96.4 percent, the profits and tax 
rates of industrial funds rose from 10.1 percent to 10.6 
percent, and the velocity of funds circulating increased from 
1.66 to 1.71 times. The building industry continued rapid 
development. 
  New achievements were made in geological prospecting, and 
new 
progress was made in the tertiary industry. The transport and 
telecommunications industries tapped their potential and strived 
to satisfy the needs of production and the people's livelihood. 
The total volume of rail freight transport was 1,193.6 billion 
tonne-km, up 3.1 percent from 1992. The total volume of post 
and telecommunications services amounted to 46.1 billion yuan, 
up 58.9 percent from the previous year. Rapid development was 
also seen in banking, accounting, auditing, information, 
consulting, and other service trades which provide direct 
services to people's everyday lives. 
  The building of key construction projects and technological 
transformation projects was stepped up. Investment in fixed 
assets nationwide reached 1,182.9 billion yuan, fulfilling 
147.98 percent of the annual plan and up 50.6 percent over the 
previous year, or 22 percent with inflation taken into account. 
To ease bottleneck restrictions on national economic 
development, the investment in the transport and 
telecommunications industries enjoyed greater increases, and its 
proportion in the total investment of state-owned enterprises 
rose to 20.2 percent in 1993 from 14.7 percent in 1992. Both the 
investment scale and engineering progress in railroad 
construction were unprecedented since the founding of the 
People's Republic. Preparations for the construction of the 
Three Gorges Project, which the NPC decided to build, have 
started in an all- around way. The first-stage of construction, 
involving earth-stone work for a cofferdam and an open 
water-diversion channel, is proceeding smoothly. The 
resettlement of displaced residents has been stepped up. The 
construction fund-raising has been going on quite well. New 
progress has been made in tackling major equipment and 
technology problems. 
  In the building of key state construction projects, better 
results were achieved in 1993 than in previous years. A number 
of backbone projects of structural readjustment were completed 
and put into operation. One hundred thirty-three large and 
medium capital construction projects and [word indistinct] 128 
technical renovation projects were completed. Newly added 
industrial and transport capacities included 14.38 million kw of 
electric power generation, 15.42 million tonnes of petroleum, 
1,019 km of newly built, newly double-tracked, and 
newly-electrified railroads, 3,556 km of highways, 37.52 million 
tonnes in harbor loading-unloading capacity, and 3.672 million 
telephone lines. In addition, a number of public welfare 
facilities were completed and put to use. 
  Economic, trade, and technological exchanges with foreign 
countries continued to expand last year. The opening up of 
coastal regions was moving in the direction of optimizing the 
industrial structure. The pace of development and opening up of 
Shanghai's Pudong District was accelerated. A number of new 
economic and technological development zones were built in some 
border and coastal cities and in some cities along inland rivers. 
  Foreign trade developed steadily. The total volume of import 
and export trade reached $195.8 billion, up 18.2 percent over 
1992. Use of foreign funds increased substantially last year. 
The amount of foreign capital actually used during the year 
reached $36.77 billion, up 91.5 percent over the previous year. 
The investment pattern by foreign businesses improved, with 
increased investment in long- and medium-term projects. 
Investment by big overseas companies and financial groups 
increased. The focus of investment is gradually shifting 
towards infrastructure and basic industries, and more 
investments are flowing to central and western China. 
  Success was achieved in promoting international tourism, 
with 
a considerable increase in income from the tourism industry. At 
the year's end, the state's foreign currency cash holdings 
amounted to $21.2 billion, up 9 percent as compared with the 
beginning of the year. 
  Domestic markets were thriving and brisk. Total retail sales 
volume in 1993 amounted to 1,223.7 billion yuan, up 26.1 percent 
from the previous year, or 11.6 percent with inflation taken 
into account. There was an ample supply of consumer goods with 
a great variety of designs. Of more than 90 percent of 
commodities, either the supply and demand were balanced, or 
supply was greater than demand. More capital goods were in 
circulation. The capital goods sold by supply and marketing 
enterprises at and above the county level in 1993 totalled 779.6 
billion yuan in value, a 32.3 percent increase over 1992. The 
retail sales of agricultural capital goods amounted to 135.6 
billion yuan, showing an actual decrease of 7.8 percent with 
inflation taken into account. 
  Scientific and technological, educational, and social 
undertakings developed vigorously. New achievements were made 
in key state scientific and technological projects. In 1993, a 
total of 33,000 major scientific and technological achievements 
were scored at the provincial and ministerial level, of which 
781 won national awards. The technology market developed 
soundly, with annual transactions totalling 20.76 billion yuan. 
Further development was made in education, and basic education 
was strengthened. Of primary school-age children, 97.7 percent 
are attending schools. New development was made in secondary 
vocational education. New achievements were also made in 
culture, press, publication, radio and television broadcasting, 
cinema, public health, and sports. 
  New progress was made in family planning. The natural 
population growth rate was 11.45 per thousand, 2.43 per thousand 
lower than the planned target. New success was made in 
controlling environmental pollution. The people's lives were 
continually improving, with a continued overall increase in 
residents' income. During the year, per-capita income of urban 
residents that could be used in living expenses averaged 2,337 
yuan, up 10.2 percent over the previous year after taking 
inflation into account. Rural residents received a net 
per-capita income of 921 yuan, up 3.2 percent over 1992 with 
inflation taken into account. The savings accounts of urban and 
rural residents totaled 1,476.4 billion yuan in 1993, an 
increase of 27.9 percent or 321.9 billion yuan over the end of 
1992. Stocks, bonds, and debentures in the hands of the 
residents increased sharply. 
  Urban employment increased by 7.05 million, and the urban 
unemployment rate at the year's end was 2.6 percent. Housing 
conditions continued to improve in both urban and rural areas. 
New housing built during the year totalled 836 million square 
meters in floor space, with 266 million square meters in urban 
areas and 570 million square meters in rural areas. 
  In 1993, the general index of retail prices rose 13 percent 
over 1992. The price index of the residents' living expenses 
increased by 14.7 percent. In 35 large and medium cities, the 
price index of the living expenses of industrial workers and 
staff members increased by 19.6 percent. 

<H3>    2. The Major Goal and Tasks of the National Economic 
and Social Development in 1994 </H3>
  In drafting, adopting, and implementing the 1994 plan for 
national economic and social development, we must use Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line as our guide and 
implement in an all- around way, the guidelines of the 14th 
National Party Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee to accelerate the pace of building a 
socialist market economic structure, open China wider to the 
outside world, strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation 
and control, vigorously adjust the economic structure, promote 
technological progress, actively open new markets, increase 
economic efficiency, control inflation, and maintain sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. 
  In accordance with the state's general work arrangement and 
guidelines for economic work, the major macroeconomic regulation 
and control targets for the national economic and social 
development in 1994 are: Gross national product is to increase 
9 percent over the previous year. Total investment in fixed 
assets is expected to reach 1,300 billion yuan. The deficit for 
1994 is expected to reach 66.9 billion yuan. Counting the 
principal and interest of internal and external debts and 
external loans for key projects due to be paid back in 1994, 
total internal and external debts for this year will amount to 
129.2 billion yuan. Banks will grant 470 billion yuan in new 
loans. Total retail sales are expected to reach 1,600 billion 
yuan in value. Imports and exports are expected to reach $200 
billion in value. The increase in the general level of retail 
prices will be controlled at under 10 percent. Economic 
efficiency will be improved. The marketing rate of products 
manufactured by enterprises, the rate of profits and tax 
generated from used capital, labor productivity, the turnover 
rate and (words indistinct) of circulating funds shall all be 
increased. The natural population growth rate is to be 
controlled at about 1.3 percent for the year. 
  The tasks for national economic and social development in 
1994 are: 
  -- Persistently attaching prime importance to agriculture 
and 
developing the rural economy in an all-around way. Continuous 
efforts will be made to strengthen agriculture as the foundation 
of the economy, invigorate the rural economy, and increase 
peasants' income. Every possible means will be employed to win 
a good harvest in agriculture and ensure stable and increased 
output of grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, and other major 
agricultural products. We plan to produce 450 billion kilograms 
of grain, 4.85 million tonnes of cotton, and 17.65 million 
tonnes of oil bearing crops during 1994. 
  -- Vigorously readjusting the structure, improving 
management 
and operation, raising efficiency, and running large and medium 
state- owned enterprises well. In 1994, industries must truly 
focus on optimizing structure, improving efficiency, and 
maintaining an effective growth rate through deepening of 
reform, opening new markets, strengthening management, and 
accelerating technological progress. 
  -- Maintaining a reasonable amount of investment in fixed 
assets and vigorously optimizing the investment structure: In 
view of the fact that the current volume of investment in fixed 
assets and the size of construction projects are already large, 
it is necessary to strictly control excessively high investment 
growth this year, and to focus our work on optimizing the 
investment structure and improving economic investment returns. 
Available construction resources will be allocated first to 
projects that have been completed and are ready to be put into 
production, to continuation projects, and essential new key 
projects incorporated in the Eighth Five-Year Plan. Efforts 
will be concentrated particularly on a number of major projects 
which have a bearing on the overall situation, including the 
Huai He and Tai Lu harnessing project, the Xiaolangdi key water 
conservancy project on the Huang He, and other water conservancy 
projects; the Beijing-Jiulong and Lanzhou-Xinjiang railways; 
harbor construction at such key ports as Qinhuangdao, Dalian, 
and Shanghai; the Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin, 
Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou, and Xining-Lanzhou-Urumqi optical cable 
trunks; major projects in the eastern region; large coal bases 
in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi; and large hydroelectric 
and thermal power stations. Efforts will be stepped up to 
complete automobile projects selected by the state; the Wuxi 
micro electronics project; and special projects on applied 
satellites. Preparations will be made for the early stage of the 
Three Gorges Project, with construction started on both banks at 
the same time. Construction of transportation projects leading 
to places outside the country and (?words indistinct) will be 
put into full swing. Land requisition and migration in the dam 
area will be completed. Preparations will continue for the early 
stages of Phase Three of the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex and 
other key projects. Investment in processing industries that 
have surplus production capacities will be strictly controlled. 
  -- Opening wider to the outside world and actively and 
effectively using foreign capital, resources, technologies, and 
markets. Efforts will continue to operate special economic 
zones, the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, open coastal cities and 
areas, and economic and technological development zones in an 
efficient way; and to open up more central cities in border 
regions, along the Chang Jiang river, and in the interior. 
  -- Earnestly shifting economic construction onto the path 
that relies on scientific and technological progress, and 
further developing educational undertakings. We will continue 
to implement the guiding ideology of taking science and 
technology as the primary productive force. We will continue to 
implement the state's intermediate- and long-term science and 
technology development programs. This year's science and 
technology work will focus on the following: 1) Vigorously 
promoting advances in industrial technologies; 2) continuously 
promoting key scientific and technological research that has a 
major impact on economic and social development, and applying 
major scientific and technological achievements in industries; 
3) strengthening the building of scientific research facilities 
and a contingent of scientific and technological personnel; and 
4) helping enterprises become a mainstay in technological 
development. Further steps will be taken to bring market forces 
into play to promote integration of science and technology, and 
the economy. Education will continue to occupy a strategic 
position for development on a priority basis. Earnest efforts 
will be made to implement the program for China's education 
reform and development. 
  -- Continuing to improve the people's living standards and 
develop various social undertakings. While developing the 
economy and upgrading labor productivity, we will continue to 
upgrade the people's living standards. An important task for 
this year's economic work is to strive to increase peasants' 
income. We will further strengthen socialist spiritual 
civilization as well as actively develop cultural, press, 
publishing, broadcasting, film and television, healthcare, and 
sports sectors. We will continue to earnestly and effectively 
tackle family planning by stressing work in rural areas and the 
mobile population, and strive to control the natural population 
growth rate within macroeconomic control targets. We should 
further strengthen environmental protection, effectively control 
pollution, implement strong measures for afforestation, and 
improve the ecological environment. We will protect and 
rationally utilize natural resources such as land, minerals, 
forests, and water. This year, the state will also draw up an 
outline for the development of national social undertakings. 
<H3>  3. Strengthen and Improve Macroeconomic Regulation and 
Control; Comprehensively Accomplish the 1994 Plan for National 
Economic and Social Development </H3>
  In accordance with the demand for establishing the socialist 
market economic system, deepening various major reforms, and 
maintaining a good momentum for sustained economic development, 
we will further strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation 
and control. The basic starting point of macroeconomic 
regulation and control is to maintain mutual coordination and 
integration among reform, development, and stability. 
Development is the last word. To develop we must have new 
ideas. It is crucial to place the emphasis on optimizing the 
economic structure, quickening technological progress, 
strengthening operations and management, and upgrading economic 
efficiency. The main task in macroeconomic regulation and 
control is to maintain an overall balance of total supply and 
total demand in society. Currently, to maintain the overall 
balance of total supply and total demand, it is necessary to 
effectively increase supply by ways and means while controlling 
the excessive growth of total demand. Macroeconomic regulation 
and control should be aimed at controlling the increase margin 
of overall price level. This year, while giving full 
consideration to the enduring capability of state enterprises 
and the people, we will appropriately adjust prices of energy, 
grain, and cotton. While promoting price reform, we must 
control the increase margin of overall price level within 
macroeconomic targets, as determined in the plan. The 
macroeconomic regulation and control system needs to be 
continually perfected with deepened reform. Effective 
implementation of this year's economic plan is significant to 
quickening the task of establishing the socialist market 
economic system; keeping a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy; and promoting comprehensive 
social progress.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- The following major 
macroeconomic regulation and control targets for the national 
economic and social development in 1994 are excerpted from the 
"Report on the Implementation of the 1993 National Economic and 
Social Development Plan and the Draft 1994 National Economic and 
Social Development Plan," submitted by Chen Jinhua, minister in 
charge of the State Planning Commission, to the Second Session

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, China's top 
lawmaker, today urged Sichuan Province to speed up its economic 
growth by further expanding agriculture and making full use of 
its industrial strength. 
  Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress, praised Sichuan, the most populous province 
in China, for making impressive economic achievements in recent 
years. 
  "I'm sure Sichuan will achieve greater economic development 
in future," he said in a group discussion about premier Li 
Peng's government work report with NPC deputies from the 
province. 
  He said that with weapons factories, steel plants and a 
railway network built in the early 1960s, Sichuan, including its 
leading manufacturing center of Chongqing, has a sound 
industrial base. 
  Therefore, Sichuan will be able to continue to expand its 
economy on that base, said Qiao. 
  Sichuan should accelerate the development of township 
factories and a diversified economy suited for hilly areas to 
spur the growth of its rural economy, he said. 
  Land-locked Sichuan Province, Qiao told the deputies, has 
its 
own advantages for attracting overseas investors, such as its 
rich natural resources, cheap land and labor, and low prices.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- China's top lawmaker 
Qiao shi said China is faced with a favorable international and 
domestic situation, which is conducive to its economic growth. 
  "China today faces an excellent situation rarely seen in its 
modern history," he said in a group discussion about premier Li 
Peng's government work report. 
  Qiao, who is chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), said that internationally, 
China maintains good relations with surrounding countries 
including members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
and is steadily improving its relations with Western countries. 
  All new reform measures taken since the beginning of this 
year are correct, and new problems that have cropped up in the 
course of implementing these measures can be solved one by one, 
he told NPC deputies from coastal Zhejiang Province. 
  Qiao, who is also a Standing Committee member of the 
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee, also spoke on such issues as agriculture, 
establishment of a modern enterprise system for state-owned 
enterprises, reform of taxation and financial systems, 
transformation of government functions, and the fight against 
corruption. 
  On agricultural development, he said, "throughout the 1990s 
and the next century, we must always give top priority to 
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy." 
  Qiao stressed the need to take "effective and feasible" 
measures to help farmers develop both the range and quality of 
production. 
  Development of the rural economy is not isolated, he said, 
but must be combined with reform measures that aim to establish 
a socialist market economy. 
  The Chinese Government has decided to help 80 million people 
shed poverty by the end of this century, he said, adding that 
attainment of the goal requires concerted efforts by both 
central and local governments. 
  Qiao Shi also visited NPC deputies from Anhui and Hubei 
Provinces.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016) and Ding </F>
Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Joining deputies of the 
Zhejiang delegation in deliberating the government work report 
today, Qiao Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC], pointed out: 
As far as the current situation is concerned, China is in the 
best period of its modern history. China's domestic situation 
is very good. In particular, a good situation of political and 
social stability and sustained economic development has emerged 
since the publication of the remarks made by Comrade Xiaoping 
during his inspection of the south in 1992. The international 
situation is also conducive to China's socialist construction. 
We should seize the opportunities and work hard together to 
develop the economy. 
  Qiao Shi is a deputy of the Zhejiang delegation. At 0900 
[0100 GMT] today, Chairman Qiao Shi arrived at the Labor 
Building, where the Zhejiang delegation is staying, to 
participate in the joint discussions of the delegation's second 
and fourth groups. At the discussion meeting, while focusing on 
the government work report, deputies Shen Zulun, Zhang Qimei, 
Peng Guozhen, Ding Bingyan, Sun Yongsen, Xu Cangen, and Liu 
Minchun, delivered speeches in connection with the struggle 
against corruption; the agricultural issue; economic reform; the 
relationship among reform, development, and stability; 
invigorating the state-owned large and medium enterprises; and 
the development of town and village enterprises. A lively 
atmosphere prevailed at the meeting. Many deputies from 
basic-level units vied with one another to express their 
opinions. 
  While the deputies were delivering their speeches, Chairman 
Qiao Shi listened very carefully. Occasionally he interposed. 
He said: "Because of my participation in this discussion 
meeting, your speeches are fairly blunt and come straight to the 
point. This is good." When Deputy Lei Wenxian, head of the 
Jingning She Autonomous County -- the sole She autonomous county 
in the country -- spoke on how to accelerate the pace of helping 
poor areas to free themselves from poverty and become well-off, 
Qiao Shi interposed, saying: It is our resolute objective to 
free the remaining 80 million people of China who are still poor 
from poverty and to become well-off by the end of this century. 
To realize this objective, we must have resolve, and adopt 
resolute and effective measures. He said: China is a huge 
country, where development is uneven. There are 
poverty-stricken areas not only in the western but also in 
eastern part of the country. The party and government have 
always attached importance to this question, but it is not 
possible for the state to take over the entire work of helping 
poor areas. However, it is necessary to adopt appropriate 
preferential policies to help poor areas. The coastal regions 
in the east, which are relatively more developed, should work 
vigorously to solve their own problem of helping poor areas 
become well-off, but they should also do their best to assist 
western regions. 
  When the deputies finished speaking, Chairman Qiao Shi 
expressed his opinions in connection with agriculture and 
reform. He said: When we say it is necessary to push the 
economy forward, we must first advance agricultural development. 
Agriculture was the foundation of our national economy; it is 
and will remain the foundation. If the foundation is not 
strong, it is not possible to develop the entire national 
economy successfully. Qiao Shi said: Our reform began in the 
countryside; it began with the all-around contract system. It 
was on this basis that surplus labor in the countryside could be 
diverted to developing town and village enterprises. China's 
development is out of the question without the changes that have 
taken place in rural areas. Therefore, at no time should we 
forget or relax our efforts in agriculture. 
  Qiao Shi said: In attaching importance to and developing 
agriculture -- the foundation of the national economy -- we must 
not indulge in empty talk. We must have down-to-earth measures. 
To permanently preserve the enthusiasm of the peasants, we must 
not be satisfied with our development level of the past. We 
should continue to develop agriculture in depth and in breadth, 
develop diversified undertakings in all sectors of the rural 
economy, and develop farming operations on a massive scale that 
stress high yields, high quality, and high efficiency. At the 
same time, town and village enterprises should continue to 
upgrade the quality of their products. Qiao Shi stressed: 
Secondary and tertiary industries have expanded rapidly in 
recent years, but their growth has been closely related with 
agriculture. We must not assume that there are no more 
agricultural problems because we have reaped bumper harvests for 
many consecutive years and because the vegetable supply has not 
posed any big problem. We should always closely link secondary 
and tertiary industries with agriculture. Only thus can we 
build socialism with Chinese characteristics better. 
  Concerning reform of the economic structure, Qiao Shi said: 
Reform is an unprecedented undertaking. The process of reform 
is one in which explorations are made, and it is not at all 
strange that some problems will be encountered. Of course, we 
should constantly sum up our experiences and strive for gradual 
improvement. We should undertake reform after drawing up a 
comprehensive plan and making all-around considerations. Of 
course this is good, but in practice this is not possible and 
does not conform to the law governing the process of knowing 
things. He urged the deputies to make proposals and offer their 
opinions to help the central authorities make policy decisions 
in a more scientific way, to constantly improve reform measures, 
and to ensure the smooth progress of reform. Qiao Shi said: 
Reform will inevitably result in the readjustment of the 
relationship among all sectors, and this requires all to 
increase their understanding of and support for the formulated 
reform measures. He said: We have the resolve and confidence 
to advance our reform to successfully build a socialist market 
economic structure at an early date. 
  In response to some deputies' suggestions that it is 
necessary to overcome formalism, Qiao Shi said: Overcoming 
bureaucratism and formalism has always been a principle of our 
party. Currently, formalism is quite serious in some areas. 
The reasons are varied. There is formalism in leading cadres, 
in localities, and in departments. Therefore, joint efforts 
from all quarters are required to overcome formalism. 
  After attending the meeting of the Zhejiang delegation, Qiao 
Shi called on some deputies of the Anhui and Hubei delegations 
at the Labor Building.

<F P=106> [News feature by ANHUI RIBAO correspondent Ding Chuanguang </F>
and station correspondent Zhan Xu: "The Chairman Is Here With 
the Anhui Deputation"; from the "Provincial Hookup" program] 
  [Text] On 12 March the conference room on level 10 of the 
Beijing Labor Building, where the Anhui deputation is staying, 
was filled with one warm round of applause after another as Qiao 
Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the National People's 
Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, entered the room in the 
company of Comrades Fu Xishou and Meng Fulin to call on Anhui 
deputies. 
  Anhui deputation head Meng Fulin introduced Qiao Shi to 
other 
responsible persons of the deputation as well as worker, 
peasant, and intellectual deputies. Qiao Shi cordially shook 
their hands, nodding to and smiling at them in greeting. 
Cameras never stopped clicking in the well-illuminated 
conference room, capturing this memorable moment on film. The 
deputies vied with one another to brief Qiao Shi on the various 
work achievements in Anhui last year. 
  Meng Fulin said: Last year saw the Anhui economy growing at 
the fastest pace and in the best manner since reform and opening 
up to the outside world. Qiao Shi asked with concern: How 
large was the share of village and town enterprises? Fu Xishou 
answered: They accounted for one third of the province's gross 
national product, turning out a total output of 36 billion yuan 
in 1991, 58 billion yuan in 1992, and 110 billion yuan in 1993. 
  Comrade Qiao Shi has all along concerned himself with 
Anhui's 
development. In 1990 and 1991, he inspected Anhui several times 
and gave work directions. Some deputies still have fresh memory 
of these. Deputy (Fang Yiben), mayor of Huaibei, said: The 
chairman called on the vast number of workers and staff members 
at the Huaibei Yanggang Coal Mine in 1991, giving them much 
inspiration. At that time the mine was still running at a loss. 
However, since coal prices were decontrolled in 1993, it has 
returned to the black. On hearing this, Qiao Shi repeatedly 
said: "Good!" He added: I talked with model and advanced 
workers at the mine. I still remember this. 
  While Meng Fulin was briefing Qiao Shi on Anhui's strategy 
of 
"one line, two points" for opening up to the outside world, a 
deputy from Wuhu chimed in, saying: Chairman, do you still 
remember the Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone? 
Qiao Shi laughed and said: I won't forget, I won't forget! 
His remarks provoked a hearty burst of laughter in the room. 
  As the clock ticked away the time, Qiao Shi finally stood up 
and said goodbye to the deputies. A woman deputy requested the 
chairman pose for a group photograph with all women deputies 
present. Qiao Shi gladly granted their wish. Soon afterwards 
he went to the lobby on the ground floor to pose for a group 
photo with all members of the Anhui deputation as well as hotel 
workers.

<F P=106> [By reporters Wang Haizheng (3769 3189 1767) and Zhang </F>
Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, member of the 
Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress [NPC], arrived at the Sichuan auditorium of the Great 
Hall of the People this morning to participate in the group 
discussion of all members of the Sichuan delegation. He said: 
Sichuan has many favorable conditions for accelerating 
development; it has great potential. I hope the cadres of 
Sichuan will make the best use of these favorable conditions, 
avoid the effects of unfavorable conditions, and make serious 
efforts to accelerate the province's economic development. 
  The morning plenary session of the Sichuan delegation was 
presided over by Yang Xizong, chairman of the Sichuan Provincial 
People's Congress Standing Committee. At the session, deputies 
continued to enthusiastically deliberate the government work 
report delivered by Premier Li Peng. Deputies Zhao Wenxin, 
Huang Yongguang, Wang Hongju, Ma Kaiming, Li Shenkuan, and Yan 
Shenggui delivered speeches, expressing their opinions on issues 
concerning rural reform and development; policies concerning the 
development of town and village enterprises in the central and 
western regions; the Three Gorges Project; support for minority 
areas and maintenance of stability in these areas; strengthening 
of construction in the old revolutionary base areas; and 
development of agriculture that stresses high yields, high 
quality, and high efficiency. 
  After carefully listening to their speeches, Chairman Qiao 
Shi voiced his opinions concerning Sichuan's development, a 
question of interest to the deputies. He said: Sichuan is a 
large province with a huge population. It has made important 
contributions to national construction since the founding of New 
China. The province has witnessed significant development in 
the past few years. Compared with the past, Sichuan's growth 
rate is still relatively fast. In the days to come, Sichuan 
should make better use of its favorable conditions and bring the 
enthusiasm of the masses into full play in order to accelerate 
economic development. 
  Qiao Shi said: It is a very difficult task for Sichuan, a 
large hinterland province with more than a 100 million people, 
to catch up with the open coastal areas in the east within a few 
years' time. However, Sichuan is very promising. It has a 
strong industrial base, especial heavy industrial base. In the 
past, when the state launched the Industrial Streamlining 
Program in Sichuan, many railways, iron and steel factories, and 
armament-producing enterprises were built here. Moreover, large 
cities like Chongqing and Chengdu have their own relatively 
sound foundation for development. It is quite promising to 
accelerate development on such a basis. Of course, Sichuan has 
many mountainous and hilly areas, but it has the Pingchuan 
Plain, similar to the plain around Chengdu, where there is great 
potential. With a rich labor force, Sichuan should make 
vigorous efforts to develop economic crops in its hilly areas in 
order to push forward its diversified undertakings and 
comprehensive agricultural development. 
  Qiao Shi pointed out: Foreign investment is beginning to 
move into inland areas and this is very beneficial to Sichuan. 
Meanwhile, Sichuan has advantages in the areas of land and 
material prices, and labor force. All these have formed a basic 
investment environment attractive to foreign investors. Such an 
environment will certainly attract more foreign capital. 
  Concerning the evacuation of residents in the Three Gorges 
area, Qiao Shi said: The task of evacuating residents in the 
Three Gorges area falls mainly on Sichuan. Resettling more than 
700,000 people through explorative evacuation is a big job. 
This process itself will offer a good opportunity for 
accelerating development. It is necessary to be good at seizing 
opportunities and transforming pressures into motive forces; it 
is necessary to fulfill the task of evacuating the Three Gorges 
residents and speed up the construction of new settlements for 
the evacuated people, to thoroughly change the state of poverty 
and backwardness. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng also participated in the 
Sichuan delegation's discussion meeting today and spoke about 
the issue of agricultural production.

<F P=106> [By station reporter Zhao Lianjin; from the "News and Press </F>
Review" program] 
  [Text] People's Liberation Army [PLA] deputies attending 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC] continued to deliberate on the government work report 
yesterday. 
  Liu Huaqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau Standing Committee and vice chairman of the Central 
Military Commission [CMC] attended a panel discussion at which 
Zhang Wannian, CMC member and chief of general staff; Yu Yongbo, 
CMC member and director of the General Political Department; and 
Fu Quanyou, CMC member and director of the General Logistics 
Department took the floor. 
  Deputy Zhang Wannian emphatically stated that, in order to 
accomplish the glorious missions of the party and the people, 
the armed forces must heighten their awareness in three 
respects: Preparedness, national defense, and fighting modern 
battles. He said: Although world tension is generally easing, 
the world is still not peaceful. While we are at peace, we must 
always be prepared for crisis. 
  Deputy Yu Yongbo stressed: We must unequivocally follow the 
correct guidance provided by the media [jian chi zheng que de yu 
lun dao xiang] and energetically promote ethical construction in 
the armed forces. We must, through deep-going and meticulous 
ideological education, heighten the armed forces' awareness of 
implementing the party's basic line and all general and specific 
policies, firmly safeguard the authority [quan wei] of the party 
Central Committee and the CPC with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the 
core, and firmly embrace and support all major reform measures 
which the state has adopted for establishing a socialist market 
economic system. 
  Deputy Fu Quanyou pointed out: We must increase the 
intensity of logistical operations reform, speed up the pace of 
reform, and achieve higher efficiency and greater logistical 
capability through reform. We must carry forward the fine 
traditions of plain living and arduous struggle, strive to 
display the five types of revolutionary spirit initiated by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit 
initiated by Chairman Jiang Zemin, and expedite the PLA's 
modernization of logistical support through reform.

(1728 4135 0193)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a plenary 
session of the Guangdong delegation today, Zhou Nan, director of 
XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, said: Having all along abided by all 
the international agreements it has signed, the Chinese 
Government will resolutely and earnestly enforce the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region [HKSAR] Basic Law; pursue the 
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people 
ruling Hong Kong"; and safeguard Hong Kong's long-term 
prosperity and stability. 
  Zhou Nan pointed out in his speech: The current dispute over 
issues on Hong Kong's consitutional system [zheng zhi 2398 0455] 
is not one on whether or not we want democracy, but on whether 
or not we should act in good faith. In a more profound sense, 
it boils down to a dispute over Hong Kong's sovereignty. In the 
final analysis, the British side's scheme is that, by using its 
administrative powers over Hong Kong in the remaining few years 
and the pretext of so-called "accelerating the democratic 
process," it will attempt to impose the leading group it forms 
onto the SAR government in an effort to continually manipulate 
Hong Kong's political affairs after 1997. The British side has 
even vainly attempted to transform Hong Kong into an independent 
or semi- independent political entity. However, it has 
forgotten the Chinese people will never give in to any foreign 
pressure on a matter of important principle concerning national 
sovereignty. 
  Zhou Nan noted: The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the 
HKSAR Preparatory Committee has been performing substantive 
work. In the future, PWC membership will be further expanded. 
We have appointed two batches of advisers on Hong Kong affairs 
and one batch of advisers on regional affairs. We will appoint 
more representatives from the Hong Kong region to be advisers on 
Hong Kong and regional affairs to hear more views and 
suggestions from the broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots; and 
to lay a broad and firm foundation for realizing the principles 
of "one country, two systems," and "Hong Kong people ruling Hong 
Kong." 
  Zhou Nan also said: The broad masses of Hong Kong government 
functionaries have made important contributions to Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability for many years. We welcome them to 
continue to be devoted to their duties after 1997 and to make 
fresh contributions to Hong Kong's future development. We also 
pay very close attention to issues concerning Hong Kong people's 
livelihood, and will try our utmost to prevent the British side 
from passing heavy financial burdens on to the future SAR 
government and broad masses of Hong Kong residents. 
  Zhou Nan also briefed participants about the "mutually 
benefitting and common prosperity-enhancing" relations between 
Hong Kong and the mainland in the fields of trade, investments, 
and finance in the past year. According to statistics, the 
value of bilateral entrepot trade between Hong Kong and the 
mainland accounted for nearly 90 percent of Hong Kong's total 
entrepot trade value. The mainland has become the largest 
market for Hong Kong's export products. In 1993, Hong Kong 
businessmen actually made use of $13 billion of their direct 
investments in the mainland, topping any other outside investors 
in China. As of the end of 1993, the number of red-chip stocks 
of Chinese companies [zhong zi hong chou gu 0022 6327 4767 4693 
5140] listed on the Hong Kong stock market was 37, previously 
the number was zero. Their market value accounted for about 10 
percent of Hong Kong's total stock market value. 
  Zhou Nan said: These facts fully show that the economies of 
Hong Kong and the mainland have integrated into a single entity, 
and the "China factor" is gradually having a greater and greater 
impact on Hong Kong's economic development. Strengthening 
cooperation with the mainland in various fields is an important 
condition for sustaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 
Most Hong Kong people have reached a common understanding that 
Hong Kong wants to closely cooperate with the mainland and 
opposes the initiation of confrontation.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- China will firmly and 
earnestly implement the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) and the principles of "one country, 
two systems" and "administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong 
people" to maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and 
stability, a Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong affairs 
said here today. 
  Zhou Nan, a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC) 
and director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, said 
the British side has damaged Sino-british agreements on Hong 
Kong and created confrontation, which shows that colonialists do 
not change their nature. 
  Joining the Guangdong delegation in a group discussion 
during 
the ongoing NPC session, he said, the essence of the dispute on 
Hong Kong's political system is whether people should act in 
good faith rather than a question of democracy. In a deeper 
sense, it is a dispute over sovereignty. 
  The British side, in the final analysis, intends to use its 
power of control over Hong Kong in the next few years to 
establish, under the pretext of accelerating democratic process, 
its own administrative organization and impose it on the special 
administrative region so that it can continue to monopolize the 
political situation in Hong Kong and even turn Hong Kong into an 
independent or semi-independent political entity. 
  He also refuted the advocation by some people of turning 
Hong 
Kong into "an international asset." 
  He said, China will resume complete exercise of sovereignty 
over Hong Kong after 1997. Though Hong Kong will adopt a 
capitalist system within China and continue to develop as an 
international financial and trade center, this does not mean 
that Hong Kong will become a so-called "international asset" or 
something like the "international concession" of old Shanghai. 
  Zhou noted, the Preliminary Work Committee (PWC) for the 
Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region faces "an arduous task and 
important duty." 
  At present, PWC has entered a stage of substantial work. It 
must unite with Hong Kong compatriots and make preparations for 
the SAR, its first government and legislature so as to live up 
to the expectations of the whole nation. 
  In future, membership of PWC will be further increased. More 
Hong Kong public figures will be appointed as advisors on Hong 
Kong affairs or on district affairs so as to solicit opinions 
and suggestions from Hong Kong compatriots and lay down a sound 
foundation for the implementation of the principles of "one 
country, two systems" and "administration of Hong Kong by Hong 
Kong people," he added. 
  He also said, most civil servants in Hong Kong have made 
important contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 
"We believe the overwhelming majority of them love the country 
and Hong Kong and support the Basic Law. We welcome them to 
continue serving Hong Kong residents after 1997 and make new 
contributions to Hong Kong's future development." 
  Zhou said that in 1993 the GDP of Hong Kong grew 5.5 percent 
over the previous year. This substantial economic development 
was attributable to increased ties and economic cooperation 
between the mainland and Hong Kong. 
  He hopes the cooperation will develop to a new stage and 
create greater benefits for both Hong Kong and the mainland this 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- China will put more 
funds into educational undertakings to realize nine-year 
compulsory education by the turn of the century, Zhu Kaixuan, 
minister in charge of the State Education Commission, said here 
today. 
  Speaking at a press conference held by the current session 
of 
the National People's Congress, Zhu said that the government has 
basically solved the problem of wage payment delays for teachers 
in most areas of the country. 
  But some localities are still owing teachers bonuses and 
subsidies, he said. 
  Zhu said that the government's budgeted spending on 
education 
undertakings will reach 81.5 billion yuan this year, including 
investment in infrastructures. 
  Zhu said that though the government education budget is much 
higher than that for 1993, it is still "a far cry from the 
actual need." 
  He said that the government needs the money to support the 
nine-year compulsory education system, which is aimed at 
enabling 85 percent of school-age children to complete nine-year 
education by the end of the century. 
  After quoting the part of Premier Li Peng's report to the 
National People's Congress (NPC), or Chinese parliament, that 
urges local governments to slash expenditures on other aspects 
and take every means to increase fund input in education 
undertakings, Zhu said that more channels of fund raising should 
be opened. 
  "The government has decreed that localities which owe 
teachers their salaries are not allowed to buy expensive cars 
and build nonproductive buildings," he said. 
  "Government-allocated fund accounts for two-thirds of 
expenditures on education, but it should not be the only source 
of funding," he said. 
  He said that, besides government allocation, China's 
education system also relies on school-run enterprises, tuition, 
donations and foundations to support its 200 million students 
and 10 million teachers. The sources provide over 16.1 billion 
yuan for the education system in 1992. 
  Asked whether an increase in tuitions will affect college 
enrollment, he said that China will keep fees for college 
students at an acceptable level. 
  Universities are now charging every student 1,000 to 1,500 
yuan as tuition and miscellaneous fees annually. The charges 
will go up in coming years. The government is offering 
scholarships, living stipends, student loans and tuition waivers 
for students. 
  "Under the socialist education system, we shall not let a 
single student drop out of school because of economic reasons," 
he said. 
  As for Chinese students studying abroad, he said that the 
government has adopted a policy of permitting people study 
abroad, allowing them to come and go freely and encouraging 
Chinese living abroad to serve the motherland in various ways. 
  "We can understand that some people want to stay in foreign 
countries for a time or apply for the status of permanent 
residents in these countries," he said. 
  He said that Chinese students studying abroad have always 
maintained close contacts with the motherland. "They can make 
contributions to their motherland's modernization drive from 
abroad," he said. 
  China has sent 210,000 students abroad for study in the past 
15 years. One-third of them, or 70,000, have returned to the 
country.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Strengthening 
agriculture as the foundation of China's economy is the keynote 
of speeches of Premier Li Peng, Chairman Qiao Shi, Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji and other leaders in group discussions with deputies 
to the National People's Congress. 
  At the ongoing NPC annual session, deputies today continued 
to discuss the government work report delivered by Premier Li 
Peng. 
  Speaking to deputies from Hebei Province, Premier Li 
expressed the hope that Hebei, a major grain and cotton producer 
in China, will pay particular attention to the expansion of a 
water-efficient farming sector, the promotion of scientific 
farming and development of a diversified economy on the basis of 
increased grain and cotton production. 
  Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, listened 
to 
several deputies from China's most populous province of Sichuan 
speaking on agricultural production. 
  He said that Sichuan has a great potential for expanding the 
farming sector, with large areas of mountainous and hilly 
region, plains and a large rural workforce. 
  He said that Sichuan should vigorously expand production of 
cash crops in hilly regions and pursue a diversified economy. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng also urged Sichuan Provincial 
authorities to readjust the province's agriculture structure on 
the basis of stabilizing grain production. 
  Speaking to deputies from Jiangxi Province, Vice-Premier Zhu 
Rongji repeatedly emphasized the importance of agriculture and 
grain production. 
  He expressed the hope that Jiangxi officials and people will 
try to step up agricultural production in a bid to promote 
economic growth and social stability. 
  Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, 
delivered a speech on agriculture to NPC deputies from Jilin 
Province, the largest commodity grain producer in China. Jilin 
harvested 15 million tons of grain in 1993. 
  According to Tian, agricultural development, rural 
prosperity 
and the rising income of farmers are essential to the success in 
deepening reforms, opening China wider to the rest of the world, 
promoting economic development and maintaining social stability. 
  He made the following proposals to expand agriculture 
production: 
  -- Taking the road of seeking high yields, and improving the 
product quality and farming efficiency; 
  -- Achieving an all-round development in farming, forestry, 
animal husbandry, sideline production and fisheries; 
  -- Vigrously expanding rural industries to increase farmers' 
incomes; and 
  -- Pushing farm products onto the market and encouraging 
farmers to become involved in commodity circulation. 
  Speaking to deputies from Inner Mongolia, Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing said that China must rely on its own efforts to feed its 
huge population. 
  "So long as we ensure a sufficient supply of grain, 
vegetables and other daily necessities and keep prices under 
control, our society will be stable," he said. 
  State Councillor Li Tieying and Wen Jiabao, an alternate 
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party 
Central Committee, also spoke of the importance of agriculture 
to deputies from Gansu Province. 
  Li Tieying, who is also the minister in charge of the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, said that agriculture 
serves as the basis for Gansu to achieve a sustained and rapid 
economic growth and narrow the gap between it and developed 
areas in eastern China. 
  Wen Jiabao, who is also a member of the secretariat of the 
party central committee, stressed the need to maintain a 
sustained increase in grain production by stabilizing the 
acreage sown to grain crops and pursuing a diversified rural 
economy. 
  Where possible, it is necessary to expand the acreage sown 
to 
cotton, plant more fruit trees and develop livestock breeding, 
he said.

<F P=106> [Report by XINHUA correspondents Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 </F>
2639) and Gao Shuhua (7559 3219 5478): "The Leaders and Rank 
and File Are of One Mind and Struggle in a Common 
Effort--Sidelights on Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's Discussion With 
Deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC)" -- XINHUA 
deadline] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 13 
March Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier 
of the State Council, went to where the Guizhou and Jiangxi 
delegations are staying. He cordially visited NPC deputies from 
the two delegations, held discussions with them, and seriously 
heard their opinions and suggestions. The NPC deputies spoke 
one after another on various subjects from seizing opportunity 
to deepening reform and opening up wider, and from accelerating 
development to maintaining stability. The deputies of the 
Guizhou delegation centered their discussions on how to 
revitalize Guizhou's economy, and jointly talked about 
achievements and satisfactory changes in Guizhou over the past 
years. 
  When the deputies expressed their hope that the party 
Central 
Committee and State Council would further support tobacco and 
wine production in Guizhou, Zhu Rongji said: "You must not 
further develop tobacco and wine production on a large scale. 
The issue you should consider now is not whether to receive 
support. You should change your concept and study how to 
maintain the existing production capacity and scale. You should 
proceed from the reality in Guizhou and take advantage of local 
resources to vigorously develop other industries." 
  Zhu Rongji added with a smile: "You all know that the number 
of Chinese smokers ranks first in the world, and no other 
country can exceed us in this respect. You cannot say it is not 
related to the large number of tobacco plants and their 
excessive output. Up until now, there was a large overstock of 
tobacco products. If we continue to vigorously develop tobacco 
and produce more cigarettes, must we even ask small children to 
smoke?" 
  "This is the tobacco issue. Now let us talk about wine." 
Zhu Rongji stated: "Guizhou's Maotai wine is the best in the 
country and is well known throughout the world. However, there 
must be a limit on wine production. The problem now is too much 
Maotai wine in too many places, and there are many fake 
products. People don't know what is the matter." He then asked 
Deputy Zou Kailiang, secretary of the party committee of the 
Maotai Winery: "Don't you think the situation is so?" 
  Deputy Zou Kailiang nodded his head and replied: "There are 
indeed too many fake Maotai products in the market. We hope 
concerned departments will take effective measures to solve this 
problem." Other deputies grinned at his words. 
  Zhu Rongji said: "Fake and shoddy products are market 
behaviors. This problem is quite serious, and we must rely on 
the efforts of all of society to solve the problem and 
strengthen people's concept of the legal system." He added: 
"You should also adopt measures to tackle the problem. For 
instance, you can improve the trademark on your wine bottle to 
prevent imitation." 
  Deputy Zou Kailiang replied: "We are doing precisely this, 
and we have undertaken research on integrating wine bottles and 
covers." 
  Zhu Rongji said: Guizhou's economy has two pillar 
industries, namely tobacco and wine. However, we must not 
produce tobacco and wine in a blind manner, and must have a new 
understanding and thinking. You should change your concept in 
tobacco and wine production. The key lies in how to strengthen 
management, raise quality, and suit the need of the market 
instead of expanding the scale of production. The bankruptcy of 
some tobacco plants in Guizhou can explain this. He added: 
"Guizhou does not lack resources like some have said. Guizhou 
has its own advantages. It has strong military industrial 
technologies and many natural resources. So long as you proceed 
from reality, adjust the production structure of the entire 
province according to market needs, attach importance to 
developing communications and transportation, and work hard in a 
solid manner, Guizhou's economic development has great hopes!" 
  His words received warm applause. Zhu Rongji smilingly said 
to the deputies: "You must all remember--the development of 
Guizhou's economy must not merely rely on tobacco and wine. We 
must not fix our eyes only on these products." 
  In holding discussions with NPC deputies from the Jiangxi 
delegation, Zhu Rongji repeatedly stressed the importance of 
agriculture and grain production. He asked cadres and masses in 
Jiangxi to strengthen agriculture and rural work as well as 
promote economic and social stability. 
  During the meeting, Zhu Rongji answered questions raised by 
the deputies. He also introduced to the deputies the current 
economic conditions at home and the situation of reform and 
opening up. Zhu Rongji successively told NPC deputies from 
Guizhou and Jiangxi: Guizhou and Jiangxi have both made great 
developments in various fields, and have achieved major progress 
and achievements in various undertakings. The party Central 
Committee and State Council have fully affirmed their progress 
and achievements. He hoped people in Guizhou and Jiangxi would 
work together with people of the entire country, unite as one, 
work with concerted efforts, continue their efforts, and further 
improve their work in a solid manner in order to promote the 
national economy. 
  Zhu Rongji encouraged comrades of the two provinces: 
Presently the situation in our country is excellent. We must 
seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, and maintain 
stability. We should correctly handle relations between reform, 
development, and stability in order to promote a sustained, 
rapid, and sound development of the national economy so as to 
further push forward the great cause of socialist modernization 
in our country.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Effectively curbing 
price hikes and stabilizing the market are the key to correctly 
handling relations between reform, economic development and 
social stability, according to Zhu Rongji, a Chinese 
vice-premier reputed to be one of China's most competent 
economic managers. 
  "Leaders at all levels must take into consideration the 
interests of the nation as a whole and firmly control the annual 
price index in the prescribed range," he said. 
  Zhu made the remarks when he joined deputies to the National 
People's Congress (NPC) from Hunan Province in a group 
discussion on premier Li Peng's government work report. Zhu 
himself is an NPC deputy from the province. 
  "Some people attribute the current price rise to reform 
measures introduced this year," Zhu said. "This is a gross 
misunderstanding." 
  The inflation, which had started two months earlier than 
their introduction, has had little to do with this year's reform 
measures, he said. 
  In the past two months, the national economy has shown 
unexpectedly good performance, the vice-premier said. He based 
his assessment on the following indicators: First, government 
revenues jumped more than 30 percent over the January-February 
period last year; second, money supply has been controlled 
effectively; third, the exchange rate between reminbi and 
foreign currencies has remained stable and the country's foreign 
exchange reserve has increased; and fourth, supplies of goods 
are sufficient. 
  "Tightened controls over the scale of capital construction 
and over consumption spending are the fundamental measure to 
keep inflation at bay," he said. 
  The central government, Zhu said, will adopt other major 
measures to control inflation. They include: To develop 
agriculture and improve the economic performance of "vegetable 
basket projects" for stabilizing the prices of grain and 
foodstuffs; to exercise strengthened management over prices; and 
to adopt soon a number of major price-control measures.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zhu 
Rongji today told China's Guizhou Province, a major producer of 
cigarettes and liquor, to desist from blindly expanding the 
production of cigarettes and liquor. 
  "Guizhou has two pillar industries, cigarettes and liquor," 
he said. "But we must have a new understanding and adopt new 
approaches on this question. Their production should not be 
blind. What counts is not large production capacity and a big 
volume of output. The important thing is to improve factory 
management and raise product quality to make what you produce 
suit market demand." 
  Guizhou Province has its own advantages such as rich natural 
resources and military technologies for its economic 
development, he said. 
  Attending a group discussion by Guizhou deputies to the 
National People's Congress now in session in the Chinese capital 
this morning, Zhu asked Guizhou to proceed from its reality, 
readjust its industrial structure according to market demand, 
speed up the construction of communications facilities and work 
in a down-to- earth manner. 
  Joining deputies of Jiangxi Province in a group discussion, 
Zhu stressed the importance of agriculture, especially grain 
production.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that it is an 
irresistible trend for economic and trade cooperation across the 
Taiwan Strait to strengthen and for their people-to-people 
contacts and exchanges to increase. 
  Any act or attempted act of secession, no matter in what 
form, will be in vain, Qian said. 
  Qian made the remarks when he joined deputies from Taiwan to 
the National People's Congress in a group discussion on Premier 
Li Peng's government work report this afternoon. 
  He expressed the hope that Taiwan authorities will go along 
with the trend and make joint efforts with the mainland to 
develop relations across the Taiwan Strait and push ahead with 
the reunification of China. 
  In the past couple of years, Qian said, thanks to joint 
endeavors of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, economic 
and trade cooperation between the two sides has developed 
rapidly and people-to-people contacts and exchanges increased 
steadily. 
  However, Qian said, there exist some problems in the 
relations between the two sides, of which the outstanding one is 
act or attempted act of secession "in varied forms." 
  It is the common aspiration of all the Chinese people to 
achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland. Any act or 
attempted act of secession, no matter in what form, will be in 
vain, since it runs counter to the fundamental interests of the 
Chinese nation, Qian reiterated. 
  As long as people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait join 
hands to develop relations, the peaceful reunification of China 
will surely be realized at an early date, Qian added.

Handle the Relations Between Reform, Development, and Stability"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability are the general 
requirements of overall importance for the whole party and 
country this year, and all other tasks must obey and serve this 
requirement. Properly handling the relations between reform, 
development, and stability is of crucial importance to 
accomplishing all tasks this year. 
  We have learned from the experiences we have gained from 
reforms and opening up during the past decade or so that reform, 
development, and stability are closely related; that nothing can 
be achieved without a stable social environment; and that 
stability can be fundamentally maintained only when we persist 
in carrying out reform, opening up to the outside world, and 
developing the economy. China's national economy has enjoyed two 
consecutive years of high growth, and our success has caught 
worldwide attention. Meanwhile, certain conditions for economic 
growth have become more stringent as a result of a "bottleneck" 
hindrance and increasing pressure from inflation during our 
economic development; and how to maintain a sustained, rapid, 
and healthy national economic growth, ensure the successful 
implementation of all reform measures, and maintain social and 
political stability have become major problems to which all 
party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, must 
attach great importance and exert themselves to resolve. 
  This year is crucial for implementing the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decision and changing 
the economic structure. Various major reform measures for 
establishing a socialist market economic structure have been 
introduced since early this year. The mission from now on is to 
make meticulous efforts in organizing their implementation. 
According to the objectives of establishing a socialist market 
economic structure, many reform measures to be carried out this 
year are preliminary in nature and we must follow the right 
direction and exert ourselves in establishing the new structure 
from the very beginning. Efforts must be made in this regard 
while reforming the financial, taxation, banking, investment, 
planning, and foreign trade systems so that a framework of the 
new structure can be set up. We must continue to implement the 
"Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations Governing the Change of 
State-Owned Industrial Enterprise Operating Mechanisms," and 
exert positive efforts in changing the state-owned enterprises' 
operating mechanisms and exploring effective ways to establish a 
modern enterprise system. We must expedite price reform in a 
timely manner and develop a consolidated, open, competitive, and 
orderly market system. The basic way to solve the outstanding 
problems and deep-seated economic problems lies in deepening 
reform. Without a deepened reform, it is unlikely we can 
expedite development and achieve stability. Leading authorities 
at all levels must rally and lead the broad masses of cadres and 
people to take a clear-cut stand in supporting reform, actively 
throw themselves into reform, and work earnestly and 
meticulously in pushing forward reform. To make sure that all 
reform projects can proceed healthily and successfully, we must 
sternly criticize and resolutely correct those who have 
disregarded the requirement of overall importance, gone their 
own ways, and acted erroneously -- such as recklessly raising 
prices -- by flaunting the banner of reform. 
  The purpose of speeding up the pace of reform toward 
establishing a socialist market economic structure is to 
liberate and develop productive forces even further. We must 
firmly focus on economic construction and concentrate our 
efforts on boosting national economic development. Under no 
circumstances should we waver in this regard. Development is 
the last word. We need new ideas and ways to achieve 
development. While setting economic development targets, we 
must make sure that mental emancipation and being pratical are 
unified, that we attach greater importance to higher quality 
when pursuing higher total output, and that we never return to 
the old path of seeking high output value and expanding 
investments unscrupulously. We must steer our economic 
construction to the track of counting on scientific and 
technological progress and improving workers' qualities; make 
great efforts to readjust structures and achieve higher returns; 
and achieve higher growth through improving management, 
upgrading technology, and improving quality. Only growth 
achieved in such a way is solid. We must continue to strengthen 
and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, 
comprehensively coordinate economic operations, and maintain a 
basic balance of economic aggregates. A sustained, rapid, and 
healthy national economic development is the foundation of 
social stability; and it can also create an economic and social 
environment favorable for the reform process. 
  To deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, and 
promote national economic and social development in all 
quarters, we must continue to consolidate political stability 
and unity and maintain social stability. The deepening of 
reform and the development of the economy certainly will give 
rise to readjustments of the patterns of interests in certain 
sectors and changes of mentality, and they will inevitably touch 
certain deep-seated contradictions and encounter many complex 
situations and issues never encountered before. We must 
correctly distinguish and handle the two different types of 
contradictions, and pay particular attention to knowing the 
development of things from small clues and checking erroneous 
ideas at the outset so that problems can be properly resolved 
when they are still in the bud. We must oppose bureaucraticism 
and subjectivism. We must go deep into the realities of life to 
investigate and study, to understand the people's mental state 
at all times, and to intensify and improve ideological and 
political work. We must establish close ties with the masses, 
care about their livelihood, and always be concerned with their 
well-being. While our reform is in line with the fundamental 
interests of the overwhelming majority of people, not everyone 
in all strata can enjoy the same interests and benefits at the 
same time during the reform process. Moreover, the levels of 
economic development are also very uneven in different areas. 
This being the case, we must pay special attention to caring 
for and assisting those who are not well off, or may even be 
quite badly off, for the time being. Upholding the principle of 
being firm in "promoting material civilization and socialist 
ethics at the same time," we must intensify building a socialist 
spiritual civilization and a democratic legal system, and 
harshly crack down on crime. We must remain sober minded and 
persist in cracking down on hostile forces' sabotage activities. 
  In short, development is our objective, reform is the 
dynamics, and stability provides the guarantee. These three are 
an organic whole. Understanding and grasping the inner ties 
among them constitute the level and art of leadership which 
leading cadres at all levels, especially senior leading cadres, 
must have. During this new year, we must, under the leadership 
of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core, firmly adhere to the guidance provided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and that provided by the party's basic line, 
comprehensively implement the guidelines laid down by the 14th 
national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and seize new and even greater 
victories in our cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Delegates to the 
current session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) 
today held discussions on Chinese Premier Li Peng's government 
work report delivered to China's top legislature yesterday. 
  Their discussions centered on the theme of "reform, 
development and stability." Close attention was also given to 
the current difficulties in economic development, as well as the 
drawbacks of the government's work in 1993. 
  During the discussions, heads of a number of local 
governments said that localities should conscientiously uphold 
the central authority and be subordinate to the economic 
macro-control of the state. 
  Chen Huanyou, governor of the economically advanced Jiangsu 
Province in east China, called the country's reforms this year 
"an uphill battle," "having risks" and "being inevitable." In 
order to ensure the smooth progress of reforms, local 
governments must "act in line with the arrangements of the 
central government, serve and abide by the need of the country 
as a whole." 
  "Localities must not go their own way beyond the central 
government's policies to pursue immediate or local interests," 
he said. 
  Xu Yan, female major of Nantong city in Jiangsu, said that 
macro-control measures that the central government adopted in 
the latter half of last year have had satisfactory effects on 
ensuring a healthy economic growth. 
  "The central government is far-sighted and appropriate in 
arranging its macro-control," she said. "Enterprises are 
enhancing their ability to adapt to these measures." 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of northeast China's Liaoning 
Provincial 
party committee, said that in order to ensure social stability 
while accelerating reform and economic growth, local governments 
have to promptly solve contradictions in the relations 
concerning interests sharing emerging from the process of 
reform. Meanwhile, they have to improve the living standards of 
the people and crackdown on crimes. 
  Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the Hubei Provincial party 
committee, also voiced concern over poor economic efficiency, 
stagnant state-owned enterprises, "bottleneck" sectors of 
transport and energy, agricultural production and social 
stability. 
  Delegates from the People's Liberation Army (PLA), who are 
divided into eight groups for discussion today, said that the 
army must carry out its tasks spelled out in Li Peng's 
government work report. 
  Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, 
said that the Army has a two-pronged strategy to safeguard 
national security and social stability. 
  Defense Minister Chi Haotian said that the Army will 
unswervingly support the country's drive to establish a 
socialist market economy and make every effort to create a 
reliable environment for reform and economic growth.

  [Text] Local delegates to China's legislature are to 
question the procuratorate over the handling of the case of Xi 
Yang, a Hong Kong reporter detained for allegedly stealing 
government financial information. 
  Concern was expressed at yesterday's meeting of the National 
People's Congress (NPC) after a faxed appeal from the Hong Kong 
Journalists' Association. The letter highlighted the lack of 
transparency surrounding the case and criticised the delay in 
the hearing. It cited China's Criminal Prosecution Law which 
stated that all criminal cases should be brought to the court 
within 1 1/2 months of the arrest. 
  Xi, a reporter for Ming Pao, was arrested by public security 
officers last September in Beijing. The authority later accused 
him of stealing state information. Officials from the judiciary 
have refused to reveal details of his case, saying it is being 
processed. 
  Outspoken lawyer Liu Yiu-chu queried why Xi had been barred 
from meeting relatives, colleagues and even his lawyer. "He 
should be punished through an open trial," she said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zou 
Jiahua has urged local governments to adopt measures to reduce 
losses and increase gains in all state owned enterprises. 
  In a telephone conference Thursday [10 March], Zou said that 
despite the successes last year, many state enterprises still 
suffered losses. 
  He said that the situation hindered the enterprises from 
development and indented local revenue. 
  He said that this situation has adversely affected the 
living 
standards of employees and social stability. 
  He called on government ministries, departments and 
localities to formulate plans and objectives for better 
performances. 
  He said that the focus should be on the coal, oil, textiles 
and light industries, especially enterprises suffering from 
losses amounting to over 40 percent and regions that lose more 
than 1 billion yuan. 
  The vice-premier said that the enterprises should adjust the 
structure of their products and develop new ones according to 
market demand. 
  He said that banks should issue loans to enterprises that 
are 
able to make up for losses.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- State enterprises in 
China are confronted with both challenges and opportunities 
during the process of establishment of a socialist market 
economy, according to members of the Eighth National Committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
(CPPCC). 
  Generally, it is promising to revitalize state enterprises, 
CPPCC members said at a press conference here today. 
  "Large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have made 
important contributions to the state in the past decades and 
served as the main pillars in the national economy. During the 
current reform, they have remarkable advantages, too, such as 
advanced equipment, strong technical force and rich experience, 
and state policy support," said Wan Guoquan, vice chairman of 
the Central Committee of the China Democratic National 
Construction Association. 
  At the press conference held by the news center of the 
current session of the CPPCC National Committee, Wan said that 
the central government's reform measures have provided favorable 
conditions for the revitalization of the state enterprises. 
  Li Gang, adviser to the China National Automotive Industry 
Corporation, said though one-third of state enterprises are 
losing money, the state coffers derive 67 percent of the 
revenues from the state enterprises. 
  Professor Wang Yu, a well known economist, said that poor 
performance of state enterprises are attributed to many factors. 
Their burdens of debts, pension, medical care and various levies 
swallow a considerable part of the enterprises' income. But, 
the fundamental reasons are drawbacks in the management and 
operational system. 
  He said that the central government has set clear target and 
formulated concrete measures to restructure state enterprises. 
The planned modern enterprise system will clearly define the 
property rights and responsibilities of enterprises, separate 
the functions of the government from those of enterprises, and 
put enterprise management on a scientific track. 
  In the process of building a modern enterprise system, 
"state 
enterprises will play a role as the major impetus for growth of 
the national economy," he said. 
  Asked about the consequences of resumption of China's status 
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Zhang Jusheng, 
chairman of the Heifei Meiling Company, said the resumption of 
China's status in GATT will promote China's economic development 
as well as producing impact on its national industry. He 
believes his refrigerator company is competitive in the world. 
  Wan Guoquan said that state enterprise cannot live on 
government "blood transfusion" loans forever. 
  "If an enterprise keeps losing money for a long time, the 
government will have to leave it and let it go bankrupt," he 
said. 
  Asked whether the contradictions between enterprises and 
workers will become serious when more companies go bankrupt, Wan 
answered the Chinese Government and enterprises have always made 
their best to guarantee the livelihood of workers and the 
workers are also cooperative with the government and enterprises. 
  He said the difficulty will be temporary. The state will 
continuously provide preferential policies to enterprises so as 
to ensure the livelihood of workers during the transition period.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China should protect 
its cultural legacy, particularly cultural relics, when it 
pushes ahead with its modernization program. 
  This call for the protection of relics was made by many 
members of the national committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at its current session. 
  Bi Keguan, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of 
Arts, said that it is a common understanding of Chinese at home 
and abroad not to destroy, over one morning, cultural legacies 
left over by their ancestors. 
  Referring to the Three Gorges Dam Project in particular, Bi 
said the government should adopt proper policies and put in 
enough funds to rescue cultural relics in the area before a huge 
reservoir begins to emerge behind the dam. 
  He cited for protection such cultural sites in the area as 
an 
ape-man fossils site, stone-age ruins and residential buildings 
of the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368-1911). 
  He urged relevant departments to try every means to detect 
relics still buried underground. 
  Relevant departments should also seek financial aids from 
Chinese people at home and abroad and from the international 
community. 
  Jin Shangyi, professor of the Central Academy of Fine Arts 
and a noted oil painter, pointed out that the smuggling of 
antiquities is running rampant on the mainland and so is ancient 
tomb robbery. In some areas, he added, people even used 
explosives in tomb robbery and some workers charged with legacy 
protection even took part in such criminal activities. 
  He called on all social sectors to make joint efforts to 
curb 
such evils which, on the part of some people, result from 
poverty, ignorance and lack of scientific knowledge. 
  Jin suggested the building of a national art museum as a way 
to protect cultural relics. 
  Bi Keguan said, however, that at present museums on the 
mainland are afflicted with fund shortages. For instance, due 
to a lack of money, he said, the China Arts and Crafts Gallery 
which cost 200 million yuan to build was leased to a foreign 
company after two years of operation. 
  Wu Guanzhong, a noted painter, said that in recent years 
some 
areas paid no attention to the protection of relics, but spent 
huge sums of money constructing replicas of ancient buildings. 
  "We should draw on the successful experience of foreign 
countries in building museums and protecting cultural legacy," 
Wu said.

  [By reporters Luo Guojun (7482 0948 7846) and Liu Siyang 
(0491 1835 2254]) 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- The information center of 
the Second Session of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, at a press 
conference it sponsored at the International Hotel today, 
invited six CPPCC National Committee members to answer questions 
raised by Chinese and foreign reporters about the establishment 
of a modern enterprise system and streamlining large and medium 
state enterprises. 
  These six members were Wan Guoquan, executive vice chairman 
of the China Democratic League Central Committee and member of 
its standing committee; Li Gang, vice chairman of the Economic 
Affairs Committee and member of the Standing Committee of the 
CPPCC National Committee; Wang Jue, professor of the economics 
department of the Central Party School; Zhang Jusheng, chairman 
of the Hefei Meiling Corp. Ltd., (Group); Yan Ruifan, president 
of the China Guanglian Industrial Corp. Ltd.; and Zhao Changbai, 
vice chairman of the board of directors of the Shoudou Iron and 
Steel Company. 
  A ZHONGGUO ZHENGQUAN BAO [China Securities] reporter asked: 
Some people hold that the stock system is the way to improve 
large and medium state enterprises, and that listed companies 
are modern enterprises. What is your comment? 
  Li Gang said: Shortage of capital is one problem facing 
large and medium state enterprises. So these enterprises can 
obtain the capital they need through the sale of stocks. 
Fundamentally speaking, however, these enterprises should 
become modern enterprises through restructuring and replacing 
their operating mechanisms. 
  Answering a question raised by a REUTER reporter on his 
observations about the revitalization of large and medium 
enterprises, Wan Guoquan said: The key to revitalizing large 
and medium enterprises lies in clearly defining property rights 
and responsibilities, separating government from enterprises, 
and managing these enterprises scientifically. The replacement 
of operating mechanisms will cause some enterprises certain 
difficulties, but there should not be any sharp contradictions 
among government, enterprises, and workers because their 
interests are fundamentally the same. If everybody strives to 
surmount difficulties with concerted efforts, certain problems 
can be resolved. He stressed that large and medium state 
enterprises were, are, and will remain the mainstays dominating 
national economic development. 
  A reporter from XIN MIN WAN PAO [New Nation's Evening News] 
asked: "How are workers' unemployment problems being solved 
since the Bankruptcy Law was implemented?" 
  Wang Jue said: The government has adopted measures to deal 
with this problem, such as promoting the development of tertiary 
industry and speeding up the construction of medium and small 
cities. As reforms deepen step by step, there will be more and 
more job opportunities for unemployed workers, and avenues of 
employment will be broader and broader. 
  Zhang Jesheng, Yan Ruifan, and Zhao Changbai also answered 
reporters' questions on the competitiveness of large and medium 
state enterprises after China becomes a GATT member, how 
state-owned foreign trade enterprises revitalize their 
operations, and how large and medium enterprises manage their 
businesses autonomously and accumulate capital.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Members of the Eighth 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) called for handling well 
relations between reform, development and stability during their 
group discussions here today. 
  Yang Jiwan, a consultant for the Ministry of Finance, said 
that the government has to bring scale of investment under 
control so as not to fuel inflation. "It is very important to 
keep prices from rising too fast at present," Yang said. 
  Wu Jinglian, a well-known economist, said that in the past 
two months, the series of reforms that China adopted this year 
have been carried out smoothly. But he said that the reform 
measures for taxation, financial and foreign exchange systems 
have yet to be perfected. 
  Gan Peigen, vice-director of the Financial Research 
Institute 
under the central bank -- People's Bank of China, said that at 
the present stage of transforming economic structure, China 
should properly regulate the economic growth rate and avoid 
major fluctuations in economy. 
  CPPCC members from Hong Kong said they hoped that the 
government will continue to increase investment in education and 
make great efforts to improve educational undertakings, because 
education is a key factor that bears profound influence on the 
growth of the national economy. 
  Rui Xingwen said that training courses for enterprise 
managers and legal persons should be held to teach them modern 
management skills. He said that a multi-tier social security 
system should be set up to take over the social insurance and 
welfare burdens from state-owned enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong deputies to 
the National People's Congress (NPC) appealed for protection of 
rights and interests of workers in overseas-funded enterprises 
at a meeting here today. 
  With a growing number of overseas-funded enterprises in 
China, disputes between labor and capital have increased and 
infringement upon workers' rights and interests has also become 
a severe issue, Hong Kong deputies said at a group discussion of 
the Guangdong provincial delegation at the ongoing NPC session. 
  Cheng Yiu Tong, chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions 
of 
Hong Kong and an advisor on Hong Kong Affairs, made an 
investigation in labor-capital disputes before he came to attend 
the NPC session in Beijing. He said, infringement upon workers' 
rights and interests by overseas-funded enterprises includes 
withholding workers' wages, extending work hours, insufficient 
facilities for safety production, lack of labor contracts, harsh 
factory rules and regulations, arbitrarily encroaching on 
personal rights and depriving workers of the right to organize 
trade unions. 
  After listing a number of facts and figures, he summed up 
that 70 percent of the disputes belong to the violation of 
economic contracts by the capital side and infringement on 
workers' rights; 20 percent are cases that the capital side 
encroaches on democratic and personal rights of workers; and 
only 10 percent cases belong to unreasonable demands by workers. 
  Hong Kong deputies raised suggestions on protection of 
workers' interests and rights with reference to relevant 
regulations of Hong Kong and in accordance with domestic reality. 
  It is necessary to strengthen supervision and strictly abide 
by law in handling the disputes, they said. 
  They suggested that workers have the right to ask for 
liquidation of enterprises which withhold workers' wages for 
more than one month; those that extend work time arbitrarily, 
violate industrial safety regulations and endanger workers' 
health shall be punished; those that refuse to sign labor 
contracts or allow workers to organize trade unions shall be 
ordered to stop operation until they accept the demand. 
  They also suggested that the labor law being drafted shall 
protect rights and interests of workers in all types of firms -- 
state-owned, collective, overseas-funded or private enterprises 
-- just the same.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China's 
129-billion-yuan budgeted debts for 1994 will not hobble 
economic growth, said K. C. Mun, an economics professor of the 
Chinese University of Hong Kong, who is here attending a session 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
(CPPCC). 
  According to Chinese Government's 1994 draft budget, the 
country's internal and external debts will total 129.245 billion 
yuan, 39.361 billion yuan bigger than the previous year's. 
  Mun did not regard that as a serious problem, saying that 
the 
debts will account for only 3.8 percent of the gross national 
product (GNP) and that the ratio of debts to GNP is far lower 
than that for Western economies. 
  "The debts are within a safe margin," said Mun, noting that 
China's current economic growth rate will enable the country to 
repay the principal and interest. 
  From this year on, the government begins to make up its 
deficit by issuing treasury bonds instead of overdrawing on the 
banks. This is the main reason for the rise of debts, Mun said. 
  He said that the change will greatly strengthen the role of 
the central bank in regulating and stabilizing banking business, 
and in accelerating the establishment of a full-fledged bond 
market. 
  He suggested that China issue bonds overseas to draw foreign 
funds to the domestic market. 
  A real danger for China's economy, he said, is runaway 
investment in fixed assets by local governments. 
  "Today, what is urgently needed is concerted efforts by the 
central and local governments to exercise macro-controls, 
especially on unbudgeted fixed assets investment," he said.

  [Text] British firms bidding for lucrative contracts in 
Shanghai might suffer in the face of the Sino-British row over 
Hong Kong's political reform, a vice-mayor of the metropolis, 
Zhao Qizheng, warned yesterday. Separately, a senior official 
in charge of Hong Kong affairs, Chen Ziming, also warned 
Britain's long-term interests in China would be undermined if 
the political dispute remained unresolved. 
  Mr. Zhao launched a fierce attack on the British Government 
at a group discussion among Shanghai delegates to the National 
People's Congress on the Government Work Report yesterday. "The 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament has said 
they hope the dispute will not affect trade. This appears to be 
correct, but wrong in actuality," Mr. Zhao said. "If the door 
of politics is closed, the door of economics will be closed, or 
at least half- closed." 
  He said the German and Japanese governments had made 
positive 
moves to strengthen relations with China over various areas 
including trade and investment. "What has the British 
Government done? It is pulling the legs of the UK firms 
instead....Many British enterprises do not agree with the policy 
of their Government to seek confrontation with China," he said. 
  Mr. Zhao urged Britain to make early moves to seek 
conciliation with China. He said foreign partners for many 
major projects in the booming city would have to be decided this 
year. These included infrastructure and other investments. 
"The chance is there. We can't hold up the projects for the 
improvement of relations (between the two countries). It's 
impossible for us to do business on one hand and engage in 
quarrels on the other," Mr. Zhao said. 
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong delegates to the National People's 
Congress (NPC) are one step closer to moving a resolution 
denouncing the three-tier government set up under British rule. 
The resolution, initiated by unionist Cheng Yiu-tong, was 
discussed at great length at a meeting of the congress yesterday. 
  Only three of the Hong Kong and Macao delegates at the 
meeting had reservations about the statement, whose message they 
said had already been carried in remarks by China's Foreign 
Ministry spokesmen and Premier Li Peng, in his Work Report to 
the NPC. Proposing the resolution, Mr. Cheng said it was 
necessary for the NPC, the most authoritative body in the 
Chinese Government structure, to support the disbanding of the 
political structure formulated by the British Government in the 
absence of a Sino-British agreement.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, a top 
leader of the Chinese Communist Party, said that development and 
stability are two major issues for Tibet-related work and that 
establishment of a socialist market economy will provide new 
opportunities for economic development in the region. 
  "We must further emancipate the mind and guide Tibet's 
economic development with new concepts and new thinking that are 
suited for a socialist market economy," he said. 
  He asked local officials to take Tibet's special conditions 
into consideration, do everything in accordance with the reality 
of Tibet, always serve the interests of Tibetan people, promote 
Tibet's development, maintain its stability and continuously 
carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. 
  "The party Central Committee and the State Council have 
always attached great importance to Tibet work, having adopted a 
series of preferential policies and flexible measures for the 
Tibet region," he said. 
  During the process of developing a socialist market economy, 
the central authorities will continue to pay great attention to 
economic development and social progress in Tibet, he said. 
  He expressed the belief that Tibet will have a bright future 
thanks to the correct leadership of the party Central Committee, 
hard struggle by the Tibetan people and support from the rest of 
China. 
  Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, 
expressed the views in a group discussion with Tibetan deputies 
to the National People's Congress now in session in the Chinese 
capital. 
  Talking about Premier Li Peng's government work report 
delivered yesterday at an NPC session, Hu said the report spells 
out the national task of seizing development opportunities, 
deepening reform, opening the country wider to the rest of the 
world, promoting economic development and maintaining social 
stability. 
  "All our work must be concentrated on fulfilling this 
central 
task," he said. "And it is imperative to promptly solve 
problems that should crop up amid continuous progress."

Haimin (0491 3189 3046): "Great changes in Tibet as seen from 
statistical figures"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- The year 1993 was 
another milestone in the history of Tibet's development. 
  When discussing the "government work report," Tibet's 
deputies to the National People's Congress [NPC] cited a series 
of figures familiarly. 
  The region's gross domestic product amounted to more than 
3.2 
billion yuan, a growth of 9.6 percent over the previous year. 
The region reaped bumper agricultural harvests for six 
consecutive years, with a record 1993 grain harvest of 620,000 
tonnes. Rural enterprises turned out more than 100 million yuan 
worth of products, up 14.9 percent over 1992. Export trade 
volume surpassed $100 million, up 55.4 percent. The per capita 
income of farmers and herdsmen was 30 yuan more than in the 
previous year...[ellipses as received] 
  These figures clearly record the track of Tibet's 
development, showing the solid steps taken in the advance toward 
modernization. 
  Some deputies said: Modern industry was nonexistent in old 
Tibet. Today, it boasts a dozen industries, ranging from 
electric power, coal, and chemicals to machinery. Its power 
generating capacity has exceeded 170,000 kw. 
  On the daily-improving infrastructure of the region, Deputy 
Gyainzim talked about the first day Medog county gained access 
to a highway, as well as the progress of highway construction in 
Tibet as a whole. According to him, a highway network now 
covers all the 74 cities, prefectures, and counties in Tibet. 
  A communications network embracing wireless, wire, air 
control, and satellite communications with Lhasa as its center 
has begun to take shape. Satellite ground stations have been 
built in most areas. International program-controlled telephone 
switches connected with the world network are now available to 
some counties and cities. As a result, it is no longer a pipe 
dream for peasants and herdsmen in out-lying areas to watch 
television. A number of airports, including the Gonggar 
International Airport and the Bangda Airport, are either under 
construction or have been completed and put into operation. 
  With the steady increase of grain output, the long history 
of 
food shortages in Tibet has come to an end. At present, the 
percentage of marketable agricultural and animal husbandry 
products has exceeded 23 percent. The clothing, food, housing, 
and transportation conditions of the more than two million 
people in Tibet have improved remarkably. Television sets, 
washing machines, stereo equipment, and other durable consumer 
goods can be found in ordinary peasant and herdsmens' homes. 
Some are even able to afford cellular phones. Urban residents 
here are as well-dressed as those in the interior and coastal 
regions. 
  Tibet's educational facilities have been built from scratch. 
There are now more than 3,000 schools of various categories in 
the region. Medical care facilities are available in all 
peasants' and herdsmen's settlements [dian 7820]. There are 30 
cultural organizations in the region. Scientists in Tibet have 
scored more than 1,000 scientific research achievements, of 
which 288 have won national or autonomous regional awards. Last 
year the region received 23,000 tourists from Hong Kong, Macao, 
Taiwan, and foreign countries, and earned $9 million in foreign 
exchange from tourism. 
  According to the deputies, reform and development have 
benefited the two million people in Tibet. 
  Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the autonomous region said: 
Tibet's progress today is completely due to the great support 
given by the party, government, and people of all nationalities 
across the country, as well as reform and opening up. It is 
also inseparable from the hard work done by the united people of 
all nationalities in Tibet. 
  The deputies said: The huge state investment and vigorous 
support provided by other parts of the country have added 
vitality to Tibet's economic development. Reform and opening up 
have enabled Tibet to free itself from a closed status, and 
become a channel for China's export goods and technology to the 
South Asia subcontinent. 
  Under the new situation in which the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure is being accelerated, Tibet 
is seeking greater development. By 1997, Tibet's gross domestic 
product and regional income are expected to reach 4.8 billion 
yuan and 3.68 billion yuan, respectively. 
  Development is the last word. Deputy Pingcuo said: "Only 
development means maximum human rights. Only when Tibet 
achieves development can its stability have a reliable 
foundation."

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Zongmin (0719 1350 2404), and Li Pei </F>
(2621 3805)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- The plane with the 
Tibetan delegation to the Second Session of the Eight National 
People's Congress [NPC] landed slowly at Beijing Xijiao Airport. 
The deputies, wearing Western-style business suits, Tibetan 
gowns, or jackets, stepped down the ramp, carrying briefcases 
with digital locks or colorful Tibetan bags. 
  As soon as he stepped down from the plane, Jian Zeng, who 
wore a business suit, told us: "Medog County can now be reached 
by car!" 
  Medog used to be the only county in Tibet not accessible by 
car. Two years ago, Jian Zeng walked nearly two weeks from his 
county to Lhasa to catch a plane to Beijing to attend the Fifth 
Session of the Seventh NPC, but because of the rugged terrains 
he missed the plane, and his belated arrival made him a figure 
in the news. For this reason, many deputies forwarded a motion 
at that session that all counties in China must be accessible by 
highways. This wish has eventually materialized. 
  Although Jian Zeng is only 39, he has served as deputy to 
two 
NPC sessions. He said: "I am particularly excited to be in 
Beijing today. People in my county asked me to deliver a 
message of thanks to the government for its concern and support. 
From now on, people in Medog have a way leading them to become 
well off." 
  The Medog highway was a regret in China's communications 
history. The state attached great importance to the highway's 
construction and invested more than 35 million yuan in building 
it in mountainous areas. The highway was eventually completed 
and opened to traffic on 1 February. During the construction, 
dozens of road builders gave up their precious lives and nearly 
100 workers have been disabled. 
  According to Jian Zeng, people in Medog cannot wait to open 
shops along the new highway. He added that people in the county 
are working on projects of setting up village and town 
enterprises, and that the local people's per capita income has 
now reached 800 yuan. 
  Bai Zen is one of the two female deputies of the Tibetan 
delegation. Speaking on changes in Tibet, she said no changes 
can be greater than the change in people's minds. Along with 
the establishment of the market economy, she said, the "roof of 
the world" has also opened its door. Even women who used to 
stay home all the time have become a main force in economic 
construction by setting up stores and restaurants and even doing 
business in coastal areas in southeast China. 
  As the principal of the No. 1 Lhasa Primary School, she said 
she is proud that boys and girls in Tibet now have the same 
opportunity to receive education. She said that half of her 
school's pupils are girls and 90 percent of the teachers are 
female. 
  Pingcuo is the only deputy representing the Moinba 
nationality -- a people with the smallest population in China. 
He said that none of his ancestors had ever thought of coming 
to Beijing to take part in state affairs discussions like he 
has. He said: Although the old Tibetan Government "Garsa" 
(parliament) also met once a year, serfs did not have any rights 
to express their views at all! Today, we and people of the 
other 55 nationalities have become the masters of our country 
and we have our own seats at the NPC where we can take part in 
state affairs discussion. 
  Pingcuo, who has put on a brand new Tibetan gown, said: 
Tibetan delegation members have carried with them the wish 
shared by the more than 2.6 million Tibetan people, namely 
working with people of all nationalities in the country to 
achieve a better life and head for prosperity together through 
developing the economy. 
  Before coming to Beijing, the Tibetan deputies had 
extensively solicited the views of people in all quarters, and 
they are ready to forward 15 proposals with regard to how to 
develop Tibet's economy and revitalize its agriculture and 
animal husbandry.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region made marked progress in economic development in 1993, 
described as a "landmark year" by deputies from the region to 
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). 
  At the ongoing session of NPC, China's top legislature, the 
deputies said that last year the region's gross domestic product 
amounted to 3.2 billion yuan, a 9.6 percent growth over the 
previous year; 
  The region reaped a record harvest of 620,000 tons of grain; 
  Rural enterprises turned out more than 100 million yuan 
worth 
of products, up 14.9 percent over 1992; 
  Exports surpassed the 100 million U.S. dollar mark, up 55.4 
percent; 
  The per capita income of farmers and herdsmen reached 515 
yuan, 30 yuan more than in the previous year. 
  Although some of the growth rates were lower than national 
averages, the achievements showed a great step forward for the 
region on the world roof, according to the deputies. 
  Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, modern 
industry was nonexistent in the region. Today, Tibet boasts a 
dozen industries and 100 product lines, ranging from electric 
power, coal, chemicals to machinery. Its power generating 
capacity alone has reached 170,000 kw. 
  The infrastructure in the region is also fast improving. 
Deputy Gyainzim from Medog, the last county in Tibet to have 
access to a highway, cited the recent completion of a highway 
leading to his county. 
  To date, a 22,000 km highway network covers the region's 74 
cities, prefectures and counties. 
  A satellite communications network has also been set up in 
the region, with satellite ground stations built in most areas 
and international program-controlled telephone switches in some 
counties and cities connected with the world network. As a 
result, herdsmen in out-lying grasslands can watch television 
and make direct-dial international telephone calls. 
  Expansion of the Gonggar Airport in Lhasa, the regional 
capital, has been completed and another airport is being built. 
  Living standards of Tibetans have improved remarkably. 
Television sets, washers, stereo equipment and other durable 
consumer goods can be found in many herdsmen's homes. Some are 
even able to afford cellular phones. 
  The region is opening wider to the outside world. Last year 
the region received 23,000 overseas tourists. 
  Rapid economic development has not only brought benefits to 
the 2.6 million residents in Tibet but also guaranteed social 
stability and unity among all nationalities in the region. 
  Yang Chuantang, vice-chairman of the regional government, 
attributed the achievements to support from the party, the 
central government and other parts of the country, to reform and 
the open policy, and to hard work by the people of Tibet. 
  In line with the national goal to establish a market 
economy, 
the region has blueprinted its own development, according to 
Yang. 
  By 1997, the region's gross domestic product will reach 4.8 
billion yuan, he said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Haimin (0491 3189 3046)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- In a group discussion 
of the government work report with delegates from Tibet, Hu 
Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the CPC Central 
Committee Secretariat, said: Only by gaining a clear 
understanding of the situation, keeping overall interests in 
mind, uniting as one, and working in a down-to-earth manner can 
we constantly push the cause of reform and construction forward. 
He firmly believed that Tibet will be better off tomorrow. 
  Having attentively listened to delegates' remarks, Hu Jintao 
noted: This year is an important year for deepening reform and 
stepping up development; we must accelerate the establishment of 
a socialist market economic structure under the condition of a 
high- speed economic growth and strive to achieve sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development while changing 
enterprise operating mechanisms. Currently, we are under a good 
situation, shouldering heavy responsibilities, facing many 
difficulties, and having a bright future. He stressed: The CPC 
Central Committee has scientifically analyzed the current 
situation, definitely set "seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability" as the overall interests of the entire party and the 
whole nation, and demanded that all kinds of work be 
subordinated to and serve the overall interests. We must gain a 
clear understanding of the situation, keep overall interests in 
mind, unite as one, and work in a down-to-earth manner. We 
should not only press forward in the face of difficulties -- 
steadfastly and constantly push the cause of reform and 
construction forward -- but also judge the hour and size up the 
situation and study and resolve contradictions and problems 
cropping up in the course of progress with a sober mind. 
  Hu Jintao said: Development and stability are two major 
issues for Tibet's work. The establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure has brought Tibet new opportunities 
for economic development; in the meantime, however, some new 
conditions and problems have surfaced too. In face of the new 
situation, we should further emancipate the mind and guide 
Tibet's economic development with new concepts and thinking that 
are suited to a socialist market economy. We should firmly keep 
Tibet's special conditions in mind, consider the reality in 
Tibet in approaching all problems and doing everything, and make 
Tibet's stability and economic development, as well as the 
pursuit of interests of various nationalities in Tibet, the 
starting point and standpoint of our work. We should 
continuously carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard 
struggle, do a solid job, and fulfill all sorts of work. 
  Hu Jintao concluded: The CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council have always attached great importance to Tibet's work 
and shown concern over people of various nationalities in Tibet. 
Since reform and open policies were launched, the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council have adopted a series of special 
policies and flexible measures for Tibet, which have favorably 
promoted economic development and social progress in Tibet and 
are well received and supported by people in Tibet. In the 
course of developing a socialist market economy, the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council will continue to pay attention 
to and show concern for Tibet as usual. We believe that with 
the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee, vigorous 
support of other fraternal provinces and regions, and the 
concerted efforts and hard struggle of various nationalities in 
Tibet, Tibet will be better off tomorrow.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- A 53-year-old deputy 
to the National People's Congress (NPC) attracts attention for 
his manner, alertness, busy schedule and unique clothing style 
in the Heilongjiang provincial delegation of NPC deputies who 
are here attending the ongoing NPC session. 
  The deputy is You Yuzhuo. Clad in a green side-buttoned coat 
with black cloud-pattern neckband, he attends meetings by day, 
and reads documents, writes suggestions or prepares speeches by 
night. 
  You is the only representative of Hezhen nationality, one of 
the smallest ethnic groups in China. 
  All the 55 minority nationalities in China have their own 
deputies to the NPC, who add up to 439 among a total of 2,980. 
  The Hui people, who scatter throughout the country and rank 
second only to Zhuang in terms of population, have 66 deputies, 
taking the first place; and 29 ethnic groups with small 
populations each have one deputy. 
  At a recent discussion on Premier Li Peng's government work 
report, you was the first to speak. He said, "the government 
work report says reform and opening up is a driving force for 
development. Changes of the Hezhen nationality in recent years 
have borne this out." 
  Hezhen has always been the smallest ethnic group in China. 
Mainly inhabiting banks of the Heilongjiang, Songhua and Usuri 
rivers in northeast China, Hezhen people used to live on 
fishing, dwelled in cellars and were clad in fish skin. 
  When New China was founded in 1949, Hezhen stood at the 
brink 
of extinction with a population of only 300. Though Hezhen 
people still engage in fisheries, modern fishing gears and motor 
boats have replaced fish forks. In addition, some Hezhens 
engage in farming and industries. Its population has jumped to 
over 4,000. 
  "The biggest change is a wider horizon for the Hezhen 
people, 
brought about by reform and the open policy," You noted. 
  "Hezhens did not know what market was in the past. Today, 
they have opened shops and hotels and even set up a 
Hezhen-cuisine restaurant in Russia," he added. 
  You was the first teacher of Hezhen nationality and now 
serves as the principal of a rural primary school. His talks 
show that he is not only familiar with his people and home town, 
but also has a good understanding of state affairs. 
  Asked how he gets all the information he needs as a deputy, 
he said he subscribes to a dozen newspapers and magazines and 
keeps watching TV news programs of both central and local TV 
stations. Moreover, the general office of the NPC Standing 
Committee and relevant departments of Heilongjiang Province and 
Tongjiang City mail him documents, draft laws and decrees and 
decisions of standing committees of people's congresses at 
various levels. 
  Since he was elected deputy to NPC last year, You have 
participated in three inspection tours. He is known for his 
"bold airing of views." 
  When the local township government withheld teachers' wages 
for four months last year, You reported the case to the city 
government, which solved the problem soon. 
  Just before coming to Beijing to attend the current NPC 
session, you solicited opinions in local villages, townships and 
Tongjiang City. He plans to put forward suggestions on 
constructing local railways and improving educational conditions 
for Hezhen people. 
  As a teacher, You regards education as the hope for his 
people. His wife, three daughters, and two sons-in-law are also 
teachers.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Xiamen City in Fujian 
Province has made thorough preparations for local legislation 
since the province's deputies to the National People's Congress 
(NPC) put forward a proposal in this regard in 1989. 
  Zhang Binsheng, vice-chairman of the provincial people's 
congress standing committee, made the remark in an interview 
with XINHUA today. 
  The current session of NPC will examine a decision on 
empowering the Xiaman Municipal People's Congress and its 
standing committee and Xiamen Municipal Government with the 
power to enact laws and regulations for enforcement in the 
Xiamen Special Economic Zone, which was established in 1980. 
  The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone bordering on Hong Kong 
was 
given the power to enact local laws in 1992. 
  Zhang said that in 1989 and 1993, respectively, 30 NPC 
deputies from Fujian Province raised a proposal to NPC on 
granting Xiamen local legislative power, which was put on the 
agenda of the NPC Standing Committee. 
  Some special economic policies are being implemented in 
special economic zones, but if no corresponding laws and 
regulations are formulated to confirm them, their authority and 
credibility will be in doubt, Zhang said. 
  Though the provincial people's congress standing committee 
has enacted a raft of economic laws and regulations for the 
start-off of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone since 1981, red 
tape and other problems have dragged legislative progress far 
behind the development of the zone. 
  As its preparations for having legislative powers, Zhang 
said, Xiamen has been formulating long-term and yearly plans for 
local legislation and conducted a great number of social surveys. 
  Xiamen has drafted eight regulations, which have been 
enacted 
by the provincial people's congress standing committee. 
  Legislative power is important to Xiamen also because it can 
serve as a pilot area for formulating laws and regulations 
governing economic, civil and legal affairs between the mainland 
and Taiwan, according to Zhang. 
  Xiamen, facing Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait, is one of 
the 
areas with the largest concentration of Taiwan investment and 
with the largest number of Taiwan visitors. As a result, 
disputes concerning economy, investment, marriage and property 
inheritance, and sea and air piracy have cropped up in recent 
years. This situation calls for urgent legislation of relevant 
laws and regulations, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Deputies from 
underdeveloped northwest China to the National People's Congress 
(NPC) expressed concern over a continuous exodus of its 
professionals to east China. 
  The deputies, who are here attending the second NPC session, 
agreed that in recent years, talent loss has adversely affected 
economic growth in their respective regions and further widened 
the development gap between China's east and west. 
  Government statistics show that every year thousands of 
professionals move out of northwest China, which covers Gansu, 
Shaanxi and Qinghai Provinces, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous 
Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. 
  For example, 10,000 scientists and technicians have left 
Qinghai province over the past six years. Moreover, the exodus 
has been increasing at an annual rate of 27 percent. 
  The deputies aired their views on how to solve the problem. 
  Zhang Wule, acting Gansu provincial governor, said, "I 
think, 
in the final analysis, market competition means competition for 
professionals and for scientific and technological progress." 
  The exodus of professionals, he said, makes it very hard for 
west China, inhabited largely by ethnic minority people, to 
develop its rich natural resources, improve the competitiveness 
of locally- produced goods and eliminate poverty. 
  Solution for the problem lies in changing the concept of 
managing professionals and reforming the personnel managerial 
system, he said. 
  According to Zhang, it is imperative to formulate policies 
that will attract professionals to stay on. 
  Mamatjan Amet, commissioner of Yili Prefecture in Xinjiang, 
said that over the past two years 6,000 intellectuals have left 
Xinjiang and many more are ready to go. 
  He said this is due primarily to a widening of the economic 
and income gaps between the country's east and west. 
  He called for government officials in west China to pay 
greater attention to the well-being of intellectuals and do 
everything within their power to let the intellectuals make the 
best use of their talent. 
  According to Song Pengsheng, deputy director of the Qinghai 
Provincial Science and Technology Commission, one reason for the 
exodus is that intellectuals are not well respected in many 
parts of northwest China and that their working and living 
conditions are poor. 
  Wang Yu, a senior engineer from Ningxia, emphasized the 
importance of taking all "possible and feasible" measures to 
encourage professionals from elsewhere to move to northwest 
China. 
  Many other deputies agreed that, to solve the problem of 
professionals leaving for east China, the state should provide 
additional policy and financial support to northwest China.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- [Passage omitted] 
<H3>  Luo Gan Happily Invites Buddhist Abbot To Sit in the Front 
Row </H3>
  Luo Gan, secretary general of the State Council and NPC 
deputy elected from Henan Province, took part in a group 
discussion of the NPC session and noticed something soon after 
sitting down. He stood and warmly spoke to Shi Haifa, abbot of 
Luoyang's Baima Temple: "Please come sit in the front row!" 
When the abbot, who is over 70 years old and wore a patchwork 
outer vestment, sat down in the front row, Li Changchun, 
secretary of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee, stated to 
clinch the point: "Comrade Luo Gan is in charge of religious 
affairs in the State Council. This is a concrete demonstration 
of how he has attached importance to religious affairs!" 
  When it was time for NPC deputies from Henan to express 
their 
views, the deputies vied with each other to speak first. Li 
Changchun held up his hand and said: "Please, let the abbot 
speak first, for people of religious circles have priority!" 
Shi Haifa then expressed his opinions on refurbishing scenic 
spots and developing tourist resources in Henan. 
<H5>  Make a "Report" to Vice Premier Li </H5>
  When Vice Premier Li Lanqing took part in a group 
discussion, 
Director Hao Yanzhong of China No. 2 Grinding Wheel Plant began 
to speak. His first sentence was: "Let me report to Vice 
Premier Li first!" 
  In the last year's NPC session, Li Lanqing had asked 
Director 
Hao: "Can your plant earn more than $10 million in foreign 
exchange in 1993?" Director Hao expressed his firm confidence 
at that time. Through hard work by staff members and workers of 
the entire plant, the plant's foreign exchange earnings 
increased from $8.25 million in 1992 to $10.86 million in 1994. 
After hearing his report, Vice Premier Li said with a smile: 
"Very well! However, you have merely accomplished your goal. 
Please work harder this year!" [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Deputies attending the 
Second Session of the 12th National People's Congress [NPC] 
continued group discussions of Premier Li Peng's "Government 
Work Report" today, expressing their in-depth views on ways to 
deal with relations among reform, development, and stability; 
and to ensure that the three will promote each other and develop 
in coordination. 
  This year is crucial to China's reform and development 
process. Many deputies explained from both theoretical and 
practical perspectives, the great significance of handling 
relations among reform, develop, and stability well. Deputies 
who are leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council took part in the discussions and deliberations of their 
respective delegations. Speaking at a meeting of the Sichuan 
delegation, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua pointed out that each 
country and region has its own laws governing economic 
development, and it is necessary to guide our work according to 
economic laws and to uncover the path to sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the economy. He noted that 
contradictions will emerge if economic development goes beyond 
the available conditions and foundation. He emphasized the need 
to control inflation to safeguard social stability. Speaking at 
the Henan delegation's group discussion, Vice Premier Li Lanqing 
also expressed deep concern about the impact of reform on 
commodity prices. He called for using laws and regulations as 
well as economic and administrative measures to carry out the 
work of controlling commodity prices within ranges tolerable to 
the masses. State Councillor Li Tieying took party in the Jilin 
delegation's discussion. He said: This year is crucial to 
reform. Reform will inevitably generate new developments and 
problems. We must follow closely, investigate and study, and 
earnestly review our experiences. Fundamentally speaking, 
reform represents the interests of the masses of people. We 
must trust and rely on the masses, and successfully guide and 
protect their reform initiatives. Comrade Ding Guangen took part 
in the Shaanxi delegation's discussion and deliberation. 
  Deputies from the People's Liberation Army delegation 
indicated: The "Government Work Report" explains the relations 
among reform, development, and stability in a way that shows our 
party and government understands more profoundly the laws 
governing socialist construction, possesses clearer ideas about 
deepening reform, and will formulate more prudent principles and 
policies. 
  Jia Qinglin, as a deputy from Fujian, said: The course of 
reform and opening up in the last decade and more shows that our 
cause advances whenever relations among reform, development, and 
stability are handled well, and tumbles or even suffers setbacks 
when relations are handled incorrectly. Properly grasping the 
"extent" of reform, development, and stability, and handling 
their relations well by using a little more dialectics, 
leadership arts, and by exercising high-standards of leadership, 
are a major task and severe test facing leaders at various 
levels in the new situation. 
  Deputies discussed how, on the basis of unified 
understanding 
and in light of reality in various regions and departments, to 
proceed from the general interests of party and state work to 
maintain a balance and mutual promotion among reform, 
development, and stability. Xie Fei, as a deputy from 
Guangdong, said: In practical work, first we must seize the 
opportunity to deepen reform, open ourselves wider to the 
outside world, and exert efforts to implement the series of 
reform measures adopted by the state well. At the same time, we 
must make full use of Guangdong's advantages to raise the level 
and increase the scope of opening. Second, we must seize the 
opportunity to develop the economy, put emphasis on developing 
high and new technology industries, and maintain a steady growth 
in agriculture. Third, we must strengthen unity, maintain 
stability, keep ourselves sober-minded, and carry out our work 
before problems occur, and promptly remove destabilizing factors. 
  Zhao Zhihao, as a deputy from Shandong, pointed out: The 
reform measures announced this year will fairly significantly 
change the interest distribution pattern in society. On top of 
this, the operation of the new structure requires a link-up and 
coordination process. As a result, the impact on the entire 
economic operation will be greater than in past years. By the 
same token, its effect and demand on social stability are more 
salient than in the past. This requires us not to set 
excessively high targets in the pace of development to avoid 
over-strained relations between various economic sectors, and 
thereby affect reform and stability. In announcing reform 
measures, we must pay close attention to timing, intensity, and 
supportability to avoid affecting the normal operation of the 
economy and creating shockwaves in society. With respect to 
social stability, we must emphasize integration between control 
in accordance with the law and education to resolve all kinds of 
contradictions and eliminate destabilizing factors. 
  Mao Zhiyong, as a deputy from Hunan, said: To correctly 
handle relations among reform, develop, and stability, we must 
grasp four key points in our work: First, we must further 
emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and use new ideas 
and measures compatible with the new situation of a socialist 
market economy to create a new phase in our work. Second, we 
must enhance our awareness of storming heavily fortified 
positions in reform and fight a successful battle to build a 
socialist market economy. Third, we must earnestly seize the 
development opportunity and promote development through improved 
economic returns. Four, we must foster both material, and 
cultural and ideological progress, attaching equal importance to 
both, and work hard to advance the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Guangdong province, the most prosperous region in 
China, has thrown its weight behind politically sensitive tax 
reforms aimed at boosting central government coffers. 
  Speaking to more than 300 reporters in Beijing last night, 
provincial Governor Zhu Senlin dismissed suggestions the tax 
changes were a move to "re-centralise" financial power delegated 
to the regions. Instead, he said the taxsharing reforms would 
lay down the rules so "everybody knows what can be done." "It 
will spell out clearly the interest of the central government 
and the regions through the setting up of a system," he said. 
  Mr. Zhu's defence of the reforms comes at a time when 
Guangdong is experiencing a dramatic surge in tax revenue. The 
reforms were introduced on January 1. Mr. Zhu revealed that in 
the first two months of this year, tax returns swelled to 4.15 
billion yuan (HK$3.7 billion) -- up nearly 60 per cent on the 
same period last year. 
  Industry and commerce tax takings have reached 3.4 billion 
yuan, representing a 59.2 per cent increase over the 
corresponding period last year. Total industrial output has 
grown by 19.8 per cent to 5.48 billion yuan. 
  "Fears that the new tax measures will dampen the enthusiasm 
of all sectors are totally unnecessary. Guangdong fully 
supports the tax-sharing system," Mr. Zhu said. Echoing Beijing 
policy, the Guangdong chief said the reforms would give central 
authorities greater "macrocontrol" over the economy, enabling 
them to make adjustments on a national scale when necessary. 
  Mr. Zhu said the central treasury's share of the total 
national revenue was "relatively low". "Regions should make 
contributions to guarantee the expenditure and the normal 
operation of the central government," he said. 
  The governor dismissed suggestions the surge in tax revenue 
for the January/February period reflected moves by the province 
to increase taxation. He attributed the increase to more 
stringent efforts to collect tax, adding that lax collection 
techniques in the past had led to many loopholes and much tax 
avoidance. 
  "We will levy tax in strict accordance with the 
law....Generally speaking, the new tax levy will not increase 
the burden on enterprises." 
  While drawing a rosy picture of the development of 
Guangdong, 
Mr. Zhu indicated a spate of long-term problems needed to be 
solved. These included the differences in economic growth 
between regions, the backwardness of infrastructure, development 
of spiritual civilisation, and efforts to crack down on crimes 
and social evils. 
  "We should also pay great attention to agriculture, 
particularly the supply of grain, price surges and law and 
order," he said. 
  On patriarch Deng Xiaoping's demand that China create 
several 
more Hong Kongs on the mainland, Mr. Zhu said a worker 
conference on the development of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) 
held recently in Zuhai had further discussed the idea. 
"Mainland provinces have expressed a lot of interest in 
building a Hong Kong in their own regions but no decision has 
been taken by the central government. 
  "We do believe the most qualified ones will be the existing 
SEZs. They have already adopted some international practices and 
can easily be integrated with other parts of the world." 
  Shenzhen Mayor Li You-wei said the zone would speed up its 
development in the next decade to help bridge the gap in 
development between the border cities and Hong Kong. 
  This was especially important in the lead up to the 1997 
transfer, he said.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 March (XINHUA) -- As cameras flashed, 
sending dazzling lights, Deputy Rong Yiren spoke with exuberant 
emotions: "This year's people's congress is particularly 
meaningful to me." The highly venerated vice president of the 
state revealed some of his "personal history" to fellow 
deputies: "The National People's Congress [NPC] has been 
established for 40 years, and I have also served for 40 years as 
a people's deputy since Premier Zhou Enlai invited me to Beijing 
to attend the congress for the first time. It is safe to say 
that I am a witness to New China's socialist democracy and legal 
construction." 
  Rong Yiren made these emotional remarks when he, with 
President Jiang Zemin, joined the Shanghai NPC delegation's 
discussion of the government work report on the afternoon of 11 
March. He recalled: "Democracy and the legal system have 
steadily developed since the founding of New China. The 
development was interrupted for a while during the 10-year 
turmoil. However, since the end of the `Cultural Revolution,' 
our democracy has continued to improve and develop, and our 
legal system has been steadily enhanced and strengthened. Our 
democracy is compatible with our national conditions. We must 
unswervingly adhere to the path of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics." 
  The senior NPC deputy earnestly remarked: "China is still a 
developing country, and its national strength is still not 
strong enough. Everyone should work hard to build up the 
country and improve the people's livelihood. However, some 
developments merit our attention -- developments such as 
excessive extravagance and waste, refusal to stress the spirit 
of plain living and hard struggle in economic construction, and 
the principle of building the country through thrift and 
diligence." 
  At the beginning of reform and opening up, Rong Yiren, 
entrusted by central leading comrades, founded the China 
International Trust and Investment Corporation. The company, 
which took the lead in linking China with the international 
economy, helped acquire a good image for China's opening up and 
raised large sums of money for its socialist construction. He 
said yesterday: "China has 1.2 billion people. If everyone 
saves 10 yuan, there will be 12 billion yuan. The reason that 
today some countries dare to criticize us and interfere in our 
internal affairs is, to put it bluntly, we are still not rich 
and powerful. We must work with one heart and one mind and make 
arduous efforts to make China strong and prosperous." 
  His forceful words were received with thunderous applause 
from Jiang Zemin and other deputies from Shanghai. The applause 
symbolized their respect and approval.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Wu Bangguo, the party 
chief of Shanghai, today expressed full support for 
macroeconomic control measures taken by the central government. 
  Wu said a growth rate of nine percent for the national 
economy in 1994 set in the government work report delivered by 
premier Li Peng is both "positive and appropriate." 
  A four percentage points markdown from last year's 13 
percent 
growth is "very necessary" because it will help balance total 
supply and demand and ease the pressure on "bottleneck" sectors 
of the economy, said Wu, who is here attending the annual 
session of the National People's Congress. 
  It will also create a relaxed environment for promoting 
economic restructuring. 
  "I think that, from a long-term point of view, it is 
conducive to the achievement of a sustained, rapid and sound 
development of the national economy," he noted. 
  "Shanghai will, as always, implement macroeconomic control 
measures taken by the central authorities," he added. 
  Wu Bangguo also expressed Shanghai's support for the 
establishment of a national tax assignment system. 
  Shanghai will try to contribute more to state coffers every 
year on the basis of economic growth, he said. 
  Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju expressed appreciation of the 
central 
government's repeated statement that its policies on the city's 
Pudong New Area and on Shanghai paying back its own foreign debt 
will remain unchanged. 
  This shows that, while pushing ahead with reforms, the 
central authorities have taken into account local interests and 
needs for further economic expansion. 
  The mayor pledged to improve Shanghai's economic performance 
by following guidelines for achieving a sustained, rapid and 
sound economic development. 
  "Meanwhile, we will continue to speed up readjustment of 
Shanghai's industrial structure," he said. 
  At the end of 1993, the service sector accounted for 38 
percent of Shanghai's gross domestic product and the ratio is 
expected to grow by two percent this year, he said. 
  Huang Ju predicted that the ratio will rise further to 45 
percent by the end of this century. 
  Shanghai's imports and exports shot up 20 percent in the 
first two months of 1994 over the same previous period, a record 
growth in the past 10-plus years, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- More than 2,000 
deputies to the second session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] began group discussions of Premier Li Peng's 
"Government Work Report" yesterday afternoon. The central topic 
of their discussions was how to focus on, serve, and submit to 
the overall task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability," which was proposed by the CPC Central Committee and 
expounded in the report. 
  At a crucial moment when our country is promoting package 
reform with breakthroughs in key areas and is accelerating the 
pace of building a socialist market economic system, the 
deputies, who are in Beijing to attend the NPC session, were 
aware of their heavy responsibilities. Lively discussions were 
going on in all meeting rooms, with the deputies focusing on 
deliberating the "Government Work Report" as they bore in mind 
the many problems specific to the grass-roots level. The 
discussions were in-depth from the outset as the deputies did 
away with pleasantries. Deputy Cheng Weigao from Hebei 
maintained: The report gives us a feeling that the party 
Central Committee and the State Council are so firmly committed 
to deepening reform and to advancing the process of building a 
socialist market economic system, that they completely foresee 
difficulties and obstacles that may arise on the way ahead, and 
that they can take steps to solve problems while the latter are 
still in their infancy. He went on to express his views on the 
question of deepening reform as part of the overall task. He 
observed: If we fail to tackle key aspects of reform this year, 
we cannot proceed on all fronts; if we fail to proceed on all 
fronts coordinately, it will be difficult to establish a new 
system. Successful reform requires efforts to 1) conduct proper 
propaganda on reform, correctly guide public opinion on reform, 
and carry out ideological and political work among cadres and 
people; 2) pay due attention to coordinating the reform process; 
3) solve thorny and key problems relating to enterprise reform 
and commodity prices; and 4) pay attention to constantly 
deepening and improving reform. He said: Enterprise reform is 
the most important and crucial part of the effort to deepen 
reform; its success or failure is the major criterion for 
judging the success or failure of reform as a whole. We should 
make enterprise reform the focus and crux of all reforms. Reform 
is the driving force, development is the goal, and stability is 
the prerequisite. Without stability, reform cannot succeed and 
it is impossible to pursue development. In closing, he said 
confidently: This year's reform is bound to succeed, the 
economy will surely develop, and social stability is bound to 
prevail if we focus on the overall task of the entire party and 
country and proceed in accordance with the principles and tasks 
spelled out in the report. We are fully confident of this 
prospect. 
  Deputy He Zhukang from Jilin maintained: We must proceed 
from an overall point of view; understand and handle all aspects 
of the relationship between reform, development, stability, and 
others; and improve the levels of integration and coordination 
in reform and development. On the other hand, the various 
problems and difficulties we currently encounter in reform and 
development are certain deep-seated contradictions which require 
us to highlight key areas and achieve breakthroughs in those 
areas while increasing the level of integration and 
coordination. He said: This particular point is explained very 
well in the "Government Work Report." On the question of work 
guidelines, the report focuses on the overall task of the entire 
party and country in seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability. It dialectically links up reform, development, and 
stability, and the resultant idea permeates the entire report. 
On the pace of reform, the report gives prominence to reform of 
the enterprise system, as well as reform of the financial, 
taxation, banking, and price management systems, thereby 
integrating efforts to establish principal competitors in the 
market and to invigorate microeconomic activity with those aimed 
at improving macroeconomic management and at setting stricter 
standards for market activity. This constitutes a concrete plan 
for implementing the decision of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and for building a socialist 
market economic system. On the question of socialist 
modernization, the report takes economic construction as the 
central task. It makes comprehensive plans for building a 
socialist market economic system, as well as for promoting 
socialist democracy and a socialist legal system. It makes 
wide-ranging arrangements for both socialist material and 
spiritual civilizations. This makes it possible to apply our 
country's concept of modernization to our work plans more 
completely and in a more balanced manner. On economic 
development, the report emphasizes the status of agriculture as 
the foundation of the national economy, restrictive factors that 
have a great impact on the national economy such as enterprises' 
economic returns and the investment structure, and the 
fundamental goal of improving the living standards. This 
reflects deep concern about improving the general quality of the 
national economy. 
  The deputies enthusiastically discussed the issue of how to 
focus on, serve, and submit to the overall task. Deputy Yao 
Minxue from Ningxia forwarded four viewpoints: First, it is 
necessary to base the job of solving problems and handling 
various contradictions of the overall task and to understand and 
attach utmost importance to the task. The overall task is to 
uphold economic construction as the center, seize opportunities, 
deepen reforms, widen opening up, promote development, and 
maintain stability with the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line. In addition, it is necessary to unite 
more closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin as the core as well as more conscientiously 
safeguard the State Council's authority to ensure the smooth 
implementation of administrative orders. Second, it is 
necessary to safeguard stability. As we cannot do anything at 
all without social and political stability, we must strive to 
safeguard stability. Speaking on Ningxia, the crux lies in 
strengthening the unity of Hui, Han, and other nationalities. 
Further, we must encourage them to cleave to each other and 
advance through thick and thin. Third, we must uphold the 
principle of grasping two links [grasping economic development 
and socialist spiritual modernization simultaneously] and taking 
stern measures in tackling both. In the course of reform, 
opening up, and modernization, it is necessary to effectively 
tackle spiritual civilization, strengthen ideological work among 
the people, enhance understanding, eliminate suspicions, 
regulate sentiment, remove contradictions, readjust relations, 
and enhance the spirit to mobilize all forces for the great 
undertakings of the four modernizations. Fourth, it is 
necessary to do practical work. We should give our best instead 
of doing superficial work; speak the truth instead of engaging 
in empty talk; and work for practical, instead of fabricated 
results. We should do genuine, solid, and practical work to 
effectively implement this session's guidelines. 
  Deputy Li Qiyan from Beijing said: The "Government Work 
Report" stressed that we must focus on, serve, and submit to the 
overall task in various undertakings. This should be a 
principle we must steadfastly implement. He said: Looking from 
the point of development, we should pay special attention to 
several issues that concern the overall task: 1) agriculture; 2) 
changing the operating mechanism of state-owned large- and 
medium-sized enterprises; 3) maintaining stable commodity 
prices; 4) upgrading the people's living standards; and 5) 
safeguarding social stability. We must attach great importance 
to these issues that concern the overall task. 
  Deputy Bai Qingcai from Shaanxi maintained: For a province 
to focus on, serve, and submit to the overall task means that in 
solving problems and undertaking jobs, it should first correctly 
identify its position in the overall task. Under the 
prerequisite of focussing on, serving, and submitting to the 
overall task, it should maintain coordinated development with 
the overall task. Serving the overall task is inseparable from 
stability. It is of vital importance to properly handle the 
relationship among reform, development, and stability. We 
should adopt a realistic and practical approach to thoroughly 
implement the intentions of the central authorities in every 
task. We should do practical work and effectively nurture and 
bring into play the people's enthusiasm. 
  Deputy Hui Liangyu from Hubei maintained: To focus on, 
serve, and submit to the overall task, it is necessary to pay 
special attention to solving the following few problems: First, 
we should upgrade economic efficiency by ways and means and 
should not blindly pursue output value, growth rate, and scales. 
Second, we should, through deepened reform, establish a modern 
enterprise system to truly bring enterprises to life. Third, we 
should further adjust and optimize the economic structure and 
focus on solving the "bottle-neck" that restricts national 
economic development. Fourth, we should attach great importance 
to agriculture and peasants' problems. He said: Agriculture is 
a sector that will bring about peace to the country. It is a 
sector that involves many people and has a relatively large 
social benefit. It is also a relatively fragile sector. We 
must not overlook our work for the rural areas and peasants' 
interests. Fifth, we should adopt realistic measures to 
safeguard social stability. 
  Deputy Tian Chengping from Qinghai maintained: To achieve 
the goal of focussing on, serving, and submitting to the overall 
task, we should first forge a uniform understanding. He said: 
In recent years, the pace of China's reform and construction 
has quickened and the national economy has developed rapidly. 
However, some problems have also emerged during progress. An 
important reason for the emergence of these problems is due to 
the lack of unanimity in our understanding. The good results 
obtained in macroeconomic regulation and control last year were 
due to better uniformity in our understanding. Problems can be 
solved only if everyone from top to bottom uniform their 
understanding. He said that Qinghai people supported the 
policies of the party Central Committee and the State Council. 
They will definitely implement well various tasks with uniform 
understanding. 
  With reference to specific work, Deputy Yue Qifeng from 
Liaoning pointed out: When seeking understanding on the issue 
of focussing on and submitting to the overall task, it is 
necessary to emancipate minds, do practical work while seeking 
truth, and work innovatively. It is necessary to give prominence 
to reform and uphold the advocation "development is the last 
word," and correctly regulate the relationship among reform, 
development, and stability to maintain social stability. We 
should effectively run state-owned large- and medium-sized 
enterprises and strongly nurture new economic growth points. In 
particular, we should support leading spots in economic 
development so as to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. 
  Persons in charge of the State Council's various departments 
observed the group meetings yesterday and today to hear 
deputies' opinions and to answered their queries.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station reporters Yao Dongming and Song </F>
Yongkuan: "The Overall Task -- A Matter of Importance" -- from 
the "News and Press Review" program] 
  [Text] With the advent of the spring breeze, the yearly 
twin sessions of the National People's Congress [NPC] and the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] are upon us again. The first 
topic among many NPC deputies and CPPCC members is the overall 
task. They believe that it is urgent to promote -- among people 
across the country and cadres at all levels in particular -- the 
idea of caring for and having the overall interest in mind. 
What is this overall task? It is the prosperity of our great 
country and the unceasing progress of the Chinese Nation. 
Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability -- this is the 
overall task today for the whole country and whole party. 
  While examining and discussing the report on government 
work, the NPC deputies and CPPCC members commented: Memorizing 
these phrases does not mean one understands what the overall 
task is. The key is that cadres at various levels must 
conscientiously subordinate themselves to this overall task in 
thinking and in action. The measures they devise should be 
conducive to this overall task and the steps they take must 
serve this overall task. When partial interest stands in the way 
of the overall interest, they must voluntarily give up partial 
interest in favor of overall interests. 
  NPC deputies and CPPCC members cited a wide array of 
irregularities in the localities that harm overall interest. 
For example, some localities always try to get around the 
strictures of the central government. When the central 
government was trying to consolidate order in the banking 
sector, the localities continued their illegal raising of 
investment; while the central government was calling for 
reducing the scale of capital construction, they continued 
building office buildings, auditoriums, and guesthouses; when 
the central government was calling for preventing the real 
estate sector from overheating, they claimed that there was no 
heating in their localities. Other manifestations include 
haphazard importation, duplication in construction, misguided 
competition in disregard of one's capabilities, rushing to 
launch new projects without careful study, and so forth. Some 
of these actions may yield short-term benefits but will, in the 
long run, be harmful to the state and people. 
  The existence of these phenomena indicates that in our 
effort to accelerate the transition from a planned economy to a 
market one, lack of understanding and experience and a mistaken 
standpoint can often lead to misguided actions. A sense of the 
overall task is especially important at a time like this. A 
man's understanding can be improved step by step and experience 
can be accumulated bit by bit, but he must first have a sense of 
the overall interest. 
  This year, we will be combining package reform with 
breakthroughs in key areas, a crucial year for all-round 
deepening of reform. Reform will unearth many deep-rooted 
contradictions. NPC deputies and CPPCC members held that the 
overall tasks requires us to properly handle the relations 
between reform, development, and stability. 
  He Zhukang, a deputy from Jilin, said: Only by persistently 
implementing reform and promoting development will we be able to 
lay a foundation for the long-term social stability and state 
order. To promote reform and development, we must have a stable 
social environment. Reform is aimed at unleashing the motive 
force, development is our goal, and stability is the 
precondition. This year we will be placing greater efforts on 
carrying out reform and new contradictions and problems are 
bound to emerge. To ensure smooth implementation of reform, we 
must subordinate ourselves to overall interests and ensure that 
regional growth rates will be appropriate and steady. 
  Referring to the policy of macroeconomic regulation and 
control adopted by the central authorities last year, Jiangsu 
Deputy Shen Daren said with feeling: This policy was adopted for 
the interest of the overall situation. It has created a 
favorable overall environment for regional development and 
helped bring along healthy development of the regional 
economies. It is easy to see from the comments of the NPC 
deputies and CPPCC members that China is indeed faced with a 
rare historical opportunity in terms of the conditions at home 
and abroad. We must, however, be aware of the fact that we are 
advancing economic reform when the national economy is growing 
rapidly; we are required to maintain a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy growth of the national economy while accelerating 
structural transformation. Under these circumstances, it is 
essential to stress ideals, discipline, unity, and overall 
interest. We must be full of confidence yet keep a clear head. 
Let us continue our conscientious, meticulous efforts in this 
regard and work in a down- to-earth manner to achieve new 
victories.

"Justify the Party Central Committee's Trust -- the Aspirations 
of Shanghai's National People's Congress Deputies" -- XINHUA 
headline] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- The central 
authorities and people across the country entertain great 
expectations about Shanghai. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's earnest 
exhortation to the people of Shanghai, in particular, has become 
one of the key topics of discussion among Shanghai's deputies to 
the National People's Congress during their deliberation of the 
government work report. Comrade Xiaoping made seven inspection 
trips to Shanghai to provide guidance over its work, devoting 
great energies to Shanghai's reform, opening up, and economic 
development. While spending this year's Spring Festival in 
Shanghai, Comrade Xiaoping said: "Shanghai has carried out its 
work very well; it has a unique quality and style. Shanghai is 
fully capable of moving at a faster pace." Deputy Huang Ju, 
mayor of Shanghai, was exultant when he told the reporter about 
this statement. In his words, "Shanghai's more than 14 million 
people were greatly inspired and felt more keenly their 
unprecedented historical responsibilities." 
  The pressures were never as great before; however, when 
these 
pressures are converted into a motive force, the results will be 
unprecedented. Deputy Huang Ju told the reporter excitedly: On 
the basis of market regulation, quality, and efficiency, 
Shanghai's total output of goods and services increased 14.9 
percent last year, reaching 151 billion yuan and pulling ahead 
of the rest of the nation. Local financial revenue rose by as 
much as 30 percent, topping 24 billion yuan and outstripping, 
for the first time, the increase in the total output of goods 
and services. [passage omitted] 
  Deputy Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee 
secretary, told the reporter: "This year is decisive for 
Shanghai's goal of achieving significant changes in three years' 
time. The burden is heavy and the road is long." This remark 
can be described as an embodiment of the Shanghai people's 
common aspirations. "Shanghai is now full of opportunities and 
enjoys geographical advantages and public support. What is 
important is to work in a down-to-earth manner. Only by 
exerting maximum efforts to make maximum contributions can we 
justify the expectations of the party Central Committee and the 
State Council, the full support of people across the country, 
and Comrade Xiaoping's earnest and great trust."

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Minister of 
Agriculture Liu Jiang said today that China has to readjust 
unbalanced product structure, raise efficiency of agriculture 
and greatly increase farmers' income this year, though the 
country saw a record grain output in 1993. 
  Addressing a press conference sponsored by the current 
session of the National People's Congress, Liu said that last 
year, output of cotton and sugar-bearing crops fell sharply 
because of natural disasters and poor management of product 
varieties in some areas of the country. 
  He said that inadequate macro regulations over the grain 
market, irrational farm crop structure, and many other factors 
fueled sharp price rises after grain price was set free late 
last year. This year the Ministry of Agriculture has sent three 
working teams to major rice producing areas to ensure an overall 
rational plantation structure in an attempt to keep the grain 
market stable. 
  Asked whether farmers' income has decreased, he said that 
the 
average income for farmers nationwide has not decreased. But he 
said that growth rate of farmers' income is relatively low 
comparing with that of their urban cousins. 
  He blamed it on the widening gap between prices of 
agricultural products and those of industrial products, and on 
the concentration on the sole business of planting, which cannot 
provide enough jobs for all workforce in rural areas. 
  According to Liu, the country has a rural workforce of 430 
million. Among them, 50 million have left their homes to seek 
jobs elsewhere. And six million more come after them every year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- China's open policy 
has injected vitality into the economies of its border areas. 
  Deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) expressed 
appreciation of Premier Li Peng's call for border areas to open 
wider in his government work report delivered at an NPC session 
Thursday [10 March]. 
  Shao Qihui, provincial governor of Heilongjiang, which 
borders on Russia, said the opening of border areas has brought 
a historical development opportunity to the province located in 
the northeast Asia economic region. 
  Heilongjiang shares a 3,000-km-plus border with Russia. 
Since the adoption of the open policy, border trade has boomed 
between Heilongjiang and Russia, he said. 
  Last year, Heilongjiang-Russian border trade reached 2.6 
billion Swiss francs, two-thirds of China's total border trade 
with Russia of that year, Shao said. 
  To further open up, the governor said, Heilongjiang will 
speed up the construction of an international trade route 
network, with priority given to completing railways and highways 
that go from the provincial capital of Harbin to Russia via the 
province's major border cities. 
  The province will also open up land-sea and river-sea 
transport routes and air routes to Europe and America. 
  Heilongjiang will also look for new markets and take an 
active part in economic cooperation in the northeast Asia 
economic region. 
  Shao said the province will encourage cities along the 
border 
to establish friendly and long-term cooperative ties with 
corresponding areas and cities in Russia. 
  Priority will also be gradually shifted to Sino-foreign 
economic and technical cooperation from traditional barter 
trade, the governor said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- The transformation of 
government functions is crucial to the the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure in China, according to 
Hainan Provincial Governor Ruan Chongwu. 
  Ruan, who is here attending the annual session of the 
National People's Congress, said that the Hainan Provincial 
authorities have asked local government leaders to devote more 
efforts and time to improving their duties of managing social 
affairs, in a bid to promote the creation of a market economy. 
  The island province of Hainan is also China's largest 
special 
economic zone, where special and flexible policies are being 
pursued to encourage investors from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and 
overseas. 
  "Under the conditions of a market economy, manufacturers 
should be able to decide on their production according to market 
demand," the governor said. 
  Therefore, government departments must always follow this 
basic law of the market economy and should never interfere in 
normal commodity production and exchanges, he noted. 
  "We have taken a series of major measures to reduce 
government interference since the beginning of last year," he 
said. 
  For example, all check posts on roads in Hainan were removed 
last year, thus facilitating the free movement of commodities 
provincewide. 
  Moreover, all government-assigned tax supervisors in 
enterprises were recalled in 1993. 
  According to Ruan Chongwu, the government is duty-bound to 
create a fine environment for the effective operation of 
commodity markets, labor markets and production factor markets. 
  "Of course, market forces are not all-powerful," he said, 
"so 
the government must exercise necessary intervention in economic 
affairs." 
  The government must perform its duty of arousing the 
initiative of all sectors of society, and must coordinate and 
balance the interests among various sectors so as to protect the 
interests of society, he said. 
  Under a market economy, he said, the government must 
undertake major projects that are beneficial to the whole 
society but have low economic returns. 
  These include water conservancy facilities, schools, 
hospitals and environmental protection facilities. 
  Furthermore, the government is duty-bound to effectively 
manage unrenewable resources, particularly land. 
  It must also exercise macro-economic controls by drawing up 
construction plans, releasing information and formulating 
industrial, fiscal and financial policies, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Henan, the second most 
populous province in China, registered a population growth rate 
of less than one percent in 1993, the lowest rate in a decade, 
Governor Ma Zhongchen said here today. 
  Ma, who is attending the ongoing session of the National 
People's Congress, told XINHUA that population growth has 
maintained a downward trend for the last three years in Henan, 
which has a population of 88 million, next only to Sichuan 
Province in size. 
  Henan's natural population growth rate was 9.52 per thousand 
in 1993, 1.62 per thousand lower than in 1992. Compared with 
the national average of 11.45 per thousand, this is seen as an 
excellent performance. 
  Back in 1990, Henan reported one of the highest population 
growth rates in China, at 18.4 per thousand. 
  "This seriously restrained local economic development," he 
said. 
  The province has in recent years adopted a series of 
measures 
to publicize family planning policies and related knowledge. 
  At present, 1,300 townships and urban neighborhood 
committees 
and 33,000 villages have set up family planning schools. Local 
governments have also given economic stimulus to households 
implementing birth control policies.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Beijing is not backing away from its commitment to 
reform its state-run enterprise sector despite the decision to 
bail out loss-making industries this year, a leading official 
said yesterday. 
  In his work report to the NPC, premier Li Peng announced 
that 
the Government would be providing special funds to large and 
medium- scale state-run enterprises and would exempt them from 
contributions to budgetary funds and energy and transport 
projects. 
  But Wang Guoquan, a leading industrialist and a member of 
the 
standing committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, said such financial privileges were 
only temporary measures designed to ensure stability in a 
transitional period. 
  If enterprises continued to lose money for long periods of 
time and failed to improve their economic efficiency, Mr. Wang 
said the Government would have no choice but to let them go 
bankrupt. 
  "Enterprises which solely rely on the Government's 
preferential policies without deepening their own reform will 
definitely sink and the Government will not keep providing them 
with aid," Mr. Wang told a specially convened press conference 
in Beijing. Mr. Wang said there was no contradiction between 
encouraging enterprises to take care of themselves on the one 
hand and continuing to provide them with subsidies on the other. 
  "What premier Li meant (in his work report) is that 
enterprises should mainly rely on their own efforts to deepen 
reform of their operational mechanism but before that, in the 
transitional period, the Government has no choice but to offer 
them some preferential treatment so that we can ensure the 
livelihood of their workers." 
  "These are only temporary measures," he stressed. However, 
independent analysts said "temporary" in this context could mean 
several years. 
  A Western diplomat in Beijing said: "The social disorder 
which would result from have 30 million or 40 million workers 
laid off is enough to make anyone nervous and so it is 
understandable the Government wants to shore up these 
enterprises for the time being. And with one third of these 
enterprises loosing huge amounts of money, it will take several 
years before the state sector is finally ready to take the 
plunge," she said. 
  Other observers said the Government's decision to provide 
additional funds to the state sector this year had been prompted 
by a wave of worker unrest over the past year. 
  A local economist said: "The Government has clearly been 
rattled by the increase in strikes and disruptions to production 
caused by workers' protests." 
  However, Mr. Wang said reports of numerous strikes in China 
had been exaggerated.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Development of rural 
enterprises will be the key for narrowing the economic gap 
between coastal areas and central-western regions of China, 
according to local leaders. 
  After hearing Premier Li Peng's government work report at 
the 
current session of the National People's Congress, leaders of 
three provinces and one autonomous region expressed their above 
view. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Ma Zhongchen, governor of Henan 
Province in central China, said that rural enterprises are a 
powerhouse for economic development in central and western 
regions, a main channel for surplus rural labor and a driving 
force for the development of rural towns. 
  He said Henan Province, the second largest agricultural 
province in China, has achieved remarkable progress in 
developing rural enterprises. In 1993 rural enterprises in the 
province produced an output value of 195 billion yuan and a 
gross profit of 24.18 billion yuan, up 62.5 percent and 76.5 
percent over the previous year. 
  Rural enterprises in Gansu and Yunnan Provinces and Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region also made breakthroughs and achieved 
record economic returns in 1993. Local leaders said that the 
output value of rural enterprises in the two provinces and 
Guangxi registered 58.4, 41.5 and 71.6 percent of growth 
respectively last year. 
  However, leaders of the three provinces and Guangxi clearly 
understood the giant gap between coastal areas and the central 
and western regions. 
  Zhang Wule, acting governor of Gansu Province, said the 
central and western regions account for 80 percent of China's 
land area and 65 percent of rural population. However, the 
output value of their rural enterprises took up only 35 percent 
of the national total in 1993. 
  "This gap will have an adverse impact on the economic 
development of the whole county," Zhang said. 
  According to existing conditions, it is necessary to carry 
out large-scale cooperation between coastal and central-western 
regions in the development of rural industry, because the 
eastern areas have technologies, financial resources and 
management expertise while the central-western regions abound in 
raw materials, natural resources and manpower, the acting 
governor said. 
  Liu Mingzu, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Regional People's Congress, said the joint-stock cooperative 
system arising from rural enterprises adapts to economic 
conditions in central and western regions. It is necessary to 
spread the system. 
  Leaders of the three provinces and Guangxi agreed that 
shortage of fund is the key factor restraining the development 
of rural enterprises in the central and western regions. 
  The State Council has decided that the central treasury will 
earmark loans to support development of rural enterprises in 
central and western regions from 1993 to 2000. 
  In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture is preparing a 
pilot 
program for east-west rural enterprise cooperation and plans to 
set up 100 pilot zones for east-west rural enterprise 
cooperation. 
  In accordance with state industrial policies, the ministry 
will also select 1,000 pilot projects for developing and 
upgrading rural industries in central and western regions. 
  At present, provinces and regions in eastern, central and 
western China are interested in the pilot program. Ten 
provinces and regions such as Sichuan, Hubei and Guangxi have 
planned to set up 50 pilot cooperative zones. 
  Leaders of the three provinces and Guangxi region believe 
that the central and western regions will usher in a new phase 
of rural industry development thanks to east-west cooperation, 
support from the central authorities plus local advantages.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- China will soon 
manufacture an improved model of "Red Flag" limousine, which was 
used exclusively by top Chinese leaders and whose production 
stopped some years ago. 
  This was disclosed by Geng Zhaojie, general manager of the 
China No. 1 Automotive Group, who is attending the ongoing 
session of the National People's Congress. 
  "Red Flag" was first designed and produced in 1958 by the 
No.1 automotive plant in Changchun in northeast China's Jilin 
Province. 
  Some years ago, the plant stopped producing the oversized, 
heavy limousine. 
  Designing of a new model began in 1991 and was completed 
last 
year, Geng said. 
  The new "Red Flag" is smaller than the old model, with two 
rows of seats instead of three, as was the case with the old 
model. Its body is shorter with an engine less than half the 
size of that for the old "Red Flag." 
  The new model is also more fuel efficient with a high speed. 
The new "Red Flag" will be cheaper than "Audi," a German car 
being made by the same plant, Geng said.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, director of 
the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, today 
delivered a report entitled "Several Questions Regarding Hong 
Kong" at a report-back meeting jointly held by the CPC Central 
Committee's Propaganda Department, the CPC Central Committee's 
Work Committee for Party Organs, the CPC Central Committee's 
Work Committee for Government Organs, the People's Liberation 
Army's [PLA] General Political Department, and the Beijing 
Municipal CPC Committee. 
  In his report, Lu Ping first discussed the origin and 
evolution of the differences between China and Britain on the 
Hong Kong question. He noted: The fundamental cause of the 
current differences between China and Britain on Hong Kong's 
political structure is that the British Government has changed 
its policies toward Hong Kong in recent years and has assumed an 
uncooperative and confrontational attitude in an attempt to 
maintain the greatest possible influence in Hong Kong after 
1997. Lu Ping said: From the outset of Sino-British talks on 
Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements held from April 
through November of 1993, the British side showed a lack of 
sincerity and refused to hold talks on the basis of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence 
with the Basic Law, and the agreements and understandings 
reached by China and Britain, all three of which had been agreed 
upon by China and Britain. It stubbornly adhered to Chris 
Patten's "constitutional reform package" containing "three 
violations." Just as the first phase of the agreement was about 
to be reached, the British side raised new issues and partially 
submitted the draft legislative bill to Hong Kong's Legislative 
Council [Legco] for discussion, without regard to the Chinese 
side's repeated dissuasions and warnings, thereby terminating 
the talks. Hong Kong's Legco, under the manipulation of the 
British side, recently adopted the partial legislative bill, 
thus completely closing the door on talks. The British side, 
without prior consultation, also unilaterally issued a white 
paper called "Representative Government in Hong Kong," in which 
it divulged the contents of the talks and distorted and attacked 
the Chinese side's position. For this reason, our Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, citing a host of facts, explained that the 
responsibility for the disruption of the talks rested entirely 
with the British side. 
  Lu Ping also discussed the construction of Hong Kong's new 
airport. He noted: The Chinese Government has always supported 
the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong. The British 
side, however, introduced a financing scheme, which leaves 
behind a heavy burden for the future Special Administrative 
Region [SAR], in violation of the relevant provisions in the 
"Memorandum of Understanding Between the Chinese and British 
Governments on the Construction of A New Airport in Hong Kong 
and Relevant Questions." The Chinese side, driven by a desire to 
protect the interests of its compatriots in Hong Kong and those 
of the SAR Government, waged a struggle, through arguments and 
reasoning, against the British side. Our government is now 
holding consultations with the British side on the latter's 
fourth financing scheme and is working to settle the financial 
arrangements for the new airport on the basis of the memorandum, 
with a view to prodding the British side to complete as much of 
the new airport as possible before 1997 in accordance with the 
provisions in the memorandum. 
  Lu Ping related various preparations made by the Chinese 
Government to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong 
in the absence of cooperation from the British side following 
the disruption of the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 
political structure. Lu Ping said on a firm note: The Chinese 
Government is confident and capable of ensuring Hong Kong's 
smooth transition in 1997 and its long-term prosperity and 
stability. 
  Li Dengzhu, deputy secretary of the CPC Central Committee's 
Work Committee for Party Organs, chaired the meeting. More than 
1,000 people from the CPC Central Committee's Work Committee for 
Party Organs, the CPC Central Committee's Work Committee for 
Government Organs, PLA troops stationed in Beijing, and 
departments under the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, heard 
the report.

  [Text] Taipei, March 12 (CNA) -- A military chief Saturday 
[12 March] urged the legislature to avoid deep cuts in Taiwan's 
military budget, warning that budget cuts could put the island 
at risk of attack. 
  Speaking at a seminar on military education, Chief of the 
General Staff Adm. Liu Ho-chien noted that Beijing has decided 
to increase its defense budget by 20 percent this year to top 
U.S.$5.75 billion. He said that any cut in Taiwan's defense 
budget would further tip the already disproportionate 
cross-Taiwan Strait military balance. The Republic of China 
[ROC] military has requested a budget of U.S.$ 9.1 billion plus 
an extra U.S.$1.1 billion for the purchase of F-16s and Mirage 
2000-5s. 
  Liu said, however, that he fully understood the government's 
desire to seek balanced national development despite the current 
financial difficulties. 
  Liu also warned that the potential military threat from 
Mainland China should not be underestimated. 
  Taiwan can never be too careful, he said, as Beijing has 
obtained a large amount of advanced weaponry from the former 
Soviet Union and the United States continues to pull its troops 
out of the Asian region. 
  Quoting Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek who said "learn from 
your enemies," Liu emphasized the importance of military 
education, and said Taiwan should pay more attention to the 
development of the military on the mainland.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng 
expressed satisfaction that deputies to the National People's 
Congress (NPC) are coming to a consensus on the necessity to 
correctly handle relations between reform, development and 
stability. 
  "This is very important for fulfilling the tasks of this NPC 
session," he said at a group discussion on his government work 
report by Beijing deputies. 
  When deputy Huang Da, president of Chinese People's 
University, expressed his view that Chinese realities require a 
correct handling of reform, development and stability, Li Peng 
said, "local governments should have the national interests in 
mind, and the mass media should guide public opinion correctly, 
providing complete and accurate information about central 
authorities' policies to avoid misunderstandings by the people." 
  For the nation, he said, 1994 is a year of heavy reform 
tasks 
and economic development. The introduction of many reform 
programs represents an important step toward the establishment 
of a socialist market economy. 
  He called for carrying out the reform programs firmly, 
adopting prudent attitudes and solving questions timely to 
ensure a smooth progression of reform and open policy 
implementation. 
  Li noted prices are an important factor for social 
stability. 
Experience has shown that it is correct to reform the country's 
price system step by step. 
  "The government has lifted price control over 90 percent of 
goods," he said. "But lifting price control doesn't mean 
forgoing macro-controls." 
  He expressed the hope that local governments would make 
efforts to keep price index at a tolerable level. 
  While conceding that a shifting of labor is inevitable now 
that there is a growing labor market in China, the premier 
called for strengthened management of the army of migrating 
laborers seeking jobs. "The government should provide guidance 
over the flowing labor force," he said. 
  He asked local governments to pay attention to improving 
urban housing and accelerating the renewal of old residential 
quarters. 
  He also urged Beijing to set an example in ideological and 
cultural progress, better management of the social order and 
create a good work and living environment for citizens in the 
capital. 
  A deputy from the suburbs urged the government to stabilize 
its rural policies and provide protective prices for farm 
products. 
  Another deputy, Doctor Hu Yamei, urged the government to 
crack down on feasting at public expense, cheating by sham 
doctors and superstitious activities. 
  Premier Li Peng listened attentively to the views and took 
notes.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng called for boosting vegetable and foodstuffs production to 
alleviate inflationary pressure here today. 
  "There are 23 kinds of goods that are most closely related 
to 
people's livelihood," Li said. "The most important of them are 
what people would like to fill in their 'vegetable baskets'." 
  In China, "vegetable basket" refers to fresh vegetables and 
foodstuffs such as eggs, fish and meat. 
  The premier made the remark at a group discussion by 
deputies 
from Hebei Province to the National People's Congress (NPC) now 
in session in the Chinese capital. The deputies were discussing 
his government work report he delivered at an NPC session last 
Thursday [10 March]. 
  Li praised Hebei Provincial authorities for doing a good job 
of developing "vegetable basket projects" in recent years and 
facilitating supplies of vegetables and foodstuffs to urban 
residents. 
  In response to Hebei party chief's comment that low prices 
and drought were factors affecting cotton production, the 
premier said that the government has decided to raise purchasing 
prices for cotton by a proper margin. 
  "However, if purchasing prices are raised too high, I'm 
afraid the textile industry won't be able to bear," he said. 
  The problem will have to be solved gradually, in the process 
of establishing a market economic structure and carrying out 
price reform, he said. 
  The premier proposed expanding the acreage of sprinkling 
irrigation and improving cotton varieties to combat drought. 
  Li Peng also talked about enterprise reform, water diversion 
from the south, and development of water-saving farming.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng today called on all localities to properly handle relations 
among reform, development and stability and firmly carry out new 
reform measures. 
  Joining a group discussion with deputies from Hainan 
Province 
to the National People's Congress (NPC), Li Peng said that in 
the process of reforms, it is necessary to discover problems and 
promptly solve them. 
  Li Peng also heard today a group discussion by NPC deputies 
from Jilin Province. 
  Hainan deputies raised proposals on strengthening the island 
province's infrastructure, developing its rubber industry and 
exploiting its marine resources. 
  Li Peng said Hainan, as China's largest special economic 
zone, has made remarkable progress in reform and open policy 
implementation and is one of China's most promising areas. 
  He expressed the hope that Hainan would make use of its 
advantages in location and resources to serve as the country's 
vegetable supply and rice breeding bases and quicken 
infrastructure development. 
  The premier also emphasized the importance of maintaining a 
high ethical standard in Hainan, China's largest special 
economic zone. 
  With the Jilin group, the premier heard deputies speaking on 
enterprise reform, grain production, the opening of border 
areas, and the introduction of a share-holding system for 
enterprises. 
  On improving the performance of state-owned enterprises, Li 
Peng said it is necessary to give them support by way of 
introducing reform measures. 
  "But, fundamentally speaking," the premier said, 
"enterprises 
should rely on themselves to find markets for their products and 
to improve their performance through technical renovation and 
scientific management." 
  After he left the Jilin delegation, Li Peng met with and 
spoke to deputies from Fujian Province. 
  Speaking of uneven economic development within Fujian, he 
said the province should make efforts to narrow the gap between 
developed Xiamen, Fuzhou and Quanzhou and its backward 
northwestern and eastern parts in a bid to achieve common 
prosperity.

<F P=106> [Reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- Today, delegates from 
the People's Liberation Army [PLA] enthusiastically examined 
Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" in eight separate 
groups. Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Chi Haotian, and other 
delegates spoke during their respective groups' examination of 
Premier Li Peng's "Govenment Work Report." 
  Central Military Commission's Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen said 
as Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" has greatly 
inspired the military, set forth clear tasks and demands 
regarding the issue of strengthening the modernization 
construction of national defense, the army will resolutely 
implement it. Consolidating the national defense, resisting 
aggression, defending the motherland, safeguarding the results 
of the peaceful labor of the people, are the sacred duty and 
responsibility that the constitution has entrusted upon our 
Army. Under the new situation of reform and opening up, the PLA 
bears a great responsibility to defend the state security and 
maintain social stability. Only by building a strong and 
powerful Army which is under the absolute leadership of the 
party, loyal to the motherland and the people, can our country 
achieve security and stability, can our country be assured of a 
smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization 
construction. 
  After reviewing the achievements in Army construction last 
year, Zhang Zhen said our army is politically firm, resolutely 
listens to the party, and can be trusted absolutely by the party 
and the people. In the new year, our Army will, under the 
guidance of Mao Zedong's military Thought and Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's Thought on building the Army in the new period, in 
line with the general demands for "political qualification, 
perfect operational skill, fine working style, strict 
discipline, and an effective logistic guarantee" proposed by 
Comrade Jiang Zemin, do a further good job in the revolution, 
modernization, and regularization of Army construction, and 
fulfill well the tasks entrusted by the party and the people 
under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin at its core. 
  Zhang Zhen said to do a good job on Army construction, it is 
first of all necessary to conscientiously study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and to use Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to arm the thinking of the Army's commanders. 
It is necessary to increase the study of new and high 
technology; raise the Army's combat capability in modern 
conditions; implement a policy of strict Army management; 
strictly enforce rules and regulations; manage troop units well; 
foster the excellent work style of strict enforcement of orders 
and prohibitions; and establish a good image for the people's 
soldiers. He also expressed the hope of again giving play to the 
role of militiamen and reserve forces in maintaining social 
order and social stability. 
  Delegate Chi Haotian, who is a State Councillor and Defense 
Minister, spoke at the group meeting. He said practice in 
China's 15 years of reform, opening up, and economic 
construction has demonstrated that reform is the strong impetus 
for propelling social development. The only way out to solve 
the deep-rooted contradictions and problems in the current 
national economy lies in deepening reform. We should not waver 
in the least to make Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics a guide and support the 
state in accelerating the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system. Our Army is the people's army led by the 
party. In this crucial period in which the state is 
accelerating the pace of reform, it is necessary to firmly keep 
in mind President Jiang Zemin's instruction that "revolutionary 
soldiers should hold high the banner of patriotism and 
socialism"; to assume responsibility for serving the interests 
of the party and the people; to serve the overall situation of 
economic construction; to try our best in doing a good job in 
national defense construction; and to create a safe and reliable 
environment to carry out reform smoothly and develop the economy 
for the state. Chi Haotian said a strong consciousness about 
national defense is the inspiration for millions of people to 
care for and support national defense. First of all, the notion 
of "if there is no Army, there will be no security, and if there 
is no Army, there will be no stability" must be firmly implanted 
in the minds of cadres at all levels. We must rely on the force 
of the party, the government, the military, and society, make 
regular use of the means of news dissemination, publishing, 
film-making, and television production to conduct national 
defense education among the masses, so that the positive effects 
of national defense education will take root in the minds of the 
people. We should also attach great importance to the building 
of a legal system for national defense and persist in giving 
equal importance to legislation and enforcement of the law. It 
is necessary to vigorously promote reform, enhance the building 
of reserve forces, and make the building of reserve forces adapt 
to the new situation. 
  This afternoon, delegates from the PLA showed great 
enthusiasm in speaking out at group discussions. Delegate Xu 
Huizi said that since the new blueprint has been mapped out and 
the state's major policies and principles decided, the key lies 
in their implementation. We must mobilize the initiative and 
creativity of comrades of the whole party and people in the 
nation to the greatest extent, gather the people's cohesive 
force, rouse people to rise with force and spirit, and link our 
army's construction with the state's economic construction and 
with the overall situation of national reform. A strong economy 
will improve the military's outlook and successful reform will 
bring about a strong national defense. We must subordinate 
ourselves to the overall situation, support reform, and 
contribute to the establishment of a socialist market economy. 
Delegate Xu Xin said all levels of party organizations should 
enhance the education of party members and leading cadres, train 
hundreds of thousands of upright and good communist party 
members, display an exemplary role in reform, opening up, and

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (AFP)--Chinese dissident Yang 
Zhou, spokesman for the Chinese Human Rights Association, was 
released here Saturday after being detained by police for 
questioning overnight. "I spent the night at the police station 
and the police made it clear I was not to go too far," Yang said 
in a telephone interview. 
  His detention came less than an hour after the arrival of 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is expected to 
ask the Chinese government about progress on human rights. 
  Yang, a 50-year-old veteran dissident, was one of the nine 
founders of the Peace Charter, a human rights movement set up 
last November. Two of its leaders, Qin Yongming and Zhou 
Guoqiang, have been imprisoned. The secretary general of the 
Human Rights Association, Shanghai-based Wang Fuchen, was also 
detained for questioning Friday. 
  The Chinese government has launched a major offensive 
against 
dissidents and rebel intellectuals over the past 10 days, 
questioning about 15, of whom three are still in custody. The 
latest crackdown coincided with the annual session of the 
National People's Congress, which began sitting Thursday.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (AFP) -- Leading mainland 
dissident Yang Zhou, spokesman for the Chinese Human Rights 
Association (CHRA), was released Sunday after being arrested by 
police for the second time in 24 hours. Yang, 50, a 
Shanghai-based dissident who is also a founder of the Peace 
Charter movement created last November, said by telephone that 
he had been released at 9:00 a.m. (0100 GMT) after being held 
for more than 13 hours. 
  Another CHRA leader, Li Guotao, who was picked up with Yang 
on Saturday evening, was released at 1:00 a.m. (1700 GMT), Yang 
said. 
  Yang and Li were the latest dissidents to be taken in for 
questioning during a police sweep in Beijing and Shanghai that 
has netted around 15 activists in the last 10 days. The 
detentions coincided with the opening in Beijing of the annual 
session of the Chinese parliament and the arrival of U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (AFP)--Dissident Wang Fuchen, 
secretary general of the Chinese Human Rights Association, was 
released Monday [14 March] in Shanghai after three days in 
police custody, a source close to him said. The spokesman for 
the association, Yang Zhou, who was also detained, said he had 
spent three consecutive nights at police headquarters in 
Shanghai and was set free at midday Monday. 
  "It's become a routine," Yang said by telephone. "They come 
to get me in the evening, I take my cigarettes and my tea, I 
sleep there and come home again in the morning." "They want to 
keep up the pressure, and they're not arresting me to show how 
human they are," added Yang, 50, who is a veteran human rights 
campaigner and one of nine founders of the Charter for Peace 
movement begun last November. 
  Wang, 39, has also been campaigning for human rights for 
many 
years, spending three years in prison for his activity during 
the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement. The detentions of both men 
were part of a massive offensive against dissidents to coincide 
with the current session of the National People's Congress, 
China's rubber-stamp parliament, and the visit of United States 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, which ended Monday. 
  Bao Ge, another Shanghai dissident, said Monday police had 
instructed him to "keep quiet" during the upcoming visit to 
China of Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosakawa. He will be 
in China March 19 to 21. Xu Liangying, 74, a professor at 
China's National Academy of Sciences, said Monday he was still 
under heavy surveillance and was not allowed to receive foreign 
visitors. Xu and six other intellectuals wrote a letter to the 
government last week, asking it to release political prisoners.

  [Text] Leading mainland dissident Yang Zhou, the spokesman 
for the Chinese Human Rights Association (CHRA), was arrested 
late yesterday for the second time in 24 hours, his wife said. 
Yang, 50, a Shanghai-based dissident and a founder of the Peace 
Charter movement created last November, was also detained on 
Friday and then released yesterday morning after receiving a 
"warning" from authorities. 
  Li Guoping said her husband had been arrested along with 
another dissident, Li Guotao, who was also a leader in the CHRA. 
On Friday, he was detained with another leading Shanghai 
activist, Wang Fuchen. Wang is still being held. 
  Several other dissidents, including veteran democracy 
activist Xu Liangying, also said by telephone yesterday police 
had thrown security cordons around their apartments, in examples 
of official pressure on dissidents during the visit of United 
States Secretary of State, Warren Christopher. 
  To date, police have arrested or detained about 15 activists 
in the run-up to Mr. Christopher's visit. Mr. Xu, 74, said he 
was being kept in a state of virtual house arrest, with police 
not allowing anyone into or out of his home. He was one of 
seven intellectuals who wrote to government leaders last week 
demanding the release of political prisoners. He said two 
policemen had stationed themselves at his door and four more had 
come to the main entrance of his building yesterday morning to 
keep friends from visiting him. 
  "When I asked them what they were doing, they said: 'We're 
protecting intellectuals'," Mr. Xu said. He later tried to 
leave his apartment in Beijing's university district to pick up 
a newspaper, but police would not let him out, he said. 
  "I fought with them, and demanded to know what law allowed 
them to do this," he said. "All they answered was: 'It's 
orders from higher authority'. " His wife, historian Wang Laidi, 
said: "They don't allow our friends to come in. They're 
concerned we'll have contact with Mr. Christopher." 
  Mr. Christopher has said he has no plans to meet dissidents 
during his trip. Speaking during his hours of freedom, Yang -- 
Shanghai's most prominent political dissident -- said he had 
been treated well by police. 
  Police also swarmed around US diplomatic compounds in 
Beijing 
yesterday in an attempt of head off any demonstrations during 
Mr. Christopher's visit. 
  Journalists who tried to see some prominent dissidents on 
Friday night or yesterday were stopped by police and, in at 
least three cases, detained for questioning. 
  A Dutch reporter was held for five hours yesterday for 
attempting to visit Liu Nianchun, the founder of a new labour 
rights' organisation. Caroline Straathof, of the Dutch 
newspaper De Volkskrant, said she and her Chinese translator 
were taken to a police station in the city's university district. 
  Mr. Liu was one of three dissidents who last week sent 
government officials an official application to establish a 
group to look after labour rights in the current economic boom. 
Straathof said police seized a copy of a document in which Mr. 
Liu proclaimed the labour federation, along with her notes, 
tapes and film. They also accused her of "visiting Chinese 
citizens without permission" and failing to carry her residence 
permit. 
  Mr. Liu's wife said he left the house on Friday and had not 
returned. Two other reporters, Nicholas Driver of United Press 
International and Matthew Forney of Newsweek, were detained near 
Mr. Liu's house on Friday. They were held for six hours. 
  Other important dissidents have left Beijing in recent days 
and do not appear likely to return during the U.S. official's 
visit. They include China's most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "More Dissidents Are Apprehended; </F>
Three Pro-Democracy Movement Leaders, Including Wang Dan, 
Suddenly Leave Beijing on Eve of Christopher's Visit"] 
  [Text] On the eve of a visit by the most senior official 
of the Clinton administration, the Chinese public security 
authorities have once again taken action against dissidents; 
Shanghai's pro-democracy figures Wang Fuchen [3769 1607 2052], 
and Yang Zhou [2799 0719] were taken away in turn by the 
authorities yesterday and their whereabouts are unknown. 
  On the same day, three of the 1989 pro-democracy movement 
leaders, including Wang Dan [3769 0030] and Zhou Duo [0719 
5305], suddenly left Beijing and their current whereabouts 
remain unknown. 
  Before the departure of U.S. Secretary of State Christopher 
from the United States, U.S. officials had hinted that he would 
possibly meet Chinese dissidents during his visit, despite the 
fact that during his journey he had openly stated that he would 
not meet dissidents. The fact that the Chinese public security 
authorities took action against dissidents yesterday shows that 
the authorities are not "taking any risks." According to some 
foreign reports, it is not known whether or not the departure of 
Wang Dan and others from Beijing is by design of the 
authorities. However, their choice to leave Beijing before 
Christopher officially began his visit might avoid becoming 
entangled with the public securities authorities which would 
most likely happen. Surprisingly, a foreign dispatch quoted 
Wang Dan and others calling on the U.S. Government to continue 
to prolong MFN status for China, before they left Beijing. 
  Wang Fuchen is the fifteenth dissident that has been 
detained 
over the past week whereas Yang Zhou has been detained twice 
over the past weeks. According to Wang Fuchen's family, when he 
returned home yesterday morning, he was immediately taken away 
by some public security men: "They said they were taking Wang 
to stay in a guest house for several days." 
  The 39-year-old Wang Fuchen, an individual household, was 
given a sentence of 3-year imprisonment for participating in the 
1978 Democracy Wall Campaign. He is currently secretary-general 
of the Shanghai Human Rights Association. 
  Yang Zhou, one of the signatories of the "Peace Charter," 
had 
talked about Wang Fuchen being detained with this reporter over 
the phone before he himself was apprehended, saying: "They hold 
Wan Fuchen in custody as a warning sign. If Wang was lucky, he 
would be detained for 24 hours; otherwise, they might detain him 
till after the conclusion of the NPC." 
  Shortly after, he was taken away from his home by a public 
security man. Yang Zhou's wife said that the public security 
man did not provide an explanation on why he took Yang away, nor 
did he disclose when Yang would be released. 
  As to the three pro-democracy movement figures who left 
Beijing, they are: Wang Dan, the student leader of the 1989 
student movement who sent the NPC and CPPCC an open letter only 
two days before; Zhou Duo, one of the last batch to withdraw 
from Tiananmen during the 4 June incident; and Min Qi [7044 
3823], a scholar. 
  This reporter phoned Wang Dan's family yesterday evening to 
inquire after him. His mother said that she knew nothing about 
Wang Dan's departure from Beijing; Wang Dan had "left home" when 
his family members were all at work and he had not said goodbye 
to his family, nor had he made any telephone calls. They 
learned about his departure through one of his friends who was 
with Wang Dan. According to his mother, Wang Dan had left home 
without saying goodbye and she was worried about it. However, 
she reckoned that Wang Dan would make contact with the family in 
a few days time. 
  According to his cousin, Wang Dan suddenly decided to leave 
Beijing by taking a train heading south yesterday morning. 
Accompanying him were two of his friends, Zhou Duo and Min Qi. 
His cousin said that Wang Dan left Beijing at around 0900 and 
that Wang did not explain anything to him because Wang was in a 
hurry; However, Wang did say that he would return to Beijing 
after a week or so. His cousin was worried as to whether or not 
he would be able to return to Beijing a week later. 
  A foreign dispatch quoted Zhou Duo: "In view of the present 
situation, we are leaving Beijing for a few days on our own. We 
strongly appeal to the U.S. Government to continue to grant 
China MFN status." 
  It is still hard to tell whether or not the departure of the 
three was genuinely voluntary. Earlier, the public security 
authorities demanded that Wang Dan leave Beijing but he refused. 
However, within 10 days, Wang Dan has already been detained 
twice fro a short time for interrogation and the public security 
men had warned him to end all his political activities or else 
he would face heavy penalties.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive report" by reporter An Ping (1344 1627): "Wang </F>
Dan, Zhou Duo, Min Qi Issue Statement: They Are Leaving Beijing 
Temporarily on Their Own in View of the Situation"] 
  [Text] According to authoritative sources, student 
movement leader Wang Dan, Zhou Duo, and Min Qi have arrived in 
Fujian. Several days ago, they signed and published an open 
statement, saying that they had "deliberately" left Beijing for 
a few days and calling on the U.S. Government to extend the MFN 
trade status to China. However, the statement, which is being 
circulated, has not been confirmed by Wang Dan in person. 
  The full text of the statement is as follows: 
  1. Under pressure from the current situation, we are 
deliberately leaving here for a few days. 
  2. We strongly call on the U.S. Government to extend MFN 
trade status for China. [Signed] Zhou Duo, Wang Dan, Min Qi 
[Dated] 9 Mar 1994 
  As U.S. Secretary of State Christopher arrived in Beijing, 
Wang Dan and the others were in other parts of the country. 
This ties in with what they said in the statement, that is, 
they left Beijing "under pressure from the situation." 
  It is understood that Christopher had submitted a list of 
political prisoners to judicial departments in Beijing askine 
for their release. This list included the names of Wang Juntao, 
Ren Wanding, and the three dissidents detained recently--Yuan 
Hongbing, Wang Jiaqi, and Zhou Guoqiang. 
  The U.S. Secretary of State is paying this special visit to 
Beijing to gauge the human rights situation at a time when the 
National People's Congress and China People's Political 
Consultative Conference sessions are being held. It is not easy 
for the Chinese side to find any reason to prevent Christopher 
from making contact with democratic activists, therefore the 
abovementioned "arrangement" have been made. 
  The sources estimate that Zhou Duo, Wang Dan, and Min Qi 
will 
return to Beijing in about 10 days.

  [Excerpts] "I tell you, there are cops here right now, and 
they have not let me go out the whole morning, nor do they let 
my friends come in," mainland Chinese human rights activist Xu 
Liangying almost roared over the phone. 
  "A reporter asked me whether I would meet Christopher if he 
came to pay me a visit. I said, I have not requested to see 
Christopher. But if he wants to talk to me, I will be willing to 
meet him. Perhaps this has irritated the authorities. This 
morning three persons in charge of the party group of the China 
Academy of Social Sciences came over here to talk with me and 
asked me not to meet Christopher. They preached at me. They 
talked of state security, blah blah blah....I gave this offer to 
them. I said, I will consider your request if you have all the 
cops withdrawn, have Ding Zilin's telephone line reconnected, 
and have all the plainclothes men withdraw from around her 
house. If you do not do this, then I tell you I will probably 
request a meeting with Christopher on my own." 
  Xu Liangying said with great indignation: "I want to tell 
the whole world what the situation is in China now -- whoever 
calls for reason and the improvement of human rights through 
rationality will immediately have his human rights infringed 
upon." [passage omitted] 
  In this telephone interview Xu Liangying also mentioned Ding 
Zilin's case: "I went to see her yesterday afternoon. Her 
telephone line had been cut off. Those staying outside her 
house seemed to be behaving in a more civilized manner. Many 
plainclothes men were staying 10 to 20 meters away from the 
house. Those cops I had here were in uniform, they were from 
the Public Security Bureau. Whether the situation has changed 
today, I do not know. That is what I saw yesterday." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ren Zhongping (0117 0112 1627): "The Leaders </F>
and the Masses Are United as One To Make a Success of This 
Year's Reform"] 
  [Text] Abstract: This year is a crucial year for 
quickening the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure and comprehensively deepening reform in our country. 
It is necessary to make "across-the-board advances" [zheng ti 
tui jin 2419 7555 2236 6651] in the three aspects of fostering 
the market entities, perfecting the market system, and improving 
the regulatory and control system, and to make breakthroughs in 
the two key points of laying the microeconomic foundation and 
building the macroeconomic structure for the new market economy. 
The reform measures that have been adopted or will be put into 
practice this year will extensively touch upon many difficult 
points in people's concepts and ideas, institutional 
innovations, the adjustment of interests, and concrete operation 
at a profound level; so this will be a tough battle. 
  At present, we are facing the most favorable opportunity for 
launching the tough battle in our reform. We should be 
courageous and determined enough to overcome all the 
difficulties in the structural reform; otherwise, we may lose 
the rare historical opportunity and may fail to ensure the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang] 
development of the national economy and to achieve the 
second-step strategic objective of our national economic and 
social development; moreover, our economy may even be bogged 
down in a predicament with the coexistence of high inflation and 
low-speed economic fluctuation over a fairly long time. 
  We should profoundly understand and consciously grasp the 
new 
characteristics of this year's tough battle in the reform. In 
the objects of the reform, as the reform will change the current 
dual-track system into the single-track system of the market 
economy, the pattern of the vested interests formed under the 
dual-track system will be profoundly shaken. Thus, we need 
comrades who take an active part in the reform to be brave 
enough to carry out self-revolution. In the structure of the 
reform, the spontaneous advances from bottom to top and the 
devolution of power from top to bottom will be changed from 
unified coordination and organization from top to bottom. This 
will be a major change, which requires new adaptability. In the 
process of the reform, "single-item advances" and batch 
operation will be replaced with "across-the-board advances" and 
"making breakthroughs in key points." This will make it more 
necessary to obey the guidance of the central authorities, to 
safeguard the authority of the central leadership, and to 
establish an overall point of view. In the guidance to the 
reform, as reform will mainly be regularized and guaranteed by 
the legal system rather than being promoted by various policies, 
we are required to continuously enhance the sense of law and to 
learn how to apply legal means to guide the reform and manage 
the economy. 
  To successfully fight a tough battle in this year's reform, 
we must be united as one from top to bottom and share weal and 
woe, and this is the decisive factor. First, we should be 
really of one heart and one mind from top to bottom in the 
aspect of approaching and assessing the situation. We must not 
think that "reform is a matter for the central authorities, and 
development is my own business" and must not thus become 
indifferent to reform. Second, we should be really of one heart 
and one mind in making efforts to create a more benign and more 
favorable economic environment for the reform, and should thus 
be determined to resolutely control the level of investment in 
fixed assets, to maintain a basic balance among the gross 
economic quantities, and effectively to curb inflation. Third, 
we should be really of one heart and one mind in using both 
hands to grasp the work; that is, while carrying out economic 
reform and economic development, we should also safeguard social 
and political stability and strengthen socialist spiritual 
civilization. Leaders at all levels should be good at finding 
out and stabilizing the people's feelings and resolving 
contradictions in good time so that a peaceful and stable 
situation as well as a benign public conduct and opinion 
environment can be maintained. We should really ensure the 
supply of foodstuffs and other daily necessities for the masses, 
and should do solid things closely linked with their daily 
lives. We must not disregard the people's livelihood while only 
being keen to raise the rate of economic growth. [end abstract] 
  What will this year be? The leading comrades of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed 
that this year will be a crucial year for implementing the 
"Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and for launching a tough battle in the in-depth 
reform across the board for the establishment of the new 
socialist market economic system. On 1 January, Comrade Jiang 
Zemin pointed out in his speech at the new year tea party held 
by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference: "The year 1994 will be an extremely 
important year for our country's reform, opening up, and 
modernization." "In the new year, the key part of our in-depth 
reform is to carefully and properly organize the adoption and 
implementation of a series of major reform measures for the 
establishment of the socialist market economic system." 
  On 28 January, in his speech to the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference, Comrade Zhu Rongji stressed: "The 
tasks of reform and development in 1994 will all be arduous, and 
this is what the people are concerned about and what the world 
is watching. Whether we can win in this tough battle in the 
course of reform will be a stern test for us." Later, in his 
speech at the Spring Festival gala, Comrade Li Peng summarized 
this year's tough reform battle into three main points: "First, 
properly organize the implementation of the major reform 
measures in the fields of the financial and taxation system, the 
banking system, and the investment system, and establish and 
perfect the macroeconomic control system. Second, continue to 
transform the management and operation mechanisms in the 
state-owned enterprises, and explore an effective way to 
establish a modern enterprise system suited to the requirements 
of the socialist market economy. Third, properly advance the 
price reform and develop and improve the market system on the 
basis of giving full consideration to the endurance capability 
of all quarters concerned." 
  All these important speeches conveyed two important messages 
to us: First, the economic structural reform in our country has 
entered a new stage of being advanced comprehensively and in a 
well-coordinated manner in depth across the board. This year 
will be a year in which most reform measures will be adopted 
more intensively than in the past more than 10 years since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and the 
size, scope, difficulty, and depth of the reform will all be 
unprecedented. Second, this year's in-depth reform will "be 
advanced across the board" in the three aspects of fostering the 
market entities, perfecting the market system, and improving the 
regulatory and control system. At the same time, breakthroughs 
will be made in the two key points of laying the microeconomic 
foundation and building the macroeconomic structure for the new 
market economy. These reform measures will basically take shape 
within this year, and will become well-known to the general 
public next year. In 1996, China will begin to move onto the 
path of the socialist market economy. With the coming of the 
new year, the prelude to the tough reform battle was started, 
and the central authorities announced a series of important 
reform programs in the field of macroeconomic control and in 
other fields. The pilot schemes for the establishment of the 
modern enterprise system, which is the main point of the 
microeconomic reform, will soon be started in about 100 
enterprises selected by the State Council. We should be fully 
aware of the necessity, arduousness, and complicated nature of 
this year's tough reform battle, and should be of one heart and 
one mind in ensuring the across-the-board implementation of all 
the major reform measures adopted by the central authorities 
according to the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee. Through our painstaking efforts to 
organize and guide the operation in various fields, we shall 
guarantee the smooth implementation of the reform measures, win 
a victory in the tough reform battle, and further develop the 
current good situation. 
<H6>  I </H6>
  Why do we call the implementation of the major measures for 
the in-depth reform this year a tough reform battle [gaige 
gongjian zhan 2395 7245 2396 1017 2069]? This mainly refers to 
the depth and difficulty of the reform. On the whole, some of 
the major reform programs to be put into practice this year will 
extensively touch many deep-level ideas and concepts, as we have 
often mentioned, as well as some difficult points in the 
adjustment of interests and concrete operation. For example, 
the reform program for establishing the modern enterprise system 
will profoundly touch the issue of defining the property rights 
in the public economy and the form of the public economy. Being 
different from the policy adjustments in the eighties in the 
enterprise reforms, which were mainly devolution of power that 
enabled the enterprises to retain more profits in their hands, 
the current in-depth reform will further create a brand-new 
enterprise system. As another example, in the reform program 
for the establishment of the market for production factors, the 
"labor force market" will touch such a deep-level issue as the 
status of workers in an enterprise under the socialist 
condition. As for the concept of a "capital market," this is 
also a major breakthrough from the traditional conception and is 
a new development of socialist economic theory. As one more 
example, the reform program for various macroeconomic control 
mechanisms, especially the tax-sharing system, requires the 
delimitation of the scope of macroeconomic regulation and 
control and is related to the scientific demarcation between the 
economic management jurisdictions of the central and local 
governments. In economic management, the authority of the 
central government must be strengthened, and the power of 
macroeconomic control in various fields must be concentrated in 
the hands of the central government. At the same time, it is 
also necessary to bring the initiative of the central and local 
authorities into play. This is an issue that has not been 
properly resolved since the foundation of the PRC and has not 
been thoroughly resolved although efforts were made to resolve 
it since the beginning of the reform. Therefore, this will also 
be a difficult point in the tough reform battle. It is also 
rather difficult to break the departmental and regional 
monopolies in some economic sectors and to adjust the existing 
interest patterns. Because the emancipation of people's minds, 
the renewal of concepts, the innovation of systems, and the 
adjustment of interests will be carried out at a deeper level 
and will encounter greater difficulties, we call this year's 
in-depth reform program a tough reform battle, which means we 
will have to overcome many difficulties. 
  Why are so many tasks of tackling difficult problems 
scheduled for this year in a concentrated manner, since tackling 
difficult problems in reform is so arduous and involves certain 
risks? Here is the question of the judgment and choice of 
timing concerning whether or not the tasks of tackling difficult 
problems in reform, which we have been discussing undertaking 
for so many years, but for which conditions have not been 
available, can be postponed. As far as the judgment of timing 
is concerned, we must tackle difficult problems in reform by 
resolving contradictions at a deeper level despite various kinds 
of existing problems in the macroeconomy of our country at 
present. Also, it is the most opportune time at present for us 
to tackle difficult problems in reform. First, the 14th CPC 
National Congress set, in accordance with the spirit of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's remarks made during his trip to the south, the 
goal of reform of establishing the socialist market economy. 
This enabled us at one go to get rid of the perplexity caused 
by concepts concerning whether the market economy is "socialist" 
or "capitalist." We can now courageously promote various kinds 
of market-oriented reforms in the same direction at a deep level 
without any ideological misgivings or obstacles, and we are 
duty-bound not to turn back. Second, in the course of reform in 
the past 10 years and more, we have overcome one difficulty 
after another, have accumulated valuable experience, and have 
increased our ability to deal with complicated situations. 
Moreover, all the plans for tackling difficult problems in 
reform put forward this time have been worked out under the 
leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
as the core, following meticulous and careful investigation and 
study over a long period, pooling the wisdom of the people of 
the whole country, and using as reference the successful 
experience of the developed countries. They conform with the 
general laws of the market economy, adhere to the principle of 
proceeding from the actual national conditions of China, and 
give as much consideration as possible to the interests of 
various quarters. Therefore, a consensus on tackling difficult 
problems in reform can be reached and resistance from various 
quarters can be reduced. In addition, what is more important is 
that since the publication of the important remarks made by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his inspection tour of the south in 
1992, a new situation has been opened up in work of all aspects 
in our country, the national economy is developing vigorously, 
market supply is abundant, the people's living standard has been 
further improved, and some problems cropping up in the course of 
advance have been, or are being, effectively solved. All this 
has created favorable political conditions and a social 
environment for comprehensively promoting the tackling of 
difficult problems in reform. If we miss this rare historical 
opportunity and do not have the courage and determination to 
overcome various difficulties in the structural reform, or 
cannot properly solve various problems cropping up in 
development, we cannot maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development [chixu kuaisu jiankang fazhan] of the national 
economy, nor can we realize the second-step strategic objective 
for the national economy and social development. We may even 
land in a predicament of high inflation and low-speed economic 
fluctuation over a considerably long period in the future. 
  Regarding the choice of timing for reform, could the 
promulgation of various reformative measures promulgated this 
year have been further postponed as some comrades suggested? 
Perhaps these comrades are not aware that technically speaking, 
financial and taxation reforms and foreign exchange reforms have 
to start in a rigid and unified calendar year and accounting 
year. A delay of 10 days or half a month will actually mean a 
delay of another year. Besides, we should also be aware that at 
present, the losses in finance and taxes of the central 
authorities are very serious. The financial revenue of the 
central authorities accounts for a decreasing percentage of the 
financial revenue of the country, and the deficits are 
increasing. If the reform of the financial and taxation 
structure is not carried out right away, things will get harder 
and harder. Again, imports are increasing, exports are 
decreasing, the trade deficit is expanding, the state's foreign 
exchange income is decreasing, and the outflow of capital is 
also increasing. If the reform of the foreign exchange 
structure is not carried out right away, things will be 
difficult to cope with. Moreover, the long-standing problem of 
"being overanxious to make investment" of the traditional 
planned economy structure, the competition in speed, the rapid 
expansion in scale, and the financial expansion have become the 
cause of the macroeconomy being out of control. If reform in 
the investment structure and the financial structure is not 
carried out right away, serious inflation will lead to serious 
political problems. Therefore, if, following the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we do not make a 
prompt decision, do not quickly make use of the favorable 
opportunity, or do not take relatively big steps in deepening 
reform, our political losses will be very great. 
<H6>  II </H6>
  What, then, are the new characteristics of the moves to 
tackle difficult problems in reform this year as compared with 
various reforms carried out since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee? We think that deepening our 
understanding of, and consciously grasping, these new 
characteristics are of the utmost importance to doing a good job 
in tackling difficult problems. 
  First, as viewed from the targets of reform, there is a 
transitional period of the "coexistence of the two tracks" in 
the change from the socialist planned economy to the socialist 
market economy. This is unavoidable in the course of reform in 
our country and practice has proved that this period is 
conducive to reducing shocks and to avoiding the common setback 
of landing reform itself in a predicament resulting from the 
accumulation of various kinds of problems caused by radical 
reform. The structure in which the two tracks coexist has many 
negative effects which brook no negligence. It induces the 
marriage of administrative power with activities of the 
commodity economy, leading to chaos in functions, misplacement 
of roles, lax binding force, and uncontrollable behavior of 
various interest entities, and to numerous loopholes and a lack 
of rules in management. In the course of tackling difficult 
problems in reform, to gradually change the dual-track structure 
into the single-track structure of the market economy will 
inevitably change the pattern of set interests formed in the 
structure in which the two tracks coexist. This pattern of 
interests is also linked with some reformative measures of the 
eighties. Change in the pattern will cause conflicts of 
interests and will also cause perplexity in concepts and 
resistance in ideology. Therefore, even comrades who were 
active in the previous stage of reform also have to further 
enhance their consciousness of deepening reform, be courageous 
to make self-revolution, and actively promote on their own 
initiative the remolding of the economic structure and the 
functions of their respective departments. Otherwise, it is 
possible that they will become "half-way reformers" and lag 
behind the times. 
  Second, as viewed from the methods of reform, the reform of 
the eighties mainly developed spontaneously from bottom to top, 
and power and interests were delegated from top to bottom. In 
that stage, the main propelling force attacking the old 
structure came from the various localities and the grass-roots 
level. Various localities, various departments, and various 
units could, according to their own will, have "optional 
exercises" in reform and "grope for stepping stones to cross the 
river," giving play to their own ability. Leading departments 
mainly delegated power and interests to lower levels. As a 
result, localities and units which energetically carried out 
reform were often the first to get the benefit, while leading 
departments appeared to be "entrenching themselves at every step 
and retreating in defeat again and again." Things are different 
in the stage of tackling difficult problems in reform. Since 
many aspects of work have to be done in the establishment of the 
new structure and close coordination among them is needed, it is 
necessary for certain authoritative organs to formulate basic 
rules for coordination. At the same time, since tackling 
difficult problems in reform will unavoidably change the pattern 
of set interests, reform does not necessarily bring immediate 
interests to each unit or individual to the satisfaction of all. 
This will inevitably encounter various kinds of difficulty and 
resistance. It is necessary to organize people to make efforts 
to remove obstacles before reformative measures can be 
implemented. Also, in tackling difficult problems in reform, the 
definition of property rights, the fixing of methods for the 
management of assets, and the establishment of the new finance 
and taxation structure, the monetary structure, the foreign 
trade structure, and the investment structure can never be 
realized spontaneously from bottom to top. The entire reform 
process must be coordinated in a unified manner, organized, and 
carried out from top to bottom by firm and powerful high-level 
authoritative state organs. If we do not act in this way, but 
let things drift, each doing what he thinks is right, serious 
imbalance will occur, the cost of reform will undoubtedly 
increase, the formation of a unified domestic market will be 
delayed, and the rapid growth of the entire national economy 
will be hindered. 
  Third, as far as the reform process is concerned, in the 
eighties, most of the reforms proceeded separately. Since 
people did not change their concepts all at the same time and 
had different degrees of feeling toward the old system, some 
localities were very enthusiastic for reform, and they took the 
initiative in implementing reform, even "at their own expense"; 
but some localities acted slowly without much enthusiasm. For 
example, in the early days of rural reform, the contract 
responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration 
linked to output was implemented and the people's commune system 
was abolished. At first, only one out of three provinces 
fulfilled the tasks; in the second year, the number increased to 
two-thirds; and it was only in the third year that almost all 
provinces followed suit. At that time, the principle of the 
central authorities was that "people are allowed to act as 
bystanders," there would "not be any coercion or campaign," 
"people could do it as long as they were willing," and they 
could "do it as much as they liked," while those who were still 
not convinced and who failed to catch up with others could wait. 
On the other hand, at a stage in which reform is implemented at 
full speed, we must achieve overall progress, take joint action, 
and make breakthroughs in key areas. It is necessary to 
coordinate the time of introducing reform measures which have a 
bearing on the overall situation of macroeconomic regulation and 
to integrate every action and step. For example, in 
implementing the taxation reform and unifying exchange rates, it 
is as if athletes must take heed of the sound of the judge's 
starting gun before they can run at full speed. It is absolutely 
out of the question for one to implement reform while another 
does not follow suit. Similarly, people cannot do it when they 
are ready but stop when they are no longer willing to do so. 
There is even less room for any wait-and-see attitude. Hence, 
at the stage of implementing reform at full speed, we must 
establish a new system, be subordinate to the guidance of the 
central authorities, maintain the authority of the party Central 
Committee and of the State Council, bear the overall situation 
in mind, reach a common understanding, and act in unison. 
  Fourth, as far as reform guidance is concerned, in the 
eighties, the main form of reform guidance was delivered through 
policy implementation. For example, in implementing rural 
reform, the central authorities issued a No. 1 document every 
year, and the peasants, who spoke of "policies making people 
rich" and "policies taking the reign," were always concerned 
about "whether there were policy changes," whereas cadres at the 
grass-roots level were quite concerned about the "money content 
of policies" and wished to constantly receive "preferential 
policies" from decisionmaking bodies. But at the stage in which 
reform is implemented at full speed, the form of reform guidance 
has already shifted, and will be more frequently shifted, from 
policy implementation to implementation of laws. This is 
because a socialist economy is virtually a kind of legal 
economy. To establish and perfect the socialist market economic 
system, it is necessary to have a complete legal system to 
standardize and protect it, and, as far as reform guidance is 
concerned, reform policy decisions are required to closely link 
up with legislative policy decisions so as to use laws to guide 
and give an impetus to reform as well as ensure its smooth 
implementation. For example, when the taxation reform program 
was introduced on 1 January 1994, the "PRC Personal Income Tax 
Law," which was amended by the National People's Congress," and 
regulations promulgated by the State Council for interim 
implementation, including those on value-added tax, consumption 
tax, sales tax, and enterprise gains tax, were simultaneously 
introduced (that is, "one law and six regulations"). Before the 
full implementation of the reform of establishing an enterprise 
mechanism for a modern enterprise system, the state has already 
promulgated in advance the "Company Law," the "Stock Law," and 
so on. In order to adjust to the law-propelled form of reform 
guidance at the stage in which reform is implemented at full 
speed, we must, on the one hand, urge legislative organs to pay 
close attention to drawing up laws on standardizing the main 
body of the market, maintaining the market order, enhancing 
macroscopic regulation, perfecting social security, opening up 
wider to the outside world, and so on, and we must revise and 
annul laws and regulations inconsistent with the establishment 
of the new system in a timely manner. On the other hand, we 
must make efforts to constantly improve the legal awareness and 
concepts of the whole society and to urge cadres at all levels 
to learn how to apply legal means to guiding reform and managing 
the economy. 
<H6>  III </H6>
  All of us will certainly reach a common understanding after 
clearly identifying the difficulties, necessity, and 
characteristics of the full implementation of reform this year. 
That is, to achieve success in reform this year, the key lies 
in making concerted efforts and helping each other. "Tai Shan 
will move and the battle will be easy if people are of one 
mind." The party Central Committee and the State Council have 
repeatedly stressed that the "leadership and the rank and file 
should be of one mind in order to score a victory" in reform. 
As far as the current situation is concerned, the unity between 
the "leadership and the rank and file" should be embodied in the 
following three aspects: 
  First, we must make really concerted efforts to get a 
clear understanding of the overall situation and to be 
subordinate to and serve it. The party Central Committee has 
repeatedly stressed that the overall situation of party work 
this year is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up 
wider, promote development, and maintain stability [zhuazhu 
jiyu, shenhua gaige, kuoda kaifang, cujin fazhan, baochi 
wending]. The essence of the overall situation is precisely to 
uphold the principle of "using reform to promote development" 
and to "treat reform as the theme." Leading cadres at all 
levels must have a sense of urgency, of responsibility, of 
crisis, and of worry when seizing the opportunity to deepen 
reform and take the initiative to devote more energies to 
reform, and must center on the major orientation and train of 
thought set by the central authorities with rapt attention. 
Never can we consider that "reform is a matter for the central 
authorities, whereas development is our own business" and be 
merely keen on development rather than on reform. In 
implementing reform, we must throw away "our small abacus," "not 
get up to any little tricks," and oppose all sorts of fraud. 
These kinds of behavior run counter to the principle of 
achieving unity between the leadership and the rank and file. 
We must draw inferences about other cases from one instance and 
check erroneous ideas at the outset. We must sternly criticize 
and correct negative phenomena in the process of deepening 
reform. 
  Second, we must make really concerted efforts to create a 
relatively relaxed and more favorable economic environment for 
reform. Since reform is gaining momentum and we have a heavy 
task to implement it in 1994, the economic environment cannot, 
under any circumstances, be controlled too tightly. There must 
be some leeway in making plans and arrangements for the pace of 
economic growth. In this connection, we must be determined to 
control the scale of fixed-asset investment, insist on matching 
the scale of construction with our national strength, and 
prevent the "three breakthroughs" in setting higher targets for 
growth rate, planned fixed-asset investment, and price rise rate 
from triggering off overheated economic development and 
aggravating inflation again. Comrade Deng Xiaoping explicitly 
said: "One of our experiences is to see emerging problems when 
development is smooth, and development should be moderate 
because an overheated economy will easily cause trouble." This 
is the wise remark of an experienced person as well as a note of 
caution. Leading comrades at all levels must stay sober-minded, 
be unconditionally subordinate to policy decisions of 
macroscopic regulation made by the central authorities, 
resolutely refrain from thinking negatively, make arduous 
efforts to keep total supply and demand basically in balance, 
take practical measures to check inflation, and guard against 
economic fluctuation. As far as the pace of development is 
concerned, various localities must proceed from their real 
conditions and never vie with each other. 
  Third, we must make really concerted efforts to uphold the 
principle of doing two types of work simultaneously, maintain 
social and political stability, and strengthen the building of 
socialist ethical progress. Upholding the principle of doing 
two types of work simultaneously and maintaining social and 
political stability is the political guarantee for our smooth 
reform, opening up, and modernization, and for our endeavor to 
accomplish economic development. It is also an important 
component of the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Without a stable social and political 
environment, we cannot succeed in reform and construction. 
Likewise, only when we insist on reform and development can 
stability be basically maintained. We are now promoting 
economic restructuring amid the high-speed operation of our 
national economy, and we must also maintain the growth of our 
national economy in a fast and good manner in the process of 
accelerating system transformation. In this connection, we are 
required much more to pay attention to maintaining a stable 
social and political environment. Leaders at all levels must 
treat the work of maintaining social stability as their own 
task, be good at taking heed of public feeling, lay stress on 
redressing grievances, promptly settle conflicts, guarantee 
safety and peace, and make sure that the general mood of society 
and the atmosphere of the press is good. We must carry forward 
our party's fine tradition of caring for the masses in every 
respect, of relying on the masses under all circumstances, and 
of always thinking of the interests of the masses. We must 
attach high importance to every concrete matter which is closely 
related to the wellbeing of the masses, such as the "shopping 
basket" and the "rice bag [mi dai zi 4717 5915 1311]" projects, 
and we should never blindly seek speed of growth at the expense 
of the wellbeing of the masses. 
  Various key measures for the full implementation of reform 
have been introduced for more than two months, the overall 
situation is good without giving rise to any outstanding 
problem. At present, the market, society, and popular feeling 
are stable, which strengthens our resolve to fully implement 
reform to the end. "We must deal with the most difficult things 
if we want to pave the way to a bright future." We believe that 
if we succeed in the difficult task of deepening reform at full 
speed, it is certain that our country will enjoy perpetual 
political stability and make great strides forward in economic 
construction. Let us be of one mind and make concerted efforts 
to march forward in the flush of victory!

  [Text] A new publication by exiled Chinese dissident Han 
Dongfang is on its way to factories across the mainland after 
being smuggled into Beijing last week. 
  Mr. Han, who left for the United States on Thursday, said he 
finished the first edition of the China Labour Bulletin last 
weekend. A "contact" was to take the first 1,000 copies to the 
Chinese capital. From Beijing, the magazine would be 
distributed to a network of workers throughout the mainland. 
Another 1,000 copies in English would be sent to the 155 
members of the International Federation of Free Trade Unions. 
  "We hope workers who see the magazine will learn what is 
happening in the China labour movement," Mr. Han said. "We also 
want the workers to think of themselves and the harsh conditions 
they are working under." 
  The China Labour Bulletin is funded by the Hong Kong 
Christian Council and its Christian Industrial Committee. 
Legislator Lau Chin-shek, director of the committee, hired Mr. 
Han to edit the bulletin last month. Initially, Mr. Han expects 
to produce one edition each month. Eventually he hopes the 
magazine will go bi-monthly. 
  Mr. Han said future editions would tell workers "how to 
agitate for their rights". He said several dissidents in China 
had also agreed to submit articles.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Xiao Rong, daughter of Deng </F>
Xiaoping, by an unidentified CCTV reporter at the Great Hall of 
the People on 14 March; from the "News" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] This morning, a reporter of this network 
interviewed National People's Congress [NPC] Deputy Xiao Rong. 
[video shows close-ups of a male reporter holding a mike asking 
Deng Xiaoping's daughter Xiao Rong, alias Deng Rong, in the 
hallway in the Great Hall of the People. Caption on the screen 
reads: "Xiao Rong says: Deng Xiaoping is concerned with the 
`two meetings,'" referring to the Second Session of the Eighth 
NPC and the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of

  [Reporter] How are you, Comrade Xiao Rong. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping is also an Eighth NPC deputy. Is he very concerned 
with the session? 
  [Xiao Rong] He is an Eighth NPC deputy. Because of age, he 
did not come to attend the meeting. But he has always been 
concerned with the session. Like all other deputies and people 
in the country, he is very much concerned with this meeting and 
its proceedings. He reads newspapers every day about the 
meeting. 
  [Reporter] How is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health? 
  [Xiao Rong, smiling] He is very healthy [ta xianzai shenti 
hen hao]. Of course, he is not as healthy as two years [buru 
qianliangnian] ago because of age; but for a 90-year-old man, 
his health should be considered as very good. Thank you. [Xiao

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Practical Government Work Report"] </F>
  [Text] It was generally agreed that Premier Li Peng's 
government work report to the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC] was a practical report. 
  The government work report mentioned that this year's plan 
fixed the growth rate of the gross domestic product at 9 
percent. This was a realistic, positive, and feasible 
arrangement. It seems that the 9 percent growth rate is 
somewhat lower than the 13 percent growth rate in the previous 
two years, but it will remain a rather high growth rate in the 
process of China's economic development and a rarely-seen high 
growth rate as compared with Hong Kong, Taiwan, and some 
Southeast Asian countries and regions where the economic growth 
rates were high in world terms. If China can continue to 
maintain its economic growth rate around 8-9 percent for a 
number of years, it will be able to realize its second-step 
strategic objective of quadrupling its GNP three years ahead of 
the schedule, and this will be a remarkable achievement. 
  Through the practice of reform, opening, and modernization 
over many years, more and more people have come to accept this 
point of view: China is facing a rare historical opportunity, 
which must be used to accelerate China's economic development; 
but development must follow a new course and must not follow the 
old course of unrealistically seeking a high growth rate of 
output value and expanding the size of investment. 
  The government work report stressed: "All localities should 
proceed from their own conditions when deciding a reasonable 
development speed, and should not compare themselves with each 
other in an improper way and unrealistically seek higher output 
value." This guided all quarters in society to make solid 
efforts rather than doing something ineffective; to consistently 
focus efforts on achieving good economic results and seeking a 
solidly high growth rate rather than unrealistically creating 
some exaggerated statistics. 
  In China, the development of the national economy is 
determined by two key factors: One is the vast countryside in 
which the overwhelming majority of the population is living; and 
the other is the more than 10,000 large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises which form the backbone of the national 
economy. Successfully invigorating and developing these two 
economic sectors is of decisive significance for ensuring the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy. 
  Therefore, Premier Li Peng stressed in his report the need 
to 
adopt various measures for strengthening the position of 
agriculture and resolving prominent contradictions and problems 
in the rural areas. He said that it is necessary to make the 
rural economy prosper by every possible means, to increase 
peasant income, and especially to help the 80 million people in 
poor areas to obtain sufficient food and clothing within the 
last seven years of this century. The government work report 
also pointed out the need to improve production and management 
in the manufacturing and transport industries, especially in 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. All local 
governments and all departments should give priority to the work 
of improving large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in 
their work schedules, and should adopt measures to create a 
benign external environment for these enterprises and help them 
stop losses and increase profits in their business operation. 
  The government work report realistically analyzed the 
prominent contradictions and difficulties in this year's work, 
and put forward pertinent countermeasures. Among other 
problems, the excessive size of investment in fixed assets is 
the toughest problem which causes great risks. The government 
has paid serious attention to this problem, and demanded that 
the size of investment this year be kept from further expanding. 
Even in the fields of basic industries and infrastructural 
construction, investment should also be made according to the 
actual capability. Financial and material resources should 
first be used to meet the needs of key projects in the fields of 
transportation, telecommunications, and major raw material 
production as well as projects for harnessing major rivers. 
Coastal areas are encouraged to make investment in the central 
and western regions of the country. This year, the government 
will not approve establishment of any new development zones, and 
new capital construction projects will not be started if funds 
are not guaranteed. The practice of using working funds for the 
purpose of capital investment will be banned. At the same time, 
through the in-depth reform of the investment structure, 
mechanisms for regulating and controlling investment will be 
established, and macro-control over investment will be improved. 
This will reduce blindness in investment and will curb 
investment swelling. 
  Strengthening agriculture, improving operation of the large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, resolving 
contradictions, and overcoming difficulties will all rely on 
reform. Reform is the key link and is also the motive force. 
Without carrying out reform or without taking substantial 
reform steps, China may just lose the opportunity and fail to 
effect further development. Therefore, it is certain that this 
year will be a reform year in China. The government work report 
mentioned the contents, steps, and noticeable points of 
financial and taxation reform, banking reform, the reform of the 
state-owned enterprises, price reform, and institutional reform. 
The reform measures will profoundly touch a wide scope of 
vested interests, and their implementation will encounter great 
difficulties and will also have a profound impact. The Chinese 
Government is determined to lead the people throughout the 
country to make breakthroughs in key points and to make advances 
across the board by overcoming one difficulty after another. 
  Because of the reforms are being carried out intensively 
against great difficulties, all localities throughout the 
country are required to create a benign condition, which is 
social stability. Without stability, it is impossible to carry 
out any reform measures no matter how good they are. At 
present, law and order in some localities is not good, and 
corruption exists among a small number of government personnel. 
These are unstable factors, which must be effectively overcome 
according to the government work report's requirement for 
preventing corruption and taking comprehensive measures for 
maintaining law and order. Reform is conditioned by stability, 
and stability should also be promoted by reform. The two things 
complement each other, and cannot be separated from one another.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Cao Zhi (2580 2535)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, chairman 
of the Central Military Commission, recently signed a decree to 
promulgate the "Afforestation Regulations of the Chinese 
People's Liberation Army [PLA]." The "Regulations" have 
specific provisions on military afforestation undertakings and 
management, on the protection and use of forest resources, and 
on awards and penalties in related work. 
  The "Regulations" stipulated that the PLA Afforestation 
Committee leads all military afforestation work. Afforestation 
committees (leading afforestation groups) at and above 
regimental level will lead afforestation work in their own units 
or systems. The basic tasks in military afforestation work are 
to plant trees, plants, and flowers on military land and in 
surrounding garrison areas; to afforest uninhabited hills, 
wasteland, and barren beaches in an effort to turn military 
camps and bases into parks; and to protect, develop, and use 
forest resources so as to serve army building and the national 
economic construction. The military afforestation drive aims at 
integrating military, ecological, social, and economic benefits. 
The "Regulations" imposed new afforestation requirements on 
military camps and bases: Military units garrisoned in urban 
areas must afforest an area no less than 25 percent of the total 
area of their military camps or bases; military units garrisoned 
in suburban and rural areas must afforest an area no less than 
30 percent of the total area of their military camps or bases. 
The "Regulations" stipulated that the survival rate of military 
afforestation undertakings should be 5 percent higher than that 
of local afforestation endeavors. 
  At an interview with the correspondent, a person in charge 
of 
the PLA Afforestation Committee pointed out: The "Regulations" 
were formulated in accordance with the "Forest Law of the 
People's Republic of China" and the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee's "Decision on Nationwide Compulsory 
Tree-Planting Campaign," and after we summarized experiences of 
the army's afforestation work for more than 10 years. The 
"Regulations" are an integral procedure for governing the army 
according to law. The formulation and implementation of the 
"Regulations" indicate the Chinese Army's afforestation work is 
governed by the legal system and will definitely further enhance 
healthy progress in such work.

<F P=106> ["State Affairs From a Businessman's Point of View" column </F>
by Chang Li (1728 4539): "Chen Yun To Make Inspection Tour of 
Shenzhen"] 
  [Text] Hearsay has it that Chen Yun will make an 
inspection tour of Shenzhen in April or May. Chen told people 
around him that his legs are all right and he can walk now, so 
he would like to visit Shenzhen to have a look. 
  Chen Yun has been in very bad health over the past few 
years, 
and many people believed that he would not last long. It is 
really surprising that this old man has been getting stronger, 
and his health has been improving although he is getting older 
in age. This is really exceptional for a man over 80. 
  Chen Yun has never visited Shenzhen. There has been some 
speculation that he disagreed with the idea of running special 
economic zones. If the hearsay about his visit is true, then 
his Shenzhen tour should be a gesture to show his support for 
Shenzhen's efforts in building the special economic zone. 
  Chen Yun is a Shanghai native. When he was young he was a 
typesetter at the Shanghai Commercial Press. Speaking with a 
heavy Shanghai accent, Chen Yun is regarded as the CPC's chief 
financial and economic expert. He used to be ranked fifth among 
other leaders within the CPC. Before the Cultural Revolution, 
CPC leaders were ranked in this order in terms of their 
standing: Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Chen 
Yun. Lin Biao and Deng Xiaoping were only ranked immediately 
after them. In the CPC political arena, where seniority is a 
great asset, Chen Yun enjoys very high prestige, and that is why 
Deng Xiaoping has to give much consideration to Chen's opinions. 
  Given the present political climate in China, if Deng died 
it 
would be almost certain that Chen would take his place. 
  Therefore, attention should be paid to Chen's move.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Various factions and leaders in the Chinese 
Communist Party are using the prestige and quotations of 
patriarch Deng Xiaoping to bolster their positions. Chinese 
sources said as the health of the senior leader deteriorated, 
contenders for power in the post-Deng China were trying to 
accumulate political capital by claiming to have his blessings. 
The sources said Mr. Deng was no longer fit to pay close 
attention to national policy. 
  Before delivering his Government Work Report to the National 
People's Congress yesterday, however, Premier Li Peng hinted 
that his report had lived up to the expectations of the 
89-year-old patriarch. "Comrade Deng has all along provided 
guidance to the report," Mr. Li reportedly told the legislators. 
"He has shown concern for the fact that the contents of the 
report should highlight the themes of reform, development and 
stability and that it (the report) must be practical." 
  Analysts said, however, that Mr. Li's report had omitted the 
bulk of the remarks that Mr. Deng had made in Shanghai before 
Lunar New Year about "fast-paced reform and development". They 
said the premier had invoked Mr. Deng's name solely to boost his 
own authority. 
  Informed sources said members of the Deng family had agreed 
to use Mr. Deng's name and authority to buttress the power base 
of the patriarch's proteges. 
  For example, while touring Japan earlier this week, Deng 
Rong, Mr. Deng's daughter and private secretary, told 
journalists that the senior leader had entrusted major national 
affairs to President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li and Executive Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji. 
  This is despite the fact that on private occasions, Mr. Deng 
had expressed reservations about the commitment of Mr. Jiang and 
Mr. Li to his reforms. 
  At the same time, members of the Chinese Communist Party's 
conservative faction have revived those of Mr. Deng's old 
speeches that advocate iron-clad control in the ideology and 
media fields. In a recent speech on stopping the "infiltration 
of corrupt ideas and culture from outside of China", the 
Minister of Radio, Film and Television, Ai Zhisheng, quoted a 
maxim of Mr. Deng on fighting "bourgeois liberalisation". 
  In a dispatch last night, the semi-official Hong Kong China 
News Service [press agency name as published] quoted Mr. Ai as 
citing this Deng dictum: "While resolutely implementing the 
open door policy, we must be cool-headed and insist on 
sabotaging the infiltration of decadent ideas from abroad. We 
must never allow the inundation of a bourgeois-liberal lifestyle 
in our country." In their public speeches, however, 
conservatives like Mr. Ai have omitted Mr. Deng's more liberal 
views on ideology and propaganda. 
  Western diplomats said as Mr. Deng's health deteriorated, 
there was a possibility he would be "controlled" by family 
members and confidants who were in a position to attribute 
policies and instructions to the patriarch.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- More than 18 million 
Muslims of various nationalities in China celebrated their 
annual Bairam Festival today, marking the end of Ramadan. 
  On the Islamic calendar, Ramadan -- the month of fasting -- 
ran from February 12 to March 14 this year. 
  The traditional Bairam Festival, the ending of the fast, is 
celebrated every year by ten of China's Islamic minority 
nationalities -- the Hui, Uygur, Kazak, Uzbek, Kirgiz, Tajik, 
Tatar, Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar. 
  The Chinese Government provides that all Muslims can have a 
day off today. 
  In Beijing, more than 10,000 Muslims went to 65 mosques in 
the city to pray and celebrate the festival. About 210,000 
Muslims are living in Beijing. 
  This morning, some 1,600 Muslims gathered at the Niujie 
Mosque, the biggest one in Beijing, for prayers. Reciters from 
Iran recited with consent of the mosque's imam. 
  More than 300 representatives of minority nationalities 
attended a party this afternoon sponsored by the Beijing 
Fellowship of Ethnic Nationalities, together with some 50 
deputies attending the on-going National People's Congress and 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 
Beijing. 
  Also at the party were leaders from the National People's 
Congress, the State Nationalities Affairs Committee, the Islamic 
Association of China, and Beijing Municipal Government. 
  Muslims in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, 
which is called China's "Islamic Region," under the arrangement 
of local governments, also hold various events today to 
celebrate the festival. 
  There are some 1.6 million Muslims in the region.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese people, 
riding the crest of the country's sustained economic growth 
during its 15- year reform drive, witnessed big increases in 
their income in 1993. 
  Last year, the per capita income of urban residents averaged 
2,337 yuan, up 10.2 percent from 1992 and 7.4 times the figure 
for 1978. Average income for rural residents registered a 
589.37 percent increase compared with 1978. 
  The country also saw bumper harvests in farming, 
stock-raising and fisheries, resulting in rich supplies on the 
country's over 80,000 free markets. 
  Thanks to fast industrial development, especially in the 
light industry, a growing number of high-quality daily 
necessities has entered Chinese people's homes. 
  By the end of 1993, there were 87.25 washing machines, 58.06 
refrigerators, 80.71 color televisions, 81.62 stereo recorders, 
26.31 cameras and 11.36 video recorders per one hundred urban 
households. Bicycles, sewing machines and watches were popular 
in the countryside. Modern electronic appliances like 
televisions and cameras also made their way into country homes. 
  Statistics show that the country grossed a record 1,223.7 
billion yuan in the sales volume of consumer goods last year, 
increasing by 31.2 percent and 19.5 percent in cities and rural 
areas, respectively. 
  Living conditions also saw a considerable improvement in 
1993, with a historic high of 266 million sq.m. In newly-built 
residences cropping up in urban areas. The per capita living 
space for urban and rural inhabitants jumped to 20 sq.m. and 7 
sq.m. respectively, compared with 1978's 8.1 sq.m. and 3.6 sq.m. 
  There were over 1,400 billion yuan on Chinese people's 
deposit books last year, 70-fold the figure of 1978. 
  And life spans have become longer than before, with over 100 
million elderly above the age of 60 in the country.

  [Text] Britain is willing to pump more money into the Chek 
Lap Kok airport and its associated railway to cut borrowings to 
$5 billion in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on 
the new airport projects. 
  But Britain wants the 62 hectares of land along the airport 
railway to be granted in one go, without going through the 
annual Sino-British Land Commission talks. 
  In its latest financing package, which is still being 
studied 
by the Chinese side, Britain boosted the government injection to 
$60 billion, cutting the debts to be borne by the future Airport 
Corporation and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation to $23 
billion. 
  But the Chinese side insists Britain abides by a stipulation 
in the Memorandum of Understanding that any debts above $5 
billion must be agreed to by China. 
  A source close to the British side said the Government was 
willing to increase the cash injection into the airport projects 
as they were a good investment. 
  But Britain would stand firm on the view that the Chinese 
should approve granting the 62 hectares of land along the 
airport railway in one go, on top of the 50 hectares of land 
disposed of annually. 
  "We must be ensured that this land is available to us 
without 
further strings attached," said the source. 
  Regarding China's demand to set up a monitoring group to 
control costs of the airport projects, the source said the 
Government would not concede this point. 
  Instead, it would rather allow the Director of Audit to 
audit 
the financial accounts of the future airport body, he said.

  [Text] A lengthy spell in the briny was not enough to 
wash away the mark of the world's most notorious opium lord from 
the biggest heroin haul seized by Hong Kong police in two years. 
The "Double Uoglobe Brand" label stamped on 96 blocks of 
high-grade heroin, weighing 67 kilograms and worth more than 
$50m, is the trademark of Khun Sa, the shadowy king of the 
Golden Triangle. Narcotics Bureau police used grappling hooks to 
drag the drugs from the seabed south of Lamma Island on Friday, 
after a tip-off led to a search of the area. 
  "This was a very big seizure so it was not surprising that 
it 
was Khun Sa's stuff," a police source said yesterday. "He is 
the number one man in the Golden Triangle and authorities have 
been after him for years. Khun Sa is believed to have a number 
of hideouts and factories on the Burmese side of the Thai 
border. He flits in and out of the Golden Triangle but no one 
seems able to catch him." 
  Khun Sa, which means "Prosperous Prince" in Burma's Shan 
dialect, ships his heroin through Thailand and is known to use a 
road built by the Thais to the remote border town of Homong, 
where he is believed to have a base complete with international 
telephone dialling, satellite television and soldiers armed with 
the latest in weapons. 
  Hong Kong police are still on the trail of the syndicate 
which dumped the drugs at sea -- a ploy used to minimise the 
risk of the entire shipment being seized on reaching the 
territory -- and have predicted a "long-term" investigation. 
The heroin is believed to have drifted along the sea floor and 
out of reach of the traffickers. The wrapping had begun to 
deteriorate, although the drugs were not damaged. 
  In another operation on Sunday night, police seized 13 
kilograms of high-grade heroin, worth about $8m, in Ngau Tau 
Kok. Acting on information from the Narcotics Bureau, officers 
of the Kowloon East regional special duties squad staged a raid 
on a flat in Amoy Garden and arrested two men after finding the 
heroin and packaging equipment. The men were still being 
questioned last night.

<F P=106> ["Short Commentary" by Ru Nan (3067 2809): "Britain Cannot </F>
Possibly Realize Its Attempt To Extend Its Influence in Hong 
Kong"] 
  [Text] After a fierce debate lasting nine hours, the 
British Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] passed, in the 
early morning of 24 February, the partial bill on the 
arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong tabled by 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten. This action by the British Hong 
Kong authorities reflects that the British side is determined to 
move along the road of confrontation with the Chinese side on 
the issue of Hong Kong. Moreover, it has moved even further 
down this path and has become even more bogged down. 
  In May and June last year, as the representatives of the 
Chinese and British Governments were holding talks on the 
arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong, the British 
Hong Kong authorities continuously took unilateral actions, such 
as approving the "Draft Regulations on the Boundary and Election 
Committees" and supporting the Legco constitutional panel in 
discussing the gazetted bill comprising the Patten package in 
order to pursue the practice of "discussing while talking," 
which had been rejected by the Chinese side. Furthermore, 
despite the strong opposition of district board members, they 
merged into one the two district boards of Yaotsim and Mongkok. 
While the British Hong Kong authorities were interfering with 
the talks, the people raised a question: Why have the British 
Hong Kong authorities repeatedly placed obstacles before the 
Sino-British talks? 
  Real intentions are revealed in the end, and the development 
of the situation has provided a definite answer to this 
question. Specifically, the British side has no sincerity toward 
the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994-95 
elections in Hong Kong and has no wish whatsoever to reach an 
agreement. 
  Formerly, the two sides agreed through consultations that 
the 
representatives of the two governments would hold talks in 
accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
principle of converging with the Basic Law, and the relevant 
agreements and understandings reached between the two sides. 
Even from the White Paper on the "Representative Development in 
Hong Kong" published by the British Government, however, we can 
also see that the British side -- apart from admitting that 
there was identical views between China and Britain on the need 
to have 18 directly elected seats in the 1991 Legco elections -- 
"there was no agreement whatsoever" on the electoral 
arrangements for 1995. This ran counter to the agreements and 
understandings reached through the seven letters exchanged 
between the two foreign ministers in early 1990. The British 
side has agreed in word that the talks between the two sides 
should conform with the aforesaid "three principles." In fact, 
however, they have acted otherwise, thus depriving the talks of 
their basis. 
  In rounds 15, 16, and 17 of the Sino-British talks, in an 
effort to speed up the process, the Chinese side made tremendous 
efforts to quickly solve the less difficult issues of the 
district board and municipal council elections in line with the 
principle of "solving the less contentious issues first." Just 
as the differences between the two sides on this issue were 
narrowing and the talks entered the stage of discussing the 
clauses for an agreement, the British side deliberately found a 
pretext to leave the negotiating table first. They also tabled a 
partial political system package at Legco for discussion, which 
led to the termination of the talks. In spite of this, the 
Chinese side continued to repeat: As long as the British side 
withdraws the partial package that has been tabled at Legco, the 
Chinese side will continue to hope to resume talks on the 
1994/95 electoral arrangements and reach agreement on this 
issue. The British side willfully took a series of actions, 
however, such as approving the partial political system bill at 
Legco, making a unilateral decision on publishing the substance 
of the Sino-British talks, and deciding to table the rest of the 
Patten bill at Legco. Thus, it has shut the door to the 
resumption of the talks. Consequently, the responsibility of 
disrupting the talks lies squarely with the British side. 
  Why has the British side stubbornly persisted in 
contravening 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of converging 
with the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and 
understandings reached between the two sides? It is by no means 
in order to have an electoral arrangement that is "open, fair, 
and acceptable to the Hong Kong people," as advertised by the 
British side. The true objective of the British side is to take 
advantage of the remaining time of its administration in Hong 
Kong to make some electoral arrangements favorable to the 
British side so as to extend British political influence in Hong 
Kong beyond 1997. 
  Britain's attempt will certainly come to naught. In his 
statement on the passage of Patten's partial political system 
bill by the British Hong Kong Legco, a spokesman for the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office put it very 
clearly: It is stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration 
and the Basic Law that Britain's administration over Hong Kong 
will terminate on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will 
resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 
1997. In line with this provision, the last district boards, 
municipal councils, and Legco, as component parts of the Hong 
Kong political structure of the British administration, will 
terminate with the end of the British administration. As of 1 
July 1997, the political structure of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region will be set up in accordance with the 
decisions of the National People's Congress and the relevant 
stipulations of the Basic Law. 
  The historical trend of China's reunification is 
irresistible 
and the principle of "one country, two systems" will certainly 
be implemented in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, the "pearl of the 
Orient," will become even more resplendent after 1997.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Dahong (2621 1129 1347): "How Long Can the </F>
`Last Hong Kong Governor' `Hold Out'?"] 
  [Text] The "last Hong Kong Governor" Patten published an 
article entitled "Braving the North Wind" [carried by THE 
SPECTATOR], which implies that he will resist China to the end 
on the Hong Kong issue. 
  However, people must ask how long can Patten "hold out"? In 
fact, it is not difficult at all to answer this question. As 
long as we look at how many cards he has, the answer is all too 
obvious. 
  Let us look at his "homeland card." When Patten came to Hong 
Kong, the first thing he did was to show this "trump card." At 
that time, with almost "unanimous" support in domestic political 
circles and the British press, Patten was in high spirits and 
vigorous and made a showy display of his abilities. However, he 
never thought of the "fire in the back yard" which is now 
occurring, and he has even stopped boasting about "full support 
in London." On 8 December 1993, Percy Cradock, a former foreign 
affairs adviser to the British prime minister and a former 
ambassador to Beijing, and two other former ambassadors to 
Beijing--Alan Donald and Richard Evans--were present at a public 
hearing on Sino-British relations held by the British Foreign 
Affairs Committee. They criticized Patten's political reform 
package as a policy of "self-destruction" and called on the 
British Government to immediately stop the "rash and risky 
policy of unilaterally implementing political reform in Hong 
Kong." At a Conservative Party meeting held in the middle of 
January, former Prime Minister Heath blamed Patten for causing 
unnecessary damage to Sino-British relations." Early this year, 
former Labor prime minister James Callaghan and former foreign 
secretary Geoffrey Howe also objected on many occasions to 
Britain's threatening and antagonistic attitude in handling the 
Hong Kong issue. On the other hand, Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA 
MORNING POST reported that when the House of Lords debated the 
Hong Kong issue not long ago, "only one person said he supported 
Patten," while in the House of Commons, "many people voiced 
their disapproval of the consequences brought about by Patten's 
policy." Meanwhile, there are divergent views within the 
British Government. The FINANCIAL TIMES published an article 
last December on the failed Sino-British talks. The article 
quoted high-ranking officials, who said that to everyone's 
surprise, Patten did not take heed of the fact that in 1990 the 
Chinese foreign minister and his British counterpart had 
discussed and reached agreement on Hong Kong's 1994/95 elections 
when he drafted his political reform package. The article also 
revealed that following the 15th round of talks, the British 
side had drafted a memorandum of understanding in accordance 
with the Chinese side's suggestions, but Patten had insisted on 
adding a clause that a single-seat, single-vote system would 
also be applied to the Legislative Council [Legco] elections, 
thus sabotaging the Sino-British talks. 
  The British press criticized Patten in a more candid way. On 
20 December 1993, THE SUN published an editorial entitled 
"Patten--the Most Cynical and Impudent Swindler." The editorial 
blamed Patten for wrecking Anglo-Chinese relations due to his 
hypocritical preaching of democracy in Hong Kong, which 
consequently made it difficult for large firms such as British 
Aerospace and Rolls-Royce to win contracts in China. The 
editorial held that what Patten had done was for his own 
personal honor. Before taking up the governorship of Hong Kong, 
Patten lost an election in his Bath constituency, and this 
result even cheered his Conservative Party colleagues. Hence, 
after taking up the governorship of Hong Kong, he has to try 
every possible means to rehabilitate himself and his political 
career. The editorial pointed out incisively that it was 
"really stupid" for Britain, which had never held any democratic 
elections in Hong Kong during its 150-years rule, and to 
antagonize China with less than four years to go before turning 
over ruling authority was "really stupid." "The price is too 
heavy if Hong Kong is sacrificed for Patten's personal 
ambitions." THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH also published a commentary 
which pointed out: "For those British businessmen who want to 
get into the China market, they do not understand why the 
Westminster model of democracy has to be introduced at a time 
when Hong Kong will revert to China three and a half years 
later. Hong Kong Governor Patten is engaging in a political 
gamble, but Britain has to pay a price in employment 
opportunities and investment prospects." 
  It is even more obvious that British business circles, which 
always set great store by business interests, are dissatisfied 
with Patten. Early this year, several British newspapers 
successively reported that since the British Government had 
implemented its antagonistic policies toward China, a 
considerable number of British-invested financial groups had 
found that their London background had become a "burden" in 
China trade. Some British firms which are eager to get into the 
China market would rather do business with Beijing through their 
overseas subsidiaries for fear that their London background will 
spoil everything. Hong Kong's MING PAO reported on 29 January 
that Carter, president of Britain's Birmingham Chamber of 
Commerce, had told British Foreign Secretary Hurd at a dinner: 
"British moves in Hong Kong will damage Anglo-Chinese trade." 
  To put it in a nutshell, the very foundation from which 
Patten received "unanimous" support in Britain has been shaken. 
  Let us look at his "international card." Patten once 
traveled far and wide to make Hong Kong an international issue 
so that he could bully people on the strength of his 
connections. However, he has been disappointed with the response 
of the international community so far. Former Prime Minister of 
Singapore Lee Kuan Yew has publicly exposed, on many occasions, 
the British Government's and Patten's political aims and has 
criticized Britain's antagonistic policy towards China. After 
that, former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser wrote an 
article in THE AUSTRALIAN for the third time not long ago to 
attack Patten. Fraser said that the fact that Patten was trying 
so resolutely to build up "democracy" in Hong Kong at a time 
when British colonial rule was about to end could only be 
interpreted as "mischief and stirring up chaos," which is "a 
kind of wanton behavior." He urged the Australian Government to 
advise "Britain to suspend and for Patten to withdraw this rash 
and misleading policy." On 6 January, (Chan Chek-yu), head of 
the Bureau of Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Canadian Foreign 
Ministry and who was visiting Hong Kong and China, publicly 
denied that Canada had expressed support for Patten's political 
reform package. He reaffirmed that the Canadian Government 
supported the Sino-British Joint Declaration. As reported by 
the HONGKONG STANDARD on 4 February, even the United States, 
which has a special relationship with Britain, "is not willing 
to reaffirm its support for the Hong Kong governor." 
  Playing the "public opinion card" is Patten's specialty, but 
how is Hong Kong public opinion now? Allan Rogers, foreign 
affairs spokesman of the British Labor Party, said that after 
listening to views expressed by various circles in Hong Kong, 
among those whom he came into contact with, most were primarily, 
and to a far greater extent, concerned about their own lives and 
the question of whether or not the transition of Hong Kong would 
be smooth than about reform of the political system. (Adeley), 
chairman of the Chinese Affairs Subcommittee of the British 
Parliament, did not even mince his words. He said that Patten 
had not consulted Legco and the people of Hong Kong at all 
before he did anything in Hong Kong, so how could there be 
"public opinion"? After all, playing the "public opinion card" 
to portray an image of "keeping in close touch with the people" 
is the consistent work style of a politician. As indicated by 
an opinion poll at the end of January conducted by an 
independent market research company which was entrusted by MING 
PAO, there is a markedly growing number of citizens who are 
asking for Patten to be dismissed from his post. Hong Kong's 
SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST even reported on 23 January that Hong 
Kong's Liberal Party, which is "one of the most influential 
parties in Hong Kong," announced that they are "withdrawing 
their support given to Patten's package." 
  Perhaps some people praise Patten for his courage, but more 
and more people understand that this is a kind of irresponsible 
courage. Just as Craddock, former foreign affairs adviser to the 
prime minister of Britain, said: "If it is you who bears the 
consequences of your own act of heroism, your heroism is above 
reproach. But if you carry out a heroic act at the expense of 
others' interests, and particularly the interests of those who 
trust you--as we are doing in Hong Kong--it is precisely a 
different story." Patten's willful acts will inevitably 
endanger Hong Kong's prosperity and stability at present, and 
after 1997, but he will not be the one who will bear such 
consequences. He will simply go away after 30 June 1997 and the 
chaotic situation stirred up by him must be cleared up by the 
people of Hong Kong. So here is the "last Hong Kong governor" 
who always claims to think about the interests of Hong Kong 
people but who is not as good as his word. 
  Now, the British Government has been thrown into confusion. 
The UK correspondent of Hong Kong's DONGFANG RIBAO [ORIENTAL 
DAILY NEWS] reports that when Patten and senior British cabinet 
officials discussed the issue of whether or not he should table 
the remaining part of his political reform draft to Legco, they 
held divergent views and differences between them were gradually 
widening. Senior officials in the Foreign Office, including 
Foreign Secretary Hurd, have leaned towards supporting a prudent 
direction, saying that the original package must be greatly 
amended so that the "Chinese side will feel that the British 
side still strictly abides by the stipulations of the Basic Law 
and the Sino-British Joint Declaration." 
  Why has Patten, who was once smug, fallen into such a 
predicament? Apart from the fact that his unjustifiable moves 
are unpopular, another important factor is that mainland China, 
which is full of vitality, is absolutely able to maintain Hong 
Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997, is marching to the 
world with great strides, and has become a vital force in the 
international economy. Recently, such key western countries as 
the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia, and France 
have conformed to the trend of the times and have successively 
reviewed their policies towards China to strive for friendly 
cooperation with China and to get into the China market in order 
to achieve huge economic gains. However, Britain is going 
against the tide and is inevitably in an isolated and passive 
position. Patten still insists on "braving the north wind," but 
how long can he hold out?

<F P=106> ["Special commentary" by Yu Yen (0205 6056): "Playing the </F>
`International Card' Is of No Avail--Commenting on Chris 
Patten's `International Asset' Theory"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten returned to Hong 
Kong in a huff after spending his holidays and making several 
visits in Australia. In an interview with the media on the last 
day of his stay in Australia, he went so far as to say that 
Chinese officials do not understand the international status and 
importance of Hong Kong so their criticism of him does not 
conform to reality, adding that Hong Kong is an "international 
asset" as well as China's asset. 
  What is the purpose of Chris Patten's trip to Australia? 
Though he repeatedly argued in his defense that he did not go 
to Australia in search of support for his constitutional 
package, the fact he talked a great deal about his 
constitutional package and requested Australia to pass on 
"genuine democracy" to Hong Kong reveals that he visited 
Australia to seek international support for this constitutional 
package, of which the first part will be put to the vote, after 
his constitutional package had drawn sharp criticism and came in 
for questioning at the British Parliamentary Foreign Affairs 
Committee hearings. The Australian Government and public, 
however, gave him and his constitutional package the cold 
shoulder and many media units and Chinese organizations even 
severely criticized him. Only one or two government officers, 
who do not know anything about the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law, supported him verbally. When 
commenting on this, a Chinese official pointed out: While Patten 
is playing the international card, it is extremely inappropriate 
for Australian Government officials to make irresponsible 
remarks. This criticism hit the vital spot. In reponse, Patten 
showed his ignorance and arrogance, once again proving that the 
British Government is bent on making the Hong Kong issue an 
international one before evacuating Hong Kong and changing Hong 
Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity, 
to extend the influence of its colonial rule. 
<H5>  Sovereignty Over Hong Kong Cannot Be Evaded </H5>
  Ostensibly, some people feel Governor Patten's remarks, 
quoted at the beginning of this article, were made in praise of 
Hong Kong and in defense of Hong Kong's international status and 
its importance. However, a rough analysis shows the matter is 
not so simple. In saying Hong Kong is an international asset, 
Patten intentionally evaded the problem of to whom Hong Kong 
belongs. According to Patten, since Hong Kong is an 
"international asset," it belongs to the international 
community, namely, it is shared by every country in the world or 
at least it is an independent or semi-independent political 
entity, over which China cannot exercise sovereignty. Does this 
not clearly show that China's sovereignty over Hong Kong was 
evaded or even denied? 
  How can China's sovereignty over Hong Kong be evaded! Since 
ancient times Hong Kong has been an inseparable part of Chinese 
territory. This is a fact known to all. Hong Kong was "ceded" 
and "leased" by the corrupt Qing Government to the "Great 
British Empire" when the latter sent in overpowering warships 
and cannons in its invasion of China, so it was in fact "stolen" 
or forcibly "occupied" by Britain. 
  Though Britain has ruled over Hong Kong for one and a half 
centuries, the fact that Hong Kong is China's sacred territory 
will never change. The Chinese nation has gone through a good 
deal, so the Chinese people value the country's sovereignty all 
the more. The Chinese Government and people have never 
acknowledged the unequal treaty signed at the point of a 
bayonet. It is for this reason that Deng Xiaoping has said on 
many occasions: "China refuses to yield an inch on the 
territory problem. To put it bluntly, sovereignty is not a 
problem for discussion." These sonorous and forceful remarks 
most vividly highlight and express the common desire of the 
Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots. 
<H5>  Attempt To Turn Hong Kong into International Wrestling Ring </H5>
  Before the Chinese people, who refuse to be bullied again, 
Patten's attempt to evade and deny the fact that Hong Kong 
belongs to China by saying Hong Kong is an "international asset" 
is of no avail. 
  What merits attention is that this was not the first time 
Patten has referred to Hong Kong as an "international asset." 
In early May last year, he openly alleged that Hong Kong was an 
"international asset" in a speech in Washington. To echo this 
assertion, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in both 
Singapore and Jakarta last July that Hong Kong had become a 
"political city." The two used different terms but they meant 
the same thing. They tried to change Hong Kong into an 
international political wrestling ring in a bid to throw Hong 
Kong into confusion, cripple Hong Kong's superiority as an 
international financial center, and rely on international forces 
to prevent China regaining sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
  Patten's allegation that the Chinese side does not 
understand Hong Kong's "international status" is entirely 
nonsense. How can Patten be compared with the Chinese Government 
where the understanding of Hong Kong's international status and 
its importance are concerned. It is because the Chinese 
Government has a profound and accurate understanding of Hong 
Kong's past and present state, and its international status, 
that it was able to advance a series of principles and policies 
including "one country, two systems," "allowing Hong Kong people 
to administer Hong Kong and enjoy a high degree of autonomy," 
and so on to solve Hong Kong problems. The fact that the 
Chinese Government included the series of principles and 
policies into the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which was made 
known to the world, giving them concrete form and putting them 
on a legal basis in the Basic Law, vividly indicates that the 
Chinese Government has a penetrating understanding of Hong 
Kong's "international status." Undoubtedly, a city's 
international status and functions are entirely different from 
the issue of to which country it belongs. They are different 
concepts and cannot be lumped together. Hong Kong is ranked 
among the biggest international cities and has become one of the 
international economic, trade, financial, and shipping centers 
but this will never change the fact that it is part of Chinese 
territory. The same is ture of New York, Paris, and Tokyo: 
They are international big cities but nobody can deny that they 
belong to the United States, France, and Japan respectively. 
  Clearly Patten has an axe to grind in preaching the 
"international asset" theory. By falsely alleging that the 
Chinese side does not understand Hong Kong's international 
status, he obviously was trying to shift public attention, cheat 
the media, and lure the international community into meddling in 
Hong Kong affairs, thus finally attaining the goal of 
internationalizing the Hong Kong issue. 
<H3>  The British Side Has Attempted To Prolong Colonial Rule for 
a Long Time </H3>
  Internationalizing the Hong Kong issue is one of the British 
Government's important plans to continue its colonial rule over 
Hong Kong after 1997 and is also one of its concentrated 
examples of going back on its word after signing the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
  Britain has been unhappy, unconscious, and even unwilling to 
return Hong Kong to China. At the beginning they said "the 
three treaties remain effective," later they suggested 
"exchanging sovereignty for administrative power," and then they 
proposed "Sino- British joint administration." All these showed 
their reluctance to give up colonial rule and return Hong Kong 
to China. 
  Former British Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher laid bare in her 
memoirs Britain's three-step strategy for handling the Hong Kong 
issue. First, insisting that Britain enjoy sovereignty over a 
part of Hong Kong; second, exchanging sovereignty over Hong Kong 
for long-term administrative power; and third, developing a 
democratic structure with the aim of granting Hong Kong 
independence or autonomy in a short period in the same way they 
treated Singapore, if the above two steps proved unworkable. 
  Before the Chinese people, who had risen to their feet, the 
first two steps have gone to the wall, so they are now stepping 
up implementation of the third step by taking advantage of their 
administrative power. People are now clear that everything, 
including the "representative government system," "the right of 
abode in the United Kingdom," the "formation of the court of 
final appeal," and "introducing the committee system into the 
Legislative Council" was closely related with to the third step. 
What Patten has said and done since he arrived in Hong Kong, 
including the "international card," has been designed to 
meticulously carry through the third step laid down by the 
British Government. This is exactly what is meant by the 
Chinese saying: He who has come, has come with ill intent, 
certainly not on virtue bent. This is the soft tactic Britain, 
which was a great empire over 100 years ago but is now on the 
wane, is forced to apply when it can no longer be insufferably 
arrogant before the giant in the east--the powerful People's 
Republic of China. According to Percy Cradock's memoirs, Mrs 
Thatcher once spoke of the need to appoint a politician as the 
last Hong Kong governor. This was because only a politician can 
achieve a certain political objective; can be impudent and break 
his promises; can contradict himself and chop and change; and 
can stop at nothing and risk danger in his desperation to carry 
out his plan. Patten has acted this way since he came to Hong 
Kong. Therefore, Patten's behavior is not personal but reflects 
a change in Britain's policy toward Hong Kong. 
  If anyone says Mr Patten has loafed around and wandered 
about 
doing nothing since he arrived in Hong Kong, this is unfair. 
Over the last two years, making nothing of the hardships, he 
has traveled to many countries to enlist support for his 
constitutional package in a move to internationalize the Hong 
Kong issue. During his recent trip to Australia, apart from 
saying that Hong Kong was an "international asset," he claimed 
that for various countries to support Hong Kong in expanding 
democracy is not equivalent to interfering in China's internal 
affairs. He also called on the international community to see 
to it that China honor its commitment after 1997 and alleged 
that Britain bears a "moral responsibility" for Hong Kong, and 
so on. All this thoroughly exposes Britain's plan to 
internationalize the Hong Kong issue. 
  Nevertheless, it is internationally accepted that while the 
Hong Kong issue is a matter for both China and Britain before 
1997, it is purely a Chinese internal affair after 1997. So any 
attempts by Patten and Britain to make the Hong Kong issue an 
international one are doomed to failure.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- An exhibition of 160 
photos reviewing the work for drafting the Basic Law of the 
Macao Special Administrative Region opened at Beijing University 
here this afternoon. 
  The three-day exhibition recording the partial work of the 
drafting and advisory committee members is aimed at 
commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of the 
Macao Basic Law. 
  Qian Weichang, vice-chairman of the National Committee of 
the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council 
will sponsor a series of commemorating activities here. 
  These will help people understand China's basic policy 
toward 
Macao, its government's principle of "one country, two systems" 
and its unremitting efforts for the implementation of the 
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao, he 
said. 
  He said that young students will witness the return of Macao 
to the motherland. Therefore, to run such an exhibition at 
Beijing University will be of vital importance to strengthening 
their national dignity and historical responsibilities. 
  Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office under the State Council, said the principle of 
"one country, two systems" is China's basic state policy. 
  China will resume its exercise of the sovereignty over Macao 
on December 20, 1999, which he said will be a major event in 
China's history. 
  To enable residents from both the mainland and Macao to 
understand thoroughly the Macao Basic Law is an important 
long-term task to ensure Macao's stable transition and smooth 
transfer of its power, Chen said. 
  Macao needs for both sides to work hard together to 
accomplish this task, he added. 
  In addition, three documentary films reflecting Macao's 
history and economy will be shown and a seminar on the return of 
Macao and Hong Kong and prospects for these two regions will 
also be held at Beijing University. 
  Taking part in today's opening ceremony were Qian Weichang 
and Ma Mankei, vice-chairmen of the National Committee of the 
CPPCC, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office under the State Council, and Guo Dongpo, director of the 
Macao branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Qian Qichen said here today that the differences between China 
and the United States can only be resolved through consultations 
and negotiations on an equal footing. 
  Qian, also foreign minister, made the remark while speaking 
to Chinese and foreign journalists prior to the conclusion of 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's four-day official 
visit to China. 
  Responding to a question about the differences between China 
and the United States, Qian quoted Christopher as saying that he 
had to implement the U.S. president's executive order and abide 
by the U.S. laws which link the human rights issue with the 
most-favored-nation (MFN) status. 
  "This is understandable," Qian said. However, "as the 
secretary of state is a lawyer, I told him that he must 
understand that neither the U.S. president's executive order nor 
U.S. laws are applicable to China. China has no obligations to 
implement them," Qian said. 
  "The differences between China and the United States can 
only 
be resolved through consultations and negotiations on an equal 
footing," he said. 
  On the MFN issue, Qian said that there are different views 
even in the United States. 
  U.S. business circles strongly support the continuation of 
MFN status to China, Qian said. But there is also opposition to 
its renewal. 
  China and the United States have a lot of common interests 
and they also have differences, he said. It is a fact. 
  China cannot become the United States, he said. It is 
impossible to ask China to accept what the U.S. sees as 
important, even so far as to become the same as the United 
States for the sake of developing trade. He said, then there 
would be no trade in the world at all, Qian said. 
  He said, "I believe Sino-U.S. trade will continue." 
  Answering a question about the impact of Christopher's visit 
on Sino-U.S. relations, Qian described the impact as "crucial." 
  He said he believed that, judging from the developing 
tendency of bilateral ties, both sides wish to implement the 
understanding reached between the heads of state of the two 
countries in Seattle last November. 
  "I believe that the U.S. secretary of state's China visit is 
aimed at resolving problems. The momentum for the development 
of Sino-U.S. relations will continue, although there are 
difficulties," Qian concluded.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, State 
Council vice premier and foreign minister, held concluding talks 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for one and a 
half hours at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this morning. 
Later, Qian Qichen spoke to foreign and domestic reporters and 
summed up the Sino- American talks and answered reporters' 
questions. 
  Qian Qichen said: China and the United States have held 
talks lasting over 10 hours. The talks were characterized by 
frankness, sincerity, and realistism [kai cheng bu gong tan 
shuai qiu shi 7030 6134 1580 0361 0982 3764 3061 1395]. China 
and the United States unanimously maintained that Sino-American 
relations are not only bilateral relations but should be put in 
the global context, and that the future and the 21st century 
should be kept in mind in handling the relations. The three 
Sino-American joint communiques constitute the foundation stone 
for Sino-American relations. China and the United States are 
two big countries with world influence. They are both permanent 
members of the UN Security Council and share many common 
interests in global affairs and in safeguarding international 
peace and security. In addition, they have much in common in 
their positions on safeguarding regional peace and stability. 
  Qian Qichen stressed: During the talks, China and the United 
States expressed their satisfaction at the speedy progress 
achieved in the economic and trade sphere, and felt that there 
are great potential and bright prospects for economic 
cooperation and trade between the two countries. 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: The issues of human rights and the 
most-favored-nation [MFN] status were the major topics of 
discussion this time. China is opposed to linking the issue of 
human rights to MFN status. The human rights issue involves two 
aspects. On the one hand, China and the United States have 
different concepts on human rights, and this is the reality 
which will exist for a long time to come. On the other hand, 
the two countries adopt different approaches in handling 
differences. We believe that the two sides can conduct dialogue 
on the human rights issue on the basis of equality, mutual 
respect, and noninterference in each other's internal affairs. 
China can only do what the Chinese law permits, and it is 
futile and harmful to apply pressure on China under the pretext 
of human rights. 
  Speaking on the specific outcome of the talks, Qian Qichen 
listed the following five points: 
  1. The two sides have agreed to continue to maintain the 
momentum of high-level exchanges. Chinese State Councillor Song 
Jian and Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, will go to the United States in April to attend 
meetings of the Joint Commission of Science and Technology and 
the Joint Commission of Commerce and Trade, respectively. 
  2. The U.S. side has reaffirmed its firm support for China's 
resumption of its status as GATT signatory. 
  3. The two sides have agreed to resume and develop exchanges 
between the two militaries, and to set up a joint commission on 
the conversion of defense industries to civilian use. 
  4. Out of friendly sentiments for the American people and 
out of humanitarian considerations, the Chinese side has agreed 
that the United States will soon send a team to China to conduct 
on-the-spot investigations into three cases of missing American 
soldiers during the Vietnam war. 
  5. The Chinese and the U.S. sides have signed a statement on 
cooperation in implementing the memorandum of understanding on 
prison labor products. 
  Qian Qichen said: "Apart from these, the two sides also have 
reached agreements in other areas. We hope the secretary of 
state's current visit will contribute to enhancing mutual 
understanding and to improving and developing relations between 
the two countries." 
  In answering questions on differences between China and the 
United States on the human rights issue, Qian Qichen pointed 
out: "The U.S. secretary of state said that he wanted to 
implement the executive order of the U.S. President and abide by 
U.S. law, thereby linking the human rights issue with the MFN 
status issue. This is understandable. The secretary of state 
is an attorney. I told him that he must know that neither the 
executive order of the U.S. President nor U.S. law can dictate 
[guan bu dao 4619 0008 0451] China. China has no obligation [yi 
wu 5030 0523] to implement them. The differences between China 
and the United States can only be solved through consultations 
and talks on an equal footing." 
  Speaking on the MFN status issue, Qian Qichen said: "The 
opinions within the United States are also divided. The U.S. 
business circles are very supportive of the extension of the MFN 
status to China. There are people with different opinions. It 
is true that China and the United States have many common 
interests as well as differences. China will not become a 
United States. How can China be asked to accept American ways 
of doing things [na yi tao 6719 0001 1152] and change itself to 
resemble the United States for the sake of developing trade? 
What trade is there to speak of in the world? I believe 
Sino-American trade will continue." 
  When a reporter asked a question on the effect of U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher's current visit on Sino-American 
relations, Qian Qichen said: "The secretary of state's current 
visit is very crucial to Sino-American relations. Judging by 
the trend of the development of Sino-American relations, I feel 
that the two sides still have to implement the memorandum of 
understanding reached between the Chinese and U.S. heads of 
state at the Seattle meeting last November. I believe the 
secretary of state came to China to solve problems. Despite 
difficulties, Sino-American relations will continue to develop."

  [Text] Washington, March 14 (XINHUA) -- A spokeswoman of 
the U.S. State Department said here today the United States 
seeks a broad relationship with a strong, stable and prosperous 
China. 
  Christine Shelly told a news briefing that Secretary of 
State 
Warren Christopher held lengthy meetings with Chinese top 
leaders while he was in Beijing. 
  During the discussions, the two sides addressed a broad 
range 
of bilateral issues including human rights, non-proliferation 
and trade, she said. 
  "The secretary presented U.S. views on all of these subjects 
to the Chinese leaders," Shelly claimed. 
  "During the meetings in Beijing, some of the differences on 
human rights issues were narrowed," she said. "However, more 
work must be done." 
  "We intend to continue our dialogue and our negotiations 
with 
China on the human rights issues," she added. 
  Shelly denied a report in the Washington post today that the 
U.S. had softened its trade stand with China and had offered a 
compromise plan to China on the renewal of the 
most-favored-nation trade status. 
  "This inaccurately reflects the substance and the tenor of 
the secretary's eight hours of discussion with China's leaders 
over the last three days," the spokeswoman said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- General Liu Huaqing, 
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, said here 
today that the Chinese Government and the Chinese Armed Forces, 
have always attached great importance to Sino-U.S. relations, 
hoping that the relations between the two countries and two 
armies will develop healthily on a normal track. 
  General Liu said this in a meeting this afternoon with U.S. 
Undersecretary of Defence Frank Wisner, who has been in Beijing 
since March 11, accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher on an official visit to China. 
  Extending a warm welcome to Wisner, Liu said that this 
current visit is helpful to the enhancement of mutual 
understanding and the improvement and development of relations 
between the armed forces of the two countries. 
  General Liu noted that the improvement of Sino-U.S. 
relations 
is not only associated with the vital interests of the peoples 
of the two countries, but also significant to peace and 
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world. 
  Wisner said that the U.S. wants to establish solid and 
constructive relations between the two countries and their armed 
forces, adding that these relations will not only benefit the 
two peoples, but also the peace and stability in the 
Asia-Pacific region and the world. 
  This morning, General Chi Haotian, Chinese state councillor 
and minister of national defence, met with Wisner and his party. 
  Chi said during the meeting that with the development of 
Sino-U.S. relations, China is willing to improve the relations 
between the armed forces of the two countries on the principled 
basis of mutual respect and benefits. 
  Chi said that China agreed to enhance bilateral exchanges, 
contacts and dialogue. 
  Lieutenant General Xu Huizi, deputy chief of the General 
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, took part in 
these meetings. He also held talks with Wisner, and exchanged 
views with him on relations between the two armed forces and 
other issues of common concern. 
  Yesterday, Lieutenant General Huai Guomo, vice-minister of 
the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National 
Defence, met with Wisner and his party.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Diplomatic Disaster"] </F>
  [Text] Warren Christopher's attempt to suggest that China 
and the United States had managed to narrow their differences 
over human rights in the final hours of his four-day visit to 
Beijing is scarcely credible. Congressional supporters of 
linking the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) 
trading status to an improvement in its human rights performance 
status are unlikely to be convinced by the Secretary of State's 
inane claim that Beijing now understands the U.S. view. The 
Chinese leaders Mr Christopher met are even less likely to have 
come away from their talks impressed by U.S. resolve. 
  The simple truth is that China, with its cynically timed 
crackdown on dissidents, has called President Bill Clinton's 
bluff. Short of a change of heart by the Chinese, the ball is 
clearly in the U.S. court. 
  Mr Clinton can try to prove he is no paper tiger by revoking 
China's MFN status. He would then have to accept that he has to 
live with the economic and electoral fallout. Alternatively, he 
could argue that U.S. economic interests are more important than 
human rights in a distant country of which many Americans know 
very little. That would mean renewing MFN, despite the evidence 
that China has not met the conditions he set for renewal. Or he 
could admit that linking trade and human rights was not the best 
strategy for promoting change in China. 
  The consequences to America of cancelling MFN should not be 
underestimated. It would lose an estimated US$9 billion in 
export business, with resulting damage to employment and 
economic recovery. It would also have to sit back and watch 
while its less-finicky competitors scrambled to take its place 
in the Chinese market as the two giant nations fought a mutually 
destructive trade war. 
<H5>  Greed for Markets </H5>
  Beijing long ago mastered the art of playing off 
export-hungry foreigners against one another. Once America's 
traditional allies had thumbed their noses at Washington in 
their greed for new markets, Beijing would have little fear that 
their behaviour would be any different in future when it came to 
membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for 
instance, or support for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong. 
  Beijing would have scored a political victory in proving the 
U.S. could not rely on international support for inflicting such 
arbitrary damage on a developing nation and potential 
superpower. But these would be pyrrhic victories neither wants 
nor can easily afford. 
  MFN, however, is not a privilege the U.S. grants only to 
China. It is a right enjoyed almost automatically by most other 
nations. Not even such dictatorships as Iraq or Libya have lost 
that right, despite other sanctions imposed on them. It is an 
accident of Cold War history that China, as one of the few 
still-nominally socialist nations, must be subjected to the 
annual farce of the MFN renewal debate while worse regimes 
remain out of the firing line. The original aim of imposing 
conditions on MFN for communist countries was to ensure they 
allowed their citizens to emigrate freely. The conditions on 
China go far beyond that requirement. 
<H5>  Blunderbuss Tactics </H5>
  The bitter truth, as the Hong Kong Government and as Hong 
Kong and American business interests have been telling Mr 
Clinton since the start of his election campaign two years ago, 
is that MFN is the wrong weapon. Human rights in China are too 
important a cause to put at risk by such blunderbuss tactics. 
These will always be questioned in the U.S. because of their 
potential to cause harm at home. And they will be questioned by 
many human rights supporters who see trade and the development 
of China's economy as essential to eventual political reform. 
  The MFN tactic also suffers from the weakness that it is a 
purely American initiative. Because other countries want to 
trade with China as well as press for human rights improvements, 
MFN makes it impossible to build an international coalition 
intent on trying to persuade China to improve human rights. 
  Since taking office, Mr Clinton and his State Department 
advisers have begun to learn the lesson that the yearly MFN 
fiasco is not a good way to deal with China. Indeed, Mr Clinton 
has learned both economic and political lessons swiftly. But he 
has not learned how to package them to make them appeal to his 
Congressional supporters. 
  Now the President and his advisers have painted themselves 
into an awkward corner, and are facing a Congress which does not 
understand the lessons the White House has learned. Yet neither 
Mr Clinton nor anyone else has worked out how the MFN weapon can 
be used -- if Congress forces that upon him -- without 
committing political suicide. MFN withdrawal will explode in 
the face of the president who orders it. Some weapon.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by Chu Ke (2806 1356): "The United States </F>
Must Curb Its Habit of Interfering in the Internal Affairs of 
Other Countries"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 14 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--When 
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher on 12 March, 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen pointed out frankly that, before 
Christopher visited China, "in disregard of China's laws, a 
senior U.S. official took actions which interfered in China's 
internal affairs when visiting China in preparation for the 
state secretary's visit." It is generally believed that Qian 
Qichen was referring to Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of 
state for human rights, who openly met with Wei Jingsheng on an 
official visit to Beijing last month. In China, Wei Jingsheng 
is a criminal who has been released on parole. It was a 
transgression of protocol for a U.S. official -- in the country 
on an official visit -- to meet privately with a person who, for 
China, is a criminal. 
  It was no coincidence that a U.S. official did something 
which did not respect the law of another country. More 
recently, when an American youth, Michael Fay, was sentenced to 
four months' imprisonment and caning by a Singapore court for 
creating graffiti and accepting stolen property, U.S. President 
Clinton suggested that Singapore reconsider the sentence. 
  One typical shortcoming of the U.S. Government is the idea 
that U.S. law is the law of laws and is universally applicable. 
If the law of a land differs from or contradicts U.S. law, it 
is automatically viewed as wrong in some way or not perfect 
enough, and the United States will even interfere with it. 
  The same goes for human rights problems. Some people in the 
U.S. Government seems to think that the United States is a 
paragon where human rights are concerned and that only American 
standards of human rights can serve as a guide for the rest of 
the world. In fact, these people only look at other countries 
and ignore numerous domestic situations which flout 
international human rights norms. The situation of the Native 
American Indians is a case in point. The U.S. Government and 
American society have been treating the Indians unfairly, yet 
there have never been any "human rights warriors" in the United 
States taking any moral actions to address the history and 
present reality of the systematic annihilation of Indian 
culture. The U.S. Government doesn't care that prisons in 
California and Oregon use prisoners as cheap labor and then 
export these prison products. 
  In the minds of the Americans, none of the Asian countries 
have "promoted human rights" in the past. During the era of the 
bipolar world order, many countries were lashed by the whip of 
U.S. "human rights" concepts and dared not raise any objections. 
Today, Asian countries can openly tell the United States that 
there are regional considerations in human rights, and, 
moreover, the right to regional development is one of them. 
This principle was expounded at last year's UN Conference on 
Human Rights. However, the U.S. Government is still violating 
this principle all the time and is continuing to interfere in 
other countries' internal affairs with its own human rights 
standards. The interference in China's human rights and 
Singapore's judiciary both originated from the same 
psychological background and show that the United States still 
has a hegemonic mentality. 
  In fact, with the disappearance of the bipolar international 
system, a multipolar world order with a diverse political, 
social, economic, and cultural situation has appeared. This 
diversified world order values mutual respect and mutual 
noninterference. If the United States continues to act in a 
hegemonic style and intervenes in other countries at the 
slightest excuse, it will, in the near future, find that the 
regions will react strongly to counter such interventions.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO correspondent Bai Jianfeng (4101 0494 1496) </F>
and XINHUA correspondent Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 2639)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Zhu Rongji, member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, said today: 
Stabilizing the market and curbing price increases are the key 
to properly handling the relations between development, reform, 
and stability [fa zhan gai ge he wen ding 4099 1455 2395 7245 
0735 4489 1353]. They are important missions facing governments 
at various levels. Leading comrades at various levels must be 
of one mind, must be concerned with the overall situation, and 
must resolutely restrain [kong zhi 2235 0455] price indices 
within the prescribed targets for 1994. 
  Arriving at the Hunan Lounge of the Great Hall of the People 
this morning as a deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC] 
from Hunan Province, Zhu Rongji joined all Hunan NPC deputies in 
a group discussion on Premier Li Peng's "Government Work 
Report." While earnestly listening to the speeches of more than 
10 deputies, he constantly interrupted and exchanged views with 
them. His cheerful and humorous remarks enlivened the 
atmosphere of the meeting. 
  Zhu Rongji fully affirmed Hunan Province's achievements in 
1993, particularly its work in eliminating "IOU's" to peasants, 
in reducing peasants' burdens, and in rectifying "the rush to 
establish development zones." Later, he made specific remarks 
on issues concerning stabilizing the market and prices which are 
of the greatest interest to the deputies. He stated: Prices 
began to rise in some localities in China in November 1993, and 
gradually price increases spread across the country. The party 
Central Committee and State Council noticed the situation, 
promptly took effective measures, and stopped prices from rising 
too rapidly. However, the problem has not been resolved once 
and for all. Since the beginning of 1994, the broad masses of 
people have been generally concerned with the tendency that 
prices have been rising monthly. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Some people attribute the current price 
increase to reform measures introduced this year. It is a gross 
misunderstanding. He pointed out: Inflation, which started 
before reform measures were introduced and which was an 
inevitable result of the excessive money supply in circulation 
in the first half of 1993, has had little to do with this year's 
reform measures. After reform measures were introduced for more 
than two months in the beginning of 1994, the national economy 
has shown an unexpectedly good performance. First, government 
revenues increased more than 30 percent in the January-February 
period of 1994 over that of the same period in 1993. Second, 
the money supply in circulation has been under effective control 
and has been reduced to a prescribed range in accordance with 
macroeconomic regulation and control. Presently the reduction 
of the circulating money supply has been progressing favorably. 
Seventy percent of the extra money supply provided prior to the 
Spring Festival has been retracted; the rest is expected to be 
taken back by the end of March. Third, simultaneous reform in 
foreign currency transactions has been progressing smoothly. 
Exchange rates between reminbi and foreign currencies have 
remained stable, and China's foreign exchange reserve has 
increased quite considerably. Fourth, the supply of market 
commodities is extremely abundant, and most commodities are 
oversupplied. The overall national economy is much better than 
that of 1993. It shows the results of macroeconomic regulation 
and control facilitated by the party Central Committee with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and the State Council. It also 
proves this year's reform measures are feasible and very 
effective. 
  Zhu Rongji stressed: The major reasons for the currently 
rising market prices follow: Many departments, localities, and 
enterprises have been maintaining excessive psychological 
expectations on growth rates and investment scales, and have 
misunderstood the meaning of "market economy." They mistakenly 
thought that under a market economy, the government will totally 
let go of prices, and enterprises can increase prices at will. 
Therefore, the main reason for the current unstable market is 
not an imbalance between supply and demand. As long as we take 
correct measures, we can curb price increases. Therefore, the 
party Central Committee and State Council have decided to take 
the following four measures: First, we will strictly "restrict 
expansion in two aspects," including excessively increased 
investments in fixed assets and overly expanded consumption 
funds. In 1994 we will not, in principle, introduce new 
construction projects. All projects which are to begin urgently 
must be under overall state programs. No bank loans shall be 
given to any project not listed in overall state programs, 
including projects which have been broken down into smaller ones 
from previously larger undertakings. Organs at various levels 
and various institutions and enterprises shall not 
indiscriminately increase wages, wantonly issue awards and 
bonuses, or sell public housing units at low prices. We should 
facilitate tax revenue reforms and social security systems to 
resolve uneven income discrepancies among various people and 
trades. Second, governments at various levels should earnestly 
and properly handle agricultural and "vegetable basket" 
projects; should stabilize grain-producing acreage, grain 
output, and grain storage; and should also ensure the supply of 
non- staple food for residents. We should regard the work 
progress in these tasks as the main criteria of evaluating the 
work performance of leaders at various levels. Third, the 
government should strengthen macroeconomic regulation and 
control over market prices. Governments at various levels should 
conduct a general inspection of commodity prices in the near 
future; should oppose indiscriminate price increases under the 
pretext of heavier tax burdens; and should oppose excessive 
profits and price-fixing under monopolistic practices. We 
should pay attention to checking prices of means of production 
which are important and transacted under monopolistic systems, 
including steel, electricity, coal, oil and chemical fertilizer; 
prices of consumer goods which concern the national economy and 
the people's livelihood, including grain and edible oil; and 
prices of public utilities and services. We must specify that 
even under a market economy, the state cannot abandon its 
functions in price management, nor can it refrain from 
subsidizing public welfare undertakings. The government cannot 
pass the commitment of giving subsidies, which it should rightly 
shoulder, in the form of a financial burden to the common 
people. We should make proper arrangements for people's 
livelihoods, even at the expense of funding a smaller number of 
construction projects. Fourth, we should expeditiously take a 
series of economic measures in the near future to curb price 
increases. To check price increases on certain commodities 
which are temporarily in short supply in the market and which 
contract excessive price increases, we should use the state 
inventory, increase the supply, and publicize price reduction 
while supporting enterprises to produce such commodities at full 
capacity. 
  Zhu Rongji stated at the end: So long as the entire party 
comes to a common understanding, helps one another, 
realistically undertakes actual tasks, and refrains from 
rhetoric, we definitely have the confidence to stabilize market 
prices; to properly perform various tasks in 1994; and under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, to achieve greater accomplishments 
in reform and development.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji said here today that the central authorities will 
continue to adopt practical measures to help state-owned 
enterprises overcome their difficulties. 
  Discussing Premier Li Peng's government work report with 
deputies from Henan Province, Zhu said major state-owned 
enterprises' difficulties have resulted from complicated causes. 
  The reform to transform their operational system has played 
a 
role in solving their difficulties; establishment of a modern 
enterprise system will also improve the competitive environment 
and operational conditions for state-owned enterprises, he said. 
  "Don't link the long-existing difficulties of state-owned 
enterprises with this year's reform measures. At the same time, 
don't expect to completely do away with historical burdens of 
state- owned enterprises overnight," he said. 
  "The party Central Committee and the State Council will 
continue to adopt practical measures to help enterprises shed 
their historical burdens," he said. 
  It is wrong, Zhu said, for some localities to encourage or 
allow a writeoff of loans for enterprises. 
  "This is not allowed by either policy or law," he said. "And 
it won't help those enterprises change their way of operation 
for the better and behave in accordance with accepted norms." 
  Zhu attributed the current shortage of operating funds for 
enterprises to excessive investment in fixed assets rather than 
to short money supply. 
  First, capital construction projects beyond state plans have 
squeezed part of enterprises' operating funds; second, newly 
completed projects having no operational funds have soaked up 
part of available funds; and third, unauthorized price hikes 
have taken a bite, he said. 
  "Without control of the excessive investment in fixed 
assets, 
it is difficult to change the fund-shortage situation," he said. 
  Banks should and will surely guarantee fund supply for 
enterprises with good economic returns if no fund 
misappropriation occurs, he added. 
  In the final analysis, he said, excessive investment in 
fixed 
assets and unauthorized price hikes, especially price hikes by 
monopoly industries, are the main causes for fund shortages and 
a debt chain for enterprises, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said today that China has a sufficient grain reserve, but 
there should not be, in the slightest degree, any relaxation on 
grain production. 
  Li Peng made the remark when he joined deputies to the 
National People's Congress (NPC) in a group discussion on the 
government work report he delivered March 10. 
  Talking with NPC deputies respectively from Henan and 
Heilongjiang Provinces, both leading grain producers in China, 
the premier said that rural reform in the past 15 years have 
brought about great changes in the countryside, especially the 
development of township enterprises. 
  As a result, many farmer-turned entrepreneurs have emerged, 
of whom majority are good and trust-worthy. But a small number 
of them have become degenerate and some even have committed 
crimes, Li added. 
  Without being supervised by the party and the masses, some 
people may easily make major mistakes when they have power and 
money. This is the case not only among farmer-turned 
entrepreneurs, but also among party officials, Li Peng said. 
  Li Peng urged party committees at all levels to protect and 
help and the masses to supervise the entrepreneurs. The 
entrepreneurs, at the same time, should enhance their awareness 
of law. 
  The premier also discussed with deputies on how to change 
the 
way state-owned enterprises operate. When conditions are 
mature, enterprises groups should be set up to build up the 
production scale. Efficiency of an enterprise lies in finding 
markets for its products, the premier added. 
  In response to deputies' proposals on smooth implementation 
of new reform measures, Li Peng said that all these measures 
have undergone careful consideration before they are introduced 
and they are aimed to create a climate in which all compete on 
an equal footing. 
  Of course, the premier said, people should not expect that 
the measures will effect all their benefits this year as some 
problems may occur in the process of implementation. The only 
correct attitude is to be prudent and promptly solve problems 
when they are discovered. 
  As for saving energy, Li Peng said continuous efforts should 
be made to improve energy utility efficiency since energy supply 
is still a bottleneck for the country.

<F P=106> [By reporters He Ping (0149 1627), Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814), </F>
and Wu Yilong (1566 1150 7893)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier 
Li Peng this morning joined separate group discussions and 
solicited opinions from the Hainan and Jilin delegations to the 
second session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]. 
He emphasized: Our work in all fields of endeavor must 
subordinate to and serve the overall interests of seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability, which have a bearing on 
the work of the whole party and the whole country. We must 
correctly handle the relations among reform, development, and 
stability; and must firmly carry out various reform programs. 
Meanwhile, we must pay attention to discovering problems and 
promptly solving them to ensure the smooth progress of reform 
and development. 
  At the Hainan delegation's group discussion, Ruan Chongwu, 
provincial party secretary and governor; Huang Baozhang, 
director of the provincial planning department; Wang Faren, 
director of the provincial land reclamation bureau; and Du 
Bilan, director of the State Oceanography Bureau's Ocean 
Strategy Research Institute; spoke successively. In light of 
the deliberation of the Government Work Report, the delegates 
raised proposals to Premier Li Peng on strengthening Hainan's 
infrastructure, developing its rubber production, and exploiting 
its marine resources. 
  Li Peng said: Hainan, as China's largest special economic 
zone, has made remarkable progress in implementing reform and 
opening up. The province is one of China's most promising areas. 
He expressed the hope that Hainan will proceed from its special 
feature in concentrating efforts on promoting economic 
construction and achieving breakthroughs in key areas to spur 
national development. He said: Hainan should further promote 
the special economic zone's development by making use of its 
advantages in location and resources to serve as the country's 
vegetable supply and rice breeding bases and quicken 
infrastructure development. 
  The premier emphasized: The special economic zone is a 
showcase for opening up China to the outside world and for 
building socialist spiritual civilization. The deeper reform 
goes and the wider China opens itself up to the outside world, 
the more necessary it is to build spiritual civilization. We 
must ensure that the work in both areas is attended to. 
  At the Jilin delegation's group discussion, the premier 
first 
listened to speeches by Jilin City Mayor Zhan Yuechang and 
Siping City Mayor Zang Shengye. It was almost noon, but 
deputies still waited for the premier to speak. Li Peng said 
smilingly: "I have stated all my views in the Government Work 
Report. It would be better for me to listen to your views." 
Then, Geng Zhaojie, Changchun No.1 Automobile Plant director, 
and Hunchun City Mayor Jin Minxiong spoke on ways for helping 
large and medium state enterprises tide over difficulties, 
introducing a share-holding system, and opening border areas. 
  After listening to the deputies, Li Peng said: Jilin, an old 
industrial base and a major grain-producing province, has made 
contributions to the state over the years. Since the 
implementation of the reform and opening policy, especially 
since the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important 
speeches made during his southern tour, the provincial economy 
has developed rapidly. He said: "I worked in Jilin for more 
than a decade. I have feelings for its people and places, and 
am very happy about the changes that have occurred in the 
province. I believe that through your continued efforts, Jilin 
will become more prosperous and more developed with each passing 
day." 
  Li Peng said: The theme of the current NPC session is to 
earnestly implement the 20-character principle [seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability] and to correctly handle 
the relations among reform, development, and stability. In 
developing the economy, we should focus attention on improving 
efficiency. On ways for invigorating state enterprises, he 
pointed out: The invigoration of state enterprises is a focal 
point and knotty task in deepening the reform of the economic 
structure. The key to improving the performance of state 
enterprises lies in raising their efficiency. This year we must 
do everything possible to accomplish this task. The government 
should create a favorable external environment for enterprises 
to change their operating mechanisms. But, more importantly, 
enterprises should rely on themselves. They should tap their 
potential, establish a modern enterprise system, improve the 
competence of their managers, upgrade technology, strengthen 
management, and gear their production to market demands. It is 
hoped that governments at all levels and enterprise managers 
will seriously study and work out feasible measures to gradually 
build up state enterprises' ability to compete in the market. 
  After attending the discussion with deputies from Jilin, 
Comrade Li Peng paid a courtesy call on the Fujian delegation. 
He told them: Fujian, a vanguard of reform and opening up, has 
made progress in recent years. The provincial economy keeps 
developing and the people's mental outlook has also undergone 
tremendous changes. We will continue to carry out more 
successfully the policy of opening up to the outside world. 
Fujian shall score greater successes in opening up to the 
outside world. 
  Noting uneven economic development within Fujian, Li Peng 
said: The province should make efforts to narrow the gap between 
fast-growing Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Quanzhou and the backward 
northwestern and eastern parts in a bid to achieve common 
prosperity. After localities become prosperous, they should 
help others cast off poverty and become well off so as to 
achieve common prosperity throughout Fujian. It is hoped that 
Fujian will make further efforts in this regard.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Deputies to China's 
top legislature said that China has met conditions for the 
resumption of its membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) and is able to assume responsibilities required 
of a GATT member. 
  At the ongoing session of the National People's Congress 
(NPC) here, deputies also expressed concern over China's 
most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status with the United States. 
  Li Hao, vice chairman of the NPC's Financial and Economic 
Committee, said China has had seven years of arduous talks since 
it officially applied for the resumption of its GATT membership. 
China's foreign trade system has undergone profound changes and 
now complies with basic principles of the GATT, he said. 
  "Conditions are mature for China to resume its GATT 
membership," he said. 
  Said Tsang Hin Chi, vice president of the Chinese General 
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong: "There isn't a single country 
in the world whose foreign trade system fully complies with GATT 
requirements. The degree of China's openness has in fact far 
surpassed that of some GATT members." 
  "It would be quite unreasonable for GATT and its future 
substitute to keep China, a big trading nation with a population 
of 1.2 billion and a fast-developing economy, outside the world 
trade organization, neither will it be beneficial for world 
economic growth. Exclusion of China would also pose a problem 
for GATT as a world trade organization." 
  Wai Kee Shun, chairman of the New Hong Kong Federation, said 
that, since China has become the eleventh largest trading 
country in the world, it is good for China to rejoin GATT. 
  "But," he said, "China is able to continue developing its 
economy even if it fails to resume its GATT membership." 
  Referring to China's MFN trade status with the U.S., many 
deputies said the U.S. should abandon its practice of 
interfering in other country's internal affairs by using trade 
as a weapon. 
  Canceled Kee Shun said [as received]: "If China's MFN status 
were canceled, China would not be the only one to be hurt, the 
U.S. will suffer more losses, because Sino-U.S. economic and 
trade relations are highly complementary." 
  Said Tsang Hin Chi: "MFN is purely a trade issue. The 
United States' use of MFN as a way to assert political pressure 
on China will only shed a shadow on bilateral economic and trade 
relations, and will even affect the expansion of bilateral 
relations between the two governments. This is obviously in 
contradiction with the common view reached between U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the 
Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle last November." 
  He said the Chinese Government is right in opposing the U.S. 
to attach any political conditions to its MFN treatment for 
China, expressing the hope that the U.S. will solve the problem 
once and for all by granting China a permanent MFN status.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- A draft Budget Law of 
the People's Republic of China was submitted here today to the 
second session of the eighth National People's Congress [NPC] 
for deliberation. 
  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, entrusted by the State 
Council, 
delivered an explanation on the draft law. 
  "Budget is a major means for the state to administer social 
and economic affairs and strengthen macro-economic control and 
its plays an important role in the state political and economic 
affairs," he said. 
  Formulation, examination and approval, implementation, 
readjustment and supervision of budget have had a lot of 
loopholes for a long time because China has lacked the law 
governing budgetary management, he said. 
  The draft budget law consists of 78 articles in 11 chapters. 
It clearly stipulates that after approval by the People's 
Congress at the same level, a budget has a binding force and 
must be implemented. No one shall change the budget without 
legal procedures and authorization. 
  The stipulation is aimed at turning round the situation in 
which arbitrary change of budget and softening the binding force 
of budget often occur. 
  The draft law has also legalized formulation, approval, 
implementation and readjustment of budget and formulation and 
approval of final state accounts. 
  According to the draft law, the National People's Congress 
approves the budget of the central government only and the 
people's congresses above the county level approve budgets of 
the local governments at the same level only. 
  The regulations will help solve contradictions and problems 
in the existing budgetary examination and approval procedures 
and increase the responsibility of people's congresses and 
governments at different levels, Liu said. 
  Article 27 and 28 in the draft read: the budget of the 
central government shall not include deficit; the budgets of 
local governments shall follow the principle of keeping 
expenditures within limits of revenues and shall not list 
deficit. 
  The draft also stipulates that budgets of governments at 
various levels shall set aside reserves according to a certain 
ratio of the expenditures of the governments, which will be used 
to tide over natural catastrophes and other extraordinary 
special expenditures. 
  Financial experts here said that it is imperative to enact 
the budget law to realize administration of financial affairs 
according to law. 
  The first draft was submitted for deliberation to the fourth 
meeting of the eighth October Standing Committee last October 
and revised according to opinions of the Standing Committee 
members afterward.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yang Zhenwu (2799 2182 2976) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- When deliberating 
Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report this morning with 
People's Liberation Army's [PLA] deputies to the Second Session 
of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], Jiang Zemin, 
general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of 
the Central Military Commission, delivered an important speech 
on strengthening all aspects of army building, in keeping with 
the new situation characterized by ever-deepening reform, so as 
to make continuing contributions to promoting the country's 
reform, development, and stability. 
<H3>  The Entire Army Should Strive To Accommodate the New 
Situation Characterized by Ever-Deepening Reform </H3>
  Jiang Zemin said: This year is crucial for promoting reform, 
opening up, and modernization. Keeping in mind the need to 
build a socialist market economic system, we will combine 
breakthroughs in key areas with package reform and strive for 
substantial progress in reforming the economic structure. The 
introduction and implementation of major reform measures set 
forth by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee -- including those aimed at reforming the financial, 
taxation, banking, investment, planning, and foreign trade 
systems, as well as those designed to establish a modern 
enterprise system -- is a "decisive battle" in our process of 
reform and opening up. Our victory in this battle and our 
establishment of a basic framework for the socialist market 
economic structure will effectively guarantee sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development in our national economy and will 
facilitate the conduct of many affairs. 
  Jiang Zemin noted: Nationwide, the situation is very good. 
The ever-deepening reform, however, dictates a readjustment of 
certain economic relations and some interests, resulting in 
quite a few new contradictions and problems. We must have a 
secure and stable social and political environment in which we 
can deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and promote 
development. Our Army comrades must be fully aware of their 
historical responsibilities and strive to strengthen all aspects 
of Army building so as to better carry out their sacred mission 
of safeguarding the motherland's security and unity and of 
defending the socialist modernization drive. 
  He said: Over the past few years, the entire Army has 
withstood the test in the course of reform and opening up and 
has always maintained a high degree of unified centralism and a 
high level of agreement with the party Central Committee. The 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure is a 
profound socialist transformation, and new circumstances and new 
problems will surface incessantly. Ideological problems of 
various types will inevitably arise among cadres and fighters. 
We should pay attention to improving ideological work among 
troops, ensuring that such work will be carried out in a 
meticulous, down-to-earth, lively, and deep-going manner. We 
should address and solve various ideological and conceptual 
problems among troops in accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
with the party's principles and policies. We should provide 
guidance to everybody concerning the need to consider the 
fundamental interests of the party and the state; to stress 
ideals, discipline, unity, and overall interests; to 
conscientiously subordinate personal interests to general 
interests; and to consistently maintain the party's basic line 
so as to make continuing contributions to promoting the 
country's reform, development, and stability. 
<H3>  All Officers and Men Should Be Further Motivated To Carry 
Out Their Work </H3>
  Jiang Zemin said: Reform, opening up, and modernization are 
a grand and arduous undertaking which requires an uplifting of 
the entire national spirit and the mobilization of positive 
factors in all parts of the country. As the Army goes, it means 
we should bring into full play the initiative and creativeness 
of all officers and men so that they will render more 
meritorious services in Army modernization and make more 
contributions to the country's prosperity, strength, and 
long-term stability. The most fundamental task at present is to 
improve education on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas for Army 
building during the new period, on the party's basic line, and 
on the Army's functions and patriotism, so as to further whip up 
the enthusiasm of officers and men for dedicating themselves to 
national defense and Army building. We should make our 
ideological and political education more appealing, relevant, 
and effective. We should educate officers and men about the 
need to firmly adopt a correct outlook on life and correct 
values, always stress the interests of the party and the state, 
foster lofty ideals, not to seek fame and wealth, work hard, 
make positive contributions, and devote themselves to Army 
building and reform. 
  Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: Leading cadres' 
efforts to forge close ties with the masses, to exercise strict 
self-discipline, to set a good example, and to foster a good 
image are very important for harnessing the enthusiasm of all 
sectors. If officers of a unit identify themselves with 
rank-and-file soldiers and follow the mass line in everything 
they do, the unit will have unity, healthy work style, and 
fighting capacity. Leaders at all levels in the Army should 
carry forward the fine tradition of forging close ties with the 
masses, uphold the principle of unity between higher and lower 
levels and officers and men, truly bear in mind the interests of 
the masses, and go down to the grass roots to perform concrete 
work and listen to opinions of the masses, thereby drawing on 
their wisdom and experiences to further improve the work. 
  Jiang Zemin also stressed the need to care about the life of 
officers and men. He said: In recent years, the party Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military 
Commission [CMC], as well as organizations at all levels, have 
adopted numerous measures to improve military personnel's living 
standards. Nevertheless, quite a few practical problems do exist 
in some grass- roots units, especially in units stationed at 
hardship posts. The CMC and the Army's headquarters have 
attached great importance to and adopted a number of measures to 
solve the problems. Organizations at all levels should also 
explore ways for improving military personnel's living 
standards, especially through encouraging Army units to engage 
in agricultural and sideline production. In improving military 
personnel's material and cultural life, we should allow 
rank-and-file soldiers at grass roots to take precedence over 
officers of leading organs. We should first improve the life of 
soldiers at grass roots and then officers of leading organs. 
This should be a standard requirement and customary practice, 
and should be passed on to the future generations. 
<H3>  Continually Raise the Army's Level of Building Spiritual 
Civilization to a New Height </H3>
  Jiang Zemin said: Promoting socialist spiritual civilization 
while striving to build socialist material civilization is 
Comrade Xiaoping's consistent thought, as well as the party's 
important guideline for the modernization drive. We should 
unswervingly implement this principle at all times. Reform, 
opening up, and the development of a socialist market economy 
have exerted a positive influence on the people's ideology and 
morality. This is primary. However, we should never ignore the 
negative influence. The deeper the reform goes, the wider the 
country is open to the outside world, and the further our 
material civilization develops, the more necessary it is for us 
to promote the building of spiritual civilization. The PLA 
should be the vanguard of society in building spiritual 
civilization. As far as this issue is concerned, the Army has 
scored remarkable achievements and has presented a large number 
of advanced models in theoretical study, ideological and moral 
construction, and work related to science, culture, education, 
literature, and art. For example, Xu Honggang, who risked his 
life to save people in difficulty and who showed no fear in the 
hour of danger, epitomizes the mental outlook of a people's 
soldier and the fine tradition of the party and the Army. His 
heroic deeds have aroused strong repercussions throughout the 
Army and society. They show that our society can produce and 
needs heroes like Xu Honggang. If each and every member of 
society can behave like him, the general conduct of society will 
keep improving and the cohesive power of our nation and society 
will become stronger and stronger. We must further deepen the 
campaigns to emulate Lei Feng, Su Ning, Xu Honggang, and other 
heroes and models to develop revolutionary spirit, foster 
healthy social mores, and promote the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: To improve spiritual civilization in 
the Army, the most important thing to do is to improve officers 
and men ideologically and morally. In view of the new 
circumstances and new problems that have arisen among officers 
and men with regard to their outlook on life, values, and moral 
concepts in the new situation, we should conduct various forms 
of education to guide cadres and officers about the need to 
always bear in mind our Army's goal of serving the people 
wholeheartedly; to strengthen their ideals and convictions in 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to promote the 
"five types of revolutionary spirit" initiated by Comrade 
Xiaoping; to measure their speeches and actions against such 
ideological and moral standards as self- sacrifice, 
selflessness, the practice of placing others' interests above 
one's own, and hard work; to conscientiously resist the 
influence of mammonism, ultra-egoism, and decadent ways of life 
so as to become practitioners and preachers of new socialist 
morals and customs. 
<H3>  We Should Always Pay Attention to Army Building at the 
Grass-Roots Level </H3>
  Jiang Zemin said: In recent years, the entire Army has 
conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the CMC's 
directives and made great efforts to strengthen Army building at 
the grass- roots level, achieving great success in this respect. 
The Army's basic work begins with the grass-roots level. 
Leading organs at all levels should further rectify the guiding 
ideology of their work, always take the grass-roots level as the 
point of departure and basis for their work, and make 
unremitting efforts to strengthen the Army's foundations. 
Toward the end of last year, the CMC promulgated anew the 
"Program for Army Building at the Grass-Roots Level." This was 
a major step taken by the CMC to implement Comrade Xiaoping's 
ideas for Army building during the new period and to strengthen 
all aspects of Army building at the grass-roots level. All units 
must implement the program effectively to promote overall 
progress in Army building at the grass-roots level. We should 
take the buildup of party branches as a crucial aspect of the 
effort to strengthen Army building at the grass-roots level. 
The Army has rich and excellent traditions of strengthening 
party building at the grass-roots level, and it is relatively 
well-organized; therefore, it should be able to achieve even 
better results in the new situation. 
  Jiang Zemin said emphatically: The Army is a highly 
centralized and unified armed group, which must be trained and 
managed strictly. An environment of long-term peace, coupled 
with the Army's ever-changing membership, can easily lead to lax 
management. This underscores an even greater need for setting 
strict demands for troops and for managing and training troops 
in accordance with relevant regulations so as to ensure the 
strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. Strict 
administration, however, does not amount to doing things in an 
oversimplified and crude manner. Our Army has the fine 
tradition of promoting unity among officers and men, which 
reflects the Army's character and goal; we should closely follow 
and widely promote this tradition in the new situation. 
Authorities at all levels should explore the distinctive 
features and patterns of commanding troops in the new period so 
as to constantly improve the level of troop management. 
  In closing, Jiang Zemin said: We should further improve 
unity between the Army and the government and between the Army 
and the people. Chairman Mao once said: "If the Army and the 
people are united as one, who in the world can match them?" We 
have always done a good job in this respect. In the new 
situation, we should all the more consolidate and expand the 
Army's relations with the government and the people. Local 
governments at all levels should show concern and support for 
national defense and Army building. The Army should support the 
government, cherish the people, and take an active part in and 
assist national economic construction. Troops stationed in 
impoverished regions, in particular, should do their utmost to 
help the poor and make positive contributions to national 
development and people's prosperity. 
  Liu Huaqing, chief of the PLA delegation, chaired today's 
plenary session. Zhang Zhen attended the session, along with 
Army-affiliated NPC deputies Chi Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Yu 
Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou. During the meeting, Deputies Xing 
Shizhong, Li Yuanzheng, Yang Huaiqing, and Li Yunsheng spoke on 
national defense modernization.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Bai Jianfeng (4101 0494 1496) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- People's Liberation 
Army [PLA] deputies today continued to hold group discussions on 
the government work report. Deputies Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, 
and Fu Quanyou separately took the floor. They stressed: All 
comrades of the Army must further study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
must make efforts to successfully carry out the Army's military, 
political, and logistic work and to achieve new development in 
reforming and building the Army in line with the general 
requirement -- "political qualification, perfect mastery of 
military skills, high discipline, excellent work style, and 
effective logistic support" -- raised by Central Military 
Commission [CMC] Chairman Jiang Zemin, and under the guidance of 
Mao Zedong's military concept and Deng Xiaoping's concept of 
army-building in the new period. 
  Deputy Zhang Wannian, chief of general staff of the PLA, 
said: Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" sets a very 
high premium on army-building. Our armed forces must 
continuously enhance their consciousness of danger, national 
defense, and modern warfare; they must keep a clear head at all 
times; they must conscientiously prepare for danger in times of 
peace; and they must always be alert. Army units must intensify 
study and training; they must work hard to enhance their modern 
warfare capabilities; they must vigorously train and bring on a 
new type of military personnel able to meet the needs of and 
take command in modern warfare; they must further strengthen 
control of Army units; they must make efforts to explore ways to 
lead troops under the new situation; and they must pay attention 
to studying the new situation and solving new problems so as to 
maintain a high degree of centralism, unity, and stability in 
Army units. 
  Deputy Yu Yongbo, director of the General Political 
Department of the PLA, said: We must actively respond to the 
call issued by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, take a clear stand 
in following the correct guidance of the media, and vigorously 
strengthen the building of spiritual civilization in the Army. 
He elaborated on how to follow the correct guidance of the 
media. He stressed that efforts must be made this year to 
successfully require Army units and especially cadres at and 
above regimental level to study Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, to energetically encourage standing 
up for what is right, and to carry on widespread propaganda for 
examples of advanced collectives and individuals that meet the 
needs of and reflect the spirit of our times. He said: We must 
treat the campaign to study Comrade Xu Honggang's activities as 
the turning point; we must energetically publicize and advocate 
the five types of revolutionary spirit initiated by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit initiated by 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin; we must carry forward the fine 
traditions of our party and Army; and we must vigorously foster 
and publicize more examples of advanced collectives and 
individuals that typify our times to enable good standards of 
conduct -- taking the interests of the whole into consideration, 
practicing plain living and waging hard struggle, strictly 
observing discipline, blazing new trails and forging ahead, and 
dedicating oneself selflessly -- to take further shape 
throughout the Army. 
  Deputy Fu Quanyou, director of the General Logistics 
Department of the PLA, said: The development of a socialist 
market economy will inevitably cause a series of new problems to 
for Army logistic work and for economic work in the military 
field. Challenges and opportunities exist at the same time, and 
so do difficulties and hopes. It requires us to try to adapt 
ourselves to the development of a socialist market economy, to 
conscientiously "converge [jie gui 2234 6510]" with the market 
economy, and to conduct our various logistical operations in 
compliance with the dual requirements of the "battlefield" and 
the "market." We must intensify reform of logistical work, 
produce results from reform, and provide effective logistical 
support. To successfully carry out reform, we must further 
emancipate our minds and change our concepts. We must intensify 
study and continuously enhance our ability to keep the progress 
of reform well in hand. We must further carry forward fine 
traditions and arduously persist in pioneering undertakings. As 
the current material conditions for reform of the Army's 
logistics are not very good, we must practice plain living, wage 
hard struggle, and press forward despite difficulties. The main 
tasks for reform of the Army's logistics for a certain period of 
time to come are: Reforming the logistic support system to 
enable it to pay equal attention to both military and civilian 
production and to integrate the logistic support operations for 
wartime with that for peacetime; reforming the acquisition and 
stockpile of military material to guarantee that the needs of 
army-building are met; reforming logistic management and 
improving military efficiency; reforming military production and 
management to better subsidizing army units in terms of 
supplies; and reforming the supply standards and methods to 
better meet the needs of Army units for their combat readiness, 
training, and subsistence.

<F P=106> [By reporters Li Nanling (2621 0589 3781) and Zhang Yijun </F>
(1728 4135 0193)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, vice 
premier of the State Council and chairman of the Preliminary 
Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region, hosted a banquet in the Diaoyutai 
state guesthouse today for National People's Congress [NPC] 
deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee from Hong 
Kong and Macao, who are in Beijing attending the ongoing NPC and 
CPPCC sessions. During the banquet he said the principle of 
"one country, two systems" will surely bear fruit in Hong Kong; 
all the targets set by the Hong Kong Basic Law will be realized; 
and Hong Kong will become more prosperous after 1997. 
  Qian Qichen said it was a great pleasure for him to have the 
opportunity to get together with NPC deputies and CPPCC members 
from Hong Kong and Macao. He said: Over last several days, you 
have displayed patriotic enthusiasm and glowingly expressed your 
views in discussing state affairs, despite travel fatigue. In 
particular, you have put forward very good opinions and 
suggestions on the Hong Kong question. We attach great 
importance to those opinions and suggestions. On behalf of 
Premier Li Peng and the State Council, I would like to take this 
opportunity to express my thanks and respects to you. At the 
same time, I wish the NPC and CPPCC sessions complete success. 
  He said: The NPC and CPPCC sessions this year are being held 
in an harmonious atmosphere in which China has made great 
achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization; and 
enjoys steady economic development and social stability, and the 
public is reassured. They are being held at a crucial moment 
when our country is in an unprecedented period of development 
and economic restructuring has entered a new stage characterized 
by overall progress and breakthroughs in selected fields. Under 
such a situation, NPC deputies and CPPCC members present at the 
two sessions are taking the 20-character principle -- the 
principle of seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up 
wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability -- as a 
basis in studying problems emerging during the course of 
advance, and discussing major policies and strategies for reform 
and economic construction. I believe the NPC and CPPCC sessions 
this year will certainly yield a positive and far-reaching 
impact on China's reform and modernization drive. 
  Qian Qichen said: On the eve of the current Second Session 
of the Eighth NPC, the British Hong Kong authorities tabled the 
remaining parts of Chris Patten's "political reform bill" to the 
Hong Kong Legislative Council [LEGCO] for discussion. This is 
another unilateral act to sabotage Sino-British cooperation by 
the British side after LEGCO passed Chris Patten's partial 
political reform bill, and the British side first publicized the 
contents of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political 
structure in a White Book. Though the British side talked 
loudly about cooperation with China, its acts and deeds on the 
Hong Kong issue in recent years have shown the very opposite. 
We cannot hold any illusion on this issue any longer. 
  He said: Before the Sino-British talks began, we made some 
predictions. In New York in October 1993, I said to British 
Foreign Secretary Hurd that there were only two possible 
outcomes of the Sino-British talks -- one, an agreement would be 
reached during the talks and the political structure elected in 
the 1994-1995 elections would be extended beyond 1997; and the 
other was that no agreement would be reached and the political 
structure unilaterally elected by the British Hong Kong 
authorities would remain valid up to 30 June 1997 only. We are 
now going to join the Hong Kong compatriots who love the 
motherland and Hong Kong, and rely on our own efforts to ensure 
the smooth transition of power and long-term prosperity of Hong 
Kong. Mr. Deng Xiaoping said as early as 10 years ago: "We 
must believe the Hong Kong Chinese have the ability to 
administer Hong Kong well. Any disbelief in their ability is a 
remnant mentality of old colonialism." China today is not what 
it was in the 1840's. The day when Chinese people were 
subordinated to the oppression and humiliation of foreign 
colonists has gone forever. The elaboration on the Hong Kong 
issue in Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report is the solemn 
declaration of the firm stand of the Chinese Government and 
people. 
  Qian Qichen said: The Chinese Government has the 
determination, confidence, and ability to realize the smooth 
transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and to maintain the 
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong because "Hong Kong's 
prosperity in the past was created by Hong Kong people mainly 
consisting of Chinese" and "Hong Kong people can administer Hong 
Kong well." At the same time, the determination and confidence 
rest with "our policy which precedes from the reality of Hong 
Kong, and with the fact that the mainland's reform and opening 
up policies are producing a positive influence on Hong Kong's 
economic development." I firmly believe that, with the backing 
of our great motherland and the concerted efforts made by the 
vast number of Hong Kong compatriots, the principle of "one 
country, two systems" will surely bear fruit in Hong Kong, all 
the targets set by the Hong Kong Basic Law will be realized, and 
Hong Kong will become more prosperous after 1997. 
  In conclusion, Qian Qichen said: As the day of the return of 
Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland draws nearer and nearer, a 
new epoch full of brightness and hope will arrive soon and the 
responsibility on our shoulders is becoming even more important 
and glorious. I cordially hope you will continue to carry 
forward the fine traditions of "loving the motherland, Hong 
Kong, and Macao" and use your experience, wisdom, and influence 
to make new, greater contributions during the crucial stage of 
the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Qian Qichen said here today that the principle of "one country, 
two systems" will surely bear fruit in Hong Kong, all the 
targets set by the basic law will be realized and Hong Kong will 
become more prosperous after 1997. 
  Qian, also chairman of the Preliminary Work Committee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region, made the remark at a reception in honor of Hong Kong and 
Macao deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and 
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse this evening. 
  He said that the Chinese Government has the determination, 
confidence and ability to realize smooth transfer of the 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintain the stability and 
prosperity of Hong Kong because "Hong Kong's prosperity in the 
past was created by Hong Kong people mainly consisting of 
Chinese" and "Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well." 
  At the same time, the determination and confidence rest with 
that "our policy precedes from the reality of Hong Kong, and 
with the fact that the mainland's reform and opening up policies 
are producing positive influence on Hong Kong's economic 
development," he said. 
  He said that on the eve of the opening of the current NPC 
session, the British Hong Kong authorities tabled to the Hong 
Kong Legislative Council (Legco) the remaining parts of Chris 
Patten's "political reform bill" for discussion. This is 
another unilateral act to sabotage Sino-British cooperation by 
the British side after the Legco passed Chris Patten's partial 
political reform bill and the British side first publicized the 
content of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political structure 
in a White Book. 
  Qian said though the British side talked loudly about 
cooperation with China, the acts and deeds of the British 
Government on the Hong Kong issue have shown the very opposite.

of Hong Kong," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held its second plenary meeting 
here today. 
  Nearly 2,000 members of the CPPCC National Committee 
listened 
to a report on proposals handling, and six members spoke at the 
meeting. 
  Today's executive chairmen were Hong Xuezhi, Dong Yinchu and 
Ma Man-kei. Some senior officials of the Communist Party of 
China (CPC) and State Council attended the meeting. 
  Zhou Shaozheng, director of the subcommittee for handling 
proposals, reported its proposals handling work since the first 
session last spring. 
  He said that CPPCC members, democratic parties and people's 
organizations have raised 1,981 proposals since the first 
session and 99 percent of them have been handled. 
  Through raising proposals, CPPCC members, democratic parties 
and people's organizations have performed the function of 
political consultation and democratic supervision and played an 
active role in the implementation of the principles of the 14th 
CPC National Congress, promoting economic and social 
development, consolidating the political situation of unity and 
stability. 
  Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the 
China Democratic National Construction Association, proposed 
that deepening reform of state-owned enterprises should start 
from clarifying who represents state assets, restructuring the 
management of state assets and defining the ownership of state 
enterprises' property rights. 
  Fang Jiade, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions, proposed relying on the working class 
whole-heartedly in the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system. 
  "The board of directors, the supervisory board and the 
assembly of share-holders should consist of a certain number of 
representatives of workers," he said. 
  Guo Guoqing, a professor of the People's University of China 
and two other members, raised proposals on bringing into full 
play the role of special supervisors, inspectors, auditors and 
educational inspectors and other discipline enforcement workers. 
  Li Hongchang, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of 
Industry and Commerce, suggested that a law governing chambers 
of commerce be enacted. 
  Gu Shengzu and Wang Chuanlun spoke on the need to guide the 
massive movement of rural labor and the ongoing anti-corruption 
drive. 
  Ye Xuanping and 11 other vice-chairmen of the CPPCC National 
Committee were present at today's meeting.

"Get To the Heart of Matters When Participating in the 
Administration and Discussion of State Affairs -- Notes on 
Coverage of the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- Participating in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs is a fine 
tradition of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC], as well as an important criterion for 
assessing the CPPCC's work. 
  During this reporter's coverage of the Second Session of the 
Eighth National CPPCC Committee, the most intensely discussed 
topic among CPPCC members was participation in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs. The progression 
from political consultation to democratic supervision to 
participation in the administration and discussion of state 
affairs is unquestionably a new leap in the work of people's 
political consultation. 
  At 49 discussion venues in seven guesthouses and hotels in 
the capital city, CPPCC members, citing a multitude of facts, 
proved the creative work carried out in people's political 
consultation over the past year, which had resulted in a higher 
and new level of participation in the administration and 
discussion of state affairs by CPPCC members. At the 
secretariat of the session, the reporter leafed through special 
investigative reports, all of which embodied the painstaking 
work carried out by CPPCC members. 
  Members of the Economy Committee under the National CPPCC 
Committee, when discussing their work over the past year, noted: 
In participating in the administration and discussion of state 
affairs, CPPCC members should adopt proper viewpoints and 
correct topics. Since its formation a year ago, the Economy 
Committee has carried out work in light of some important 
problems in current economic construction and in reform of the 
economic structure, producing six special-topic reports which 
attracted the attention and favorable comments of the party 
Central Committee, the State Council, and relevant central 
departments. 
  "Several Proposals for Tightening Macroeconomic Regulation 
and Control and for Reining in Inflation," made by the Economy 
Committee last June to deal with problems in the national 
economy, maintained: Inflation is now in evidence in our 
country. Central policy-making organs should form clear 
judgments and adopt forceful measures. The proposals suggested: 
To rein in inflation, we must restore banking order and 
strictly enforce fiscal discipline. Only by doing so can we 
stop the runaway investments in fixed assets and thoroughly 
dampen the property boom, the craze in building development 
zones, and the stock market boom. The proposals emphasized: A 
fundamental solution to economic problems is to allow the market 
to play a primary role in deploying resources through reform. 
Moreover, the government must establish an effective system of 
macroeconomic regulation and control and introduce greater 
changes to the banking, financial, taxation, and investment 
systems. 
  After perusal by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National CPPCC 
Committee, the proposals were forwarded to the CPC Central 
Committee's Political Bureau Standing Committee for review, 
attracting close attention from central leading comrades and 
relevant departments. Copies of the proposals were printed and 
distributed to vice premiers and state councilors after central 
leading comrades had provided written comments on them. They 
were also forwarded to comrades in charge of the State Planning 
Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission, the State 
Economic Restructuring Commission, the Finance Ministry, and the 
People's Bank of China for careful study. The relevant 
departments concurred with the National CPPCC Committee's 
proposals, saying that they correctly analyzed and judged the 
current economic situation. Many of the views outlined in the 
proposals were incorporated into documents issued shortly 
thereafter by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on 
tightening macroeconomic regulation and control and on reining 
in inflation. 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin, during an informal discussion 
with non-CPC people last June, specifically talked about the 
proposals. He said: "The National CPPCC Committee, various 
democratic parties, and people with no party affiliation are 
very concerned about the current economic situation and have 
offered many valuable opinions and useful suggestions for 
reform, opening up, and economic construction. The party 
Central Committee and the State Council highly value these 
opinions and suggestions, have forwarded them to relevant 
departments for study, and are assimilating and adopting them in 
their work." 
  Members of the Economy Committee under the National CPPCC 
Committee, in reviewing work related to people's consultation 
over the past year, said of their profound understanding: To 
allow people's consultation to play a genuine role, we should 
show concern for major state affairs, keep overall interests in 
mind, adopt proper viewpoints and correct topics in light of our 
own special conditions, and build on our advantages. Members 
who took part in the Economy Committee's investigations said 
that the reason their proposals were valued and adopted by the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council was because they 
drew on the collective wisdom of members and offered sound 
opinions and suggestions for solving the most pressing problems 
in the current stage of national economic development. 
  Almost all members of the 15 committees under the National 
CPPCC Committee shared the feelings of their counterparts on the 
Economy Committee. Members of the Women and Youth Committee, in 
discussing last year's special investigations, maintained: The 
establishment of a sound socialist market economic structure 
will surely lead to greatly expanded services for women, youth, 
and children, as well as some new circumstances and problems. 
The focus of the Women and Youth Committee's work in the period 
ahead is to conduct investigations and study with regard to 
certain salient problems and to offer feasible countermeasures 
and proposals. 
  Last November, members of the Women and Youth Committee 
conducted investigations in Guangdong and Fujian to ascertain 
the conditions of female and young workers in "partly or wholly 
foreign-owned" enterprises in open coastal areas. During their 
investigations, the members were given to understand that some 
"partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises did not pay due 
attention to the rights and interests of their workers and staff 
members; that there were some problems regarding the employment 
of workers, work hours, and the protection of workers and staff 
members' dignity; and that some of those problems were quite 
serious. To this end, the members made four proposals for 
protecting the legitimate rights and interests of workers and 
staff members in "partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises, 
compiling them into a special-topic investigative report. 
  The report drew the attention of leading comrades at the 
State Council and was very well received by leading party and 
government departments in coastal areas who thought that the 
Women and Youth Committee had addressed a currently important 
problem demanding prompt solution. 
  Mindful of the widening gap in the levels of development 
between minority regions and developed coastal areas, the 
yet-to-be-solved problem of poverty in some areas, and the host 
of new problems in the course of building a socialist market 
economy, the Nationalities Committee under the National CPPCC 
Committee sent two investigative teams last August to Sichuan 
and Guizhou to investigate issues pertaining to poverty relief 
efforts and economic development, producing three investigative 
reports that served as very useful references. After reading 
the reports, State Councilor Luo Gan convened a special meeting 
of comrades in charge of relevant departments to hear briefings 
by comrades on the investigative teams. Luo Gan fully affirmed 
their investigative work, suggesting that the Nationalities 
Committee's proposals be incorporated into the report being 
drafted by the State Nationalities Affairs Commission on behalf 
of the central authorities. Comrades from the the CPC Central 
Committee's United Front Work Department and Policy Research 
Office, after reading the reports, said that the reports were of 
great value and that they were studying the problems reflected 
in the reports. 
  When discussing their understanding during the session, 
CPPCC 
members who had conducted the investigations focused on this 
topic: One of the important things to do in participating in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs is to conduct 
special investigations and study, which should be in-depth, 
oriented toward practical results, and designed to aid practical 
work. 
  According to statistics compiled by the National CPPCC 
Committee's General Office, the various special committees under 
the National CPPCC Committee have, over the past year, conducted 
special investigations and study on some important issues 
concerning the two civilizations and united front work, 
producing 24 investigative reports. The views outlined in many 
of those reports have attracted the attention of the CPC Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the departments and localities 
concerned, and quite a few opinions have been adopted. 
  It has become the keynote of the new term of the National 
CPPCC Committee to guide participation in the administration and 
discussion of state affairs by promoting awareness about reform 
and opening up, and to encourage such participation by 
harnessing the CPPCC's unique characteristics and advantages so 
as to adapt participation in the administration and discussion 
of state affairs at high levels to the need for establishing a 
socialist market economic structure. During the current 
session, CPPCC members noted: From now on, we will participate 
in the administration and discussion of state affairs while 
bearing in mind the central task of the party and the state; 
improve practical results; harness the advantages of the CPPCC's 
intellectual pool, information sources, and broad channels at 
both higher and lower levels, so as to actively promote 
socialist modernization.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of a recorded news conference given by leading </F>
CPPCC members for domestic and foreign correspondents at the 
International Hotel in Beijing on 11 March; -- from an ad hoc 
"Special Program on the NPC-CPPCC Sessions"] 
  [Text] Listeners, the Press Center of the National 
People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] hosted a news conference for 
Chinese and foreign correspondents at the International Hotel at 
1500 [0600 GMT] today on the subject of establishing a modern 
enterprise system and enhancing the vitality of state-owned 
large and medium enterprises. It invited Standing Committee 
members of the CPPCC National Committee, Wan Guoquan and Li 
Gang, and National Committee members Yan Ruifen, Zhao Changbai, 
Zhang Junsheng, and Wang Jie to answer questions. We now 
broadcast excerpts of the recorded news conference. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified moderator] Ladies, 
gentlemen, and friends, the NPC-CPPCC Press Center is hosting a 
news conference for Chinese and foreign correspondents here this 
afternoon on the themes of establishing a modern enterprise 
system and improving state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises. We are honored to have been successful in inviting 
six Standing Committee members and members of the CPPCC National 
Committee here today. Please allow me to introduce them to you, 
they are: Wan Guoquan, Standing Committee member of the CPPCC 
National Committee and vice chairman of the Central Committee of 
the China Democratic National Construction Association; Li Gang, 
Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National Committee, vice 
chairman of the Economy Committee of the CPPCC National 
Committee, and adviser to the China National Automotive Industry 
Corporation; Yan Ruifen, member of the CPPCC National Committee 
and general manager of Guangdong China Guanglian Enterprise 
Company Limited; Zhao Changbai, member of the CPPCC National 
Committee and vice-chairman of the Board of Directors of Shoudu 
Iron and Steel Corporation; Zhang Junsheng, member of the CPPCC 
National Committee and board chairman of (Hehe Meiling) Company 
Limited; and Wang Jie, member of the CPPCC National Committee 
and professor of the Economics Department of the CPC Central 
Party School. We now invite questions. 
  [Ye] I am Ye from the (?SHANG YE JIN RONG BAO) [?COMMERCIAL 
AND FINANCIAL JOURNAL]; my question is: Quite a number of 
shareholding enterprises have claimed that their switch to 
shareholding status means they have already changed their 
operating mechanisms and see no need to change them again under 
the current call. What do you think? 
  [Moderator] We would like to invite Committee Member Li Gang 
to answer this question. 
  [Li] Thank you. This is a very meaningful question. There 
are quite a number of factors that currently make large and 
medium state-owned enterprises unable to enliven themselves. 
One of these is shortage of funds. However, we feel the most 
fundamental reason for the poor performance of large and medium 
state-owned enterprises is one of mechanism and system. 
Although capital may be injected through share issues, in the 
final analysis, the success or failure of enterprises depends on 
whether or not we can enliven our system. 
  [(Li Ruisheng)] I am a reporter from RENMIN RIBAO, my name 
is (Li Ruisheng). I would like to direct my question to board 
chairman Zhang Junsheng of the (Meiling) Company. [words 
indistinct] 
  [Zhang] To a developing nation like China, I think admission 
to the GATT will have far-reaching impacts; in the meantime, 
however, it will play a big role in pushing China's economic 
development. To we Chinese enterprises, admission to GATT 
presents both a challenge and an opportunity. As far as our 
company is concerned, our (Meiling) refrigerators are well 
prepared to compete with refrigerators produced by any country 
on an open, just, and fair basis. We are confident we will get 
our deserved market share. 
  [(Chen Yunping)] I am (Chen Yunping) from the Central 
Television Network. I would like to direct my question to Zhang 
Junsheng. It is argued that there are two ways to enliven large 
and medium state enterprises; one is implementing the 
share-holding system the other is private ownership. What are 
your views? Do you think these arguments are correct? 
  [Zhang] From the perspective of historic development, the 
development from private ownership to public ownership is 
inevitable; history should not reverse itself. According to the 
operating characteristics of the market economy, the superior 
will win while the inferior will lose. Under these 
circumstances, private ownership may (?accommodate) public 
ownership and verse versa. Therefore, I would say that the 
question of introducing private ownership in China does not 
arise. In addition, in his government work report delivered 
yesterday, Premier Li Peng emphatically stressed keeping public 
ownership as the mainstay of the economy. 
  [(Wen Shizai)] I am XIN MIN WAN BAO [XINMIN EVENING POST] 
reporter (Wen Shizai). The enforcement of the Bankruptcy Law 
will bring unemployment to some workers. My first question is: 
Are we going to control our unemployment rate? And my second 
question is: If the answer is yes, to what extent should we 
exercise control? 
  [Moderator] Shall we direct these questions to Committee 
Member Wang Jie? 
  [Wang] Once the Bankruptcy Law comes into effect, some 
workers will inevitably face temporary periods of waiting 
between jobs. In the process of developing a market economy, 
and in the course of promoting fair competition, the "superior 
will win and the inferior will lose" law will certainly apply to 
every enterprise. Some workers, therefore, are bound to spend 
some time job-waiting. It can be argued, though, that this 
job-waiting is different from previous western-style, long-term 
unemployment phenomena. As far as our socialist system is 
concerned, the working people are the masters of our nation and 
we will make every effort to get jobs for them. Hence, our 
party and governments are now vigorously developing tertiary 
industry, township and village enterprises, and small and medium 
cities, and towns. All these are designed to provide a secure 
[words indistinct] workplace for the working people who are 
temporarily out of job. It has been my personal view that, in 
light of deepening of reform and the development of a socialist 
economy, there will be more job opportunities. This point 
[words indistinct] has been proved by history. 
  [(Li Rao)] My name is (Li Rao) from the ZHONG HUA GONG SHANG 
SHI BAO [CHINESE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL JOURNAL], I have a 
question for committee member Wan Guoguan. At present, large 
and medium enterprises are the main components of our country's 
economy, their success or failure will have an impact on the 
development of the whole national economy. For the past few 
years, we have been introducing contract systems, implementing 
regulations on transforming operational mechanisms, and now we 
are active in developing a modern enterprise system. As doubts 
and anxieties still exist over whether these measures are really 
helpful to the invigoration of large and medium enterprises, can 
we ask the views of Wan Guoquan, the executive chairman of the 
Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction 
Association and a representative of democratic parties, on these 
issues? 
  [Wan] I think this is a very important question, an issue 
of deep concern for us. Before discussing it we must, first and 
foremost, affirm the contributions made by our large and medium 
state enterprises to the country and people in the first few 
decades after its founding. Meanwhile, we should also recognize 
large and medium state enterprises as the mainstay of the 
national economy. They have played a dominant role in national 
economic construction in the past, play a similar role now, and 
will continue to do so in the future. Because state enterprises 
were founded on the enterprise system under a planned economy, 
the introduction of a socialist market economy in China has 
indeed put them in a predicament. However, I have ample 
confidence that state enterprises can be invigorated, for four 
reasons: First, central government has adopted a clear-cut goal 
and policy measures to enliven state enterprises, which are 
reflected in the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and Premier Li Peng's government work 
report. As Premier Li Peng explained, the goal and policy 
measures can be summarized as follows, the requirement that 
large and medium state enterprises deepen reform and change 
operating mechanisms, including, of course, the establishment of 
a modern enterprise system, under which property rights as well 
as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly 
defined, government administration and enterprise management are 
separated, and scientific management is established. Based on 
my experience as a manager when enterprises did not have 
managerial autonomy and were not responsible for profits and 
losses, I am fully aware of that if an enterprise is shackled by 
many restrictions it will lack vitality. If state enterprises 
operate according to central government policy and the Company 
Law, which will come into force soon, they will be full of 
vitality. Second, even though the equipment of some enterprises 
is outdated, others have upgraded or, more importantly, have 
been equipped with internationally advanced facilities. The 
latter can play an effective role in promoting socialized mass 
production. Third, state enterprises have a large contingent of 
talented people, including senior engineers and veteran workers. 
They are an invaluable asset of ours. Moreover, through more 
than a decade of continuous exploration, we have accumulated 
experience in bringing state enterprises more into line with our 
socialist market economy. The entrepreneurs present here today 
are typical products of such exploration. Fourth, central 
authorities have set great store by, and the people have shown a 
keen interest in, reform of the large and medium state 
enterprises. Now is the time to reform them or they will not 
survive. This is a demand of our socialist market economy. 
Reform must be carried out and will certainly succeed. That 
Premier Li Peng devoted a whole section of his report to this 
question explains the great importance attached by the State 
Council to reform of state enterprises. Therefore, I am fully 
confident that enterprise reform will succeed, but it will take 
some time. 
  [Correspondent] I am from Hong Kong's KUAI PAO [EXPRESS]. 
During an interview a few days ago, an economist propounded a 
theory that the performance of large and medium state 
enterprises was not bad, but that their vitality had been 
diverted into other areas. Do you agree with this theory? 
  [Moderator] Shall we direct this question to Professor Wang 
Jie? 
  [Wang] There is some truth in the theory that the poor 
performance of state enterprises does not indicate a decrease in 
their efficiency, but rather the diversion of efficiency to 
other areas. At present, some large and medium state 
enterprises have to undertake a heavy burden. For example, they 
have debts and apportionments for social undertakings and 
various expenses, which must be paid from their profits. It is 
true, therefore, that in the final analysis their efficiency is 
low. However, we must admit that the overall efficiency of 
enterprises is not high; and the reasons, as mentioned in 
Premier Li Peng's report, are many. The fundamental one lies in 
the shortcomings and defects of the management systems and 
operating mechanisms of state enterprises. How are the 
shortcomings and defects reflected? They are reflected mainly 
in the failure to clearly define the property rights as well as 
the rights and responsibilities of enterprises, and in their 
administrative (?interference) with operating mechanisms. For 
this reason, all enterprises have limited management autonomy 
and are weak in market competition. It is precisely because of 
these shortcomings and defects that the decision of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has explicitly 
proposed a step-by-step reform of state enterprises, and has 
defined the establishment of a modern enterprise system as the 
objective of reform. I believe that once property rights and 
the rights and responsibilities of enterprise are clearly 
defined, once government administration and enterprise 
management are separated, and once scientific management is 
established in accordance with the objective set by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, state 
enterprise efficiency will surely be gradually enhanced, and 
they will bring into more effective play a role commensurate 
with their dominant position in the national economy. 
  [Correspondent in English, fading into Mandarin 
translation] I am from the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. There 
appears to be something of a contradiction in Premier Li Peng's 
government work report. On the one hand, he demanded that state 
enterprises rely on themselves to achieve development through 
reforms, while on the other he pledged more government financial 
aid to these enterprises. For example, they are no longer 
required to pay funds for energy and transportation construction 
projects and budgetary regulatory funds. Moreover, the 
government will also provide financial aid to enterprises to 
help them resettle surplus labor. If the government continues 
to provide assistance in terms of funds to state enterprises, 
how can they be encouraged to make reform and enhance efficiency? 
  [Unidentified CPPCC committee member] The premier's report 
is not contradictory. What is essential is that enterprises 
rely on themselves by deepening reform and changing their 
operating mechanisms. However, during the transitional period, 
the state will implement an interim preferential policy toward 
enterprises, especially to guarantee the livelihood of their 
workers and staff. If an enterprise rely on the preferential 
policy without deepening reform, it can go nowhere. Government 
support will not last forever. The only way out for an 
enterprise running in the red over a protracted period is to 
declare bankruptcy. 
  [(Chen Tiebiao)] I am (Chen Tiebiao) from the (?Cable 
Television). My question is about the tax assignment system, 
which is a new state policy. As the Finance Minister explained 
in the budget report, the new system may encounter 
contradictions in the course of implementation. Will such 
contradictions be those between the state enterprises and local 
governments, or between the enterprises themselves? Please 
clarify. 
  [Unidentified CPPCC member] Implementation of the tax 
assignment system is a very important step in our tax reform. 
It is not a system unique to China, and is also implemented in 
many other countries. At present, there are national and local 
taxes. However, under the tax assignment system, the central 
government, in order to make allowances for local governments, 
will reimburse them a certain amount of tax revenue to tide them 
over difficulties during the transitional period. Of course, it 
is entirely possible that a reform of such a great magnitude 
will affect the interests of a certain sector. What we can do 
is to proceed from the overall situation and take into 
consideration both national and local interests.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Proposals raised by 
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have played a 
significant role in deepening reforms, promoting economic and 
social development and consolidating unity and stability in 
China. 
  During a full session of the CPPCC National Committee today, 
Zhou Shaozheng, chairman of the CPPCC subcommittee for handling 
proposals, delivered a report on the handling of proposals made 
since the last session a year ago. 
  Over the past year, members of the CPPCC National Committee, 
various democratic parties and people's organizations have made 
a total of 1,981 proposals, he said, adding that his 
subcommittee had handled 99 percent of the proposals by February 
25, 1994. 
  He said that 1,506 members, 72 percent of the total, made 
proposals in 1993. Of these, 13 came from the Central Committee 
of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Central 
Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, 
and groups of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese 
Kuomintang, the Jiu San (September 3) Society and the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions. 
  According to Zhou, 673 of these proposals, or 35.4 percent, 
deal with China's economic development; 617 of these, or 32.5 
percent, involve education, science, culture, public health and 
sports; 394 of these, or 20.7 percent, cover political affairs, 
legal affairs, labor and personnel; and the rest deal with 
united front work, nationality affairs, religious affairs, and 
affairs relating to Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and Overseas 
Chinese. 
  All the proposals made during the first session of the CPPCC 
National Committee, held a year ago, have been submitted to 
departments of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and 
the State Council for handling, he said. 
  To date, those departments have either adopted or handled 82 
percent of these proposals in various ways and have also 
explained why they cannot adopt the remaining, he said. 
  He said that a considerable part of the proposals contain 
specific measures to accelerate reforms, open China wider to the 
outside world, step up the modernization drive, push forward the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure, promote 
ideological and cultural progress, and improve the party's style 
of work and the building of a clean and honest government. 
  For example, members made a number of proposals calling for 
increased investment in agriculture and faster construction of 
large water conservancy facilities. There are nine proposals 
requiring the undertaking of a massive project to divert water 
from south China to water-deficient north China. 
  The State Planning Commission has listed diverting Chang 
Jiang River water to north China as a priority project and is 
now making a feasibility study of it, he said. 
  Many members also proposed setting fair and rational tax 
rates and establishing a new rational taxation system throughout 
China. 
  The party Central Committee and the State Council have 
decided to institute a tax assignment system since the beginning 
of this year, in an effort to tighten the central government's 
unified management of tax revenues, he said. 
  Moreover, the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress has adopted a proposal suggesting that an amendment to 
China's constitution provide for the establishment of a 
"multi-party cooperation and political consultative system under 
the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." 
  The stipulation "a multi-party cooperation and political 
consultative system will exist for a long time to come and 
develop" has been included in China's constitution, he added. 
  Zhou Shaozheng pledged to handle proposals by CPPCC National 
Committee members more efficiently in future.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- An economics professor 
appealed for a better understanding of the positive significance 
of China's massive movement of rural labor and offered advices 
for its solution. 
  "For the surging tide of migrating rural labor," he said, 
"we 
should not take a blocking method. Rather, we should provide 
guidance over the direction of its flow by way of market 
principles." 
  The suggestion was made by Gu Shengzu, a member of the 
national committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC) and an economics professor of Wuhan 
University, in a speech he made here today at a general session 
of the CPPCC National Committee members. 
  Professor Gu first dealt with statistics. 
  He said: China at present has over 400 million rural 
laborers. With 100 million absorbed by rural enterprises, there 
are still more than 200 million surplus laborers in rural areas. 
Among the surplus laborers, 50-60 million have left their 
villages to form what is known as a tide of migrating rural 
labor. That means, at least, over 100 million laborers in rural 
China need job placement. Moreover, surplus rural laborers will 
increase by more than 10 million each year. 
  In the 1990s, he said, the issue will become increasingly 
serious. A markdown of the comparative benefits of farming will 
drive a great number of rural laborers to move in search of 
jobs. By the turn of the century, he said, China will have an 
army of about 100 million migrating rural laborers. 
  Gu said, rural labor has promoted the economic development 
of 
regions where they work. They have contributed to construction 
projects for the 1990 Asian games, expressway construction in 
Beijing, development of Shanghai's Pudong, the Chang Jiang Three 
Gorges project, and the economic takeoff of the Pearl River 
Delta area in Guangdong. 
  At the same time, he said, the labor tide is having an 
adverse impact on urban traffic and social order. 
  Gu suggested that urbanization of rural areas be taken as a 
main channel for the absorption of surplus rural laborers to 
slow down the pace of their flow into big cities and avoid a 
waste of resources caused by scattered industrialization. 
  His urbanization program calls for letting 300 small cities 
absorb 30 million surplus rural laborers, each taking 100,000; 
letting 2,000 county towns soak up 100 million, each taking 
50,000; and selecting 2,000 towns and building them into small 
cities to absorb 100 million. 
  "We need an innovative way to solve the problem," Gu said.

"The Premier's Important Requests"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- The issues about 
enriching the "food baskets" of urban and rural residents, 
diverting water to the north, transporting west China's coal to 
the east, settling debts between enterprises, and stabilizing 
cotton output became the topics of discussion among Hebei 
delegation's deputies attending the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC]. While joining the deputies' 
discussion and listening to their views, Premier Li Peng also 
chipped in and discussed with the deputies ways and means to 
expedite reform and development. 
  In light of Hebei's actual situation, Provincial Governor Ye 
Liansong said: "Commodity prices, especially prices of goods 
closely related to people's livelihood, have a direct bearing on 
social stability." 
  Li Peng supported his view, saying: "There are 23 kinds of 
goods which are closely related to people's livelihood, 
including the essential ones in their `food baskets.' In recent 
years Hebei has been attaching great importance to the `food 
basket' project and has done a fairly good job in promoting 
direct trade between consumers and producers. I hope you will 
sum up your experiences so that you can continue to improve your 
work." 
  Cattle raising has been developing quite rapidly in Hebei. 
Deputy Li Bingliang, deputy secretary of the Hebei Provincial 
Party Committee, especially mentioned Li Fucheng, a major 
cattleman in Sanhe County. Li Peng said: "I have visited his 
cattle farm. I even met him when he made a special trip to 
Beijing during the Spring Festival this year!" 
  Li Bingliang said: The size of Li Fucheng's cattle 
production has been expanding ever since his cattle raising 
business was semimechanized. His cattle inventory last year 
exceeded 4,700 head; and he made a net profit of 6 million yuan 
from the $5 million foreign exchange he created by selling 1,700 
head of cattle. 
  Li was pleased with the report, saying: "Cattle raising is 
profitable in many ways. Cattle bred for meat yield high 
economic returns. In addition to meat, cow hide and bone can be 
extensively processed into useful products. Cattle eat straw 
and their droppings are good manure for soil improvement and can 
also be used for producing marsh gas. Hebei has advantage in 
this regard in many ways, and I hope that this project will 
continue to be a success." 
  Deputy Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party 
committee of Hebei, a major cotton producing region in the 
country, said that low state-set prices for cotton and drought 
are major problems hindering Hebei's cotton output. Li Peng 
asked: "Are there any cotton plant comrades here? How much do 
you pay for one dan [50 kg] of cotton?" Deputy Zhang Fenge, a 
worker of the No. 1 Handan State-Operated Cotton Yarn Plant, 
stood up and gave Li Peng an answer. 
  Li Peng said: "I mentioned in the government work report 
that 
the state will pay a higher price for cotton, but the textile 
industry may not be able to tolerate if the price is raised 
excessively. And so I think this problem can only be resolved 
step by step along with the establishment of the socialist 
market economic system and price restructuring. As for the 
impact from drought, can we solve the problem by developing 
water conservation measures, such as sprinkling irrigation, as 
well as by improving cotton strains to make them more drought 
resistant?" 
  When Deputy Liu Hanzhang, director of the Handan Iron and 
Steel Works, took the floor, Li Peng asked him with concern: "I 
visited your plant in 1988. Has its annual output reached 1 
million tonnes yet?" After he received a positive answer, Li 
Peng said: When I visited your plant, your annual output was 
only 800,000 tonnes or so. Then Li Peng asked Liu about his 
plant's production situation as well as the way it obtained its 
coal, iron, and other raw materials and the types of products it 
produces and their quality. Li Peng specially empasized the 
importance of high technology, saying that high technology not 
only can yield higher returns, but also can conserve large 
amounts of energy. 
  Li Peng asked Deputy Xu Ji, director of the Kailuan Mining 
Bureau: "Have you solved your water problems? How is 
production? Have you totally removed price control? What is 
the all-personnel labor productivity?" Xu Qi answered all the 
questions, feeling very excited that Premier Li Peng was so 
familiar with the situation in Kailuan and other areas in Hebei. 
He also factually reflected the bureau's problems but pledged 
to live up to the premier's expectations. 
  Li Peng said: Hebei has fairly good natural conditions and 
fine revolutionary traditions, and it has made fairly fast 
progress in its development since adoption of the reform and 
opening up policy. This shows that as long as leading cores at 
various levels are united, work with one heart and one mind, and 
deal with common problems with concerted efforts, they can 
expedite economic construction and make new progress in both 
material and spiritual construction under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  On improving state-operated enterprises, Li Peng stressed 
that leading authorities at all levels should place this project 
high on the agendas, take effective measures to create an 
environment favorable for business, and help enterprises solve 
their problems through upgrading their technology and 
management. He said enterprises should give full scope to their 
initiatives by taking advantage of the opportunities created by 
various reform measures. 
  Li Peng said: As a major agricultural province, Hebei should 
pay special attention to developing water-efficient agriculture 
and scientific farming, and diversify operations on the basis of 
stabilizing grain and cotton production. 
  As soon as the premier finished saying "I wish Hebei greater 
success and faster progress every year!" the hall reverberated 
with applause and laughter.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 KYODO -- Members of a regional 
delegation to China's ongoing National People's Congress will 
submit a motion demanding war compensation from Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Chinese sources said Tuesday [15 
March]. 
  The motion, a copy of which was made available to KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE, appears only days before Hosokawa begins a three-day 
visit to Beijing Saturday, his first as Japan's top leader. 
  The document clearly states the strong dissatisfaction of 
the 
Chinese victims of Japanese wartime aggression, while demanding 
a formal apology and compensation from Hosokawa. 
  Signed by a 32-member delegation from Hubei Province and led 
by Liu Napeng, the motion declares that despite the Chinese 
agreement to give up demands for war reparations in the 
Japanese-Chinese joint declaration of 1972, Chinese victims 
still have the right to be compensated for civilian losses. 
  The document claims more than 10 million Chinese victims 
were 
savagely murdered by Japanese forces during the so-called 
"Nanjing massacre" alone, causing over 300 billion dollars in 
economic losses. 
  The motion appeared at the NPC in 1992 on the eve of the 
"historic" visit of Japanese Emperor Akihito, but authorities 
refused to act at the time, due to political considerations. 
  The drafters of the document say the time is now ripe to 
demand payment for war losses, as many Japanese already support 
Hosokawa's position on apologizing for Japan's war behavior and 
the new government and the Social Democratic Party have taken a 
positive attitude toward compensating civilian victims of 
Japanese war crimes. 
  Besides asking Hosokawa to apologize and promise war 
compensation to Chinese victims, other demands include the 
establishment of a committee for civil compensation from Japan, 
which would include Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and overseas 
Chinese, the acknowledgement and publication of a legal basis 
for demanding payment from Japan, and an open and published 
denunciation of Japanese aggression and war crimes. 
  The document also says the right to formally register the 
victims should belong to the Chinese Government and that 
Japanese yen loans should also be used to compensate victims. 
  While visiting Japan in 1992, Chinese party secretary Jiang 
Zemin, now also the nation's president, indicated that the 
Chinese Government would not interfere with demands for civilian 
compensation. This has led to an increase in such demands.

<F P=106> [Report on interviews with NPC deputies and CPPCC members by </F>
correspondents Bao Jinghao and Fu Yongchang in Beijing -- date 
not given; from the "Special Program on NPC-CPPCC Sessions"] 
  [Excerpts] Listeners and friends, in his government work 
report delivered to the Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC] on 10 March, Premier Li Peng said 1994 
is an important year for China to push forward its reform. In 
the new year, China will continue to deepen reform and open 
wider to the outside world. He also stressed that it is 
necessary to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control. [passage omitted] 
  The state policy on macroeconomic regulation and control was 
drawn up by the party Central Committee and the State Council 
and is enforced jointly by them. However, it is different from 
the planned management of the past. It does not contradict the 
state's introduction of the socialist market economy. 
Commenting on this, NPC Deputy Shen Daren, who is also chairman 
of Jiangsu People's Congress Standing Committee, said: 
  [Begin recording] [Shen] Macroeconomic regulation and 
control... [recording fades into announcer-read passage] 
  Deputy Shen Daren held: A market economy is not a free 
economy in which one can do whatever one wishes. Not only is it 
restricted by law, but it is also subject to interference by the 
administrative means of the state. Experiences, both positive 
and negative, in economic development over the past decade show 
that it is impossible for localities to develop their economies 
successfully if the overall economy is not well developed or not 
enlivened, and if the economic relations between the center and 
localities are not straightened out. If localities only take 
into account their special interests to the exclusion of the 
overall interests, and if they ignore the damage done to the 
overall interests, there is no way they can preserve their 
special interests. In past few years some localities have, more 
of less, vied with one another in seeking higher growth rates, 
undertaking new construction projects, and recklessly trying to 
increase output. Problems of the localities need to be 
addressed. Only by solving these problems can we guarantee a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  NPC Deputy Shuai Liguo, mayor of Guangxi's Beihai City, put 
forward his view when he discussed the central policy on 
macroeconomic regulation and control. He held that 
macroeconomic regulation and control present opportunities for 
localities. 
  Deputy Shuai Liguo said: [Begin recording] [Shuai] The 
introduction of macroeconomic regulation and control by the 
state is aimed mainly at achieving a balance between total 
supply and total demand in the economy and solving the problem 
of irrational economic structure. Under macroeconomic 
regulation and control, we can strengthen weak links in the 
local economies, readjust their structures, and remove 
bottlenecks restricting the development of local economies. In 
addition, during the period of macroeconomic regulation and 
control, we can strengthen the construction of urban 
infrastructural facilities and improve the "hard" investment 
environment. We can also strengthen local economic management, 
rectify the economic order, expand the scope of reform, 
accelerate the pace of transforming the operating mechanisms of 
enterprises, and heighten their economic performance. We can 
concentrate on improving the "soft" investment environment in 
order to lay the foundation for economic development. A 
rational structure in the national and local economies will, 
doubtless, play a role in boosting economic development. 
Therefore, macroeconomic regulation and control, in a positive 
sense, also provide an opportunity for localities to develop 
their economies. [end recording]

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- China's environmental 
quality has remained basically unchanged in recent years, though 
environmental problems has posed a serious challenge to the 
country, a senior Chinese environmental official said here today. 
  At a press conference given by the current session of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC 
Environmental Protection Committee, said that the country's 
environmental quality has "basically remained at the same level 
of the 1980s." 
  He said that economic losses caused by environmental 
pollution in China top about 100 billion yuan every year. 
  Asked about Chinese Government's spendings on environment, 
he 
said that China spends 20 billion yuan on environment protection 
every year, accounting for 0.7 percent of its annual gross 
national product. The figure leads all other developing 
countries in the world, he said. 
  He cited the example of Beijing city, which spends an amount 
of money that accounts for 2.4 percent of its annual gross 
domestic product every year. In the past decade, the city has 
spent over ten billion yuan on projects for curbing pollutions. 
  He noted that the government imposes very low fines on 
enterprises which violate environmental protection rules, 
prompting some enterprises to pay fines in exchange for 
government consent on their spoiling of environment. The total 
fines of last year only accounted for 0.11 percent of the 
country's annual industrial output. 
  "We have raised the minimum of the fines by one-third last 
year... and we are going to make it even higher, so as to compel 
the enterprises to clean up the environment instead of just 
paying fines," he said. 
  Asked about the actual figures for cancers and respiratory 
diseases caused by pollution in China, he said that China has 
yet to compile a set of complete figures on the impact of 
environmental pollution on people's health. 
  "It is a very complicated job. We are still carrying out 
researching programs in this regard," he said. 
  He said that the Chinese Government did not make public to 
the people the World Bank reports on pollution-related diseases 
in the country, because it has to consult with relevant 
departments to "verify the preciseness of the international 
figures." 
  Asked about China taking out gall bile from living bears, Qu 
said that China's wild life protection policy is to "carefully 
protect, actively reproduce and rationally utilize" wild animals. 
  "China has a large number of bears," he said. "On this 
precondition, we should consider utilizing them for medical 
purposes." 
  He said that keeping one bear for medical use will avoid the 
killing of 220 bears. And the bear will not suffer great pains.

"Objectives, Motive Force, Foundation, and Preconditions -- the 
Relationship Among Reform, Development, and Stability as Seen 
From the `Two Sessions'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- In China, the high tide 
of reform and opening up is surging up, economic development 
shows a strong momentum, and the 1.1 billion people are having 
an unprecedented opportunity for great development in the 
1990's. The situation in China has attracted people's attention 
both at home and abroad. How to develop further is the main 
topic for discussion among the National People's Congress [NPC] 
deputies and the members of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] at 
the ongoing NPC and CPPCC sessions. 
  Premier Li Peng pointed out in his government work report: 
To seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote 
development, and maintain stability is the stress of the work of 
the whole party and the whole country. The crux of how to stick 
to the stress lies in correctly handling the relationship among 
reform, development, and stability. 
  How to stick to the stress of the work and handle well the 
relationship among the three has become the most popular topic 
at the "two sessions." 
  "Development is the last word." This famous word of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's is known to everyone in China. To develop 
productive forces is the fundamental objective of socialism and 
meets the basic needs of social progress and the people's 
happiness. If the economy is not developed, how can we show 
superiority of the socialist system and meet the challenge of 
the world? Our economic development in the last 15 years was 
with high growth rate in many consecutive years, which has 
caused surprise and admiration in the world. As a result, our 
annual gross domestic product has exceeded 3,000 billion yuan, 
our annual grain output has reached 900 billion jin, and our 
annual steel output has been near 90 million tonnes. In 
addition, we have had urban and rural markets with ample supply 
of goods, we have built hundreds of millions of new houses, the 
rural per-capita income has reached 921 yuan.... The people 
support our party even more and they are even fuller of 
confidence in the future of socialism. By comparing the 
realities of their own regions and departments with the 
situation of other countries, the conferees to the "two 
sessions" have profoundly realized that the current 
international situation and domestic situation are conducive to 
China's promotion of reform and construction, and it is indeed 
an unusually good opportunity for us. "The key to seizing the 
opportunity to develop ourselves lies in economic development." 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks made during his southern 
China inspection tour have inspired us to stick firmly to 
economic construction -- the central task -- and do all we can 
to develop economy. 
  What do we rely on to achieve development? We should rely on 
reform. Reform is the power, motor, and booster for 
development, as well as a panacea for the liberation and 
development of productive forces. Over the last 15 years, 
reform has added a great vitality to China's economy, given a 
pair of wings for all trades and professions to soar, and 
created a series of miracles. In short, reform and development 
grow up together. In order to make further progress in economic 
development in the 1990's, China must rely on deepening the 
reform and opening up wider, and there is no other way. Chinese 
leaders and people with breadth of vision clearly know that 
China's reform is a long process, it should be deepened steadily 
and prudently step by step with the progress of socialist 
modernization, and it cannot be achieved overnight. The 
establishment of socialist market economic structure is deeper 
and broader thorough reform. The plans for reforms of the 
fiscal and taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade 
systems have been promulgated for implementation. They will 
involve a great deal of work and contradictions. During the 
course of examining the government work report, the NPC deputies 
and CPPCC committee members have reached the following 
consensus: The plans are being carried out quite smoothly, 
marking an important step taken by China in establishing 
socialist market economic structure; as the reform has a bearing 
on China's development and prosperity, the whole country must 
work as one, go all out, and vigorously promote it; since the 
reform is being deepened, affecting the relative interests of 
many quarters, it must be planned meticulously and carried out 
prudently. 
  Reform and development require a relaxed and harmonious 
social environment, as well as a political situation of 
stability and unity. Comrade Xiaoping has said: "Stability is 
above all else." Without stability, nothing can be achieved, 
neither reform nor development. Useful lessons in this regard 
can be found in Chinese and foreign history, both ancient and 
modern history. For this reason, stability is the indispensable 
precondition for reform and development. 
  Our country needs stability, a long-term peace and 
stability. According to reports on the "two sessions," the NPC 
deputies and CPPCC committee members have understood even more 
profoundly the necessity to promote stability with development 
and reform. A genuine social stability is impossible if the 
country is weak in national strength and suffers bad inflation 
and market supply shortage and the people's living standards are 
not improved. Development and reform are the foundation of long 
peace and stability in the society. The NPC deputies and CPPCC 
committee members suggested that in order to achieve stability, 
we should first stabilize economy and the market commodity 
prices and ensure a healthy economic development; we should 
attach importance to agriculture because stable agriculture 
will create stability across the country; and we should solve 
well any problems concerning public order so that people in both 
urban and rural areas can live and work in peace and 
contentment. Some deputies from ethnic minority regions 
emphasized that we must strengthen the great unity among the 
people of all nationalities, and the brothers of 56 
nationalities should share weal and woe, link their hearts, and 
forge ahead together. Leaders at all levels should be concerned 
about the masses, and resolve contradictions and overcome 
difficulties for the masses. There will be long-term peace and 
stability in our country if the 1.1 billion people are of one 
heart and one mind and our economy is prosperous. 
  Reform, development, and stability promote one another and 
form a single entity. General Secretary Jiang Zemin put the 
relationship in a vivid and profound way during his discussion 
with Shanghai's deputies: "Reform, development, and stability 
are like three closely related strategic pieces on the chess 
board of China's modernization drive. We will win the game if 
every move is properly made and one move helps another. If one 
move is wrong, it will endanger other pieces and even cause loss 
of the game." Everyone has a share of responsibility for the 
destiny of the country. All citizens should clearly know the 
stress of the work of the party and the state, do a solid work 
at their posts, and plunge themselves into the reform to promote 
development and maintain stability. 
  The "two sessions" have sent a message to China and to the 
world as a whole: No matter how the world situation changes, 
the Chinese people will firmly take the road of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. China will firmly promote reform and 
opening up in a peaceful and stable environment. We will work 
as one under the banner of reform and achieve a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development to usher in the new century.

Youcheng (5113 2589 2052)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Henan delegation to 
the National People's Congress [NPC] session held small group 
discussion on 13 March. Minister of Railways Han Zhubin, 
together with the directors of the ministry's planning and 
transport bureaus, visited the deputies, listened to their 
views, and answered their questions. 
  The deputies affirmed the contributions of the railway 
department to Henan's economic development. They also made 
candid criticism and suggestions on issues concerning passenger 
and cargo transport, capital construction, and work style of 
railways. Han Zhubin listened attentively to their views, took 
notes, and occasionally discussed things with the two bureau 
directors in a whisper. Soon after the deputies finished 
presenting their views, Han Zhubin said with a smile: Some of 
your problems involve too many departments and I cannot make 
decisions on them in a short time. I can give you clear and 
definite replies on the problems which the Ministry of Railways 
can solve right away: 
  -- No. 251 and No. 252 express trains between Zhengzhou and 
Beijing will be changed to nonstop express trains as of the 
middle of April this year; 
  -- No. 233 and No. 234 express trains running between 
Xinyang 
and Beijing on a temporary basis will become permanent service; 
  -- On the question of linking Henan's local rails with state 
rails, we may in principle conduct an experiment at a selected 
locality first; 
  -- The Ministry will readjust wagon dispatch and change the 
practice of keeping southbound railway wagons in the south, and 
will move a large number of railway wagons northward from 
Guangdong and Shanghai; and 
  -- In wagon dispatch, the railway department will do all it 
can to satisfy Henan's needs in shipping products with high 
added value and export products produced by Henan enterprises. 
  The deputies affirmed the practice of the State Council in 
having the responsible cadres of ministries and commissions 
attend the meetings of NPC delegations and hear their views. 
Han Zhubin's replies won applause from the audience.

  [Text] Hu Jintao, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee and member of the CPC 
Central Committee Secretariat, and Chi Haotian, state councillor 
and minister of national defense, joined the National People's 
Congress [NPC] deputies of the Tibet delegation in examining the 
government work report on the morning of 13 March. 
  After Raidi, deputy head of the Tibetan delegation, declared 
the meeting open at 0900, the deputies freely spoke about what 
they wanted to speak. Commenting on the three major 
requirements -- reform, development, and stability -- Deputies 
Losang Gyaincun, Qiangba Pingcuo, Losang Namgyai, and Losang 
Toinzhub maintained that, because of Tibet's rather special 
situation, it must properly handle the relations between those 
three requirements in order to attain the targets set for 1994. 
This means that, in addition to making efforts to deepen 
reform, open wider to the outside world, and promote 
development, Tibet must also pay attention to maintaining a 
stable social, political, and economic environment and strive to 
promote reform and development in a stable environment and 
achieve a long-term social stability through reform and 
development. 
  Deputy Losang Toinzhub said: None of the three requirements 
-- reform, development, and stability -- is dispensable. 
Tibet's socialist modernization drive certainly can move 
forward as long as we are able to properly handle the relations 
between the three requirements, maintain the standards of 
productive forces [sheng chan li biao jun], seize the 
opportunity, achieve breakthroughs in key points while promoting 
all projects as a whole, work in line with the national 
framework [yu quan guo zai kuang jia shang yi zhi] and 
structures, and, in light of Tibet's actual needs, take resolute 
actions, adopt flexible policies, and take steady and reliable 
steps. 
  Comrade Hu Jintao listened attentively to the views of the 
speakers, occasionally nodded to express his approval and 
inquired about Tibet's framework for reform. 
  After the deputies finished speaking, Raidi asked Minister 
Chi Haotian to say a few words. Chi Haotian said: I have come 
to learn from you. People in Tibet care very much for and 
support the armed forces, and they have contributed 
significantly to strengthen the border defense in southwest 
China. Under the new situation, we must continue to strengthen 
army-police-people unity [jun jing min tuan jie]. The armed 
forces and the people should share the same destiny, breathe the 
same breath, and link their hearts so that our border areas can 
be built into a steel great wall. Meanwhile, we must strengthen 
the joint army-people defense to ensure stability in border 
areas. As long as army and people are united as one, we can 
surmount any difficulty.

Zhiwei (3944 1807 0251)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- Zhejiang Governor Wan 
Xueyuan said here today: Zhejiang's overall strength has 
increased rapidly in the past 15 years of reform and opening to 
the outside world. Next, Zhejiang will, in accordance with the 
requirements set by the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, open wider to the outside world, deepen the reform, and 
optimize the economic structure, raise the quality of economic 
growth to ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of 
its economy. 
  The news center of the "two sessions" held a news conference 
this morning and invited Zhejiang Governor Wan Xueyuan, Ningbo 
City Mayor Xu Yunhong, Hangzhou City Mayor Wang Yongming, and 
Wenzhou City Mayor Chen Wenxian to meet with Chinese and foreign 
reporters. 
  In response to a reporter's question on what Zhejiang has 
done or will do in the area of building and cultivating a 
socialist market system, Wang Xueyuan replied, saying: Zhejiang 
started the reform of the market structure early, and it has 
developed its own characteristics in the process of developing a 
market economic structure. First, Zhejiang has been known as a 
"large market province" because of its early effort to cultivate 
markets. There are now over 4,300 markets of various types in 
the province, 107 of which can handle over 100 million yuan 
each. Markets for capital, labor, technology, real estate, and 
other basic means of products are being developed rapidly. At 
present, the role and scope of the market mechanism have 
expanded considerably in the operation of Zhejiang's economy. A 
profound change has taken place in the government's functions 
and methods of organizing the economy, and mandatory plans under 
the jurisdiction of the province have all been abolished. 
  Wan Xueyuan said: The development of markets has promoted 
Zhejiang's economic development. This year, Zhejiang will 
strive to improve all types of services and accelerate the 
establishment of markets for the basic means of production, 
especially financial, technological, and labor markets. At the 
same time, in close conjunction with the state's major reform 
measures, the province will improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control, deepen enterprise reform, and step up the building of a 
system of social security. Through a few years of efforts, we 
will strive to initially build a modern enterprise system, a 
distribution system, a social security system, and a 
macroeconomic control system meeting the requirements of a 
market economy, thereby forming an open and integrated market 
system. 
  In response to a question on whether the tax reform of this 
year will affect the town and village enterprises, Wan Xueyuan 
said: Zhejiang's town and village enterprises have developed 
rapidly in the past few years. Their output value has accounted 
for 60 percent of the province's total industrial output value. 
In the process of deepening the reform, town and village 
enterprises are faced with many challenges -- challenges from 
state-owned enterprises whose strength has been enhanced through 
the transformation of operating mechanisms and challenges from 
the private sector. With the introduction of the new tax 
system, the abolition of preferential policies on tax reductions 
and exemptions followed. This, in fact, has increased the tax 
burden on some town and village enterprises. But this should be 
viewed from another angle -- town and village enterprises have 
formed a flexible mechanism whereby they are responsible for 
their own decisions regarding management, for their own profits 
and losses, and for their own development and reform. 
Improvements and pressures, as well as the pressure of market 
competition, brought about by reform will prod the processing 
industries into readjusting the investment structure, the 
production setup, and the product mix. Therefore, we can say 
there are both difficulties and opportunities, but opportunities 
and hopes outstrip difficulties. 
  Hangzhou Mayor Wang Yongming, Ningbo Mayor Xu Yunhong, and 
Wenzhou Mayor Chen Wenxian also answered reporters' questions.

(7559 3219 5479)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- Deputy Gu Jinchi, 
secretary of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee who was 
attending the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC], said that launching the anticorruption drive is 
an important measure for properly handling the relationships 
among reform, development, and stability, that practical 
measures should be taken, and that unremitting efforts should be 
made for a protracted period of time to come. 
  Gu Jinchi said: Premier Li Peng drew applause from deputies 
when he touched on successfully launching the anticorruption 
drive in his government work report. It fully shows that the 
anticorruption drive is an issue of common concern to the masses 
of the people, and that the central authorities' decision to 
improve the building of a clean and honest government has won 
their resolute support. The current anticorruption drive has 
produced certain results, and the situation is good. However, 
we should be soberly aware that corruption among a small number 
of government functionaries is still relatively serious, that 
relevant policies and regulations drawn up by the central 
authorities have yet to be carried out to the letter, that the 
anticorruption task is still very arduous, and that we still 
need to be mentally prepared for making unremitting efforts for 
a protracted period of time to come. 
  Gu Jinchi believed that deepening reform, amplifying laws 
and 
regulations, and establishing an effective supervision and 
restriction system to prevent and eliminate corruption through 
the system are the fundamental measures for fighting corruption 
and advocating a clean and honest government. In this 
connection, he made three suggestions: 
  1. A clear distinction between the functions and powers of 
party committees and governments at all levels should be made in 
earnest during reform of organizations so as to define 
responsibilities and establish an appropriate supervision 
mechanism. Administration should be exercised in accordance 
with the laws and discipline; necessary restrictions will be 
imposed on the exercise of powers to eliminate the cause and 
spread of such corruption as shifting responsibility onto 
others, arguing back and forth, abusing power to seek personal 
gain, and taking bribes among relevant units and individuals 
when fulfilling their functions and exercising their powers. 
  2. A system that standardizes the management and use of 
personnel, funds, and materials, and makes public such 
management and use must be established to persist in a system of 
relying on supervision by the masses, to place those who 
exercise powers under public supervision, to enable people to 
inform those who violate regulations and abuse power to seek 
personal gains to the authorities, and to eradicate the 
environment of concealment upon which corruption subsists. 
  3. Restrictions should be imposed on those who indulge in 
the collection and spending of fees which are apt to make them 
reluctant to practice plain living and wage hard struggles or 
dishonest in the performance of official duties by adopting 
measures indirectly linked to the income of relevant personnel; 
a system for reporting the income of leading cadres for the 
record will be gradually implemented. Meanwhile, appropriate 
measures will be taken to stop concealed income and to plug the 
loophole that gives rise to corruption. 
  Deputy Gu Jinchi expressed the belief that so long as we 
take 
the correct road, we can achieve marked successes in the 
anticorruption drive and will surely be able to fulfill the 
objective determined by the central authorities.

  [Text] The Anhui delegation attending the Second Session 
of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] held a plenary 
meeting on 13 March to continue examination and discussion of 
the government work report. State Councillor Li Guixian 
attended the meeting and heard the deputies' views. Sun Qimeng, 
vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee, and members of the 
NPC Standing Committee Yang Jike and Yang Zhenhuai took part in 
the discussion. Deputies Wang Hanhua, Wang Yang, Wang Shengbao, 
Fang Yiben, and Wang Shixin expressed their views on such issues 
as [words indistinct] the reform of the banking, fiscal and 
taxation systems, commodity prices, and how to strengthen the 
role of agriculture as the foundation of national economy. 
  Zhou Zhengqing, NPC deputy and vice governor of the People's 
Bank of China, spoke on an issue about which people are 
concerned about -- the reform of the banking system. State 
Councillor Li Guixian spoke after hearing the deputies' views. 
He said: We will take your problems and suggestions back to 
our office for serious discussion and study. 
  On the government work report, Li Guixian said: The report 
is very clear. Its emphasis is to handle well the relationship 
among reform, development, and stability. Now, it won't do 
without reform and development, and reform and development 
cannot be accomplished without a stable environment. In light 
of the current situation, the party Central Committee has put 
forward the 20-character principle -- the principle of seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability. This is the stress of 
the work of the whole party and the whole country. The whole 
party and the people of all nationalities across the country 
should uphold the principle. At present, we are having a good 
opportunity of deepening reform and accelerating development. 
In order to achieve development, we must carry out reform and 
open up. We must reform the old structure and establish a new 
structure of socialist market economy. Only in this way can we 
accelerate development. All the reform measures promulgated 
this year are designed to lay a foundation for establishing 
socialist market economic structure. If these measures are not 
implemented well, we will be unable to establish the socialist 
market economic structure. For this reason, we must not fail in 
their implementation. We must promptly deal with new 
circumstances and problems which might crop up during the course 
of reform and development. [passage indistinct] 
  Li Guixian said: After the prices are decontrolled, we must 
not treat the price increase problem lightly. Effective 
measures must be adopted to curb price increases and stabilize 
the market. At the same time, we must solve well the problem 
concerning the livelihood of the workers and staff members of 
enterprises which suffer operating losses. We must also solve 
the problem of teachers' back pay. We must oppose waste and 
extravagance, reduce unnecessary spendings, and guarantee [words 
indistinct]. 
  The person in charge of the Ministry of Electronics Industry 
attended the meeting and heard the deputies' views.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jia Qinglin, NPC deputy and secretary of the </F>
Fujian provincial party committee, by XINHUA correspondents Pu 
Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Wu Yilong (1566 1150 7893)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- At the very moment when 
he met with these correspondents, Jia Qinglin, NPC deputy and 
secretary of the Fujian provincial party committee, failed to 
conceal his excitement, saying: "Premier Li Peng's report has 
voiced our innermost thoughts and feelings; now, with our 
development goals even more clearly defined, enthusiasm for work 
will be further enhanced." 
  Jia Qinglin stated: The greatest impression after hearing 
the government report is the necessity to correctly understand 
and firmly seize opportunities, maintain reform, obtain a 
foothold in development, and solidly quicken the pace of 
establishing a socialist market economic system to ensure a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development. 
  The year 1993 has been a proud year for the people of 
Fujian. 
Based on the flourishing economic development experienced over 
the previous 14 years, particularly 1992, Fujian's national 
economy continued its rapid and sound development in 1993. With 
province-wide gross domestic product [GDP] totalling 95.3 
billion yuan, a 25.4 percent increase over the previous year, 
Fujian has realized its goal of quadrupling the 1980 GNP seven 
years ahead of schedule. During this time, primary industry 
registered a 7.5 percent growth, secondary industry 41.8 
percent, and tertiary industry 19.7 percent. New headway was 
also made in reform, opening up, and all other social 
development undertakings. 
  "As Fujian's development over the past few years has shown, 
achieving a relatively greater and more rapid development is 
completely possible." This is Jia Qinglin's pragmatic 
attitude--full confidence and non-avoidance of questions. He 
said: Objectively speaking, we faced certain restraining factors 
in the course of development, such as shortages of funds, 
lagging transportation, insufficient energy, and the pressure of 
high inflation. However, on the whole and with favorable 
factors outnumbering unfavorable ones, Fujian is experiencing 
rare development. 
  Jia Qinglin maintained that currently Fujian has at least 
the 
following favorable development conditions: First, reform has 
been accelerated at all levels throughout the province, with the 
deepening of reform taking root in the hearts of the people. 
Second, over the past dozen years and more of reform and opening 
up, the pattern of diversifying major economic sectors has taken 
shape, while new economic growing points keep on emerging. A 
greater play of market regulations has injected vigorous 
vitality into the national economy. Third, opening up wider to 
the outside world has incessantly strengthened our capacity in 
international competition and cooperation, thus providing more 
room for provincial-wide economic development. Fourth, 
continued heavy investment in fixed assets in recent years; 
further enhancement of production capacities in energy, 
transportation, and raw and processed materials; increased 
incomes for both urban and rural residents; and greater demands 
for both investment and consumption will certainly further 
promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
  Turning to the future, Jia Qinglin said ambitiously: In 
terms of speed, it took Fujian seven years to double its GDP, 
and another six to quadruple it; judging from the current growth 
rate and relatively relaxed economic environment, it may take an 
even shorter period to secure an eight-fold increase. In terms 
of efficiency, Fujian has been maintaining its national lead in 
the composite industrial efficiency index in recent years. In 
light of the development of "high-yield, high-quality, and 
high-efficiency" agriculture--which has brought better 
efficiency as well as gradual and greater reliance on scientific 
and technological progress for economic development--the 
province's overall economic efficiency will be further enhanced. 
As long as we correctly handle relations between reform, 
development, and stability, and as long as we further tap the 
potential of speed and efficiency, Fujian will certainly find 
itself a more rapid and sounder way of economic development.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Xiamen city, one of 
China's five special economic zones, will be given legislative 
power at the ongoing session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress (NPC). 
  A draft bill for that purpose is being deliberated by the 
congress. When it becomes law, it will empower the Xiamen 
municipal people's congress and its Standing Committee and the 
Xiamen municipal government to enact laws and regulations for 
implementation in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone. That means 
Xiamen will have the same legislative power as a provincial 
legislature. 
  Xue Ju, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, made an 
explanation on an NPC draft decision on the question to the 
current NPC session. 
  In recent years, the Xiamen Special Economic Zone has become 
an important window for developing economic relations with 
Taiwan and the rest of the world. 
  Development of Xiamen requires that the special economic 
zone 
have the power to enact local laws and regulations, Xue Ju said. 
  Xue said local laws and regulations to be enacted by the 
Xiamen People's Congress and its Standing Committee shall follow 
the country's constitution and the basic principles of national 
laws and administrative regulations. They shall be submitted 
for the record to the NPC Standing Committee, the State Council 
and the Standing Committee of the Fujian provincial people's 
congress. 
  The Xiamen municipal government will be empowered to 
formulate regulations and decrees for implementation in the 
Xiamen Special Economic Zone. 
  A motion calling for giving Xiamen legislative power was 
raised by NPC deputies in 1989 and 1993, Xue said. 
  Zhang Binsheng, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of 
the Xiamen municipal people's congress, said the people of 
Xiamen will treasure and use the power judiciously.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese courts at all 
levels must strictly enforce laws and provide a powerful 
judicial guarantee for social stability, establishment of a 
socialist market economy, and a sustained, rapid and sound 
economic growth, China's top judge Ren Jianxin said today. 
  Delivering a report on the Supreme Court's work to the 
ongoing session of the National People's Congress [NPC], Ren, 
president of the Supreme People's Court, said, "Stability serves 
as an important guarantee for reforms and economic development." 
  In 1994, he said, all courts will continue to unswervingly 
crack down on serious criminal activities and better use 
judicial means to regulate economic relations and protect the 
legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens, and improve 
the explanation of new laws. 
  Reviewing last year's work, he said that, in 1993, Chinese 
courts tried 3.4 million cases of all kinds, including 400,000 
criminal cases, he said. 
  Courts meted out severe punishment to offenders of such 
crimes as murder, robbery, rape, explosion, kidnapping and 
roguery, he said, adding that organized crime was a prime target 
of the law. 
  The top judge said that last year courts convicted 230,000 
criminals on charges of seriously damaging state security and 
disrupting public order. 
  Meanwhile, courts mitigated sentences for, or released on 
probation, criminals who showed real repentance or performed 
meritorious deeds in reform through labor, with 230,000 
mitigation cases and 33,000 probation cases handled in 1993. 
  Courts at all levels speeded up the handling of cases 
involving economic crimes after the government decided to launch 
an anti- corruption campaign last year. 
  According to Ren, courts handled 27,463 such cases last year 
and concluded 27,323 ones. They gave verdicts to more than 
22,106 economic offenders, of whom 6,863 were sentenced to 
prison terms of five years or more, life in prison, death, or 
death with a reprieve. 
  He revealed that among the convicted were 69 county-level 
and 
seven bureau-level officials. 
  The top judge said that, in recent years, a number of 
government employees, including a very small number of 
officials, have abused their power to commit serious crimes of 
embezzlement, bribery and diverting public money for personal 
use, to public indignation. 
  Courts took as their main punishment target officials 
committing such crimes who worked in leading bodies of the 
Chinese Communist Party and the government, judicial 
departments, administrative law-enforcement departments and 
economic administrative departments. 
  With the growth of a socialist market economy, people's 
courts are in a better position to regulate economic relations. 
  In 1993, the number of lawsuits involving economic disputes 
rose substantially, with many new types of such lawsuits 
occurring, he said. 
  Last year courts handled 890,000 such lawsuits of the first 
instance, up 37 percent from 1992, involving a total amount of 
70.5 billion yuan. 
  Furthermore, with the development of China's foreign trade 
and marine transportation, the number of cases involving 
maritime disputes has risen steadily in recent years, Ren said. 
  In 1993, maritime courts handled a total of 1,830 such cases 
and concluded 1,607 ones. Courts at all levels also concluded 
1,311 economic cases involving foreign nationals or residents 
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. 
  Ren Jianxin said that in handling cases involving foreign 
parties, Chinese courts adhere to the principle of safeguarding 
national sovereignty, fully exercise China's jurisdiction, and 
protect, on the basis of equality, the legitimate rights and 
interests of both Chinese and foreign parties involved in 
accordance with international treaties signed or acceded to by 
China and by taking reference to internationally accepted 
practices. 
  "The prompt and proper trial of such cases is conducive to 
improving China's investment environment and to promoting 
foreign economic cooperation and trade," he said. 
  He said that, in 1993, Chinese courts attached greater 
importance to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of 
citizens and legal entities by various judicial means, and 
handled large numbers of cases involving the right of person and 
property rights. 
  Last year courts handled 2.08 million civil cases of the 
first instance, 61 percent of the total number of all types of 
cases of the first instance. 
  Of these handled, there was a sharp increase in the number 
of 
cases involving divorce, personal reputation, honor, 
nomenclature, name and portraits, disputes over labor contracts, 
wages, insurance, welfare and labor protection, debt, land 
development, housing sales and real estate mortgage. 
  Meanwhile, courts also re-tried a total of 73,121 criminal, 
civil, economic, administrative, civil and maritime cases that 
had been given verdicts since 1949, he said. 
  They changed verdicts for 14,271 cases that had been proven 
to be incorrect, he added.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- China's National 
People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee will give 
first priority to economic legislation this year in an effort to 
establish a legal system for a socialist market economy in China. 
  Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Tian Jiyun made 
the remark when delivering a work report of the NPC Standing 
Committee here today. 
  He said, as China has instituted this year more reform 
measures than before, it is necessary to guide, promote and 
guarantee reforms with law. This calls for accelerating 
legislation, especially economic legislation. 
  The five-year tenure of the eighth NPC is an important 
period 
for China to establish a socialist market economy and realize 
the second-phase goal of the modernization program. The NPC 
Standing Committee has worked out its work priorities in 
accordance with the general situation and tasks of the state: 
under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the Communist 
Party, to take the strengthening of a socialist democratic and 
legal system as its fundamental task, further improve the 
people's congress system, ensure enforcement of the Constitution 
and law, and push forward the development of a socialist market 
economy. 
  In the past year, the NPC Standing Committee formulated, 
amended and adopted 21 laws and law-related decisions, including 
13 relating to a socialist market economy, setting a record in 
legislative work. In addition, it approved 17 treaties, 
conventions and agreements signed with foreign countries or 
acceded to by China. 
  During the year, the NPC Standing Committee and the special 
committees assigned 37 inspection groups to examine the 
enforcement of 18 laws. At the same time, the Standing 
Committee heard and deliberated work reports on finance, foreign 
trade, education, anti-corruption and civil aviation submitted 
by the State Council, relevant departments, and the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate. 
  Tian noted that raising motions and suggestions is an 
important form for deputies to exercise their right to 
administer state affairs and help state organs accept people's 
supervision and improve their work. 
  At the first session of the eighth NPC last year, deputies 
put forward 611 motions. Ninety-three of the motions have been 
submitted to special committees for deliberation. Most of them 
relate to legislation. The remaining 517 motions were handled 
as suggestions and criticisms, and together with 2,325 pieces of 
suggestions, have had responses from relevant departments. 
  Development of exchanges with foreign parliaments is a 
component of state foreign affairs as well as an important task 
for the Standing Committee. In the past year, delegations 
headed by the chairman or vice chairmen of the NPC Standing 
Committee visited 26 countries, while the Standing Committee 
received visiting delegations of 37 parliaments or international 
parliamentarian organizations.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing said today the fundamental way to enable China's 
education to meet advanced international standards lies in 
carrying out reforms. 
  Speaking to members of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Li stressed 
the need to readjust the educational structure in line with the 
needs of a socialist market economy. 
  To this end, it is necessary to greatly improve basic 
education and vigorously develop vocational education in both 
urban and rural areas, he told a forum attended by CPPCC 
National Committee members. 
  Higher education should focus on improving teaching quality 
and running universities and colleges better, he said. 
  The vice-premier also emphasized the importance of research 
and teaching in basic science. 
  Li Lanqing also noted that universities and colleges must 
properly handle relations between development and stability. 
  He also appealed to mass media organizations to publicize 
the 
teachers law and make sure that local authorities do practical 
things for teachers.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China would continue 
to strengthen the building of its democratic and legal system by 
"speeding up legislation in the spirit of reform," China's top 
legislator said here today. 
  Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) 
Standing Committee and a member of the Political Bureau Standing 
Committee of the party Central Committee, said that at present 
more laws are being formulated to govern and ensure the smooth 
advance of the country's reform, opening to the outside world 
and establishment of a socialist market economy. 
  Qiao made the remarks in a group discussion of the Inner 
Mongolia delegation attending the ongoing session of the eighth 
NPC. 
  Qiao admitted that China's legislation lagged behind social 
and economic development despite noticeable achievements made 
over the past 15 years. Legislation should be speeded up to 
keep pace with development of the socialist market economy, he 
added. Qiao also called on local people's congresses to 
formulate more regulations in line the constitution and state 
laws. 
  People's congresses at various levels and their standing 
committees have the responsibility to supervise the work of 
governments and courts and procuratorates, Qiao said, adding 
that the ongoing deliberation of the government work report by 
deputies is not only a form of supervision but also a exercise 
of democracy. 
  In his speech Qiao also touched China's system of 
establishing minorities autonomous regions and economic 
development in areas densely populated by minority people. 
  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a region with good unity 
among different ethnic groups. The autonomy system introduced 
since the founding of New China has proved correct and conforms 
with China's conditions and also accords with the common wishes 
of the people and their fundamental interests. The system has 
helped boost local economies and retain ethnic cultural and 
tradition which are the common wealth of the Chinese nation. 
The Chinese nation should carry forward the good tradition of 
maintaining national unity and safeguarding the national 
unification, he said. 
  On regional economy, Qiao Shi said that Inner Mongolia has 
witnessed great progress politically, economically, culturally 
and in terms of national unity over the past 40-odd years. And 
the region could make full use of its rich resources and take 
advantage of the good relations among various ethnic groups to 
strive for greater achievements. 
  Qiao Shi expressed his appreciation of deputies' clear 
understanding of and support to the general task of correctly 
handling the relations between reform, development and 
stability, which is the theme of the session. Every reform 
measure has undergone meticulous consideration before it is put 
into effect, Qiao said, adding the measures would also be 
improved in implementation. 
  China's reform began from the coastal areas to gain 
experience and then proceeded to expand to other areas because 
of China's uneven development. Historically, the inland areas 
had been comparatively underdeveloped. However, so long as 
these areas give full play to their advantages, their gap with 
the coastal areas would be narrowed and common prosperity would 
finally be realized.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- A top Chinese leader 
poured scorn on empty talk and called for efforts to seek real 
effects through measures that really work. 
  "In the past we sometimes didn't do things correctly, not 
because our direction was wrong, but because we didn't have 
measures that really worked," said Li Ruihuan, chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC). 
  "Bragging, empty talk, erroneous talk having a semblance of 
correctness, and talk that is not mistaken but useless are all 
the 'evil habits of the cultural revolution' and must be done 
away with resolutely," he said at a group discussion by Tianjin 
deputies to the National People's Congress now in session in 
Beijing. Li once worked in Tianjin as mayor. 
  The central authorities have worked out major policies and 
principles, and the key issue now is to study measures that 
really work and pay attention to real effects in their 
implementation, said Li, who is also one of the top seven 
leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. 
  "Studying measures that really work means doing away with 
tricks -- measures that are hollow, flowery, sham or heretical; 
it means coming up with methods which really solve problems; 
paying attention to real effects means assessment of work on the 
basis of real results instead of lip-service," he said. 
  Li said, good measures come from a correct understanding of 
facts and a scientific summary of people's experience. 
Therefore, leaders at all levels must go to grassroots units, 
make thorough investigations, understand people's feelings, 
respect people's initiatives, pool people's wisdom, combine 
policies and principles with local conditions, and put forward 
concrete measures and effective methods. 
  "The desire to achieve real effects should become the point 
of departure, goal and criterion of our work," he said. 
  "Only by concentrating our time and energy on the study of 
problem-solving measures and the achievement of results can we 
overcome difficulties and make progress," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- The various delegations 
attending the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] held plenary meetings this morning and group 
meetings this afternoon to continue deliberating the government 
work report. Focusing on the task of making package 
improvements and breakthroughs in key areas in the reform of the 
economic structure for 1994, the deputies discussed in depth the 
relevant issues. They pointed out that it is necessary to 
concentrate more on reform; to pay attention to careful 
organization and overall coordination; to unite as one; and to 
work creatively so as to ensure essential progress for our 
reform this year. 
  Some leading comrades from the CPC Central Committee, the 
NPC 
Standing Committee, and the State Council participated in the 
discussion meetings of some of the delegations today. They 
joined the deputies in deliberating the work report and listened 
to their opinions and proposals. Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun; Wen 
Jiabao, alternate member of the Standing Committee of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau; and State Councillor Song 
Jian focused on agricultural production when they expressed 
their opinions while participating in the discussion meetings of 
the Jilin, Gansu, and Jiangsu delegations respectively. Tian 
Jiyun stressed: There will be overall stability only when there 
is stability in agricultural production and stability in the 
countryside; only when there is overall stability can reform in 
various areas be smoothly implemented and can development be 
promoted. People throughout the country, both at the top and at 
lower levels, must take agricultural development as a task of 
prime importance. Wen Jiabao stated: We must conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and those of the central conference 
on rural work; must stabilize and improve the party's basic 
policies for rural areas; must deepen rural reform; must ensure 
the implementation of various policies; and must further enhance 
the enthusiasm of the peasants by promoting rural economic 
development, by increasing peasants' income, and by promoting 
rural stability. Song Jian stressed: We should regard 
agricultural production as our basic strategy and pay particular 
attention to developing agriculture by relying on science and 
technology. 
  After hearing remarks by deputies from the Inner Mongolian 
delegation, Vice Premier Li Lanqing pointed out: This year's 
reform covers a broad spectrum and is very intensive. Time is 
pressing. This requires governments at all levels to effectively 
handle relations between reform, development, and stability 
while practically and realistically resolving problems appearing 
in the process of reform. Taking part in the Gansu delegation's 
discussion and deliberation, State Councillor Li Tieying said: 
Although there is quite a gap in the level of economic 
development between China's eastern and western regions, their 
understanding of reform and their efforts to accelerate reform 
should not differ. Accelerating reform and exploring new ideas 
suitable to the western region's development constitutes the 
fundamental approach to revitalizing the region's economy and 
narrowing the gap between east and west. Speaking at a meeting 
of the Liaoning delegation, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua paid special 
attention to the technological transformation of large and 
medium-sized enterprises. He suggested we must have a sense of 
urgency on this issue, undertake work every year, and make 
constant efforts to achieve technological progress and meet 
market demands. Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the 
CPC Central Committee, said at a meeting of the Shanxi 
delegation that effective measures must be taken to safeguard 
and ensure public order and social stability. 
  Taking part in the Taiwan delegation's discussion and 
deliberation, Vice Premier Qian Qichen said: Peaceful 
reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of all 
Chinese people. Any attempt or act to divide the motherland, no 
matter in what form, runs counter to the fundamental interests 
of the Chinese nation and is doomed to failure. He added: As 
long as people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait join hands to 
develop relations, the great cause of peaceful reunification of 
the motherland will surely be realized at an early date. 
  The reform programs to be launched by the state this year 
are greater in number and magnitude, broader and deeper in 
scale, and more difficult than those carried out previously. 
Therefore, deputies from various provinces emphasized: We must 
dare to make reforms and must seek ways for advance, 
coordinating efforts to effectively implement and publicize 
reform programs to ensure the achievement of concrete results. 
  Shandong delegate Jiang Chunyun stressed the need to devote 
more energies to studying, promoting, and carrying out reforms 
to ensure the smooth implementation of the central authorities' 
various reform programs. To this end, he said, we should pay 
particular attention to work in the following three aspects: 
First, we should further emancipate our minds and seek truth 
from facts, seeing to it that the thinking and concepts of 
cadres at all levels conform with the requirements for the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure. Second, 
we should enhance our awareness of the overall interests and 
correctly handle the relationships between individual and 
collective, local and national, and current and long-range 
interests. Third, we should fully mobilize and harness the 
enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people in 
reform. Guangxi delegate Zhao Fulin stated: We must fight an 
all-out battle because many of the reform programs already 
launched this year involve changes in ideology and concepts, 
innovations of system, and readjustment of interests. Hence, he 
called for courage and determination to overcome difficulties in 
reform, adding that people at higher and lower levels must work 
with one mind, consider the overall situation, and observe 
discipline. Henan delegate Li Changchun said: In brainstorming 
this year's reform programs, we must promote package reforms in 
the five areas of the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure, while simultaneously achieving breakthroughs 
in the two key areas of microeconomic market foundation and 
macroeconomic market system. Therefore, leaders at all levels 
should pay keen attention to promoting reforms, correctly 
handling the relationship between local and national interests, 
and earnestly implementing various macroeconomic regulatory and 
control measures. Jiangsu delegate Shen Daren said: In the 
course of introducing various reform measures, leaders at all 
levels should pay keen attention to investigations and studies, 
constantly keep abreast with new circumstances, promptly solve 
new problems, and earnestly summarize and popularize good 
experiences so as to promote reforms in a prudent and 
down-to-earth manner. 
  Many delegates stated views on specific reform programs. 
Sichuan delegate Guo Daiyi said the only way for invigorating 
large and medium state-owned enterprises lies in deepening 
reform, pointing out: First, we must straighten out the 
relationship between the enterprises and the state with regard 
to ownership; second, we must clearly define the relationship 
between the government and enterprises; third, we must reduce 
the financial burden the enterprises have to bear in supporting 
social undertakings; and fourth, we must establish mechanisms 
for the enterprises to exercise scientific management and raise 
economic efficiency. Stressing the need to accelerate reform of 
the financial system, Henan delegate Zhao Bingshen said: First 
of all, financial system reform must be synchronized with the 
transformation of the operating mechanisms of enterprises; 
second, it is necessary to standardize management systems while 
continuing to rectify financial order; third, it is necessary to 
go all out to pool funds lying idle in society to meet the 
demand of funds for economic growth; fourth, it is necessary to 
adhere to the policy of stressing efficiency and repayment 
capability in issuing loans; and fifth, it is necessary to 
increase efforts to transform specialized banks into commercial 
banks.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- The spokesman of the 
Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said today that the 
enforcement of the law on the protection of investment of Taiwan 
compatriots will promote the economic and trade exchanges 
between the mainland and Taiwan. 
  In his comment on the law approved by the Sixth Session of 
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC), Li Qingzhou, the spokesman of the office, noted that the 
law will further strengthen the confidence of Taiwan compatriots 
in investing in the mainland. 
  He said that the law, the first of its kind in the country, 
is significant in the economic and trade relations between the 
mainland and Taiwan and it marks an improvement of the 
mainland's protection of the investments of Taiwan compatriots. 
  In recent years, with the progress of the relations across 
the Taiwan Straits, the economic and trade relations between the 
two sides have become closer. 
  He said that Taiwan compatriots' investments in the mainland 
are on the increase. 
  In 1992, projects funded by Taiwan compatriots and 
investments in them exceeded the combined sum for past years. 
  In 1993, the number of newly-approved Taiwan 
businessmen-funded projects reached more than 10,000 and the 
contracted investment funds were more than 10 billion yuan. 
  He noted that investments from Taiwan compatriots have not 
only played an important role in economic development on the 
mainland, but also have become one of the important factors in 
promoting economic growth in Taiwan. 
  The spokesman stressed that the central government in China 
has always attached importance to the protection of the legal 
rights of Taiwan compatriots regarding mainland investments and 
has adopted preferential policies for such investments. 
  In 1988, the State Council issued the regulations on 
encouraging Taiwan compatriots to invest. 
  He said that the "law on the protection of investment of 
Taiwan compatriots" was based on the regulations and absorbed 
the suggestions from Taiwan compatriots and related sectors in 
Taiwan. 
  The spokesman said that his office will make efforts to 
encourage localities to enforce the law. 
  He said that the related authorized non-governmental 
organization is also willing to hold talks with its Taiwan 
counterpart on the question of the rights and interests of 
Taiwan businessmen on the mainland. 
  He stressed that it is a general trend to enhance the 
economic and trade exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan 
Straits and that the Chinese Central Government has always 
actively promoted economic and trade cooperation between the two 
sides. 
  He noted that the law passed by the NPC Standing Committee 
shows the sincerity of the central government in this aspect. 
  He called on Taiwan authorities to remove the obstacles to 
Taiwan compatriots' investing in the mainland.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent (Sun Jie); from the "News" </F>
program] 
  [Text] While attending the Jiangsu Delegation's 
deliberation of the government work report on 13 March, State 
Councillor Song Jian said: We should put agriculture in a 
strategic position and conscientiously apply science and 
technology to develop it. 
  Praising Jiangsu's achievements in various fields of 
endeavor, Song Jian stated: During the Spring Festivals I have 
spent in Jiangsu over the past two years, I witnessed its rapid 
development, which was very heartening. All provincial, city, 
county, and township cadres followed a clear ideology, adopted 
effective measures, and scored remarkable achievements. The 
economy has been thriving in many localities. Last year, 
Jiangsu's provincial gross product increased 18.5 percent, or 
5.1 percent more than the national growth rate. This remarkable 
feat explains the brilliant performance of the provincial party 
committee and provincial government. Moreover, Jiangsu adopted 
realistic measures in promoting development, such as efforts to 
minimize the use of crop lands in establishing economic 
development zones. By relying mainly on its resources, cadres, 
and people, Jiangsu has taken its own road of development with 
distinctive Chinese characteristics. 
  Song Jian discussed agriculture at length. He said: By the 
CPC's centenary in the next century, our population will 
probably reach 1.6 to 1.7 billion. To feed such a large 
population, we must increase the output of grain and farm 
products by 50 percent over the current level, thereby catching 
up with intermediate developed countries. To this end, we must 
imbue ourselves with a sense of urgency in developing 
agriculture. Due to various reasons, we did not pay sufficient 
attention to agricultural science research. From now on, we 
must further uphold the policy of relying on policies first, 
investments second, and science and technology third when 
developing agriculture. Governments at all levels should give 
top priority to agricultural basic research and development, and 
should increase investments in these areas. This will be 
crucial to scaling new heights in agricultural production over 
the next few years. Only a developed agriculture can support 
the nation and maintain sustained development and stability. 
  Underscoring the importance of popularizing agricultural 
science and technology, Song Jian added: We must grasp the work 
with two hands. On the one hand, we should allocate all-level 
financial resources to steadily popularize agricultural science 
and technology; on the other, we should develop and nurture new 
mechanisms for popularizing science and technology through 
innovations by the masses and in line with the requirements of a 
socialist market economy. He praised some localities for 
popularizing science and technology through integrating 
production, supply, and marketing; establishing associations of 
special trades; and introducing share-holding cooperative 
systems. 
  Discussing ways for implementing large-scale management in 
rural areas, Song Jian stated: We should encourage 
diversification and multi-polarization instead of practicing a 
single mode and demanding uniformity. On the issue of 
readjusting farm product prices, he said: Rural prosperity 
depends to a large extent on the prices of farm products. 
However, in the long run price hikes alone cannot promote 
prosperity. At the core of the issue is to increase rural labor 
productivity. All sectors of society should make more 
contributions to promoting high-tech in rural areas in order to 
facilitate the production of high industrial goods and gradual 
agricultural modernization.

  [Text] Moscow, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said Russia and the United States should 
enter into relations of partnership but both sides should have 
their independence. 
  The minister told the press before his meeting with visiting 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the Russian Far 
East city of Vladivostok that both Russia and the United States 
have no other choice but to enter into relations of partnership. 
However, such a relationship does not mean that one party 
should restrain its actions while the other enjoys much freedom. 
  He also rejected the idea that the U.S. is the senior 
partner 
while Russia is junior. 
  Russia-U.S. relations fell back in the past two months due 
to 
their different positions on the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict and 
the espionage issue. 
  The meeting between the two ministers is expected to focus 
on 
"mending bilateral relations" and on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Middle East issue. 
  Kozyrev said this meeting will provide a change for the two 
countries to establish their relations of strategic partnership 
on a mature basis. 
  He suggested that in establishing relations of partnership, 
Russia should not follow every step of the West and Russians 
should not have the idea that partnership means no conflict or 
problem between the two countries. 
  He noted that every pragmatic politician must understand two 
basic facts. Firstly, Russian is a big nation. Therefore, it 
should not be treated as a small brother but as an equal 
partner. Secondly, relations of partnership should not sacrifice 
Russia's policies of national interest. 
  The Russian foreign minister criticized the "wild fantasy" 
by 
some people of regarding the United States as "the sole leader 
of the present world." 
  He said in the present world the U.S is not able to solve 
every problem by its own. Russia, though is facing many 
difficulties, is still a big power in that it has nuclear 
weapons as well as a strong military force, he added.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Russia today appeared 
to be supporting an agreement reached by Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats by calling on the Bosnian Serbs to "seriously study" the 
accord. 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin said during 
a 
meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic here that the 
agreement concluded between Bosnian Muslims and Croats in 
Washington on March 1 to set up a federation could help solve 
the Bosnian conflict. 
  According to the agreement, Bosnian Serbs will be invited to 
join the federation. 
  U.S. Presidential Envoy for Bosnia Charles Redman last week 
met with Churkin in London, asking the latter to persuade the 
Serbs to join the U.S.-sponsored peace plan. 
  Churkin has been shuttling between Zagreb, Sarajevo, Pale 
and 
Belgrade. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev met Monday in 
Vladivoskok to discuss newly-emerging problems between the two 
countries. 
  The two foreign ministers agreed in their talks that the two 
countries should continue to seek cooperation in international 
issues including Bosnia and the Middle East. 
  In another development, UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia 
lieutenant General Michael Rose arrived at the Tuzla airport to 
inspect the work under way to reopen the airport for 
humanitarian relief supplies. 
  The Bosnian Serbs agreed to end the siege of the airport on 
March 1 on condition that Russia sends observers to guarantee 
that the airport only be used for relief supplies. 
  But the date of the airport's reopening has not been set 
yet.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors today left the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) after two weeks of inspections 
of the country's nuclear facilities. 
  They declined to talk about the inspection process and said 
that results will not be released immediately. 
  The inspection of seven of the nine DPRK nuclear sites was 
agreed to in a February-15 accord between the IAEA and the DPRK. 
Pyongyang described the accord as one aimed at ensuring nuclear 
safety. 
  The IAEA is expected to negotiate with the DPRK on 
inspection 
of the remaining two nuclear facilities to verify that the DPRK 
is not developing nuclear weapons. 
  The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency suspects that the DPRK 
is developing nuclear weapons in the two facilities. 
  The United States has made the implementation of IAEA 
inspections one of the conditions for opening the third 
U.S.-DPRK high-level meeting, scheduled for March 21 in Geneva.

  [Text] Detroit, March 14 (XINHUA) - President Bill Clinton, 
opening the jobs summit of the Group of Seven nations here 
today, urged Japan and Europe to stimulate their economies for 
jobs creation. 
  In his speech, the President hinted that the restrictions of 
domestic demand in Japan and the high interest rates in Europe, 
especially in Germany, were part of the reason for the high 
unemployment rates in the West. 
  "Have we balanced our fears of inflation with the need for 
economic growth?" Clinton asked the G-7 delegates, which include 
economic, finance, labor and trade ministers of the world's 
major industrial nations. 
  "One lesson is clear," Clinton said. "There is no rich 
country on Earth that can expand its own job base and its income 
unless there is global economic growth." 
  In previous G-7 meetings, Clinton said, the U.S. was 
criticized for its high budget deficit. And now, with deficit 
on decline and 2.1 million new jobs created in the past 13 
months, the U.S. should be proud, Clinton said. 
  The President, meanwhile, asked the participants to talk 
together "openly and honestly" about the problems of growth. 
  "Every advanced nation is facing that choice between hope 
and 
fear, between stagnation and change, between closing up and 
opening up," Clinton said. "America has chosen the path of 
change." 
  He said that while the U.S. should continue to bring its 
deficit down, Japan should increase domestic demand, Europe 
should continue to work for lower interest rates "so that these 
three things together can spark a new round of worldwide growth 
which will create more economic activity and more jobs." 
  The President said that trade was not a zero-sum game. In 
the U.S., the export-related jobs pay on average 22 percent more 
than the jobs that have nothing to do with exports. 
  The President also asked the summit to address the three 
challenges: training high-skilled workers to meet job changes, 
increasing productivity without shedding workers, and ensuring a 
social safety net for workers, from health care, welfare, 
training to family leave and child care. 
  "We cannot turn away from the notion that modernization is 
the key to employment," he said, adding that the trick for the 
government and private sector was to keep finding new area that 
productivity will succeed. 
  "If we allow ourselves for a minute to try to resist the 
growth of productivity, we are in deep trouble," the President 
said.

<F P=106> ["Feature": by Wang Nan "U.S. Motown Crackles With Energy] </F>
  [Text] Detroit, Michigan, March 13 (XINHUA) -- For Lorrie 
Carlton, a Detroit resident since her teenage years, the late 
1980's was a piece of sad memory for the city and its people. 
  "At that time, it was the highest in unemployment and the 
lowest in self-esteem," she said of the America's "motown", 
whose recent fate is a mix of decline and rebound. 
  When the leaders of the Group of Seven Nations (G-7) 
gathered 
at the sprawling Cobo Center today for the first jobs summit, 
the city, however, was crackling with the excitement and energy 
that it hadn't witnessed in a long time. 
  With the country's auto industry, now more lean, efficient 
and profitable then 10 years ago, on a steady and forceful way 
back, Detroit, long a manufacturer's showcase for America, is 
finding itself on the world map again. 
  The big three automakers are all headquartered in and near 
Detroit and are the major employers in the metropolitan area, 
with total population at four million. They all turned profits 
in 1993, the first time since the recession. 
  "The city is going through a fundamental, very deep, and 
sometimes very painful changes. Now it is in a Renaissance," 
said Robert Giles, editor of the DETROIT TIMES. 
  When President Clinton announced last month that Detroit 
would be the venue for the G-7 jobs summit, he praised Detroit 
as a city "reaching out to the future in investment and economic 
growth." 
  Detroit's turnaround, local people said in recent 
interviews, 
came along with the painful restructuring of auto industry and 
the gradual adaptation to a new world economy characterized with 
intense global competition. 
  The city's new mayor Dennis Archer, in his widely supported 
campaign last year, said that Detroit's "only choice is to face 
the challenge of global competition head-on, and continually 
improve ourselves so that we will be competitive in this global 
economy." 
  The state of Michigan, where the city of Detroit is the 
capital, lost some 100,000 jobs out of its 900,000-people 
workforce in the 1980's in wake of corporate downsizing. 
  "Jobs have come back into the auto industry and its related 
suppliers industry, although not at the rate they would have 
been in the 1960's and 1970's," said Von Logan, the deputy 
director on finance and management in the Michigan Employment 
Security Commission. 
  Unemployment rate, the core subject for the two-day G-7 
meeting, was as high as 15.5 percent in Detroit in the whole of 
1980's, one of the highest across the nation. It now dropped to 
eight percent, a little above the national average. 
  Detroit remains a small town, then a small city until well 
into this century when Henry Ford put together a group of 
technical experts to mass-produce cars that provided mass jobs 
for workers with even minimal skills. 
  "Detroit's workers are already beyond the no-brain, 
repetitive tasks that Henry Ford pioneered in the 1920's," said 
John Lippert, a FREE LABOR PRESS writer. "We're working in 
teams, learning new skills in space-age factories." 
  "We're a symbol of hope: we changed. We're tough. We're 
competitive," he said. 
  Worker retraining, central issues for the G-7 summit, are 
being tested in Detroit with praise. "We have a change in the 
complexion of the workforce," said Ron Dix, manager of Marketing 
Communications for Detroit Center Tool Inc.. 
  The United Auto Workers (UAW) and the big three automakers 
have established job training funds to help the workers laid off 
from auto assembly lines to learn another skill and find a new 
job. "It's not easy," said UAW's president Owen Beiber. 
  Called the Labor Market Information On-Line, the city's job 
service is no longer satisfied with merely providing the 
insurance benefits of 293 U.S. dollars for a newly dislocated 
worker for 26 weeks. All the people need now is a computer and 
a modem and they can have access to the on-line system. 
  Connecting the heartland of America with Canada, the U.S. 
largest trading partner, Detroit is now not only a world leader 
in automobiles and transportation manufacturing, but also moving 
high gear on the information superhighway. 
  "Not only do we build cars here, we are also the center of 
automotive research and development," said John Engler, the 
governor of Michigan. 
  Detroit, where a black man invented the traffic light some 
100 years ago, "stopped at the red light for too long, and now 
it goes green," said Bill Kast, chairman of the Michigan 
International Trade Authority. 
  The automotive centers located in the city now include those 
those of Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Hyundai, 
Nissan, Volkswagen and Saturn. "They help our business to be 
more efficient and competitive," Governor Engler told reporters 
who came to cover the G-7 summit. 
  Many people, on the other hand, are looking at the other 
side 
of the city - its rising criminal offenses, more young people 
out of work too early, and the painful restructuring of local 
economy that sees no end. 
  "It's the here and now that matters most to many 
Detroiters," 
commented a recent editorial of the METRO TIMES, a weekly local 
newspapers on the highly publicized jobs summit. 
  "We should be aware that how fragile this recovery is now," 
Timothy Leuliette, senior vice president of ITT Corp., said at a 
seminar on Sunday [13 March]. "Not everyone is taking part in 
the recovery." 
  In Detroit, 46.7 percent of the black kids cannot find jobs. 
Thousands of auto workers are now seeing a decline of their 
wages. 
  Others complain that the city's adaptation to a new world 
"now that Detroit's automotive heyday has passed, we think of it 
as being as ancient and as hopeless as the Roman Empire. 
Nothing could be further from the truth," said Jack 
Lessenberry, a local columnist.

  [Text] Washington, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Secretary of 
Defense William Perry said today that the United States should 
have a "hedge strategy" against a scenario when Russia turns 
militaristic and hostile to the West. 
  During a speech at the George Washington University, Perry 
said U.S. policy toward Moscow should be based on the principles 
of realism and pragmatism. 
  Terming U.S.-Russian ties as a "pragmatic partnership," 
Perry 
said there is "a great variety of morbid symptoms" in Russia 
when the country is trying to dismantle the controls of the 
previous system. 
  He listed the "morbid symptoms" as a deeply divided 
political 
system with profoundly disaffected elites; economic uncertainty 
and social dislocation. 
  These facts, in the worst circumstances, would lead Russia 
to 
"emerge from her turbulence as an authoritarian, militaristic, 
imperialistic nation, hostile to the west." 
  "In such a situation, we could indeed see a renewal of some 
new version of the old Cold War, Russia without the Warsaw pact 
but still with a formidable nuclear arsenal," Perry said. 
  In light of the "stark realities," the defense chief said, 
Washington should try to influence events in Russia to a 
positive outcome while being prepared to deal with a negative 
outcome. 
  He described some of the elements in U.S. defense planning 
that are not justified by current threats but needed as a "hedge 
against the possibility of a negative outcome" in Russia: 
  -- While implementing the provisions of the First Strategic 
Arms Reduction Treaty (START), the United States would hold off 
reductions stipulated under the second start treaty until "we 
see comparable reductions being made in Russia." 
  -- The Pentagon would maintain a "minimum essential defense 
industrial infrastructure" so that it could have the capability 
to reconstruct "key elements." 
  -- It would maintain a "minimal" production and research and 
development capability for nuclear weapons, while the Pentagon 
is reducing the nuclear stockpile. 
  -- The Pentagon would continue building nuclear submarines 
even though current threat and replacement needs don't justify 
building new submarines until the year 2000. 
  On Wednesday, Perry will start a week-long trip to Russia, 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. 
  While in Russia, he plans to meet with government as well as 
leaders of the parliament's military and foreign affairs 
committees.

  [Text] United Nations, March 14 (XINHUA) -- 
Secretary-General Butrus has recommended that the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) be strengthened considerably in order to 
demilitarize Sarajevo and keep the peace in central Bosnia. 
  In a report to the Security Council issued today, he said 
UNPROFOR needed extra 8,250 troops, 150 military observers and 
275 police monitors. 
  The council, in resolution 900 passed earlier this year, had 
asked the secretary-general to appoint an official to help 
restore normal life in Sarajevo, and to report on procedures to 
extend UN protection to the towns of Maglaj, Mostar and Vitez. 
  The secretary-general said 2,200 of the extra troops would 
be 
needed in and around Sarajevo, 6,050 in central Bosnia, 
including Mostar and Vitez, and further 1,500 would be needed if 
the council were to extend the safe-area concept to Maglaj. 
  He warned that UNPROFOR currently lacked the military 
resources to achieve its objectives and could lose the 
initiative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite numerous 
opportunities for progress. 
  The secretary-general said UNPROFOR's mandate would have to 
be modified if member states did not provide the necessary 
personnel. 
  "It would be a tragedy for the people of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina if the present opportunity were lost for lack of 
resources," he concluded.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Gong Zhenxi: "Russia Back to Peace </F>
Drive"] 
  [Text] Tunis, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Russia has been making 
an all-out diplomatic effort in the Middle East since the Hebron 
massacre, with its envoys frequently touring the region to put 
forward initiatives for reviving PLO-Israeli peace talks. 
  The latest tour of Israel and Tunisia made by Russia's 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev made it crystal clear that 
Russia has been back to the Middle East peace drive. 
  Since peace negotiations were first set in motion in Madrid 
in October 1991, Russia's role has not been particularly 
significant as Russia's participation has only been in 
accordance with formalities. 
  Now, Russia is not anymore hesitant to take attitudes which 
are inconsistent with those taken by the United States. 
  It also stressed that it could take advantage of its 
traditional influence with Palestinians and some Arab countries 
to help revive the PLO-Israeli peace negotiations, suspended 
since the Hebron massacre of at least 30 Palestinian worshippers 
in Ibrahimi Mosque on February 25. 
  Russia has declared that it supports the Palestinian demands 
of providing protection for the Palestinian people in the 
occupied lands and has proposed that another international 
conference, along the lines of the Madrid Conference, be held to 
break the stalemate of the peace talks, though the U.S. and 
Israel have rejected this proposal. 
  Kozyrev toured Israel and Tunisia Friday [11 March] for 
talks 
with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat on ways of continuing PLO-Israeli negotiations, with 
emphasis on the draft resolution put to the U.N. Security 
Council on the Hebron massacre. 
  After his talks with 'Arafat, Kozyrev said the PLO chairman 
has signaled willingness to continue negotiating with Israel, 
while 'Arafat said that the Palestinian leadership expects 
obvious and explicit guarantees from the co-sponsors of the U.S. 
and Russia for safeguarding the Palestinian people in the 
occupied Arab territories as well as Islamic and Christian 
shrines. 
  As Kozyrev was having talks with 'Arafat in Tunis, Russia's 
representative to the U.N. put forward a draft resolution on the 
Hebron massacre to the Security Council. 
  Official Palestinian sources said that the U.S. and Israel 
said they are not satisfied with the provisions of the draft 
resolution on the Hebron massacre now discussed by the Security 
Council, but they are ready to accept it should the PLO be 
committed to continuing PLO-Israeli negotiations. 
  The sources said that the draft resolution condemns the 
Hebron massacre, calls for international presence in the 
occupied Arab territories and urges the Israeli Government to 
take further measures to disarm Jewish settlers in the occupied 
lands. 
  The resolution also asks the U.S. and Russia to monitor the 
implementation of the resolution, which is expected to be voted 
Monday. 
  Tunis-based Arab diplomatic sources said that Russia's 
flurry 
of diplomatic activity in the Middle East can further strengthen 
the Palestinians' attitude and exert pressure on Israel and the 
U.S. to help speed up the Middle East peace process.

<F P=106> ['News Analysis' by Zhang Dacheng: "Will Iraq Find Normandy </F>
To Break UN Oil Embargo?" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Baghdad, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Defying the United 
Nations trade sanctions imposed since August 1990, Iraq last 
week sent its first high-ranking official delegation to Paris on 
post-sanction oil export and cooperation with major French 
companies. 
  Will Baghdad find a Normandy to make a flank breakthrough of 
the oil embargo? 
  Observers here noted that Iraq's latest move signaled a new 
strategy in its anti-sanction drive, namely, to open a flank 
battlefield outside the U.N. resolutions framework by selling 
oil profits to certain states in private. 
  When U.S. President Bill Clinton took office at the White 
House in January 1993, Iraq changed its early post-Gulf-war 
policy toward the U.N. which was characterized by passive 
cooperation and positive resistance, pinning great hope on the 
new commander-in-chief of the pro-sanction coalition. 
  However, Iraq turned back to the U.N. again following the 
U.S. missile attack against Baghdad in June and adopted a new 
policy of "weapons for oil." As a result, the country in 
November accepted U.N. Resolution 715 which calls for long-term 
monitoring of Iraq's weapons industries. 
  While asserting its full compliance with all relevant U.N. 
resolutions, in particular Resolution 687, Iraq has been 
launching a campaign to press for a U.N. commitment to Article 
22 by closing the chapter of weapons destruction and monitoring 
and opening a new one to allow Iraqi oil exports. 
  The U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with the 
weapons 
issues, however, answered that there are still doubts about 
Iraq's weapons-related information and that an observation of 
the monitoring mechanism was a must for an indefinite period. 
  In addition, the U.S. and its Western allies tried to attach 
to the precondition for lifting the sanctions Iraq's recognition 
of Kuwait's sovereignty and boundary and resolving the issues of 
the Kurds and Shiite Moslems. 
  Disappointed at the futility of its sacrifice in the main 
battle field, Iraq began earlier this year shifting its focus to 
a flank battlefield in an effort to break the sanctions, which 
are pushing Iraq to an endless abyss. It resumed oil sales to 
certain ex-partners. 
  Observers said that such an action is well based on Iraq's 
abundant oil reserves and on the contradictions between the 
anti-Iraq coalition members. 
  The basic reason for maintaining the sanctions is not Iraq's 
failure in fully compliance with the U.N. resolutions, but the 
West countries' failure in compelling Baghdad to guarantee their 
post- sanction interests in the Gulf region and particularly in 
Iraq, which possesses the second largest oil reserves in the 
world. 
  The United States, which has gained great profits from the 
oil-rich Gulf states since the 1991 Gulf war, is facing 
ever-increasing economic conflicts with the West European 
countries, which are not content with their status quo in the 
Gulf. 
  In fact, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, 
Japan, South Korea and others have never stopped their secret 
deals with Iraq, each planning to gain great profits from the 
post-sanction Iraqi oil exports and economic reconstruction. 
  Choosing France, whose oil imports from Iraq after the 
sanctions accounted for one-third of its total, as the Normandy 
for opening the second battlefield, Iraq hoped to lure more to 
follow and finally disintegrate the pro-sanction coalition. 
  Iraq's strategy is to take concerted actions in both 
battlefields. 
  If it succeeds in the flank battlefield, the U.N. sanctions 
will collapse automatically, if not, the potential benefit 
gainers will intercede for an early lifting of the sanctions 
against Iraq. 
  On the other hand, Iraq has also enhanced its efforts in the 
main battlefield. 
  Iraqi President Saddam Husayn Sunday [13 March] called for 
an 
immediate lifting of the sanctions or Iraq will end them on its 
own. Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Riyad al-Qaysi is on a 
mission to Russia, China, France and other members of the 
Security Council. And Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz is 
expected to hold Tuesday a new round of talks with UNSCOM 
chairman Rolf Ekeus on ending the sanctions. 
  However, the U.S. will not allow an easy flank breakthrough 
of the sanctions to happen in the near future. It will 
coordinate its stance with the West European allies to guarantee 
their long-term interests in Iraq and the Gulf region at large. 
  Moreover, Iraq's Gulf neighbors will inevitably stand in the 
way of an early lifting of the sanctions, not only because the 
potential threat to their safety has not been eradicated, but 
also because Iraq's re-entry into the oil market will reduce 
their profits. 
  It can be predicted that Iraq still has a difficult way 
ahead.

<F P=106> ["Special feature" by Shao Ling (6730 7227): "China Takes </F>
Steps To Revamp Banking System"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong 10 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A piece 
of information from Beijing states that the People's Bank of 
China recently refused to make loans to the Finance Ministry to 
clear the national debt. A person in charge of the bank pointed 
out that the state budgetary deficits must be covered through 
issuing state treasury bonds. Earlier, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, 
who is also governor of the People's Bank of China, said: "No 
bank should be treated as a teller or an accountant for the 
government or a government department." All the above 
information suggests that China is trying to set up a relatively 
independent Central Bank, policy-related banks, and commercial 
banks, so as to meet the needs of the market economy and bring 
about the convergence of China's financial system with the 
international financial system. 
  Without doubt, the first step China is to take in financial 
reform is to change the People's Bank of China into a real 
Central Bank, to set up policy-related banks, and to change 
professional banks into commercial banks. As the central bank, 
the People's Bank of China will have two major functions: 
Stabilizing the currency and supervising financial matters. In 
the future, the People's Bank will not provide funds to 
government departments or supply money directly to industrial 
and commercial enterprises to help solve their problems. 
Instead, it will focus on the efficient exercise of its powers 
to supply money, adjust reference interest rates, manage central 
funds, and control the total amount of credit, while the 
functions of its branches will include supervising and managing 
financial matters, conducting investigations, compiling 
statistics, making analyses, laterally adjusting the money 
supply [heng xiang tiao cun tiao ji 2897 0686 7333 1407 6148 
0495], managing the state treasury, providing funds, controlling 
foreign exchange, and settling combined accounts. 
  The second step is to set up three policy-related banks -- 
the State Development Bank, the China Agricultural Development 
Bank, and the China Import and Export Credit Bank -- which will 
be placed under the supervision of the central bank. The three 
banks will have their capital provided by the Finance Ministry; 
they also can raise money through issuing bonds to banking 
institutions. The sole function of these three banks is to 
provide loans on government instructions for the purposes of 
production, development, and foreign trade. They are expected 
only to break even, rather than to make profit. 
  The third step is to gradually change the existing 
professional banks into real commercial banks. The Bank of 
China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the 
Agricultural Bank of China, and the People's Construction Bank 
of China, which are existing professional banks on the mainland, 
gradually will be transformed into commercial banks. A number 
of commercial banks have been set up on the mainland over the 
last few years, including the Communications Bank of China, the 
CITIC (China International Trust and Investment Corporation) 
Industrial Bank, the Everbright Bank, the Huaxia Bank, the 
Zhaoshang Bank, the Fujian Xingye Bank, the Guangdong 
Development Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, and the 
Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. The total capital of all 
these national and regional commercial banks, some of which are 
collectively owned or joint-stock enterprises, has reached 100 
billion yuan. These banks enjoy a more rapid capital turnover 
and a higher rate of loan recovery because they only provide 
mortgage loans under their systems of fund management. However, 
as these banks have gone into operation for a short period and 
the government has yet to formulate appropriate laws for 
commercial banks, their management remains to be standardized 
and improved. 
  While commenting on changing the way the bank operates, Wang 
Qiren, chairman of the board of directors of the Bank of China, 
believed that it is necessary to draw on the experience of 
foreign banks, especially commercial banks in Hong Kong and 
Macao. He said: "The mainland and Hong Kong banking industries 
have built closer and closer relations. A total of 13 Hong Kong 
banks have set up 35 branches, 24 offices, and six joint-venture 
banking institutions on the mainland, while various mainland 
professional banks, such as the Bank of China and the People's 
Construction Bank of China, also have set up branches in Hong 
Kong. It is necessary to make appropriate use of Hong Kong 
commercial banks' experience in management and operation. 
However, we must change the operational mechanism gradually." 
  Since the beginning of this year, the National People's 
Congress has stepped up financial legislation and will 
promulgate the "Law of the People's Bank of China," the "Banking 
Law of the People's Republic of China," the "Law on Commercial 
Banks," the "Stock Law," and the "Bill Law" in turn, indicating 
that China is planning to put banking system reform onto a legal 
basis.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 12 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
financial official outlined the country's plan to develop the 
securities market in the fourth members' meeting of the Shanghai 
Stock Exchange (SSE) today. 
  Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission (CSRC), said that the planned new issuance of 5.5 
billion yuan in shares for 1994 will be conducted in accordance 
with market situations. They will be floated in the latter part 
of this year or next year. 
  This year, the state-owned and corporate-owned shares won't 
be listed on the exchange for trading due to the current limited 
conditions. And no stock revenue tax will be levied, Liu added 
in his address to over 1,000 delegates from all over the country. 
  This SSE meeting will also discuss its working report and 
budget project, revise its regulations and elect its board of 
directors. 
  In 1993, the Shanghai equity market developed into a 
national 
market, with brisk state bond transactions, its upgrading of 
trading facilities and steady rises in B stocks.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- The establishment of a 
legal entity's property system in major state-owned enterprises 
does not mean privatization, according to a leading economist. 
  Wang Jue, an economics professor at the Beijing-based Party 
School of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said 
that in instituting a modern enterprise system, major state 
enterprises will have multiple principal holders of their 
property rights, instead of just one principal holder, that is, 
the state. 
  The change is vital to the success of enterprise 
restructuring, said Wang, who is attending the current session 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference. 
  Under a planned economy, a state enterprise operated as a 
subsidiary of a government administrative department, without 
the status of a legal entity, he said. [sentence as received] 
  According to Wang, in fact, the transformation of their 
operational mechanism by state enterprises means turning state 
property into the property of a legal entity. 
  "The state will sever its administrative ties with 
enterprises by permitting legal entities to invest in 
enterprises. Only in this way can we increase enterprises' 
competitiveness," he said. 
  The government may either entrust investment companies to 
operate state-owned property or lease such property to these 
companies, he said. 
  These companies will become legal entities entrusted by the 
state to make sure that state-owned property will not be 
infringed and will increase in value, he explained. 
  The economist also stressed the importance of separating the 
ownership of the investor (the state) from that of a legal 
entity (an enterprise). 
  Under given conditions, the ownership of the investor takes 
the form of holding the stock right by the investor, he said. 
  That means that as a shareholder, the investor should have 
the right to receive returns from its assets and to participate 
in making policy decisions and choosing managers, he explained. 
  As a result, the investor will become a shareholder of the 
enterprise, represent the people or perform the duties of a 
property owner on behalf of the state, he said. 
  "Therefore, state enterprises will not change their nature, 
but will change their managerial and operational methods only," 
he noted. 
  Only thus is it possible to create necessary conditions for 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system, he said. 
  It is very difficult for major state enterprises to solve 
such problems as unemployment resulting from the transformation 
of their operational mechanism, he said. 
  According to Wang Jue, the solution to such problems lies in 
taking comprehensive measures by both the government and society. 
  First of all, the state should assist a number of key 
enterprises in expanding their capacity and providing more jobs. 
  Second, the state should earmark funds to help retirees, 
veteran workers and the disabled solve their problems in their 
livelihood. 
  "In my opinion, the money should not be given to 
individuals, 
but should be used to invest in joint-stock companies so as to 
draw dividends," he said. 
  Third, it is necessary to encourage some workers to shift to 
the service sector. 
  The economist also emphasized the need to establish more 
foundations and various other organizations to alleviate the 
burden of state enterprises in running social welfare. 
  "I am sure that with the implementation of these 
supplementary reform measures, major state-owned enterprises 
will certainly be able to operate efficiently," he said.

<F P=106> [By Cai Hong: "Private Businesses Play a Subsidiary Role"] </F>
  [Text] China's private sector has made unprecedented 
economic gains during the past two years, according to a poll 
released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. 
  The sample investigation of 1,432 private enterprises found 
that their economic returns are often better than those of 
collectively- owned firms and State establishments due to 
various reasons. 
  "The survey is a complete nationwide study of private 
businesses because it includes Tibet," said Lu Xueyi, director 
of the Department of Sociology of the academy. 
  Private enterprises in China are defined as those 
established 
with private capital and employing eight or more people. 
  "The private sector has proved to be a subsidiary to the 
other two," said Li Ding, director of the Society of Chinese 
Private Economy. On the other hand, it also turns out to be a 
rival. 
  In Guangdong Province alone, private businesses and the 
self- 
employed paid 1.7 billion yuan ($195 million) in taxes during 
the first half of 1993, sharing 11 per cent of the province's 
revenues. 
  By June of 1993, there were 184,000 registered private firms 
employing 2.9 million workers. The private businesses engaged 
in the service industry numbered 76,000, an increase of 130 per 
cent over the same period in 1992. 
  The growth of the private economy, however, varies from 
region to region in China. 
  East China shares 60 per cent of the nation's private 
economy, leaving 30 to the central region and a shoestring 10 
per cent to the West. 
  According to the State Administration of Industry and 
Commerce, there were 23,800 new registrations of private 
enterprises in 1993, an increase of 70 per cent over the 
previous year. 
  These figures, however, are superficial, since some private 
firms use the names of collectively-run companies, joint 
ventures or the self employed to obtain preferential treatment 
or gain maximum profits . 
  The private firms in the survey had been in business for an 
average of five years and eight months. Their registered 
capital grew by more than 30 per cent in 1992. 
  "The growth rate may plummet to 20 per cent this year as the 
development of the private sector stabilizes," said Dai 
Jianzhong, deputy director of the Department of Sociology of the 
Beijing Academy of Social Sciences. 
  The survey notes that owners of private enterprises are 
usually better off than common salary earners. 
  Every 100 families of private entrepreneurs for example owns 
136 colour TV sets, far more than the average 75 in China's 
cities and towns. 
  The income of private entrepreneurs comes from wages and 
shared bonuses. The annual earnings of an owner of a private 
business on average amounted to nearly 92,000 yuan ($10,600), 
about 20 times higher than an individual salary earner. 
  The survey found that private entrepreneurs spent most of 
their profits expanding their ventures rather than squandering 
them on non-essentials. 
  Slightly more than 12 per cent of the private business 
owners 
in urban areas were technicians before switching to the private 
sector, 22 per cent previously were government workers, 25 per 
cent were rank-and-file workers, and 17 per cent came from 
farming backgrounds. 
  According to the Department of Sociology of the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences, 120,000 government workers joined 
the contingent of employees in corporations in 1992 alone. A 
number of them have turned out to be private entrepreneurs. 
  Private entrepreneurs have a higher educational level than 
the average worker in China. Slightly more than 70 per cent of 
them are high school graduates. Nearly 17 per cent have had 
higher education. 
  The reasons for these people's fashionable "xiahai" -- 
risking their fortune by running a business -- differ. 
  More than 56 per cent of them left their former work places 
because "they found it hard to realize their full potential." 
Nearly 20 per cent, however, were "looking forward to making 
more money." 
  One-family-and-two-systems pattern is an operating feature 
in 
working families. When the husband runs a private business, the 
wife usually keeps their relationship with public ownerships -- 
continuing to work in State or collectively-owned institutions. 
  It indicates that they are not yet prepared to expose both 
of 
them to the forces of the market economy. 
  It is interesting, the survey reported, that contact among 
private entrepreneurs is rare. They were likely to make friends 
with government functionaries, enterprise managers and 
technicians. 
  According to the survey, private entrepreneurs spent nearly 
22 per cent of their salary on entertainment, a lifestyle 
different from wage earners. They believe that social 
interaction is integral to their businesses. 
  According to Dai, private entrepreneurs have a "clearer" 
assessment of themselves. 
  Sixty-five per cent of the private entrepreneurs claimed to 
be members of the mainstream, while 30 per cent agreed with the 
statement, "we earned a higher income." Only 5 per cent were 
not satisfied with their "lower" income. 
  Forty-four per cent of those surveyed felt they held higher 
social status than average and 49 per cent believed that they 
enjoyed average social position. Seven per cent complained 
about their low social status . 
  The survey also revealed that 37 per cent of the wealthy, 
powerful, private entrepreneurs were convinced they were playing 
an important part in their communities. 
  Private enterprises existed in China before 1950, when the 
State bought and nationalized all of them. 
  Current private enterprises are very different from the old 
ones in their labour-capital relationship, their operating 
environment, and functions. 
  Dai said he believed private enterprises will ask for more 
participation in their communities when their business ventures 
become increasingly successful.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- A guild will be set 
up in China's nonferrous industry to take up the administrative 
affairs of the industry while the original China National 
Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation will become a holding 
company to manage the state assets of all the enterprises in the 
industry. 
  This is a major move to change the management mechanism in 
the industry. 
  The guild will be established in the first half of this 
year. 
It will be a medium organization between the government and 
enterprises and undertake administrative affairs of the 
non-ferrous metal industry upon the trust by the government. 
  The China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation, 
which used to control both the administrative and economic 
affairs of enterprises, will become a holding company to 
undertake the tasks of managing the state assets of all the 
enterprises in the industry by way of controlling shares or by 
participation or by running solely owned enterprises. It will 
bear limited liability for the losses or bankruptcy of 
enterprises. 
  The holding company will send directors and supervisors to 
enterprises to supervise the management of state assets.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (CNS) -- Without doubt China had 
to keep inflation under control and not let it exceed economic 
growth, a member of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress (NPC) and professor at Beijing University, Mr. 
Li Yining, said in an interview with this agency. He added, 
however, that a rise in unemployment rather than inflation would 
pose a greater threat to China. 
  Inflation to some extent is not inevitable for the 
maintenance of economic growth, according to Mr. Li who is 
attending the current session of the 8th NPC. Should the 
government make proper use of four important means at the 
present stage, namely savings deposits at bank for value 
preservation, adjustment of wages in accordance with the cost of 
living, pensions and the curbing of a price hike by 
administrative means, inflation would not worsen. 
  Mr. Li said he believed that if people had a job and a 
regular income which could support their daily needs, inflation 
to some extent would not constitute a threat. By contrast, 
however, a person who had lost his job would be in anxious state 
and a group of unemployed persons in despair would be a 
potential source of unrest to society. 
  It justified the thinking that reasonable economic gain 
should be not only in line with the national strength and with 
the market purchasing power, but also capable of providing 
sufficient job opportunities for the newly increased number of 
job-seekers. 
  Mr. Li suggested that the central government should give 
priority to the handling of employment which involves job 
opportunities for ten million job-seekers every year. The 
important matter, Mr. Li said, lay in the relaxation of the 
policy on restriction on employment and in letting people seek a 
suitable job for themselves.

<F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Drought Brings Worst Shortage in 10 Years"] </F>
  [Text] A chronic drought continuing to plague northern 
China has produced the worst shortage of drinking water in a 
decade and is threatening to wipe out more than 10 million 
hectares of crops. 
  Nearly 4 million people and more than 14 million heads of 
livestock are suffering from the dry spell. 
  "The shortage of water was so serious that many locals in 
arid areas in Northwest Gansu Province had to get water from far 
away," the Beijing based State Anti-Drought Office (Sado) said 
yesterday. 
  The drought, which began last fall, has hit the most 
important winter wheat and cotton-producing areas. 
  More than 5.3 million hectares of winter crops in 12 north, 
northwest and northeast provinces have been affected, while 
another 8.7 million hectares are running out of moisture, the 
latest statistics show. 
  Even though snow fell in some drought-ridden areas in mid- 
February, the moisture level was far from enough to meet the 
demands of winter wheat. 
  This summer's harvest is now being threatened. 
  The precipitation, ranging from 1-10 millimetres in most of 
the drought-stricken areas, was too little to fully ease the 
persistent drought, while more rainfall is badly needed for the 
winter-crop growing, "drought officials told China Daily. 
  As a result, more than 35 per cent of winter wheat seedlings 
in northwest Gansu Province are not growing well and many are 
dying. 
  And the latest weather forecasts provide little hope of 
escaping the drought soon. The dry spell is expected to 
continue through the end of the month as rainfall will be less 
than in previous years throughout northern regions and even in 
some parts of the south.

  [Text] Nanjing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Commercialization of 
farmland-use rights, a practice which was banned for more than 
four decades after the founding of New China in 1949, is 
germinating again in some parts of the country. 
  In a traditional agricultural country such as China, rural 
people used to consider farmland as their lifeblood. Such a 
concept has been gradually changing. Many rural families, whose 
laborers are working in rural industrial enterprises, have 
willingly transferred their farmland-use rights to their 
fellow-villagers or even to people from other villages, 
townships, counties or provinces. 
  Wang Jinbao, a 66-year-old peasant in Wuxi County, east 
China's Jiangsu Province, said that he has tilled the land all 
his life and loves the land very much. However, he added, he 
has now transferred his land-use rights to others because all 
his children have found jobs in cities or in rural industrial 
enterprises and no longer make their living by farming. 
  The practice originated in the mid-1980s in the area of 
Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou in southern Jiangsu Province, where 
rural industrial enterprises are well developed. At present, 
over 60 percent of the rural laborers in the area have turned 
from farming to working in industrial or service-trade 
enterprises. As a result, some of the rural families are 
willing to transfer their farmland- use rights to skilled 
farmers who want to expand their scale of production. 
  Such a practice was soon approved by the top leadership of 
the country. A decision on some issues concerning the 
establishment of a socialist market economic system adopted at 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the 
CPC on November 14, 1993 says that on the premise of adhering to 
collective land ownership, the compensated transfer of land-use 
right according to law will be allowed and that operations 
adaptable to economies of scale may be developed in a few 
economically developed areas through various forms such as the 
transfer of contracts and the purchase of shares on a voluntary 
basis. 
  In order to solve the problem of some farmers being 
reluctant 
to continue farming and to avoid leaving the land waste [as 
received], the Chinese central government has selected the Pearl 
River Delta, Chang Jiang Delta and the outskirts of Beijing as 
the pilot areas to carry out the commercialization of land-use 
right. 
  The official in charge of the experiment in the Chang Jiang 
Delta, focussing on Jiangsu Province, said that the experiment 
is aimed at gradually transferring the land-use right to those 
farmers who are more skilled and willing to engage in farming 
and finally realize economies of scale in farming. 
  In carrying out the experiment, it is important to separate 
the land ownership from the land-contracting right and the 
land-use right. All the farmland is owned by the village. But 
the land- contracting right and the land-use right belong to 
individual households. Every household is allowed to transfer 
its contract and land-use right to others. 
  The experiment started in the three counties of Wuxi, 
Changshu and Wuxian in the Chang Jiang Delta in 1987. So far, 
the practice has spread to 26 counties in the prefectural cities 
of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. The 
per-capita farmland in the area was less than 0.07 ha 
[hectares]. However, there are now 8,200 units engaging in 
farming on a total of 31,600 ha of land, each of which has more 
than one ha of farmland. 
  Located in Zhangjing town in Jiangsu Province's Wuxi County, 
the richest county in China, the Xinhu farm has 13.3 ha of land. 
The land-use rights belonged to the local residents in the 
past, but have now been transferred. The farm is at present 
contracted by Li Songfan, a farmer from Changxing County in 
Zhejiang Province. Moreover, Li has transferred the contract to 
Shi Ziliang, another farmer from Changxing County. So, the 
actual persons who are cultivating the land of the farm are Shi 
and his wife as well as four of their relatives. 
  There are 1,501 such farms operating economies of scale like 
the Xinhu farm in Wuxi County, according to county magistrate Lu 
Rongde. These farms have a total of 7,800 ha of farmland, which 
accounts for 53.6 percent of the county's total contracted 
farmland. 
  Farming based on economies of scale has helped raise 
agricultural productivity and promoted the development of rural 
industry and the service trades. Statistics from the Jiangsu 
Provincial Office of Agricultural Modernization show that the 
per-ha and per-laborer grain output of such farms is generally 
200 kg more than and 20.3 times that of small plots cultivated 
by farmers who have concurrent jobs in rural industrial 
enterprises. Over 93 percent of the grain produced by such 
farms is marketable grain. The percentage is 60 percentage 
points more than that of small farms. 
  Many skilled farmers are willing to engage in farming of 
this 
type. Tang Hongquan, head of the Guangming farm in southern 
Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, contracted to cultivate the farm, 
which has 35 ha of land. His wife resigned from her post as 
head of a workshop in a rural industrial enterprise to manage 
the farm together with him. Last year the farm made a net 
income of 185,000 yuan. The per-capita annual income of the 20 
laborers on the farm surpassed 4,000 yuan, which was about 30 
percent more than their fellow-villagers who worked concurrently 
in rural industrial enterprises. 
  Experts noted that the rebudding of commercialization of 
land-use rights in China indicates a new trend in the country's 
reform of the land-use system under the new circumstances of the 
nationwide efforts to build a socialist market economy.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Since China's National 
People's Congress approved a resolution to obligate the whole 
nation to plant trees 13 years ago, the country has afforested a 
combined area of 33 million hectares with 18 billion trees, tops 
in the world. 
  Advocated by Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the 
tree-planting movement has been developed quickly throughout the 
country. More than 500 million people planted 2.4 billion trees 
last year. 
  Presently, all the barren hills in Guangdong, Fujian and 
Hunan Provinces have been covered with green trees. Both the 
forest areas and forest reserves of the country have increased 
over these years. 
  China recently made new plans to promote the afforestation 
movement. Some 100 counties are designated as key areas to be 
afforested.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Research achievements 
in rice growing have brought in an economic return of more than 
five billion yuan over the past decade. 
  According to a national cereals conference here today, 
research achievements have been applied in some 34.67 million ha 
[hectare] of rice fields throughout the country over the last 
few years. 
  China is one of the biggest rice producers in the world. Its 
rice acreage accounts for a quarter of the world and rice output 
accounts for one third of the world's total. 
  As such, China has invested heavily in the studies of rice 
growing. An example is the opening of the Rice Research 
Institute in Hangzhou, which boasts eight million yuan worth of 
advanced laboratory equipment and experimental plots totalling 
494 ha. 
  The institute has undertaken 165 research projects since its 
opening.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Be Determined To Solve Deep-Rooted </F>
Contradictions in Agriculture"] 
  [Text] In 1993, our country's grain output topped the 
crucial point of 45 billion kg, fulfilling two years ahead of 
schedule the quota set by the Eighth Five-Year Plan. Peasants' 
per capita net income stood at 880 yuan, increasing by 2 percent 
over the previous year. The peasants' burden began to be 
lightened. The sales income, net profit, and total value of 
products of town and township enterprises increased by more than 
60 percent. The situation in agriculture is encouraging. 
  We must be aware, however, that there exists quite a number 
of deep-rooted contradictions in the development of agriculture 
and rural economic work. The first is the low comparative 
effectiveness of agricultural production, especially grain and 
cotton production. The price scissors between industrial and 
agricultural products keep increasing, while the income of 
peasants increases at a slow pace. The second contradiction is 
that there is no sign of improvement in the system to promote 
agricultural technology, which has broken down, with its 
personnel scattered. The phenomenon of "unhooking and weaning" 
is quite common. The third controduction is that agricultural 
science and technology lags behind the development of 
production. It lacks fine species, as well as new, low-cost, 
highly beneficial breeding and cultivation technology for the 
purpose of upgrading agriculture. The rate at which current 
scientific research is promoted and transformed is comparatively 
low. The fourth contradiction is the increasing employment 
pressure caused by the surplus labor force. The fifth is that 
state agricultural regulation and control measures are 
insufficient, while the agricultural foundation is weak. These 
problems seem commonplace, but many new developments have taken 
place in each of these areas. Our task is to analyze these new 
developments, study the new problems, and be determined to solve 
these deep-rooted problems in the development of our agriculture 
and the rural economy. 
  Information from an authoritative department shows that 1994 
is to be the year for major breakthroughs in our economic 
restructuring. The state will adopt important measures in 
finance, taxation, banking, planning, investment, foreign trade 
and the reform of state-owned enterprises. Beginning this year, 
the reform will shift from the surface to a deeper level, from 
breakthroughs in single items to overall coordination, from 
paying attention to the benefits brought about by comparatively 
independent reform measures to the formation of a 
comprehensively new economic relationship. 
  It is inevitable that this reform situation in China will 
have a profound impact on rural reform bacause it is an 
important part of the economic restructuring of our country. On 
the one hand, it will give a vigorous boost to agriculture and 
the rural economy. In the past, we used to say that it was 
difficult to deepen agricultural reform. The key problem was 
that the external reform was not coordinated with rural reform. 
This year, now that the entire economic restructuring has come 
to a crucial phase of overall advance, it will create an 
excellent external environment for rural reform and development. 
We should grasp this opportunity firmly. On the other hand, the 
reform will readjust the present pattern of interest 
distribution in a big way. It is also inevitable that it will 
affect agriculture and the rural economy in a disadvantageous 
way. Take the reform of the financial and taxation system for 
example; the practice of the new circulating-tax system and the 
unification of enterprise income tax will have a considerable 
effect on the tax load of town and township enterprises. 
Moreover, these enterprises also have to undertake many social 
burdens and tasks to develop agriculture through industry. As a 
result, their profit retention will be less, which will affect 
the capacity of these enterprises for further development. 
Raising prices for crude oil, refined oil, and electricity, as 
well as completely deregulating prices for centrally distributed 
coal and farm chemicals, will bring about price increases for 
the means of agricultural production and will increase the cost 
of agricultural products. 
  In short, the nation's in-depth reform provides a good 
external environment for solving the deep-rooted contradictions 
in agriculture and the rural economy. We should say that it is 
high time for us to seize the opportunity to solve these 
deep-rooted contradictions in agriculture and the rural economy. 
In actual practice, of course, these deep-rooted contradictions 
cannot be solved overnight, nor can they be solved altogether at 
the same time. The competent state department should take them 
into consideration as a whole and should make overall 
arrangements. A locality, a department, or a system first 
should solve whatever problem for which the conditions for its 
solution are ripe. Now confronting us are contradictions and 
difficulties, as well as potential and opportunities. However, 
the opportunities we have are greater than the difficulties. 
Therefore, we must take hold of the situation, grasp the 
opportunities and meet the challenges so as to make our 
agriculture and rural economy take off again.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- These reporters have 
gathered from the Frontier Guard Bureau of the Ministry of 
Public Security that at noon on 9 March, officers and men from 
the Puxi station of the Putian Frontier Guard Detachment of the 
Fujian Frontier Guard Corps of the Armed Police Force seized 6 
million yuan's worth of counterfeit renminbi in Wenjia harbor, 
Putian. "Xintongfa," the Taiwan fishing vessel involved in the 
case, was taken into custody. Two Taiwan fishermen, Chen Tongfu 
and Chen Xianming, were detained in accordance with the law. 
  It has been disclosed that at midday on 7 March, Chen Tongfu 
and Chen Xianming, fishermen from Taiwan's Jilong [Keelung] 
City, sailed the "Xintongfa" fishing vessel out of Jilong 
harbor, carrying with them 6 million yuan's worth of counterfeit 
renminbi. At noon on 8 March, they berthed at Tailun in Wenjia, 
Putian, under the pretext of seeking shelter from the wind. On 
9 March, officers and men from the Puxi Frontier Guard Station 
boarded "Xintongfa" to conduct an inspection in accordance with 
relevant provisions. Among worn-out fishing gear on deck they 
found four cardboard boxes containing 6 million yuan's worth of 
counterfeit renminbi denominated in 100 yuan and bearing a fake 
printing year of 1980. This was the first major case involving 
counterfeit renminbi uncovered by frontier guards from the 
Ministry of Public Security in coastal areas since the beginning 
of this year. 
  The case is now under further investigation.

"Shanghai JIEFANG RIBAO Chief Editor Visits Taiwan at Invitation 
of Taipei LIEN HO PAO"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of Taipei LIEN HO PAO, Ding 
Ximan, editor-in-chief of Shanghai JIEFANG RIBAO, and editor 
Chen Zhongbiao, took a plane yesterday evening for a 13-day 
visit to Taiwan. JIEFANG RIBAO, a mouthpiece of the Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee, has set six records in mainland's press 
reform since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee in 1979. Now JIEFANG RIBAO is one of the four major 
newspapers which is read daily by the CPC Central Committee. 
Ding Ximan said that the purpose of his current visit to Taiwan 
is to open up a channel of press cooperation with the Taiwan 
media. 
  Shanghai's JIEFANG RIBAO took over a textile mill in the 
latter half of last year, setting a precedent in mainland media 
taking over an enterprise. 
  Ding Ximan explained the six records set by JIEFANG RIBAO 
since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee: The first newspaper to resume coverage of social 
news; the first to establish a comprehensive newspaper digest; 
the first to resume publication of serial novels; the first to 
resume commercial advertisements; the first to publish a colored 
"Weekend Supplement"; and since 1 January last year, the 
newspaper has published 12 pages per issue, another record set 
in the provincial-level newspapers. 
  Ding Ximan said that the four major newspapers which are 
read 
daily by the CPC Central Committee, include RENMIN RIBAO, 
BEIJING RIBAO, and Shanghai's WENHUI BAO and JIEFANG RIBAO. 
Ding continued that JIEFANG RIBAO is an influential newspaper 
in China. 
  Ding Ximan and Chen Zhongbiao will stay in Taiwan until 24 
March. During this period, they will call on the Straits 
Exchange Foundation, Chen Lifu, and other press agencies.

  [Text] Taipei, March 12 (CNA) -- The government will try 
its best to maintain relations with Hong Kong and Macao after 
the two colonies revert to Mainland Chinese rule in 1997 and 
1999, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Saturday 
[12 March]. 
  Cheng An-kuo, the MAC's director of Hong Kong and Macao 
affairs, made the comment at a hearing sponsored by Legislator 
Parris Chang in the Legislative Yuan on the future course of the 
government's Hong Kong and Macao policy in view of recent 
developments there. 
  Chang, a scholar-turned-politican, invited government 
officials and academics to give their views during the hearing. 
  Cheng, elaborating on the just-announced draft of the 
statute 
governing relations with Hong Kong and Macao, said that Taiwan 
will still consider the colonies as "special areas" rather than 
as Mainland Chinese territory after the colonies revert to 
Mainland Chinese rule, and will not consider links with them to 
constitute "direct" links with Mainland China. 
  He noted that all Taiwan Government offices in Hong Kong and 
Macao would continue to operate on a civilian basis after the 
handover, and said that the Taiwan-Hong Kong and Taiwan-Macao 
relationships would continue much the same way as before. He 
added that the rights of Taiwan residents living in the colonies 
would be fully protected. 
  On whether Beijing would try to seize Taiwan Government 
property in Hong Kong and Macao after 1997 and 1999, Cheng said 
that he could not rule out that possibility, and said that 
Taiwan has asked for legal help to safeguard against such an 
exigency.

  [Text] Taipei, March 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan's export reliance 
on Mainland China in 1993 reached 14.9 percent, up from [number 
indistinct] percent five years ago, Council for Economic 
Planning and Development Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang said. 
  Export reliance measures the percentage of Taiwan's total 
export value that goes to a country. 
  Hsiao revealed the figures while delivering a speech on 
cross- Strait relations and future economic development 
sponsored by the National Unification Council Thursday [10 
March]. 
  Citing Hong Kong customs tallies, Hsiao said that 
cross-Strait trade increased from US$2.7 billion in 1988 to 
US$8.69 billion in 1993. 
  In 1988, Taiwan's exports to Mainland China via Hong Kong 
totaled US$2.24 billion, accounting for 3.7 percent of Taiwan's 
total exports. The figure jumped to US$7.59 billion in 1993. 
  [Word indistinct] said that most of Taiwan investment on the 
mainland would now be considered long-term, and that investors 
are now targeting inland regions and moving away from coastal 
areas. 
  Investors are also putting their money into 
technology-intensive enterprises rather than labor-intensive 
ones, and into medium- and large-sized ventures rather than 
small ones.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yin Nai-hsing (1438 0035 7451) and Li </F>
Chien-kuo (2621 0256 2654) from Taipei] 
  [Text] With the crucial year 1997 approaching, such issues 
as the orientation of Taiwan's relations with Hong Kong and 
Macao and aviation agreements are attracting attention from 
various quarters. Because the two sides of the strait, as well 
as Hong Kong and Macao, will all be signatories to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], the Taiwan side may in 
the future define the relations among the two sides of the 
strait and the three parties as "one country, four regions" and 
"two banks, four sides." 
  As to the aviation agreements, the relevant departments of 
Taiwan will energetically push ahead with Taiwan-Hong Kong talks 
on aviation rights and Taipei will also strive to open a 
Taiwan-Macao air route, because it may even serve as a 
"cushioning chip [huan chong chou ma 4883 0394 4693 4316]" for 
the Taiwan-Hong Kong talks on aviation rights. 
  The first phase of the Macao Airport will be completed by 
the 
middle of next year. The Macao Government is very interested in 
opening a Taiwan-Macao aviation line. The term of an aviation 
contract is five years, so it should straddle 1999. If so, no 
matter how the Taiwan-Hong Kong talks on aviation rights are 
progressing, at least the Taiwan-Macao route can serve as an 
intermediary transit base. But the Macao Government is hoping 
that the two sides will sign a commercial aviation contract, so 
as to lower the level of official involvement. Furthermore, the 
Beijing factor is present in the Taiwan-Macao talks on aviation 
rights, which will be a significant variable in the negotiation 
process. 
  Beijing will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao in 
1997 and 1999 respectively. The evolution of Hong Kong society 
and Macao society under Beijing's rule and the development of 
Taiwan's relations with Hong Kong and Macao will be a big 
variable in the progress of cross-strait relations. The 
departments concerned in Taipei are working hard on the 
"Regulations on the Relations With Hong Kong and Macao," which 
will govern exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong and Macao 
after 1997 and 1999. Taking account of Beijing's response, the 
relevant departments in Taipei have claimed to the outside that 
these regulations are being deliberated under the framework of 
"one country, two regions," but in actual fact the preamble of 
the regulations will clearly define the Hong Kong region and 
Macao region as distinct from the two sides of the Taiwan 
Strait. Thus, with the additional definition of the Taiwan 
region and mainland region contained in the regulations on the 
relations between the people on both sides of the strait, the 
framework of "one country, four regions" is coming into being. 
  Considering that the two sides and Hong Kong and Macao will 
all be signatories to the GATT and the level of 
internationalization of the two sides and three regions will 
increasingly grow, Taipei's decisionmaking body on mainland 
affairs will probably define the two sides and Hong Kong and 
Macao after 1997 and 1999 as "two banks, four sides" and "one 
country, four regions," so as to make less significant the 
comparative appraisal [xiang dui ping bi 4161 1417 6097 3024] of 
the two sides under the principle of "one country." 
  It is learned that when the group for developing the 
regulations on Taiwan's relations with Hong Kong and Macao came 
to Hong Kong to solicit comments from various circles in the 
process of drafting the regulations, the people consulted 
include some pro-China personalities, such as the persons in 
charge of China-funded organizations, Hong Kong members of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference national 
committee, and advisers on Hong Kong affairs. 
  Following the group's extensive consultations in Taiwan and 
Hong Kong, the draft regulations on Taiwan's relations with Hong 
Kong and Macao have been initially completed. Tomorrow, the 
Mainland Affairs Committee will hold its first examination 
session on the draft. In April, the drafting work will 
officially enter the stage of examination by all ministries and 
commissions. It is expected to be submitted to the Legislative 
Yuan for deliberation before the end of this year.

  [Text] Taipei, March 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Singapore will 
link their automatic customs clearance systems to facilitate 
exchanges of trade information, the Directorate General of 
Customs (DGC) announced Saturday [12 March]. 
  "The linkage was first proposed by Australia as part of its 
effort to promote trade cooperation among members of the Asia- 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum," said DGC Deputy 
Director-General Hou Teh-chi. 
  If the Taiwan-Singapore linkage succeeds, Hou said, other 
APEC member states will follow suit. 
  Among the 17 APEC members, only the United States, 
Australia, 
New Zealand, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan have established 
automatic customs clearance systems. As the Japanese system 
does not meet the United Nations standards, Australia suggested 
earlier this year that Taiwan and Singapore link their systems 
first on a trial basis. 
  Hou said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to 
provide funds needed for the computer uplink. 
  After the project is completed, Hou said, Taiwan and 
Singapore will be able to call up each other's export/import 
product lists and other related information on their own 
computer screens. 
  Hou said APEC members will also establish computerized trade 
databanks to boost multinational economic cooperation. 
  Apec groups the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New 
Zealand, Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, 
Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, South Korea, 
Mexico and Papua New Guinea.

  [Text] Taipei, March 11 (CNA) -- Vice Economic Affairs 
Minister Li Shu-chiu is scheduled to lead a 20-member delegation 
to Indonesia in early April to help promote the government's 
"southern strategy," the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced 
Friday [11 March]. 
  The delegation will be composed of officials from state-run 
enterprises such as Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), Taiwan Power 
Company [Taipower], Taiwan Sugar Corp. [Taisugar], Taiwan 
Fertilizer Co. Ltd., China Steel Corp., BES Engineering Corp., 
and Taiwan Salt Works. 
  Ministry officials said the CPC will be looking at oil 
exploration and oil refinery deals, and Taipower is interested 
in investing in both hydro and thermal power generation projects. 
  In addition, CPC officials will meet with their Indonesian 
counterparts on the purchase of low-sulphur crude oil and 
liquefied natural gas, while Taipower will offer to help train 
Indonesian electricity engineers and managers. 
  Taisugar, Taiwan Salt, Taiwan Fertilizer, and China Steel 
are 
looking forward to providing Indonesia with expertise in 
sugar-cane planting, salt panning, fertilizer manufacturing, and 
steel making, respectively, the officials pointed out. 
  Moreover, they noted, BES is considering assisting Indonesia 
in the planning and construction of industrial parks and 
residential districts. 
  The government's southern strategy has been fueled by 
Premier 
Lien Chan's vacation trip to Malaysia and Singapore at the 
beginning of the year and President Li Teng-hui's unofficial 
visit to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand in February. 
  The strategy encourages Taiwan manufacturers to increase 
investment in Vietnam and member countries of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations, which groups the Philippines, 
Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Brunei.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA) -- Forty-seven years ago, 
hundreds of people were slaughtered in Taiwan during an uprising 
against the Chiang Kai-shek government, and thousands more 
around the island were believed arrested and killed in the 
crackdown that followed. Today, the nation was quietly 
commemorating the tragedy in spite of the hurt deep in the minds 
of many people. 
  In Taipei Monday morning, more than 300 relatives of those 
who lost their lives at the massacre, better known as "2-28 
Incident," attended a memorial concert sponsored by Soochow 
University along with ranking government officials and scholars. 
  Chang Hsiao-tsu, president of the university, said the 
concert was intended "to commemorate the victims regardless of 
their age, sex and birthplace." 
  "The hosting of the concert," Chang said, "is aimed to allow 
us an occasion to review the historical tragedy so as to avoid 
the recurrence of similar incidents." It was the second such 
concert held by the university. 
  The 1947 uprising was sparked after a government official 
beat a woman selling untaxed cigarettes. Angry crowds later 
stormed government offices as native Taiwanese erupted in a fury 
against what they saw as an oppressive Chiang Kai-shek regime. 
  Chiang responded by sending troops from the mainland, which 
the nationalists still ruled, to Taiwan, which had just reverted 
to Chinese control after 50 years of rule by Japan. It is still 
unclear as to how many people were killed during the initial 
uprising and the subsequent period of "white terror." The 
incident had been a taboo topic of conversation until a few 
years ago, but with Taiwan's increasing democratization has 
become a much-debated subject. A report by a special task force 
of the Executive Yuan put the number of victims at around 
18,000-28,000. 
  Chen Wei-chao, president of National Taiwan University, 
likened the incident to an untended gash. "The cut was so deep 
and wide that the wound could hardly be healed, even though 
nearly five decades have elapsed," said Chen, also a noted 
surgeon. 
  The government has apologized for the incident, and is 
building monuments and mapping out relief measures to compensate 
the victims, but "the spiritual wounds are hard to heal," Chen 
said. 
  In the southern city of Kaohsiung, [word indistinct] Wu 
Tun-yi chaired a memorial service in front of a monument to the 
victims. He said he hopes the wounds can be gradually healed and 
thus pave the way for a more harmonious society. 
  Wang [words indistinct] president of the Kaohsiung 
association on the victims of 2-28 Incident, said he was pleased 
[words indistinct] here paying great [word indistinct] and 
concern to the relatives of the victims, but he is still hoping 
the government will [words indistinct] a national holiday. 
  Meanwhile, President Li Teng-hui also attended a concert 
held 
to commemorate the 2-28 Incident at Taipei's National Concert 
Hall Monday evening. Li said he hopes through music, the 
historic wounds can be cleansed and then lingering hatred 
dispersed.

Lines, will be handed over to Chinese troops in 1997 with the 
British side offering the PLA the right to redevelop the 
three-hectare site. But to ensure that the military estate 
close to the Conrad Hotel and Island Shangri-La Hotel, will not 
be redeveloped for commercial or other uses, British negotiators 
are understood to have attached a stringent condition that any 
redevelopment be confined to military use. The draft accord 
also makes it clear that instead of Hong Kong taxpayers bearing 
the cost for any redevelopment project, the PLA would foot the 
bill. 
  Based on the results of four days of tough negotiations late 
last month, the draft accord detailing the plan and other 
arrangements is now being considered by the PLA for final 
confirmation. Sino-British defence experts are understood to 
have planned to meet again towards the end of this month, hoping 
to put the finishing touches to the draft deal. Should the PLA 
raise no objection to the draft accord, it is expected that the 
two sides will put the deal to the next Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG) plenum for formal approval. Sources said 
the two sides were discussing the date for the next plenary 
session, expected to be held next month at the earliest. 
  Queens Lines is understood to have been one of the three key 
sticking points during the long-running defence talks at the 
JLG. The other stumbling blocks were the relocation of the HMS 
Tamar naval base to Stonecutters Island, and Britain's demand 
for China to make a declaration that it would return any unused 
military facilities to the Special Administrative Region 
government for development. Comprising two towers and housing 
more than 40 families of the British barracks, Queens Lines is 
currently the married quarters for senior British military 
officers. Property experts have put the value of the site at 
more than $6 billion at 1993 prices, given the lack of prime 
sites in the Central business district. Noting the value of the 
site, British negotiators are understood to have tried to 
persuade the Chinese side to release Queens Lines for 
redevelopment for either commercial or residential use but the 
Chinese side insisted on retaining at least part of the areas. 
  One of the options considered by the two sides during the 
negotiations was for the British side to redevelop the site at a 
cost of about $400 million. Anticipating the difficulty in 
seeking the Legislative Council Finance Committee's approval for 
funds, the British side is understood to have cast doubts on the 
option, which was eventually dropped. 
  During the negotiations, the Chinese side indicated it 
wanted 
to keep Queens Lines for use as married quarters for PLA 
officers.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today expressed the hope that 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's current visit to 
China will contribute to the enhancement of mutual understanding 
and the improvement and development of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Qian, speaking to Chinese and foreign journalists at the 
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, noted that in the past few days, the 
two sides have had meetings in a "candid, frank and 
business-like" atmosphere, which totaled more than ten hours. 
  Qian said that the two sides have agreed that the Sino-U.S. 
relations should be put in the bilateral as well as in the 
global context, and that the future and the 21st century should 
be kept in mind in handling the relations. 
  The three Sino-U.S. joint communiques constitute the 
foundation stone for the Sino-U.S. relations, Qian said, adding 
that both China and the U.S. are big countries with 
international influence and permanent members of the United 
Nations Security Council. The two countries have many common 
interests in global affairs and in maintaining international 
peace and security, he said. 
  The two sides also have much in common in their positions on 
maintaining regional peace and security, said Qian. 
  Qian said that during the talks the two sides have expressed 
satisfaction over the rapid progress in the economic and trade 
sector and believed that there are great potentials and broad 
prospects for the two countries's economic relations and trade. 
  The issues of human rights and the most-favored-nation (MFN) 
status were the major subjects discussed, Qian noted, adding 
that China is opposed to linking the issue of human rights to 
MFN. 
  The question of human rights involves two aspects, Qian 
said. 
On the one hand, China and the U.S. have different concepts on 
human rights, and this is the reality which will exist for a 
long time to come. 
  On the other hand, he said, China and the U.S. adopt 
different approaches in handling differences. 
  "We hold that the two sides can conduct dialogue on the 
issue 
of human rights on the basis of equality, mutual respect and 
non- interference in each other's internal affairs, " he said. 
  The Chinese vice-premier stressed that the Chinese side can 
only do what the Chinese law permits, and it is futile and 
harmful to apply pressure on China under the pretext of human 
rights.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Deng Xiaoping, China's 
senior retired leader, takes a walk every day, loves swimming 
and has a very good appetite, according to his daughter Deng Nan. 
  "Father is in excellent health. He has a very good appetite 
and walks three kilometers every day -- longer sometimes," said 
Deng Nan today when she, as vice-minister of the State Science 
and Technology Commission, was on her way to solicit opinions 
from deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) now in 
session here. 
  When asked whether her father still likes swimming, Deng Nan 
said: "Father loves swimming in the sea; he never swims in a 
swimming pool." 
  The senior leader is following closely the progress of the 
ongoing sessions of the NPC and the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, according to 
Deng Nan. 
  "Father certainly knows what is going on. Every day, he 
reads newspapers, watches TV, and is very much concerned about 
domestic and international affairs," the daughter said. 
  In response to a reporter's concern that Deng Xiaoping 
seemed 
thinner when he appeared on TV during the Spring Festival, Deng 
Nan said: "It's good to be thin. Haven't you heard of the 
Chinese saying `a thousand taels of gold cannot buy thinness in 
one's old age'?" 
  Asked whether Deng Xiaoping will again spend the Spring 
Festival in Shanghai, Deng Nan said: "I think he will. He has 
also said that he will spend a Spring Festival in Hong Kong 
after 1997."

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- Deng Nan, daughter of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, said today that her father Deng Xiaoping

technological, cultural, and educational circles during their 
group discussion of the Government Work Report. On her way to 
the meeting room, some reporters kept asking her: "Is Comrade 
Xiaoping well?" Deng Nan said: "My father is in very good 
health [shen ti hen hao 6500 7555 1771 1170] and has a very good 
appetitite. He walks three km each day, sometimes covering a 
slightly greater distance." 
  A reporter asked: "Is Comrade Xiaoping still fond of 
swimming?" Deng Nan replied: "Father likes to swim in the ocean 
and has never swum in a swimming pool." 
  "Is Comrade Xiaoping well-advised of the `two sessions'?" 
  "Of course. He reads the newspapers and watches television 
everyday; he is very concerned about major domestic and 
international affairs." 
  A reporter said that Comrade Xiaoping appeared to be thinner 
on television during his Spring Festival appearance. Deng Nan 
said: "It is better to be thinner; to be thin in old age is 
something that cannot be bought with money."

<F P=106> [Interview by XINHUA reporter Chi Maohua (3069 5399 5363): </F>
"Make Development While Carrying Out Reform -- an Interview With 
NPC Deputy Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial 
Party Committee and governor of the province"] 
  [Text] Jiangsu is one of our country's economically 
developed provinces. Its per capita GNP amounted to 3,675 yuan 
in 1993, higher than the country's average. Thus, the 
province's overall economic strength has reached a new level. 
At the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC], this reporter interviewed NPC Deputy Chen Huanyou, 
secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and governor 
of the province. 
  Chen Huanyou said: Jiangsu Province has made new planning 
for 
reform and development. We have set forth a reform objective 
according to local conditions that the basic framework of a 
socialist market economic structure should be built in about 
five years. Then, we must effectively perform our work 
particularly in several aspects in order to achieve this 
objective and push Jiangsu's economy to a new level. 
  Chen Huanyou said: First of all, we must continue to deepen 
reform. The state has announced more reform measures this year 
than in the past. Reforms are more difficult to carry out, and 
they need to be conducted in more depth and breadth and with 
more intensity. All the announced reform measures involve the 
key aspects of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure. We have decided according to Jiangsu's conditions 
that we should carry out various reforms while concentrating on 
establishing a modern enterprise system and reforming the 
macroeconomic management system. We should perform our work 
carefully and practically, do a good job in publicizing and 
explaining reform measures, organizing and coordinating their 
implementation, and strive to achieve actual results. 
  In dealing with the reform of the foreign trade and foreign 
exchange systems, Chen Huanyou said: We should seize this 
opportune time to open to the outside world in an ever broader 
scope and more fields and at an ever higher level in order to 
integrate our economy with the international economy at a faster 
pace and with better results. We should expand our import and 
export trade and increase our ability to earn foreign exchange 
through exports. We should make vigorous efforts to attract 
investment by foreign businessmen and make more use of foreign 
funds. Our planned use of foreign funds this year is to increase 
30 percent as compared with last year. Meanwhile, we should 
vigorously develop our economic and technological cooperation 
with other countries. We should also build various development 
areas according to high standards. 
  Chen Huanyou said: This year we will not follow the beaten 
track of blindly going after the output value and expanding the 
investment scale and will put the stress of economic work on the 
quality, efficiency, and level of high economic growth [gao jing 
ji zeng zhang 7559 4842 3444 1073 7022]. We should foster the 
idea that "development is the last word." Enterprises whose 
exports are marketable and with good economic returns should 
develop their production as fast as possible, and those which 
cannot do so should not be forced to do so. Everything should 
be done according to reality. We should attach importance to 
scientific and technological progress and the improvement of 
workers' quality, make vigorous efforts to readjust the economic 
structure, raise the quality and overall level of economic 
growth, and improve overall economic results. 
  On the construction of infrastructural facilities and basic 
industries, Chen Huanyou said: Jiangsu has made tremendous 
progress in building key infrastructural facilities and basic 
industries over the past several years. But there are still 
some weak links in these regards. This year we should 
concentrate our efforts on building key projects, optimize the 
investment structure, and use our limited financial and material 
resources for such key projects. We should strengthen 
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy; 
vigorously readjust the structure of agricultural production; 
stabilize the production of grain, cotton, and oil- bearing 
crops; develop export-oriented and foreign-exchange-earning 
agriculture, as well as village and town enterprises and 
diversified economic undertakings, and make every possible 
effort to increase farmers' actual incomes and to promote an 
all-round development of the rural economy.

  [Text] Moscow, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher met in the 
Far Eastern Russian city of Vladivostok today for talks on 
bilateral relations, the INTERFAX NEWS SERVICE reported. 
  The report said their talks started in the city's airport 
building directly after Christopher's arrival and were expected 
to cover ways of dealing with the recent spy row between the two 
countries, former U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to 
Moscow, and how to build strategic partnership relations. 
  They will also discuss a settlement of the Bosnian conflict 
and the peace process in the Middle East. 
  Before leaving Moscow for Vladivostok Sunday [13 March] 
night, Kozyrev had said there were certain groups both in the 
United States and Russia opposed to cooperation between the two 
countries, especially if it assumes a strategic character. 
  However, he told reporters at Moscow Airport that further 
development of Russian-U.S. relations should be based on the 
principles under the Moscow Declaration signed by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in January. 
  After the talks, Kozyrev and Christopher are expected to 
hold 
a brief news conference.

production, transportation and supply in order to guarantee the 
agricultural need. 
  In order to stabilize the national economy, it is an 
important task for the country to obtain a bumper agricultural

on fertilizer production. However, he noted, chemical 
fertilizer is short of supply at present. 
  Zou encouraged the fertilizer factories to overcome all 
difficulties to produce more chemical fertilizer. 
  He also urged the governments at all levels and all 
governmental departments concerned to create better conditions 
for the fertilizer production.

  [Text] Taipei, March 15 (AFP)--China would resort to the 
use of M-9 and M-11 missiles to attack the western coast of 
Taiwan in the event of an invasion of the island, according to a 
defense ministry report. The report is yet to be released, but 
excerpts published by the United Evening News said China had 
authorized its military to deploy the surface-to-surface 
tactical ballistic missiles. 
  The report says China has never given up on invading Taiwan, 
and would be encouraged to attack if the island declared 
independence, in the event of large scale chaos or riots, the 
weakening of Taiwan's defense force or foreign intervention into 
Taiwan's internal affairs. China would also be encouraged to 
invade if Taiwan developed nuclear arms, or in the event of 
unstable political conditions in the post Deng Xiaoping era, the 
report adds. 
  The report lists what it says are the six most likely ways 
Beijing would attack Taiwan, including the seizure of 
Taiwanese-held offshore islands, using jet fighters to violate 
Taiwan's air space, bombarding its west coast with missiles, and 
starting fishing disputes to give the Chinese navy an excuse to 
invade. China has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since 
the 1949 civil war, and has threatened to attack if Taiwan 
declares independence. 
  The report says China has actively promoted its offensive 
capability by buying more sophisticated arms and technologies 
from Russia, and says Taiwan will also seek to modernize its 
forces. Admiral Liu Ho-chien, chief of the General Staff, has 
warned that the next two years would be pivotal for Taiwan in 
trying to keep China's increasingly superior armed forces at bay. 
  Taiwan takes delivery in 1996 of 150 F-16 and 60 Mirage 
2000-5 jet fighters it has ordered from the United States and 
France, plus several foreign-made warships, but says an absence 
of modern weaponry leaves it particularly vulnerable until that 
time. 
  The report, entitled Defense Ministry White Paper, will be 
published between late March and early April, a ministry 
official told AFP.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, March 15 (XINHUA) -- U.N. 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today praised China, a 
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, for playing a 
more and more important role in the world organization and 
international affairs. 
  The U.N. chief was speaking to Chinese Deputy Foreign 
Minister Liu Huaqiu when they met here today. 
  Butrus-Ghali said the U.N. and China have cooperated very 
well on U.N. affairs and important international issues. 
  Under the current situation, the secretary-general said, it 
is quite necessary to encourage developing countries to take 
part in U.N. affairs since they form the bulk of the world body 
consisting of more than 180 member nations. 
  To encourage all developing countries to play a positive 
role 
in international problems is also significant to maintaining 
world peace and promoting economic development, said 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  He said the U.N. needs close cooperation from developing 
countries since they can express their wishes and requests 
through the world body. 
  Only by doing so, can the U.N. truly stand for their 
interests, he said. 
  Referring to the World Women's Congress to be held in 
Beijing 
in September 1995, Butrus-Ghali said that it will be a prominent 
meeting in the world. 
  He praised China for making outstanding preparations for the 
congress. 
  The U.N. chief also said that the congress will exert 
far-reaching influence on the promotion of women's status in the 
world. 
  Butrus-Ghali said he will visit China this year together 
with 
U.N. officials in charge of the World Women's Congress to help 
prepare for the congress, he said. 
  The Chinese deputy foreign minister agreed to Butrus-Ghali's 
views on the role of developing countries, saying that they will 
play a more and more important role in international affairs. 
  Liu emphasized that the Chinese Government attaches great 
importance to the World Women's Congress. 
  He said the Chinese Government will make proper preparations 
as the U.N. requires. 
  Liu arrived in Argentina on Sunday [13 March] on a visit at 
the invitation of the Argentine Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) stressed today that it had 
completely carried out its commitments as far as inspection of 
its nuclear sites was concerned and called on the United States 
to carry out those agreed by it. 
  A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that the DPRK had 
fully accepted nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) within the time limits set under an accord 
between the two sides. 
  He noted that the inspections were implemented on the basis 
of full discussions between IAEA inspectors and DPRK 
administrative personnel at the country's nuclear facilities. 
  He also said all the problems emerging during the 
inspections 
have been solved satisfactorily under the IAEA's requirements, 
which has been recognized by the authority. 
  The spokesman added that during inter-Korean working-level 
contacts aimed at realizing an exchange of special envoys, the 
DPRK unilaterally took a resolute and magnanimous attitude so as 
to pave the way for that procedure. 
  However, he said, the United States had failed to carry out 
its own commitments. "The U.S. introduced two additional 
prerequisites when announcing the suspension of joint military 
exercises" added the spokesman. 
  They were that the nuclear inspections by IAEA must be 
implemented satisfactorily and exchanges of North-South Korean 
envoys be realized. 
  "The United States still insists on these two prerequisites 
and it is by no means justifiable" the spokesman said. 
  He reiterated that if the United States did not carry out 
its 
own agreed commitments, the DPRK would regard it as a break-down 
of communications and would take appropriate measures, including 
suspending inter-Korean working-level contacts and refusing to 
attend the third-round of U.S.-DPRK meetings scheduled for 
Geneva.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Huang Huizhu: "U.S., Russia Repair `Relations </F>
of Partnership'"] 
  [Text] Moscow, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher met Monday [14 March] in the Russian Far Eastern 
city of Vladivostok to discuss the newly emerging problems in 
relations between the two countries. 
  The two sides announced after the meeting that Russia and 
the 
United States are still partners, although they will have 
differences forever. 
  The statement indicates the U.S.-Russian relations of 
partnership will go ahead on a road full of zigzags. 
  In a world characterized by multi-polarity instead of the 
bi-polarity structure, both the United States and Russia are 
paying great attention to their mutual relations. 
  The two heads of state met thrice last year in an effort to 
establish a new-type relationship marked by mutual interests, 
cooperation and mutual restraint. 
  At the January Moscow summit this year between Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the 
two countries announced that they have "entered a new phase of 
mature strategic relations of partnership." 
  However, as the situation in Russia and the international 
situation evolve, the two countries have neither solved their 
old differences nor prevented new ones from erupting. This has 
resulted in repeated bumping and frictions between the two 
countries over the past several weeks. 
  "A number of gaps have been appearing in the mansion of 
Russo-U.S. partnership" and "Russo-U.S. relations have 
experienced some of the most serious crises for the past few 
years," local media reports said. 
  It is not accidental that great ups-and-downs have occurred 
in Russo-U.S. relations only months after the Moscow summit. 
Local media reports summed up the causes for this change as 
follows: 
  -- Russia is constantly adjusting its own foreign policy, 
and 
is putting a particular emphasis on an independent policy in 
dealing with international affairs; 
  -- Russia is trying to strengthen its impact and role in 
other former Soviet republics to check the expansion of the 
United States in those areas; and 
  -- The evolution of the situation in Russia has aroused 
worries in the United States and other Western countries. 
  Russia's effort to resume its big-power status in the 
post-cold war world conflicts with the role of the U.S. as the 
only remaining superpower on earth. 
  Russia has tried to adopt a pro-West foreign policy in order 
to win Western aid. However, the policy has not helped Russia 
tide over its economic crisis or establish a market economy that 
would help the country integrate with the Western world. 
  Instead, the policy has greatly weakened Russia's impact and 
role in the international scene and, to the dismay of many 
Russians, the country has lost some of its traditional spheres 
of influence. 
  Yeltsin pointed out recently that Russia's foreign policy is 
mainly aimed at "realizing its national interests" and its 
diplomatic ideas should always "conform with the supreme 
standard of big-power status." 
  He called for an end to "the situation of faulty and 
unilateral concessions" by Russia when it deals with Western 
countries. 
  The Russian foreign minister also said recently that it is a 
"fanatical illusion" to wish that the world will be ruled by 
only one power -- the United States. 
  The differences between Russia and the United States were 
fully shown in the course of the Bosnia crisis. 
  Russia, as an active mediator in the Bosnia war and as a 
traditional friend of the Serbs, was kept out of the door when 
NATO decided in mid-February to press the Serbs to withdraw 
heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo with threats of air strikes. 
  Russia countered the NATO decision by persuading the Serbs 
to 
withdraw the weaponry on time and sending several hundred 
Russian soldiers to Sarajevo. This foiled NATO's plan for air 
strikes and increased Russia's confidence in resuming its role 
in solving major international crises. 
  Washington, furious with Russia's action on Bosnia, 
retaliated by arresting a senior CIA officer for spying for 
Russia, and by expelling a Russian diplomat. 
  The United States has also been active in expanding into 
former Soviet republics ranging from the Baltic nations to 
Kazakhstan. The U.S. secretary of state visited almost all the 
former Soviet republics, promising things from aid in the 
removal of nuclear warheads to "democratic partnership" pacts. 
  The U.S. supported the Baltic states' call for Russian 
troops withdrawal, provided aid to Ukraine at a time when Kiev 
was quarreling with Russia over the natural gas supply, invited 
Kazakhstan and some other Central Asia republics to cooperate 
with NATO, and supported Georgia's call for sending 
international peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia. 
  Russia, which regards these areas as its spheres of special 
interests and responsibility, apparently considers the U.S. 
move as a kind of threat to its own security. 
  Meanwhile, Russia's ever-changing domestic situation has 
been 
marked since last December by the victory of the right-wing 
nationalists in parliamentary elections, the resigning of 
pro-West economists from the government, and the amnesty by the 
state Duma to free former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and 
former parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
  All this has aroused worries and scepticism in the West over 
the future of Russia's "democratic and market economic reforms." 
  Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who has been on a trip 
in Moscow since early March, was turned down a meeting request 
[as received] with Yeltsin. 
  Nixon's mission is clearly to see for himself what's really 
going on in Russia and to report his "data-collection" to 
Clinton. 
  Kozyrev and Christopher agreed to further cooperation 
between 
their countries in dealing with crises like those in Bosnia and 
the Middle East, and expressed satisfaction over the meeting. 
  They also agreed that the two sides would establish specific 
organs for guaranteeing their relations of partnership in 
dealing with international affairs. 
  But local media reports have expressed pessimism over 
whether 
such specific organs can be set up without difficulty.

  [Text] In a recent interview with our staff reporter Zhang 
Xiaodong, Chinese human rights specialist Fan Guoxiang gave an 
analysis of the current distortion of the human rights issue and 
concluded that international cooperation is the most reasonable 
and practical way to promote human rights. 
  QUESTION [Q]: Respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedom is widely regarded as an important issue by all 
countries in the world. But unfortunately it has been used by 
some countries as an excuse to practice power politics. Can the 
universal significance of human rights be interpreted as a 
common human rights standard? 
  ANSWER [A]: The understanding and appreciation of human 
rights have undergone a historical process. In this century, 
especially during World War II, the armed aggression against and 
military occupation of other countries by the German, Italian 
and Japanese fascists brought about untold sorrow to millions of 
innocent people. There were no human rights in the occupied 
countries and regions, and the people in the fascist countries 
were also stripped of their human rights. 
  Reflecting on the scourges of war, the Charter of the United 
Nations solemnly stipulates, "To develop friendly relations 
among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights 
and self-determination of peoples" and "to achieve international 
cooperation...in promoting and encouraging respect for human 
rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction 
as to race, sex, language or religion." 
  The United Nations has also adopted some other international 
human rights instruments which have given, for the first time, a 
number of specifications to human rights. 
  Respect for and promotion of human rights are significantly 
important to all countries, in the West or East, developed or 
developing. However, during the Cold-War period, human rights 
were used to serve the West-East confrontations. 
  In recent years, human rights have been further distorted by 
some countries which have used the human rights issue as an 
instrument to perform power politics and force other nations to 
accept their human rights formula as the so-called common 
standard, turning the universal value of human rights into a 
uniform and predetermined human rights formula. 
  Historically, certain religions persecuted and proselytized 
others in order to spread their rule to the ends of the globe. 
There were also claims that some nationalities were superior to 
others. Although powerful political and military forces were 
exploited to carry out such policies using all kinds of excuses, 
these blatant violations of human rights were continually cast 
aside by the people. 
  The present world is a multicolored one. Different cultures 
and state systems and government forms co-exist. Insisting that 
some way of life or specific values should be a common standard 
and claiming that some governments through certain methods of 
elections are democratic and others are not have confused the 
universal significance of human rights with the common standard 
of human rights. It is designed to force the developing 
countries to take in the so-called common standard by putting 
pressures and imposing sanctions on these countries. 
  In history, the religious fanatics and those who advocated 
ethnic superiority were proved wrong. At present, any attempt 
to impose a single human rights standard on the world will also 
lead nowhere. 
  Many specialists have pointed out that some people claim to 
support democracy in other countries, but they are far from 
being democratic in the international arena. They vigorously 
support dissidents in other nations, but they are 
internationally intolerant of different views on human rights, 
demonstrating their hegemonist behavior. 
  Human rights is universally significant, but it cannot be 
twisted to claim that there is only one standard. The concept 
of universal values for human rights is quite different from 
that of a common standard of human rights. 
  Q: The specific situation of human rights differs from 
nation 
to nation. Under such circumstances, how can we embody the 
universal value of human rights while respecting the diversity 
of human rights in each country? 
  A: For a long time, the human rights issue has been 
politicized and distorted. It became a political instrument in 
the Cold-War confrontation. This practice should be cast aside. 
The only reasonable and feasible way to promote human rights 
is, as stipulated by the UN Charter, through international 
cooperation. 
  Various countries should discuss, exchange views and consult 
on human rights, rather than resorting to attacks and charges 
against each other. When a consensus is reached in some areas 
and conditions mature, international conventions may be signed 
and the signatories should be legally bound to the stipulations 
of those documents. 
  Concrete cooperation may be achieved through bilateral, 
multilateral, regional and global meeting to exchange the 
experiences of each country. Before the 1993 Human Rights 
Conference was convened in Vienna, there were regional meetings 
in Asia, Africa and Latin America, which have proved to be 
beneficial to reflecting the views on the promotion of human 
rights from different regions. 
  International cooperation in human rights may encompass a 
wide range of activities. Discussions between countries may 
include, inter alia, individual human rights and collective 
human rights; people's rights and obligations in society; 
personal freedom and national security; political rights and 
economic rights; relationships between human rights, development 
and peace; protection of the rights of minority nationalities 
and indigenous populations; and protection of the rights of 
women, children and the handicapped. The discussions may be 
conducted from different points of views, taking into account 
divergent historical backgrounds. But it is improper to 
arbitrarily say someone is 100 percent correct and others 
totally wrong. 
  It needs to be noted that discussions should be held with 
all participants enjoying an equal status. Equality is the 
basis for cooperation. Although history, tradition and the 
present situation differ from state to state, each country has 
made specific contributions to human rights. The developing 
countries should be aware of the practices in developed 
countries. At the same time, they can relate their experiences 
to the developed countries so that both sides can learn from the 
successes and mistakes of the other. But it is inappropriate to 
assert that some countries are advanced in promotion of human 
rights and others backward, and that the former should be the 
educator and investigator and the latter the educated and 
investigated. 
  In the international human rights field there must be a 
strict distinction between humanitarian assistance and 
humanitarian intervention. 
  International armed conflicts, natural disasters and other 
uncontrollable forces have caused great harm to the people of 
the affected areas. The United Nations and some other 
international organizations have provided assistance to the 
victims so as to ease their misery. This is positive, 
beneficial and welcome. 
  But some countries, with their own political motives, have 
deliberately, engaged in humanitarian intervention in the name 
of rendering assistance, going as far as to send troops to 
extend so-called aid that finally results in the escalation of 
war. This runs counter to the original intention and deepens 
the misery of the victims. 
  The negative effect of humanitarian intervention has put the 
United Nations and some other international organizations in a 
dilemma and their prestige has been damaged. Humanitarian 
intervention has invited widespread opposition from the 
international community. More and more people are concerned 
that, far from promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
this type of power politics practiced in the name of 
humanitarianism will bring about more serious international 
tension and instability. Therefore, humanitarian assistance is 
welcome and humanitarian intervention should be opposed.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "In Job Creation, U.S. is a </F>
Mirror Image of Europe" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Detroit, March 13 (XINHUA) -- More jobs or good 
jobs? This is the question facing the governments on the two 
sides of the Atlantic Ocean. 
  And there is little hope to put their chronic argument to 
rest when the labor and finance ministers of the world's biggest 
industrial countries gather here on Monday [14 March] for a 
summit that, for the first time, focuses exclusively on jobs. 
  "For long, the choice is either between a low wage, high 
employment model, that is the United States, and a high wage, 
low employment model, that is Europe," commented Jeff Faux, 
president of the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute. 
  "It seemed to us that this trade-off is unsatisfactory," he 
said. "Solving the problem will require some sort of collective 
action." 
  Collective action comes from a common solution, which now 
looks almost impossible since the problems at issue, despite 
some similarities, are basically different, observers noted. 
  In the U.S., the real wages of workers have been falling by 
one percent a year since 1973, when the country's real gross 
domestic product went up 27 percent. However, it gained more 
than three million jobs since the 1990-1991 recession, mostly 
part-time jobs in the service area. 
  "Especially in recent years, the real problem is we've had a 
collapse in earnings opportunities for young Americans of all 
educational levels," said Lester Thurow, MIT's [Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology] professor on management and economics. 
  In Europe, it is a picture of another kind. European Union's 
unemployment rate stands at a high of 11 percent, although in 
the last 18 years, the manufacturing workers there enjoyed wage 
increases from 30 percent to 40 percent. 
  "From the European perspective, the position is that 
unemployment is worse, it is worsening, and it will continue to 
worsen," said Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor of the Exchequer 
of Britain's Labor Party on Thursday. 
  In the U.S., meanwhile, six out of every seven new jobs 
created from 1970 to 1991 were in the private sector, while in 
Europe, according to OECD statistics, two thirds of the new jobs 
were in government. 
  Another difference: Half of the incomes for European workers 
come from benefits and pensions, while in the U.S., workers 
suffered a continuous decline in unemployment insurance 
benefits, which generated the call to reform the country's 
welfare system "as we know it." 
  For the whole 1980s, the unemployment rate in the U.S. and 
European Union were respectively 7.3 percent and 10.1 percent, 
while in the 1960s and 1970s, the rates were five percent for 
the U.S. and two percent for Europe. 
  What's in common for them, according to Eileen Appelbaum, a 
professor of economics in the Temple University, is that the 
industries experiencing high productivity in these countries all 
shed workers. 
  "The question is how and whether we can get back to a 
situation in which wages, productivity and employment all rise 
together," she asked at a recent seminar. 
  The Clinton administration, which said it expected no 
communiques out of the two-day summit, stressed in recent days 
that they wanted to use the occasion to swap notes with Western 
Europe. 
  "It's the height of arrogance to think we cannot learn from 
each other," said U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen last 
week. 
  For examples, U.S. officials said, Europe's success in 
worker 
training and integrity of schools and workplaces is one area 
that Washington thinks warrants learning. 
  The mobility of the U.S. labor markets, which means workers 
can move freely and employers can fire workers without the 
pressures from labor unions, U.S. officials said, is perhaps 
their own advantage that cannot be found now in Europe. 
  For U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, there is a third 
choice bringing the gap across the Atlantic. 
  "It may be to combine the investment in education in Europe 
with the dynamic labor flexibility in the United States, all 
encased within macro-economic policies which encourage growth 
and jobs," he told foreign reporters on Wednesday. 
  In so saying, Reich was referring to the high price 
Europeans 
have been paying for higher interest rates, especially in 
Germany, which the U.S. said obstructed the countries' real 
economic growth. 
  This, in turn, is not what the European ministers would like 
to be lectured when they fly half around the world to Detroit, 
whose major presence - the auto plants - is the pride for the 
White House, more than ever.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- The 16th meeting of 
the Working Party on China of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) is scheduled to open on March 15 in Geneva. 
  A 31-member Chinese delegation headed by Vice-Minister of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Gu Yongjiang and 
Vice-Minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission Yu 
Xiaosong left here in two groups on Saturday [12 March] and 
Sunday respectively for Geneva. 
  Long Yongtu, secretary general of the Chinese delegation to 
the meeting, told reporters before leaving here for Geneva that 
this meeting is the first-round negotiation on the issue since 
the end of the Uruguay Round in the end of last year. 
  During the negotiation, Gu Yongjiang and Yu Xiaosong will 
table a series of China's important measures to reform its 
foreign trade system, especially in its import system, Long said. 
  China stands for maintaining a balance of rights and 
obligations in GATT and strives to achieve positive results in 
the meeting. 
  It is learned that during its stay in Geneva, the Chinese 
delegation is expected to hold bilateral talks with the United 
States and the European Community and will also hold 
negotiations on reduction of tariffs with Japan, Canada, 
Australia and New Zealand.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (AFP) -- China said Wednesday it 
was "disappointed" with the results of the recent visit by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher that focused on a row over 
renewal of Beijing's MFN status. 
  "I am also somewhat disappointed," Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen told journalists, referring to comments Monday by U.S. 
President Clinton expressing disappointment in the results of 
the four-day visit, which ended Monday. "My talks with 
Christopher have not produced as many results as previously 
expected," said Qian without elaborating. 
  However, the foreign minister once again appeared to put the 
blame for the failure of the talks on a meeting just ahead of 
Christopher's arrival between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
for Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck and China's most famous 
dissident Wei Jingsheng. "We thought that the two sides would 
be able to reach agreements to further develop bilateral 
relations, but before the visit some things occurred and we were 
disappointed," Qian said. 
  Despite China's disappointment, Qian said the two sides were 
"making efforts to avoid the deterioration of relations." 
Clinton has made June's renewal of China's most-favoured-nation 
(MFN) trade status conditional on significant progress in 
improving human rights. While Qian was unable to say whether he 
would meet again with Christopher before June, he added that "we 
continue to maintain contacts." "I don't think that the 
differences on the concept of human rights have been reduced, 
but we have reduced differences on specific matters" during 
Christopher' visit, he said.

  [Text] Washington, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Boeing 
Company said here today it fully supports the continuation of 
most favored nation (MFN) trading status for China. 
  Lawrence Clarkson, vice president of Boeing, made these 
remarks at a symposium on U.S.-China relations held by the 
Council on Foreign Relations. 
  Clarkson said that "the American people would be better 
served if the divisive annual debate on MFN was avoided." 
  "Bilateral issues between our countries should be addressed 
as they would be normally between two countries who share 
significant mutual interests," he noted. 
  China is now the United States' 8th largest trading partner, 
and U.S. exports to China grew 17.36 percent in 1993 to 8.7 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  "U.S. exports to China in 1993 supported more than 167,000 
U.S. jobs," Clarkson said. "China trade also creates thousands 
of jobs for U.S. retailers, wholesalers, and importers." 
  He also said that during the next 15 years, China will need 
800 commercial planes worth 40 billion dollars, making it the 
world's third largest aviation market. 
  "Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are currently well positioned 
in the Chinese market," he pointed out. "But Airbus, Fokker and 
the Russians are waiting to quickly take advantage if the 
relationship between the United States and China deteriorates." 
  Clarkson said the Boeing Company believes strongly that U.S. 
President Bill Clinton should extend MFN status for China and 
that Congress should support such a decision.

"Common Interest Is the Crux of Sino-U.S. Relations"] 
  [Text]China and United the States Are Still 
Deadlocked on the Human Rights Issue 
  After winding up his trip to Beijing, U.S. Secretary of 
State 
Warren Christopher left Beijing to visit Russia. During his 
short visit to China, Christopher again applied pressure on the 
human rights issue, but China remained tough. Will the United 
States "wield" the "magic wand" of denying China most-favored 
nation [MFN] status? It seems unlikely, or we can say that both 
parties will always set store by their common interests and not 
come to a rupture. 
  Chinese leaders have pointed out on many occasions: 
Sino-U.S. relations have never been based on common ideology 
and values, but on common interests. This is a pertinent 
remark. Since Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger visited China 
more than two decades ago, and since the 4 June incident, there 
have been frequent "cold wars" in Sino-U.S. relations, but never 
have they fallen out with each other. In the final analysis, 
this is because the common interests of the two countries, which 
still servs as a basis, have never changed. 
  Although the two countries have differing views on the human 
rights issue, China is still ready to discuss it with the United 
States on the basis of equality in order to increase 
understanding. It is known to everyone that China gradually is 
improving human rights, but the United States has no reason 
whatsoever to pressure China into accepting a U.S.-style concept 
of human rights. 
<H3>  A Japanese Newspaper Attacks the United States for Applying 
Pressure on China </H3>
  ASAHI SHIMBUN carried an editorial on 15 March. From some of 
its unbiased remarks on this issue, it is not difficult to see 
where the rights and wrongs lie. The paper says: "Japan is 
very much concerned about what China will become. China is now 
Japan's second-largest trading partner, while Japan is China's 
largest. If China is thrown into chaos, Japan will be 
tremendously affected. Therefore, Japan does not want to see a 
deterioration of relations between China and the United States, 
both of which are nations friendly to Japan." The paper added: 
"China holds that, as far as developing countries are 
concerned, 'the rights to survival and development are the basis 
of human rights.' This argument is not hard to understand. The 
U.S. practice of forcing China to make concessions on the issues 
of democratization and human rights is too impatient and is 
disgusting." 
  Moreover, the paper also has said something to China. It 
says: "Respect for human rights is a world trend. As the 
economy develops, it is also natural that people are pressing 
growing political demands. If China wants to have long-term 
stability, it needs to attach importance to democratization and 
human rights." 
  Let us look at the following fact: The Chinese and U.S. 
foreign ministers reached a five-point agreement in their talks. 
It includes a memorandum on prison labor products signed 
between the two parties. If the United States makes a request, 
it can go to a suspected prison within 60 days to investigate 
whether prison labor products are still exported. These, of 
course, are part of the steps China has taken to improve human 
rights. 
A Huge Chinese Delegation Will Go to the United States Next 
Month [subhead] 
  China's democratization must be developed gradually; it 
cannot be copied from Western practice. This is China's 
national condition, and it will not waver on this. As the 
people's living standards improve and as education is 
popularized on a larger scale, democratization and reform of the 
political structure naturally will advanced simultaneously. 
However, in the course of such major reforms as the market 
economy, there must be an appropriate degree of macroregulation 
and control in terms of stability, development, and the 
deepening of reform. Otherwise, if society were to be thrown 
into chaos, a large country with a population of 1.2 billion 
would not be able to sustain it. A case in point is the failure 
of Russia and Eastern Europe in their overdrastic 
democratization and democratic reform. 
  Based on their common economic interests, it is advantageous 
to both China and the United States to expand economic 
cooperation and exchange. China will dispatch a high-ranking 
200-man delegation to the United States next month to discuss 
economic cooperation in 800 industrial and agricultural 
projects. This is beneficial to the rapidly recovering U.S. 
economy and to China's construction. Barring ulterior motives, 
we really cannot see any benefit that can be derived from 
exerting pressure on China, which leads to losses to both 
parties.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 14 (XINHUA) -- As from this month, 
Japanese investors can trade on the Shanghai equity market. 
  Being listed as Japan's 36th appointed foreign securities 
market marks the major progress which Shanghai Stock Exchange 
(SSE) has made in integrating with the world market. 
  Under Japanese securities laws and regulations, its 
individual investors are only allowed to buy and sell in 
appointed overseas markets, which are selected by the national 
securities association and approved by the Japanese Government. 
  The other approved markets include the big securities 
exchanges in New York, London and Amsterdam. 
  The move not only opens the door for Japanese investors to 
try their luck in Shanghai, but also makes it possible for 
Japan-registered trust funds to invest in Shanghai and for 
Shanghai-listed companies to raise money by issuing stocks in 
Japan. 
  Under the current Chinese situation, Japanese investors are 
limited to "B" shares on the Shanghai exchange. 
  Encouraged by Nomura Securities Co. Ltd, one of the four 
largest in Japan, the three-year-old SSE applied for the status 
last December, and was approved within two months, after an 
overall field inspection made by Japanese experts. 
  The approval has set two records: it is for the youngest 
exchange so far and the fastest process of approval. 
  To date, Shanghai equity market has 148 listed enterprises, 
501 member securities companies and more than 5 million 
registered investors. With the highest daily transaction of 
over 3.9 billion yuan, the SSE has stocks totalling over 260 
billion yuan in market price being traded.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (YONHAP) -- Choe Chong-hyon, 
chairman of South Korea's Sunkyong Business Group, secretly met 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Thursday and obtained China's 
support for a joint-venture oil refinery his group is promoting 
in Shenzhen in southern China. 
  A highly placed Western source here said on Friday that 
Choe, 
who flew into Beijing last March 6, met Jiang on Thursday 
morning to exchange opinions on ways to expand economic 
cooperation between South Korea and China. 
  "We understand that during the meeting Choe asked for and 
gained the Chinese Government's positive support for the 
refinery project being promoted in a joint venture with the 
China National Petrochemical Corp. and Shenzhen municipality," 
the source said. 
  He added that the meeting between Choe, who serves as 
president of the Federation of Korean Industries, and Jiang 
lasted about 30 minutes and that Choe left for Korea after the 
talks. 
  Sunkyong and the two Chinese partners have agreed to build a 
1.5 billion dollar refinery capable of producing 100,000 barrels 
a day in Shenzhen. Sunkyong is to invest 40 percent of the 
capital. 
  "We believe the refinery project has virtually been fixed 
with Choe's meeting with Jiang," the source said. "A formal 
contract could be signed timed with President Kim Yong-sam's 
visit here beginning March 26."

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 16 (XINHUA) -- No progress was 
made in the seventh contact today on the question of exchange of 
special envoys between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK) and South Korea. 
  The two-hour closed-door meeting between representatives of 
the two sides was held north of the demarcation line at the 
Panmunjom truce village. 
  Pak Yong-su, head of the DPRK working delegation, said after 
the contact that the two sides failed to bridge their difference 
on the role of the special envoys. 
  South Korea was opposed to the inclusion in the role 
insistence on national independence, pursuit of national unity 
and identification of ways of national reunification, Pak said. 
  He added that the south side was marking time with a view to 
blocking the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks scheduled for March 
21. 
  Pak said that whatever, special envoys should be exchanged 
at 
an early date and DPRK would continue to work for it. 
  The two sides will conduct their eighth contact south of the 
demarcation line at Panmunjom on March 19.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen said that despite a breakdown in 
Sino-British talks on Hong Kong political issues, work in other 
fields that requires efforts from both sides has been underway 
and will continue. 
  Qian made the remark at a news conference here today. 
  "Sino-British talks on the arrangement of Hong Kong 1994/95 
elections have broken down," he said. "But this does not mean 
work of the Joint Liason Group will suspend." 
  Negotiations on the new Hong Kong airport are continuing, 
too, he said. 
  "In my view," Qian said, "both sides should make efforts to 
ensure Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Despite a 
breakdown of Sino-British talks on the political structure 
arrangement of Hong Kong, China still cares about Hong Kong's 
economy and the livelihood of its people." 
  China will try its best to cooperate with the British side, 
he said. 
  "Whether or not cooperation can proceed smoothly depends on 
both the attitude and action of the British side," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The formal diplomatic 
links between China and South Africa will be put on the agenda 
of the Chinese Government after the general election in South 
Africa to be held in April, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
said today. 
  But before the general election which is to elect a new 
democratic government which abandons the policy of apartheid, 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries is not possible, Qian told a press conference during 
the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress now 
in session. 
  China and South Africa have had links between 
non-governmental organisations, Qian said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- China stands for 
frequent consultations between non-governmental organizations 
from both sides of the Taiwan Straits in order to reach 
agreements on relevant issues, said Chinese Vice-Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today. 
  At a press conference hosted by the current session of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), Qian said that such contacts 
will contribute to the development of relations between the two 
sides of the straits. 
  He said that it is a consensus of people on both sides of 
the 
straits that "there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is 
a part of China." This is also a fact recognized by the 
international community, he said. 
  Asked about China's stand on Taiwan's move to "develop 
diplomatic space," he said that if the move aims to develop 
economic relations, "we can understand." 
  "But, if (Taiwan) developing `diplomatic space' aims to 
create `two Chinas,' that will harm the fundamental interests of 
the Chinese nation and it will be detrimental to the cause of 
the reunification of China," he said. "We, therefore, are firmly 
opposed to moves toward that end." 
  On the question of Taiwan's "holiday-making diplomacy," he 
denounced its avowed purpose of "expanding economic relations" 
as "false." 
  "There are political intentions in it," he said. 
  Some countries seek to develop non-governmental relations 
with Taiwan mainly out of economic considerations, he said. But 
the Taiwan authorities take advantage of this to develop what it 
calls "diplomatic space" in an attempt to create "one China, one 
Taiwan" or "two Chinas," he said. 
  "It is a move that is not in keeping with the trend of the 
times and goes against the aspirations of people on both sides 
of the Taiwan Straits," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen said that enactment of a law by the 
National People's Congress (NPC) is to better protect investment 
in the mainland by Taiwan compatriots and promote economic 
cooperation between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. 
  In response to a question at a news conference here today, 
Qian said the "Investment Protection Law for Taiwan Compatriots" 
to be enacted by the NPC is "more comprehensive and 
authoritative" than what he called "the 22 regulations" 
previously formulated by mainland authorities concerning 
investment in the mainland by Taiwan compatriots. 
  On the possibility of the signing of an agreement on 
investment protection by non-governmental organizations from 
both sides of the Taiwan Straits, Qian said he cannot rule out 
such a possibility from a long-term of view. 
  "But, at present," he said, "conditions are not ripe since 
there aren't two-way exchanges between the two sides."

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the visit of Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to China will promote 
Sino-Japanese cooperation in all fields. 
  When asked about Sino-Japanese relations at a press 
conference this morning, Qian said, China and Japan are close 
neighbors and the leaders of the two countries often exchange 
visits. Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji's recent visit to Japan 
achieved a great success. 
  Now Chinese leaders are looking forward to the Japanese 
Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's visit to China at a time when the 
Sino-Japanese relations have achieved all-round development. 
  "I believe the visit will play a very important role for 
further development of the Sino-Japanese relations and 
cooperation in economic fields," he said. 
  During the visit, China and Japan will formally sign an 
agreement on cooperation between the two governments in 
strengthening environmental protection, Qian said. 
  On the relations between China and the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea and between China and the Republic of Korea, 
Qian said, "our stand remains unchanged." 
  He said that Premier Li Peng has made it clear in his 
government work report that China has further strengthened its 
good-neighborly relations with the surrounding countries and the 
friendship between China and the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea has grown. 
  China has steadily expanded its mutually beneficial 
cooperation relations with Japan, Russia and the Republic of 
Korea, Qian said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that neither the 
export of prison labor products nor immigration should become 
conditions for extending China's MFN status. 
  There are a lot of such issues, they should not be played up 
or played down for political needs, Qian said, and China hopes 
both sides adopt a realistic attitude towards addressing these 
issues. 
  Qian made the remarks when responding to a question at a 
press conference here sponsored by Zhou Jue, spokesman for the 
current session of the Eighth National People's Congress. 
  On the export of prison labour products, Qian said that even 
the United States acknowledges that its prison labour products 
are exported to some countries. The U.S. side, however, does 
not want prison labour products from other countries to enter 
the United States, Qian said. 
  Qian said China has a big market and it is entirely possible 
for China not to export its prison labour products to the United 
States. Moreover, the issue has already been settled. 
  On the question of immigration freedom in relation to MFN 
status, Qian said that again this is not a problem as far as the 
Chinese side is concerned. Even the U.S. side acknowledges that 
China does not place obstacles to large scale immigration to the 
United States. The obstacle now is that those who are found with 
an intention of immigration are denied the visa to the United 
States. 
  What is more. Qian said, China has the problem of illegal 
immigration, and "we are discussing ways to solve the problem."

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- China hopes that the 
situation on the Korean peninsula will move towards relaxation 
and stability and also hopes the peninsula be nuclear free, 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today. 
  "This conforms to China's interests as well as to the 
regional and world interests," Qian said at a press conference 
this morning. 
  Asked about the International Atomic Energy Agency's 
difficulties in inspection of nuclear facilities in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Qian said China 
supports DPRK to hold negotiations with the United States, the 
Republic of Korea, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  In the past the negotiations met some setbacks and achieved 
some progresses too, Qian said. 
  Now some difficulties have cropped up again. "We believe 
that 
so long as all sides are patient in negotiations and do not 
adopt measures to make the situation complicated, the 
negotiations will achieve important progress," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA)-- Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen said today that U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's recent visit to China has not produced as 
many results as originally expected. 
  Qian made the assessment at a press conference here today. 
  In response to a question about U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's 
reported disappointment over Christopher's China visit, Qian 
said, "I am also somewhat disappointed. More results could have 
been achieved. 
  "During my first round of talks with Christopher, I was the 
first to say something disappointing. The meeting between us 
was prepared in accordance with an invitation I had extended to 
Christopher when we met on January 24 in Paris. 
  "In his letter to me in mid-February, he said he would like 
to visit China in mid March, which I agreed, because this visit 
had the possibility of reaching agreements that are beneficial 
for further developing relations between the two countries. 
  "Something had occurred just before the visit of the 
secretary of state, which disappointed us. In my view, these 
matters at least demonstrated that the U.S. side didn't have 
enough sincerity for this visit." 
  On U.S. granting China most-favored-nation trade status 
(MFN), Qian said, its renewal will benefit both China and the 
United States. Its removal will be bad news for both countries. 
  Qian said that the MFN status is a reciprocal and mutually- 
beneficial arrangement between China and the United States, and 
it is the base for normal trade for the two countries. 
  "The United States has given the MFN status to many other 
countries, and I have never heard it will be removed. If the 
U.S. Government should remove the status for China, trade 
between China and the U.S. can hardly be carried on," he said, 
adding that, if it should happen, China and the U.S. would be 
the first to suffer losses, and other countries and regions like 
Hong Kong and Taiwan will also suffer. 
  Qian also said that it can be hardly said that in his talks 
with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, the differences in the 
views on the human rights issue were narrowed, but the two sides 
did reach some common understanding on specific methods and 
measures to handle that issue. 
  He said, "that can be considered progress in this regard." 
  Answering a question on whether or not removal of the MFN 
status for China will make economic relations between China and 
the U.S. deteriorate, and whether or not that will lead to a 
deterioration of their political relations, the foreign minister 
said, "deterioration of economic relations will surely have some 
negative influence, but efforts being made by both sides are 
just to prevent this kind of deterioration from occurring." 
  More than one third of the questions put forward today 
during 
the hour-long press conference were related to Sino-U.S. 
relations. About 600 Chinese and foreign reporters were present 
at the conference, which was sponsored by the ongoing session of 
the National People's Congress (NPC).

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has boosted its defence budget by 20 per 
cent in an apparent bid to expedite modernisation of weaponry. 
  While addressing the National People's Congress (NPC) 
yesterday, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said the State Council 
had earmarked 52.04 billion yuan (HK$46.2 billion) for national 
defence for 1994. The percentage increase this year was the 
highest since 1979, when patriarch Deng Xiaoping launched his 
economic reforms, one of whose tenets was to curtail military 
spending and devote more resources to the economy. 
  China's military outlay takes up 9.59 per cent of its total 
governmental expenditure, as compared with 23 per cent for 
Taiwan, 24.3 per cent for South Korea and 17.6 per cent for the 
United States. A total of 43.25 billion yuan was spent on the 
People's Liberation Army (PLA) last year, slightly more than the 
original target. About 42.5 billion yuan had been set aside for 
national defence in last year's budget, which represented an 
increase of 14.8 per cent over the 1992 figure. 
  "This year's national defence expenditures have been 
appropriately increased because of price rises, army wage reform 
and higher living expenses," Mr. Liu told the 2,800-odd 
legislators at the Great Hall of the People. The big increase 
was made in spite of Mr. Liu's insistence that the overall 
financial situation of the country was "grim" and that the 
criterion for drafting his budget was "tightening control over 
expenditures". 
  The 20.32 per cent surge for the PLA is also bigger than the 
18.5 per cent boost for education, a "national priority area" 
cited by premier Li Peng on Thursday. 
  In addition to the defence budget, Beijing has also 
allocated 
61.36 billion yuan for"administrative expenses for building 
state power", which analysts said included police expenditures. 
The 1994 figure is 13.57 per cent more than that of 1993. 
  Chinese sources said the State Council had succumbed to 
aggressive lobbying by the top brass, who complained about 
antiquated equipment and falling standards of living in the face 
of inflation. Vice-Chief of Staff of the PLA, General Xu 
Huizhi, said yesterday the new allocation was suited to the 
"practical situation" of the country. General Xu claimed that, 
as was true of last year's allocations, only a small part of the 
budget would be used to purchase weapons. 
  General Ding Henggao, Minister of the Commission of Science, 
Technology and Industry for National Defence, added the budget 
bonanza was "mainly to help improve the quality of life of the 
troops". 
  Xinhua (the New China News Agency) last night quoted the 
Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Liu Huaqing, 
as saying "our endeavours to modernise national defence serves 
solely to defend ourselves". General Liu asserted that "China's 
annual military expenditure is very small in the world", and 
that the PLA's major role was to provide a "powerful security 
guarantee" for the reform and open-door policy. 
  An NPC delegate representing the PLA, however, complained 
yesterday that the 20 per cent rise was too small. Sources 
close to the PLA said the actual expenditure by the army was 
more than double the publicised sum allocated to it by central 
Government. 
  "Much of the funds for military research and development, 
retirement expenses, and those incurred in conscription and in 
helping demobilised soldiers and jobs in the civilian sectors 
are covered by 'hidden budgets' absorbed by other government 
units," an informed source said. "A sizeable portion of the 
funds, including foreign currency used by the PLA to import 
weapons, comes from the profits made by the mushrooming PLA 
business empire, which is sometimes a law unto itself." 
  Asian military analysts said yesterday the increase in the 
budget was in line with the PLA's avowed goal of acquiring 
weapons and technology that were commensurate in sophistication 
with the country's fast-growing economic and geo-political 
clout. They said a focal point of the PLA's armament 
modernisation drive in the mid-1990s was the navy, which was 
essential for China's "power projection" in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  "The PLA is pumping funds and resources into developing 
nuclear-powered submarines as well as medium-range missiles that 
could be launched by them," a military source said. The source 
added that priority was set after the top brass decided late 
last year to scrap the plan for building aircraft carriers. 
  "China's five existing nuclear submarines are old Soviet 
models that are terribly antiquated," the source said. "The PLA 
is testing a submarine-launched missile that has a range of 
around 400 kilometres." 
  Western military analysts said the PLA's Second Artillery 
Unit was aggressively developing medium to long-range ballistic 
missiles, including the Dong Fang 25 and the Dong Fang 31 
models, which had ranges of respectively 1,700 km and 8,000 km. 
  At the same time, emphasis is being put on churning out a 
new 
generation of solid-fuel Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles. 
  The analysts said the PLA had to spend more money developing 
its own weapons systems partly due to the stalemate in efforts 
to procure Russian military technology. They added discussions 
on buying another batch of SU27 jet fighters from Moscow -- as 
well as a co-production agreement to turn out MiG aircraft on 
Chinese soil -- had bogged down because of Russian reluctance to 
part with top- of-the-line know-how. 
  However, with the revival of military co-operation with 
Europe and even the United States, the top brass is again 
hopeful of acquiring sophisticated hardware from the Western 
world. "In view of the recent 30 odd per cent devaluation of 
the yuan, the 52.04 billion yuan budget is not much to play 
around with," a Beijing diplomat said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The ongoing Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) held its 
third plenary meeting here today, hearing explanations on a 
draft law and a draft NPC decision, a report by the NPC Standing 
Committee and two reports by judicial departments. 
  The meeting was presided over by Executive Chairman Cheng 
Siyuan. 
  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli dealt on reasons for the 
enactment of a budget law, whose draft has been presented to the 
session for deliberation. 
  Liu said the law aims to strengthen the management of, and 
supervision over, budget planning, examination, implementation 
and enforcement. Such a law is needed, he said, to guarantee 
and promote a healthy social and economic development. 
  State budget, as an important macro-control means, plays an 
important role in the country's political and economic life, Liu 
said. 
  Xue Ju, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, made a speech 
explaining an NPC draft decision to grant legislative power to 
the Xiamen Special Economic Zone (SEZ). 
  As one of the earliest SEZs, Xiamen has become the 
mainland's 
important window of economic and trade relations with Taiwan and 
the outside world, he said. 
  To open the zone wider and to attract more overseas 
investment, the Law Committee suggests that the Xiamen People's 
Congress and its Standing Committee be authorized to enact local 
laws and regulations and that the Xiamen municipal government to 
formulate regulations for implementation locally, he said. 
  Tian Jiyun, a vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, 
delivered a report on the work of the NPC Standing Committee 
over the past year. 
  Tian defined the five-year term of the current NPC Standing 
Committee as a period when establishment of a socialist market 
economy is to be speeded up and China's second-phase 
modernization goals are to be attained. 
  The guiding thinking of the Standing Committee is, under the 
guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, to take as its fundamental task the 
strengthening of a socialist democratic and legal system, 
further improve the People's Congress system, guarantee the 
implementation of the constitution and other laws, and promote 
the development of a socialist market economy, he said. 
  To attain these goals, Tian said, the Standing Committee 
will 
continue to give economic legislation top priority so as to 
gradually establish a legal system that conforms to a socialist 
market economy. 
  Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, said 
in 
his work report that courts throughout the country should 
provide a strong judicial guarantee for a sustained, rapid and 
healthy development of the economy, and maintain social 
stability through strict law enforcement. 
  In 1993, people's courts at various levels handled more than 
3.4 million cases of the first instance, of which three fifths 
were civil cases. 
  In his work report, Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate, said in 1993 procuratorates 
throughout the country and military, railway and other special 
tribunals reinforced their function of legal supervision. They 
devoted much efforts to handling major cases of embezzlement and 
bribery. Criminal cases were severely dealt with, and cases 
involving infringement of people's democratic rights and 
dereliction of duties were also handled, Zhang said. 
  According to Zhang, in the last four months of last year, 
procuratorates investigated more than 8,000 serious cases of 
bribery and misappropriation of public money for personal use. 
Each bribery case involved more than 10,000 yuan and each case 
of the latter category more than 50,000 yuan. 
  Seven hundred and fifteen officials at or above the country 
level implicated in such cases were dealt with according to law, 
he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- An economic takeoff 
in China's vast central and western regions is the country's 
hope in the 21st century, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said here 
today. 
  "The central and western regions have great potential for 
development," Zhu said. "How to develop their economies, how to 
feed and clothe the poor there, how to help the local people get 
rid of poverty, and how to realize common prosperity for them 
all are important issues attracting world attention." 
  Zhu expressed the view when he joined deputies to the 
National People's Congress from Shaanxi Province in a group 
discussion on premier Li Peng's government work report. 
  Achievement of common prosperity and development of central 
and western regions are an important component of Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, Zhu said. 
  With continued national economic growth and more revenues 
for 
the central government, he said, the central authorities will 
increase investment in the central and western regions and 
accelerate development there, he said. 
  Zhu called on the regions to continue developing their 
agriculture as the foundation of their economies. 
  In developing their industry, he said, the regions should 
not 
"give up" on agriculture, in which he said they have a 
comparative advantage. 
  The central authorities are adopting measures to narrow 
"price scissors" between industrial and farm products to 
increase peasants' income, he said. 
  "As prices for farm produce rise, the central and western 
regions will get prosperous," he said. 
  The central and western regions should develop water 
conservancy projects and infrastructure, especially transport 
facilities for shipping their rich natural resources to the rest 
of the country and onto the world market, he pointed out.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yu Ning (0060 1337) and XINHUA </F>
reporters Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 2639) and Zhang Yijun (1728

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- Zhu Rongji, a member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice-premier of the State Council, joined deputies 
from Shaanxi in examining the "government work report" in the 
Shaanxi Room today and conscientiously heard their views and 
suggestions. He said: The vast territory of China's central and 
western regions have great potential for development. How to 
develop these regions' economy, improve work of helping the poor 
areas with development, solve the food and clothing problem of 
the poor population, and accomplish common prosperity is an 
important question that draws both the concern of the people and 
the focus of world attention. The economic takeoff in China's 
central and western regions symbolizes China's hope in the 21st 
century. 
  Deputies Liu Ronghui, Wang Shuangxi, Wang Dazhong, Lei 
Renyi, 
and others, who are provincial, prefectural, and city leaders as 
well as factory and rural representatives, spoke one after 
another. Responding to various policy matters raised by the 
deputies, including finance and taxation, Zhu Rongji replied in 
simple terms and spoke on the development of the central and 
western regions. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Both thinking on achieving common 
prosperity and strategies in developing the central and western 
regions are important components of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have 
seriously discussed and given concrete instructions on the 
question of developing the central and western regions, 
particularly during the recent national work conference on 
helping poor areas when a package of principles and policies on 
promoting development in these regions was presented. The 
party's Central Committee and the State Council have all along 
attached great importance to the economic development in the 
central and western regions. With enhancement of its financial 
strength, the central government will invest more to quicken the 
pace of development in these regions. 
  Zhu Rongji emphasized economic development in the central 
and 
western regions must continue to be based on agriculture. He 
stated: The central and western regions, with a certain 
industrial foundation, should not abandon their agricultural 
superiority. As comparative agricultural efficiency has been 
declining in recent years, the central government is taking 
measures to constantly narrow the scissor-shaped price gap 
between industrial and agricultural products to enhance both 
comparative agricultural efficiency and the peasants' incomes. 
We should not have the notion that agricultural development is 
doomed to suffer losses. Developing industry in a region with an 
extremely backward agricultural foundation is unimaginable. The 
central and western regions will become prosperous as prices of 
farm products gradually improve. In developing agriculture in 
these regions, special attention should be paid to the 
construction and maintenance of water conservancy projects. 
Peasants should be mobilized to build small-scale but effective 
irrigation projects, while the larger ones should be carried out 
according to capability. 
  Zhu Rongji pointed out: The central and western regions 
should vigorously develop infrastructure facilities and basic 
industries with emphasis on communications and transportation. 
Restrained by communications and transportation conditions, the 
regions' rich natural resources have not been fully utilized, 
however. Similarly, in the absence of a convenient 
transportation system and posts and communications networks, 
industrial development will be impossible. Hence, as far as the 
central and western regions are concerned, developing 
communications and transportation is not only an important means 
for quick prosperity, but also will help build a solid 
foundation for future industrial development and economic 
takeoff. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Developing the central and western regions 
will involve other questions, such as personnel training, 
changes in concept, transformation of mechanisms, and system 
innovation. The nationwide efforts in streamlining government 
organs and downsizing cadres are particularly important to the 
central and western regions. Currently, revenues collected by 
some poor areas nearly all go to the maintenance of cadres as 
state subsidies for helping poor areas through development; as 
such, what financial strength do we have to develop the economy? 
  Over the past few days, Zhu Rongji has been talking with 
deputies from Hunan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and Henan, and 
conscientiously heard views reflected by deputies from the 
central and western regions. Deputy Ding Guangen, a member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the 
Central Committee Secretariat, also took part in today's 
discussions with the Shaanxi delegation.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- Delegations attending 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC] continued their group meetings today to examine and 
discuss Premier Li Peng's government work report. Based on 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the realities of China's reform and 
development, deputies pointed out the need to unswervingly 
uphold the policy of promoting material and spiritual progress 
at the same time and attaching equal importance to both in the 
entire process of reform, opening up, and modernization, and to 
strengthen in a concrete way the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization, regarding it as a common task for all fronts and 
departments. 
  Some leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee, the NPC 
Standing Committee, and the State Council took part in various 
delegations' discussions of state affairs and listened to fellow 
deputies' views and suggestions. Li Tieying, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and state councillor, took 
part in the Tianjin delegation's discussion, focusing on the 
question of building a modern enterprise system for state-owned 
enterprises. He said: In reforming the system of property 
rights, state-owned enterprises must concentrate on three areas: 
1) building a new system to monitor, control, and manage 
state-owned assets; 2) establishing the rights of enterprises, 
as legal persons, to own properties and perfecting the system 
for enterprises to act as legal persons; and 3) establishing and 
perfecting the leadership and organizational structures of 
modern enterprises. He stressed: In the course of establishing 
a modern enterprise system, we must handle well relations 
between enterprises on the one hand and government, society, the 
market, and the owners on the other and between the leadership 
apparatus of an enterprise and its workers. We must make 
theoretical inquiry into this issue, and more importantly, we 
must probe it in practice and review and popularize what has 
been gained in practice. During his discussion with the Ningxia 
delegation, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said: No matter how 
enterprises develop in form, the character of state-owned 
enterprises must not change. We must take steps to preserve and 
increase the value of state assets; we must not let it decline 
or disappear. 
  Taking part in the Jiangxi delegation's examination and 
discussion, Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his views on 
reforming and develop education. He said: Education is of 
vital importance to the development of the national economy. 
The fundamental solution for education is reform. In carrying 
out education reform, we must first adjust the macroeducation 
structure, concentrating our resources on basic education. 
Without a successful basic education, higher education will end 
up as "castles in the air." Second, we must not impose 
uniformity in promoting the nine-year compulsory education. We 
must not demand uniform education, ignoring differences between 
urban and rural areas and between developed and underdeveloped 
areas. Third, we must step up reform with the goal to improve 
education standards and increase the beneficial results of 
higher education. Fourth, we must strengthen moral education 
and conduct education in patriotism and collectivism to bring up 
morally, intellectually, and physically developed people. 
  Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau, took part in the Sichuan delegation's 
discussions. Councillor Chen Junsheng attended the Guangdong and 
Guangzhou delegation's discussions; and State Councillor Ismail 
Amat participated in the Qinghai delegation's discussion. Each 
expressed his views on agricultural issues and on the question 
of developing the economy in nationality areas. 
  Wen Jiabao said: Agriculture affects the country's overall 
interests. At present we must carry out three major tasks: 
First, we must stabilize and increase grain and cotton outputs 
and make the "vegetable basket" project successful. Second, we 
must make continuous efforts to increase peasants' income. 
After stabilizing grain and cotton production, we must make 
vigorous efforts to diversify operations and develop secondary 
and tertiary industries. Third, we must safeguard stability in 
rural society. We must stabilize and perfect the party's 
various basic rural policies, successfully guide and protect the 
peasants' initiatives, and vigorously implement the various 
measures to perform concrete services for the peasants. 
  Speaking of the work of helping poor people, Chen Junsheng 
said: We must establish models who lifted themselves out of 
poverty and became well-off and give wide publicity to 
representative figures who shook off poverty and set out on the 
road to prosperity through self-reliance, hard struggle, thrift, 
and diligence. We must rely on advanced models to lead the 
march and overcome the mentality of waiting for, depending on, 
and demanding state preferential policies for relief. Chen 
Junsheng also urged Guangdong to make determined efforts to 
maintain the area of its grain crops, increase grain output, and 
work hard to raise the level of self-sufficiency in grain supply. 
  Ismail Amat said: For Qinghai to accelerate economic 
development, first the state should provide it with the support 
it needs; second, developed regions should provide it with 
assistance; and third, Qinghai should double its own efforts, 
which is the most crucial of the three. 
  During her participation in the Shanghai delegation's 
discussion, State Councillor Peng Peiyun briefed the deputies on 
China's current family planning work. State Councillors Chi 
Haotian and Song Jian took part in the discussions of the 
Guangxi and Liaoning delegations, respectively. 
  In their discussion of the policy of doing two types of work 
at the same time and attaching equal importance to both, 
deputies pointed out that strengthening the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization is an important component of 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
and an objective requirement for accelerating reform and 
develop. Gu Changchun, a deputy from Liaoning, said: Premier 
Li Peng's government work report gives prominence to the 
thinking of doing two types of work at the same time and 
attaching equal importance to both in the process of building a 
socialist market economic structure and the thinking of taking 
the road of developing the economy and culture simultaneously. 
In setting forth this year's economic construction and 
development tasks, the report also stresses the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization and the development of science 
and technology, education, and culture. These ideas of 
all-around social development conform with the trend of 
development of human society and the reality of Chinese society. 
Only by acting in accordance with these ideas and relying 
wholeheartedly on the broad masses of people can we ensure 
successful implementation of this year's reform measures. 
  In the discussions, deputies representing the People's 
Liberation Army said: To develop a socialist market economy, it 
is essential that we make vigorous efforts to strengthen the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization. The practice of 
reform and opening up has proved that a society's spiritual 
civilization will not automatically advance once the economy 
develops. Relentless and concrete efforts must be made to build 
spiritual civilization. We must answer the CPC Central 
Committee's call to deepen activities to learn from Xu Honggang, 
foster the Lei Feng spirit of the new period, and vigorously 
combat corruption and promote honest government. Leading cadres 
at all levels must set themselves as an example; start from 
themselves in maintaining integrity and exercising 
self-discipline; establish a good image in promoting clean, 
efficient government; and earnestly and comprehensively tackle 
problems of public order to create a good social and cultural 
environment for the speedy establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure. 
  Pointing out Shanghai's reality, Wu Bangguo, a Shanghai 
deputy, pointed out that to ensure Shanghai's economic 
development, its social ethics and public order must not weaken. 
We must follow Comrade Xiaoping's instruction and turn in a 
satisfactory report card in both material and spiritual 
civilization to the central authorities and Shanghai's people. 
We must carry out a good education in patriotism, collectivism, 
and socialism and advocate and foster the pioneering spirit 
proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin to bring up a new generation of 
better-educated people with idealism and a strong sense of 
discipline.

<F P=106> [News conference by National People's Congress deputies Qu </F>
Geping, Lin Zongtang, and Yang Jike with domestic and foreign 
correspondents at the International Hotel in Beijing on 15 
March; from a "Special News Feature" on the Second Session of 
the Eighth NPC -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Moderator] How are you, ladies and gentlemen? At 
today's news conference we have invited...[rest of sentence 
edited out by source] 
  [Qu Geping, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) 
Environmental Protection Committee (EPC]) Today, we are very 
glad to have this opportunity to meet you and exchange views 
with you on China's environmental protection. I have already 
given you my written statement. Now my two colleagues and I are 
ready to answer your questions. 
  [Dong Zhixiang] I am KEJI RIBAO [SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
DAILY] reporter Dong Zhixiang, what plans does the EPC have for 
China's future environmental protection? What will China's 
environment be like in the future? Thank you. 
  [Qu] China faces many environmental issues today and the 
situation is quite severe. So we must take a series of 
effective measures to deal with problems in this area or it is 
unlikely China will continue to have sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic growth in the future, especially next century. 
To protect the environment, we must take measures in several 
major respects. First of all, the NPC must intensify 
legislation and come up with the laws that are urgently needed 
today. During our present term of office, the NPC will revise 
or draw up 14 laws for control of environmental pollution and 
protecting natural resources. But it is important that these 
laws are enforced after they have been enacted. We have to urge 
the government to come up with effective measures for carrying 
out strict supervision of the environment according to law. 
Third [as received], as far as protecting the environment and 
natural resources are concerned, the state must appropriately 
increase spending. Generally, China's environmental condition 
is severe. But we hope that, after taking necessary measures, 
we will have an environment favorable for our natural resources 
as well as for sustained economic development. 
  [Unidentified correspondent in English, fading into Mandarin 
translation] I am from ASSOCIATED PRESS [AP]. Local Chinese 
governments at various levels have now given greater priority to 
economic development than to environmental protection. How 
serious is the problem? Moreover, the fines [fa kuan] imposed 
on the polluters are quite low. What measures have do you have 
planned to correct the situation? 
  [Qu] We have conducted many years of investigation and study 
on the economic losses which environmental pollution has causes 
in China. The approximate annual economic losses caused by 
pollution amount to 100 billion [yi qian yi] yuan. As far as 
your second question is concerned, the fees levied for pollution 
discharge [pai wu shou fei] are indeed too low. Some 
enterprises would rather pay the fees than take measures to 
control pollution. We have taken note of this problem. We are 
ready to raise the rates to force these enterprises to take 
remedial measures. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the Hong 
Kong SING PAO DAILY NEWS, I have something to ask related to a 
question from the AP correspondent. You said you plan to raise 
pollution discharge fees, can you tell us something about the 
collection of the fee? How big will the increase be? When 
(?will the increase become effective) and [words indistinct] 
fines? 
  [Qu] The total figure of pollution discharge fees we collect 
each year is less than 3 billion yuan, or a little bit more than 
0.1 percent of our gross industrial output. This is a very 
small figure. Therefore, the State Environmental Protection 
Bureau raised the rates by one-third last year. But it seems 
the new rates, which are being implemented, are still too low. 
So they will be raised further. Another measure adopted last 
year was the establishment of higher standards, by nearly 50 
percent, for pollution discharge by all newly-built factories. 
So the standards for pollution discharge are much higher now. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a China Central Television 
reporter, and I have a question for Chairman [as heard] Yang 
[EPC Vice Chairman Yang Jike]. You have been engaged in making 
economic laws for many years. The way certain impoverished 
areas have chosen to develop their economies has had a big 
impact on the ecology, can you tell us whether legislation can 
be passed to control these areas? Do you have such a plan? 
Thank you. 
  [Yang] The NPC plans to establish a legislative system 
compatible with (?sustainable) development by the end of this 
century, or a little later. This means that (?sustainable) 
development should be incorporated with our legislative system. 
Our work will include improving the Environmental Protection 
and Resources Protection Laws; speeding up economic legislation; 
and applying the (?sustainable) development principles to 
legislative affairs concerning development, population, 
production, and social security. China is a sprawling country. 
Different regions have different characteristics. And so local 
authorities should also have their own laws about the 
environment. So we hope that, around 2000, local authorities 
will have improved their legislative affairs relevant to 
(?sustainable) development. We hope our laws can converge with 
similar international laws. We will also adopt as many as 
possible legal provisions that have proven to be effective in 
other countries. Of course, China has its own specific 
situation. Since China has a large population, our population- 
related legislation may be different from that of developed 
countries. Except for this, we will do as much as we can to 
adopt the good experiences of countries in the West and learn 
from them. Finally, we will also propagate the ideas and 
information of (?sustainable) development, and train the 
personnel we need to make laws in this area. 
  [Correspondent, in Mandarin] I am a Hong Kong Wireless 
Television reporter. You mentioned that China has sustained 
economic losses amounting to 100 billion yuan annually [from 
environmental pollution]. How did you come up with this figure? 
My second question is: In recent years, the Chinese Government 
has planned to develop its nuclear power industry and has built 
some nuclear power stations, especially in southern Chinese 
provinces, such as Guangdong. These nuclear power stations are 
potentially dangerous with respect to their nuclear materials 
and wastes, which have to be properly treated, and accidents 
that might occur. Is there a contradiction between 
environmental protection and the development of nuclear power? 
As a state organ in charge of environmental protection, what is 
your comment on the policy of developing nuclear power? 
  [Qu] Your first question is about how the pollution-caused 
losses are calculated. It is a figure which experts have come 
up with through extensive investigation and study. The losses 
include those of material resources and the damage caused to the 
ecology, as well as the calculable harmful effects on physical 
health. This is a very complex issue. I can only give you a 
general picture. As for your second question about nuclear 
power development, it should be answered by [EPC Vice Chairman] 
Lin Zongtang, he is an expert in this area, but he asked me to 
comment on it briefly. China has only two nuclear power 
stations -- the Dayawan and Qinshan Nuclear Power Stations. We 
also plan to build more nuclear power stations in Guangdong and 
energy-deficient areas along the coast. Compared with 
traditional power plants that generate electricity by burning 
coal or oil, nuclear power stations should be considered a 
source of clear energy. The key requirement is that these 
stations must have safety measures. So when the nuclear power 
stations were built, China attached top priority to their 
quality and safety. The two nuclear power stations are very 
safe. They have the highest safety coefficient in the world. 
As as long as we strengthen management, nuclear power stations 
will not endanger the environment. The two nuclear power 
stations are now operating very well. As for the problem of 
treating nuclear wastes, this is a global problem. But this is 
not a big problem for China. Why? We have only two nuclear 
power stations. In addition, China has very large, very 
efficient, and very safe vaults [ku] for the storage of nuclear 
wastes. So the treatment of nuclear wastes is not a problem as 
far as China is concerned. 
  [Lin Zongtang] We have very good storage facilities in the 
Gobi Desert [laughing heartily]. 
  [Qu] So, countrymen in Hong Kong do not have to worry about 
this problem at all. 
  [Yang Jike] Just recently I invited six professors -- 
prestigious experts in the fields of energy and environment -- 
from Sweden, the United States, Britain, Italy, and Canada to 
inspect the Dayawan Nuclear Power Station. We found that this 
station has the world's best system for ensuring security. This 
system can continuously monitor the way nuclear wastes are 
treated and how the hardware installed in the station can cope 
with nuclear accidents. Moreover, all the personnel in the 
station must receive rotational training every year to make sure 
they can deal with any accident. So we were very impressed. All 
the professors were very satisfied. So countrymen in Hong Kong 
can feel at ease. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a FANGZHI RIBAO [TEXTILE 
DAILY] reporter, I want to ask Vice Chairman Lin Zongtang this 
question. During last year's (?campaign) for enforcing the law 
for environmental protection, some rhinoceros horns and bears' 
gallbladders were found. How were these findings handled. What 
is the result of the handling? 
  [Lin] China attaches very great importance to protecting 
wildlife and enforcing the Wildlife Protection Law. Last year, 
China joined the Convention for Protecting Endangered Wildlife 
and Plant Species. We are earnestly implementing this 
convention which we joined in 1980 [as heard]. Last year, the 
State Council formally issued a circular to strictly ban the 
illegal hunting and trading of tigers, rhinoceros, and other 
wildlife. For those rhinoceros horns already imported through 
normal channels, they are all sealed up and properly kept, 
pending handling. As for bears' bile, it is a very important 
ingredient in Chinese medicine and it plays a significant role 
in ensuring people's health. In the past, a bear had to be 
killed for its bile, which would later be processed into 
medicine. Now we keep the bear alive and draw the bile from the 
bear. So there is no need to kill the bear when obtaining its 
bile for medicinal purpose in such a manner is available. By 
raising one bear, we can prevent the slaughtering of 220 bears. 
However, we are still studying whether or not we can use 
another substance to replace bears' gallbladders. 
  [Qu] China has large numbers of bears. When the number of 
bears becomes too high [guo duo], they have to be (?thinned). I 
think this is a principle commonly followed by the International 
Fund for Wildlife Protection and other similar organizations. 
  [Moderator] Now the news conference has ended. Thank you 
all.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- In a report on the work 
delivered to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress today, Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's 
Court, said: Stability serves as an important guarantee for 
reform and economic development. In 1993, courts throughout the 
country continued to adhere to the principle of "grasping two 
links at the same time" in severely cracking down on serious 
criminal offenses. 
  In the report, he said: In 1993, courts accepted 403,267 
criminal cases of the first instance, of which trial was 
concluded on 403,177 cases. Courts gave verdicts to and 
enforced the law on 451,920 criminals. Of these, 173,879 were 
sentenced to prison terms of five years or more, life 
imprisonment, or death (including death sentences with a 
two-year reprieve), accounting for 38.48 percent of the total, 
or up 3.86 percentage points from the previous year. 
  In 1993, courts throughout the country deepened the struggle 
to deal severely with economic crimes. They accepted 27,463 
economic criminal cases of the first instance, of which trial 
was concluded on 27,323 cases. Of these, 15,204 cases were 
tried and 16,143 cases were concluded from August to December, 
73.62 percent and 102.13 percent respectively more than the 
monthly average of the first seven months of the year. Except 
for cases pending on appeal, withdrawn by procuratorates, or 
returned to procuratorates for further investigation, courts 
gave verdicts to and enforced the law on 22,106 criminals. Of 
these, 6,863 were sentenced to prison terms of five years or 
more, life imprisonment, or death (including death sentence with 
a two-year reprieve), accounting for 31.05 percent of the total, 
up 7.17 percentage points from the previous year. 
  Last year, courts concluded trial of 7,872 cases involving 
10,000 yuan or more, representing 54.75 percent of the total 
number of economic criminal cases and up 10.66 percentage points 
from 1992. Of this, 443 cases involved 300,000 yuan or more. 
Among the convicted were 69 county- or section-level and seven 
department- or bureau-level officials. 
  Ren Jianxin said: By punishing criminal offenders according 
to the law, the people's courts played an important role in 
strengthening comprehensive management of public order, 
safeguarding social stability, and ensuring the smooth progress 
of reform, opening up, and economic construction.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- In delivering work 
reports to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress today, Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's 
Court, and Zhang Siqing, procurator general of the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate, disclosed how judicial organs dealt with 
several major and important cases during the anticorruption 
struggle. 
  Ren Jianxin discussed bribery and embezzlement cases 
involving Li Xiaoshi, former vice chairman of the State Science 
and Technology Commission, and Shen Taifu, former president of 
Beijing's Great Wall Scientific and Technological Industrial 
Corporation of Machinery and Electronic Products, which had 
aroused widespread concern in all segments of society. He said: 
Li Xiaoshi abused his power to help Shen Taifu illegally 
collect money in return for more than 52,000 yuan in bribes and 
20,000 yuan in embezzled funds from the latter and his 
colleagues. On 4 March this year, the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court sentenced him to 20 years in prison 
on several charges during first-instance trials. On the same 
day, the same court, during first-instance trials, sentenced 
Shen Taifu to death on several charges, including those of 
raising funds illegally, such as embezzling 1 million yuan in 
public funds in collaboration with his wife and misappropriating 
2 million yuan in public funds by himself, as well as those of 
offering 250,000 yuan in bribes. Following appeals by Li 
Xiaoshi and Shen Taifu, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's 
Court is currently conducting second-instance trials. 
  Speaking of a cigarette-smuggling case in Shandong's Rushan 
City, Ren Jianxin said: Liu Qishan, former director of the 
Rushan City Commerce Bureau in Shandong Province, and his 
associates smuggled cigarettes worth a massive sum of money in 
collusion with smugglers outside the national boundaries in 
exceptionally serious circumstances, thereby causing an adverse 
effect in society. On 15 February this year, the Weihai City 
Intermediate People's Court in Shandong Province sentenced Liu 
Qishan; Fan Zhanwu, former political commissar of the Weihai 
City Border Defense Sub-Bureau; and Liu Ning, deputy director of 
the sub-bureau's business section, to death on several charges, 
including smuggling and bribery, during first-instance trials. 
The same court also sentenced Wang Jianzhi, former secretary of 
the Rushan city party committee, to death on several charges, 
including bribery and perversion of the law for personal gain, 
with two years' probation. The defendants have appealed to the 
Shandong Provincial Higher People's Court, which is conducting 
second-instance trials. 
  In his report, Zhang Siqing related how procuratorial organs 
investigated and dealt with major and important cases, saying: 
Fujian Province procuratorial organs solved a massive bribery 
case involving the Power Industry Ministry's Minjiang 
Engineering Bureau. The bureau director, four other bureau-level 
cadres, and 10 division-level cadres abused their 
project-contracting positions to demand and accept more than 3 
million yuan in bribes. Last September, procuratorial organs in 
Tieling City, Liaoning Province, solved a massive case of 
embezzlement, bribery, misappropriation, and tax evasion 
involving grain departments in Changtu County. Gui Bingquan, 
director of the county grain bureau, his deputy Yang Maoyuan, 
and other people abused their power to demand and accept bribes 
and to jointly engage in graft while selling substandard 
equipment to the county grain depot. Procuratorial organs 
booked 43 people for investigation, decided to arrest 25 people, 
and recovered and impounded 32 million yuan in ill-gotten money. 
  Zhang Siqing also related how procuratorial organs 
investigated and dealt with judicial personnel whose actions 
constituted crimes, saying: Guo Zhengmin, director of the 
Guizhou Provincial Public Security Department, abused his power 
to illegally authorize other people to process exit permits, 
taking more than 100,000 yuan in bribes in the process. Chen 
Zhiwen, procurator general of the Changping County Procuratorate 
in Beijing City, misused his power to take more than 20,000 yuan 
in bribes. Li Kaifu, member of the judicial committee and 
president of a Hubei Provincial Higher Court criminal tribunal, 
promised to win a reprieve for a death-row inmate in return for 
10,000 yuan in bribes from the inmate's relatives. Zhang Siqing 
said: Procuratorial organs investigated and sternly dealt with 
crimes committed by such judicial personnel while enforcing the 
law, thus safeguarding the dignity and fairness of state laws.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
procuratorates at all levels in 1993 strengthened their 
supervision over law enforcement, focused their efforts on 
fighting against offenses of embezzlement and bribery and 
serious criminal offenses and stepped up the work to deal with 
violators of citizen rights and suspects of malfeasance. 
  Thus, they have made great contributions to safeguarding the 
country's stability and public order and ensuring a smooth 
progress of establishing a socialist market economy and pushing 
ahead with the modernization drive. 
  Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of China's Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, made the remarks to the current session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress here today. 
  Last year, Zhang said, procuratorates at various levels in 
the country investigated more than 56,491 cases involving 
embezzlement and bribery, misappropriation of public funds, tax 
evasion, refusal to pay taxes and frauds in export tax refunding. 
  Procuratorates at different levels investigated and punished 
1,037 cadres at or above county level involved in such offenses 
in 1993, with 64 being bureau-level officials and one being a 
vice- ministerial level official, Zhang said. 
  Procuratorates at all levels last year firmly carried out 
the 
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's directions on 
fighting against corruption, focused their efforts on 
investigating and dealing with major cases. 
  In the September-December period, they investigated 8,538 
major cases each involving embezzlement and bribery of more than 
10,000 yuan and misappropriation of public funds valued at 
50,000 yuan and more and investigated and punished 715 officials 
at or above country level involved in such offenses. 
  In cooperation with public security, state security, 
judicial, administrative departments and courts, China's 
procuratorates appropriately dealt with some major cases with 
great impacts, safeguarding the country's political and social 
stability, according to Zhang. 
  For instance, Zhang said, procuratorates across the country 
last year staged nationwide struggles against train robbery, 
larceny, kidnapping and abduction of women and children, and 
prostitution. In the period, they carried out struggles against 
narcotics trafficking and confiscated arms from smugglers in 
Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and waged 
anti-smuggling and illicit emigration fights in southeastern 
coastal and border provinces and regions. 
  In 1993, Zhang said, procuratorates across the country 
approved the arrest of 532,394 criminal suspects and took 
proceedings against 479,860 of them to people's courts, of whom 
129,219 were involved in major cases. 
  At present, China's public order is generally stable, but 
there are still some unstable factors, Zhang said. Hostile 
forces and elements abroad have never stopped their activities 
to split, subvert and infiltrate China and steal secrets from 
the country. At home, at the same time, sabotage activities by 
splittists and illicit activities under the cloak of religion 
have become more serious. 
  Major heinous criminal cases are on the rise, the number of 
violent crimes has increased by a bigger margin, public order in 
some rural areas is out of control and, organized crime runs 
rampant in some cities and towns, leaving people with no sense 
of safety, Zhang said. 
  Cases of larceny, destruction of state important production 
facilities, looting of state property and fighting with weapons 
among groups of people take place frequently, he added. 
  In his speech, Zhang also touched upon supervision over law 
enforcement and training of procurators. 
  As for tasks of procuratorates this year, Zhang said that 
first, in the anti-corruption struggle, procuratorates will 
concentrate their efforts on handling major cases and 
investigate mainly cases involving officials and staff members 
in party and government organs, judicial departments, 
administrative law enforcement departments and economic 
management departments. 
  Second, procuratorates will continue to crack down on 
serious 
criminal offenses; 
  Third, they will strengthen supervision over law enforcement 
and promptly correct law violations in judicial work; 
  Fourth, training of procurators will be improved, the 
procuratorial system will be reformed, and a socialist 
procuratorial system suited to a socialist market economy and 
having Chinese characteristics will be built.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The Revolutionary 
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) today called on the 
Taiwan authorities to agree to formal contacts between the 
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Kuomintang in Taiwan. 
  RCCK Vice Chairman Li Ganliu made the call on behalf of his 
party at Wednesday's [16 March] meeting of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC). 
  "The Taiwan authorities should abandon illusions, face the 
reality, accept CPC's proposals on opening talks between the two 
parties and establishing direct exchanges of mail, trade, and 
shipping and air services between the two sides of the Taiwan 
straits, and make decisions that will benefit the Chinese 
nation," he said. 
  Relations across the Straits and the situation relating to 
the peaceful reunification of China have undergone significant 
changes in the past year, and the major trend of changes is 
positive, he said. 
  Li reviewed development of relations between the two sides: 
economic links between the two sides are growing, with Taiwan 
investment in the mainland increasing by a big margin; trade and 
personnel exchanges between the two sides are expanding rapidly; 
and agreements reached between the two non-governmental 
organizations, namely the Strait Exchange Foundation of Taiwan 
and the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits of 
the mainland, marked a historical step forward in relations 
between the two sides. 
  He pointed out, however, that the Taiwan authorities 
stubbornly cling to their policy of blocking direct commercial 
and communication links with the mainland. On the other hand, 
they are pursuing a splittist policy of "two Chinas" on the 
international scene by carrying out "money campaigns" and 
"flexible diplomacy." Last year, they stepped up activities for 
Taiwan's "return to the United Nations" in an attempt to gain 
"dual recognition." After the attempt was thwarted, they have 
resorted to "holiday-making diplomacy" recently. 
  Facts have shown that there has not been a fundamental 
change 
in the Taiwan authorities' wrong stand on the reunification of 
China. Their activities are in contradiction with their 
repeatedly proclaimed stand of "one China." 
  He said the reunification of China is an irresistible trend 
of the times and the aspirations of people on both sides of the 
straits. Any attempts to delay the cause of reunification and 
to create "two Chinas" are doomed to fail, he said.

(6328 1164 0516)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] held its second plenary meeting 
this morning to let committee members voice their views. Gu 
Shengzu, Fang Jiade, Guo Guoqing, Li Hongchang, and Wang 
Chuanlun expressed opinions on ways to guide "migrant rural 
workers," to establish a modern enterprise system, and to bring 
into full play the role of supervisors. 
  In his speech, committee member Gu Shengzu offered 
suggestions on how to rationally guide the current massive 
movement of rural labor. He said: At present, of the 0.2 
billion surplus rural workers, 50-60 million are migrant 
workers, creating a massive movement of rural labor. Migrant 
workers do make contributions; however, they greatly affect 
transportation and social order at the same time. He made the 
following suggestions: We should use the market to rationally 
guide migrant workers. Under the premise of guiding them 
through multiple channels, we should make rural towns and 
townships the main centers for channeling surplus rural labor in 
a bid to slow down the flow of surplus rural labor to large 
cities. Meanwhile, we should reform such systems as residence 
registration to bring about a complete transfer of part of 
surplus rural labor. To prevent a blind and disorderly massive 
movement of rural labor and to organize migrant rural workers 
systematically, the government should strengthen overall 
regulation, guidance, and coordination in dealing with migrant 
rural workers who move from place to place. 
  In his speech, committee member Fang Jiade said: To 
establish a modern enterprise system is the foundation for 
establishing the socialist market economic structure and the 
goal of the reform in state-owned enterprises. To carry out 
this important reform, we must whole-heartedly persist in the 
policy of relying on the working class. In the course of 
establishing a modern enterprise system, we must attach great 
importance to the workers' role. Moreover, we must set up a 
scientific enterprise leadership system and an organization and 
management system with the workers' democratic participation. 
He suggested: In the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system, the board of directors, the supervisory board, and the 
assembly of share-holders should consist of a certain number of 
workers' representatives. We must uphold and perfect the 
Workers' Congress and practice democratic management in 
enterprises. We must uphold collective negotiations and sign 
collective agreements to ensure that the legitimate rights and 
interests of workers, who are the master of the state, will not 
be violated. At the same time, we should step up the 
formulation of relevant laws to incorporate the policy of 
whole-heartedly relying on the working class into laws, policy, 
and the plans and measures for establishing a modern enterprise 
system. 
  Committee member Guo Guoqing said: Under the conditions of 
the socialist market economic structure, it is very important to 
bring into full play the role of special supervisors, 
inspectors, auditors, educational inspectors, and other 
discipline enforcement workers. He pointed out: These special 
discipline enforcement jobs are highly political and 
professional. We should arrange for professionally trained 
comrades and those who are capable of participating in political 
affairs to do those jobs. Meanwhile, relevant state departments 
should make an overall plan for those special discipline 
enforcement workers each year. In light of the development and 
needs of the situation, these departments must promptly amend 
and perfect the regulations governing the special discipline 
enforcement workers; further specify their duties, rights, and 
responsibilities; and institutionalize the special discipline 
enforcement work. The CPC Central Committee and relevant state 
organs should often communicate with special discipline 
enforcement workers, ask for their opinions, summarize their 
experiences, and bring into play the role of comrades 
participating in special discipline enforcement. 
  Committee member Li Hongchang suggested that the 
development of chambers of commerce be placed high on the agenda 
to meet the socialist market economy's needs. He said: The 
economy's rapidly growing nonpublic-owned sector has become 
increasingly important. This sector, which is at its initial 
stage and is rather scattered, has kept its distance from 
macroeconomic regulation and control. Therefore, it is in 
particular need of organizations like chambers of commerce that 
organize their representatives, represent their legitimate 
interests, maintain communications with the party and 
government, and provide various services. At the same time, the 
government needs the chambers of commerce to help it administer 
and guide the nonpublic-owned sector's healthy development. He 
also suggested that party committees and governments at all 
levels be fully aware of the importance of chambers of commerce 
and give top priority to their development. The relevant state 
authorities should formulate a "Chamber of Commerce Law" at an 
early date to clearly define, in the form of law, the functions 
and responsibilities of chambers of commerce so that they can 
operate in accordance with law. 
  Committee member Wang Weilun pointed out that the 
anticorruption drive is of major importance today. He said that 
in the ongoing anticorruption drive, it is important to rely on 
the masses and step up efforts in investigating major cases in 
accordance with law. Meanwhile, we must pay special attention to 
collective violations of discipline; strictly enforce rules and 
regulations; and root out unhealthy practices in various 
industries, trades, and professions. Party and government 
departments at all levels should also announce progress in the 
anticorruption drive to keep the people informed and to bolster 
their confidence and enthusiasm in the drive.

invite six members and Standing Committee members of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National 
Committee to the news conference today, entitled: Energetically 
Develop Education, Science and Technology, and Cultural and Art 
Undertakings in the Process of Establishing a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure. They are renowned Chinese educators, 
scientists, and artists: Jin Kaicheng, CPPCC National Committee 
Standing Committee member, Jiusan Society Central Committee vice 
chairman, and Beijing University Chinese Language Department 
professor; Wu Zuqiang, CPPCC National Committee Standing 
Committee member and former Central Conservatory of Music 
president; Ye Danian, CPPCC National Committee Standing 
Committee member, China Democratic League Central Committee 
Standing Committee member, and Chinese Academy of Sciences 
Geology Institute member and researcher; Zhang Kaixun, CPPCC 
National Committee member, China Association for Promoting 
Democracy Central Committee member, and Beijing Machinery 
Industry and Automation Institute senior engineer; Zhao Yufen, 
CPPCC National Committee member, Chinese Academy of Sciences 
member, and Qinghua University professor; and Guan Dongsheng, 
CPPCC National Committee member, Central University of 
Nationalities professor, and calligrapher. 
  [(Wen Guangwei)] (Wen Guangwei), from the Central People's 
Broadcasting Station. My question is directed to Standing 
Committee member Jin Kaicheng: Respect for knowledge and 
talented people is the key for developing scientific, 
educational, and cultural undertakings. Would you please 
discuss how this concept is being implemented in actual work? 
  [Jin] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has all along advocated respect 
for knowledge and talented people. Through the efforts by 
higher and lower levels and in all sectors since the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, this concept 
has gradually taken root in society and has been translated in 
various concrete actions. For example, the Teachers Law provides 
that the whole society shall respect teachers. This is a 
concrete expression of respecting knowledge and talented people 
in the education sphere. Therefore, in my view, some progress 
has indeed been made in implementing the concept in education. 
However, I would like to call attention to a more noteworthy 
phenomenon in society, that is, the demand for talented people 
under circumstances of a market economy. The demand for 
talented people has become very acute in some places, though it 
has not become burning yet. In the light of this, I believe 
that in the future, the concept of respecting knowledge and 
talented people will be translated as the demand for knowledge 
and talented people rather than the continued practice of 
everyone eating from the same big pot. Meanwhile, the view of 
talented people will be changed from a static and dynamic state. 
At present, the acute demand for talented people is reflected 
not nationwide, but only at certain points, such as the 
Zhongguancun Single Trade Lane and village and township 
enterprises in southern Jiangsu. However, I dare to predict 
today that so long as China continues its reform, development, 
and stability for a long time to come, the demand for talented 
people will pervade the whole country. By that time, respect 
for knowledge and talented people will no longer be an issue of 
understanding; it will be guaranteed by an irresistible force. 
  [Reporter] Hong Kong WEN WEI PO reporter. What is the 
government policy regarding to Hong Kong and Taiwan singers' 
performance tours in the mainland this year? 
  [Wu Zuqiang] Quite a few singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan 
performed in the mainland over the past few years. They exerted 
some good influences, strengthened exchanges in music between 
the two sides, and brought along new songs to the delight of 
mainland music lovers. However, problems also cropped up in the 
past two years. They were caused mainly by poor quality of some 
performers and their mainland agents' sheer profit-seeking 
approach, thus creating confusion and harmful consequences. For 
this reason, the culture departments, at suggestions from the 
masses, have recently examined the work related to Hong Kong and 
Taiwan singers performance tours, and will work out more 
effective and rational administrative measures. I believe 
singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan will continue to stage 
concerts and performance tours in the mainland in 1994, but I 
hope such activities will be conducted through proper channels 
and will exert healthy influence on music and society. 
  [Reporter] RENMIN ZHENGXIE BAO [PEOPLE'S POLITICAL 
CONSULTATIVE NEWS]. My question is directed to member Guan 
Dongsheng. As I understand it, in the current session, CPPCC 
members have attached great importance to the development of 
ethnic minority regions. As a University of Nationalities 
professor, do you have any suggestions or opinions for 
developing culture and education in ethnic minority regions? 
  [Guan] As is known to all, due to historical, social, and 
geographical reasons, the overwhelming majority of China's 
ethnic minority regions are lagging far behind the coastal 
regions in terms of the overall development of economy, 
education, and culture. The party and government have always 
paid keen attention to the development of minority nationalities 
regions. The 1990 CPC Central Committee Proposal Concerning the 
Formulation of the 10-Year Program for National Economic and 
Social Development and the Eighth Five- Year Plan stressed the 
need to bring into full play the ethnic regions' advantages and 
to appropriately combine the exploitation of their resources 
with their social and economic development to gradually change 
the relative economic backwardness of ethnic regions. Facts 
have proved that the party's policy toward minority 
nationalities implemented since the PRC's founding is entirely 
correct and has withstood the tests of time. Premier Li Peng's 
government work report to the current National People's Congress 
[NPC] session further emphasized the need to put education in a 
strategic position for priority development and to increase 
funds for educational undertakings. Premier Li Peng also 
suggested that governments at various levels cut back 
expenditures in other areas and do everything possible to 
achieve concrete results in developing education. All NPC 
deputies and CPPCC members attending the current sessions 
believe Premier Li Peng's suggestion reflects the fervent hope 
of the Chinese people of all nationalities. They have called 
upon leaders at all levels to guard against formalism and to 
earnestly implement the suggestion to the letter. They have 
also urged leaders to thoroughly understand the great 
significance of developing education in ethnic regions and to 
make an effort at training ethnic talented people and raising 
the quality of ethnic work force. This is the only way for 
invigorating ethnic regions' economy, and the cardinal principle 
for safeguarding national unity and the motherland's unification 
and for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Moreover, it is necessary to proceed from reality in all things 
and fully consider the minority nationalities regions' ethnic 
characteristics in increasing funds for basic education in 
ethnic regions and continuing to adopt feasible and flexible 
methods in running schools -- such as bilingual education, 
technical schools, and schools run by the coastal regions -- so 
as to keep up with the demand for development in ethnic regions. 
In my view, to achieve initial prosperity in ethnic regions, it 
is necessary to first promote education. 
  [Reporter] ZHONGGUO RIBAO correspondent. My question is 
directed to Ms. Zhao Yufen. The government has drawn up a new 
program for developing higher education. Would you explain the 
program's contents and your assessment? 
  [Zhao] The most formidable task facing the Education 
Commission is called Project 211, a project for training 
talented people. As you know, the world contest for national 
strength today will ultimately be a contest for talented people. 
China is aware of the great importance of training talented 
people. Project 211 aims at building 100 key universities that 
will reach the world's most advanced level in a number of 
subjects within a short period of time. At present, many 
schools of higher learning, including famous national and 
provincial universities, are vying with each other to become one 
of the 100 key universities. In view of the fierce competition 
to be included in the project, many local governments have 
financed various universities to set up joint campuses so that 
each can best utilize its strong points to become a key 
university. As a result, we have seen a trend for joint 
management of schools of higher learning. The Chinese nation is 
now endeavoring to build a great wall of talented people. 
Project 211 is as significant as the Three Gorges Project. 
This is the largest-scale project to train talented people in 
Chinese history. 
  [Reporter] Hong Kong SING TAO DAILY correspondent. My 
question is directed to Mr. Zhang Kaixun. How do you raise 
funds for popularizing technological innovations? Were any 
illicit means ever used in fund raising, such as in the Shen 
Taifu case? 
  [Zhang] If the topic of a scientific research project is 
directly related to the development of production or a common 
need of the people's everyday lives, such as medicine and health 
care, disaster prevention and control, and new scientific 
instruments, the project can find manufacturers of related 
fields as sponsors. We have recently developed a new medical 
device which can accurately detect possible infant suffocation 
during sleep. The need for such a device already existed before 
we started planning the project. After we disclosed our idea to 
relevant enterprises and organizations, they were certain that 
their sponsorship for the project would succeed because it was a 
demand of society for scientific innovation and they had the 
responsibility to meet this demand. In this way, we have 
effectively combined the wealth, enthusiasm, and wisdom of 
society to jointly carry out the project. Therefore, it is not 
difficult for us to raise funds for developing new technology. 
We do not use Shen Taifu's method. 
  [Reporter] KEJI RIBAO [SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DAILY] 
correspondent. My question is directed to member Ye Danian. 
While deliberating the government work report, what is the 
issue of utmost concern to CPPCC National Committee members? 
  [Ye] My experience from attending the past seven CPPCC 
sessions shows that inadequate input is the issue of most 
concern to members from science and technology circles, and it 
has been discussed time and again. Members are encouraged by 
the Scientific and Technological Progress Law, which will become 
effective soon. However, they deplore the absence of provisions 
in the law for a fixed input in science and technology during a 
given period of time. They feel that even though funds for 
science and technology have increased numerically, the increase 
is off-set by price rises and the funds are insignificant. 
Another issue is the policy of holding fast to one end and 
leaving the whole field open. Members support this policy, but 
hope it will be more specific and easy to be implemented. 
  [Reporter] China International Broadcasting Station 
correspondent. As we understand it, there are many cultural 
relics around the Three Gorges Dam area. The CPPCC National 
Committee last year organized members for a tour of the area. 
As I know, Wu Zuqiang was one of the members. Would member Wu 
Zuqiang explain measures to protect cultural relics in the Three 
Gorges Dam area? 
  [Wu] We visited many places with cultural relics. It was 
our general impression that vigorous efforts should be made to 
promptly preserve cultural relics while building the dam. We 
are pleased that our findings have provided a positive impact to 
the efforts to preserve cultural relics. For example, the Three 
Gorges Construction Committee has set an unprecedented rule that 
requires companies and organizations bidding for any project to 
include provisions for protecting cultural relics into the terms 
of contracts. 
  [Moderator] This is the end of the news conference. Thank 
you.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The central 
government must not relax its macro-controls over the country's 
banking industry after banks enjoy full operational autonomy, 
according to a well-known Chinese economist. 
  "Macro-controls over the banking sector, however, should be 
distinguished from government mandates to banks," said Wang 
Chuanlun, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and an 
economics professor of Chinese People's University. 
  To have macro-control means, the professor said, the 
government must establish and improve various kinds of financial 
markets in a systematic way. 
  First to be established, Wang said, is a market for 
short-term inter-banking lending and borrowing, to be followed 
successively by a bill discount market, a market for the trading 
of treasury bonds, a market for the trading of enterprise bonds 
and shares and a mortgage loan market. 
  In the meantime, he said, the existing foreign exchange 
market should be improved. 
  For the central bank, he said, the main function is to 
maintain the value of the Chinese yuan and determine its 
exchange rates with other currencies. 
  In converting existing banks into purely commercial banks, 
he 
said, the first thing to do is to determine their assets through 
careful auditing. 
  It is necessary, he said, for the government to decide 
establishing some "policy" banks. But the government should 
have concrete decisions on who exercise control over such banks, 
where their founding capital should come from, and who will bear 
their future risks and losses.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Xu Zhaorong (1176 0340 2837)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- Like the wind of spring 
coming from the south, Mr. Ma Man-kei, vice chairman of the 
Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC] and president of Macao's Chinese Chamber of Commerce, 
again punctually arrived here this year to attend the Second 
Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee -- as he has done 
in many past years. Although almost 70, the venerable Ma is 
still full of vitality. He spoke of the National People's 
Congress [NPC] and CPPCC sessions with profound feelings: "I 
was involved in the CPPCC work in Guangdong for more than two 
decades, and during the last 10 years and more, I have been 
involved in NPC and CPPCC National Committee work. Overall, I 
feel that our NPC and CPPCC work have become more and more 
mature. The sessions' proceedings have improved with each 
passing year. This year's sessions will further push forward 
the reform to build a socialist market economic structure. I am 
confident that the sessions will be successful." Speaking of 
this, he stepped closer to the reporter and, with an amiable 
smile, he said: "I am full of determination and confidence. 
The reason is I have faith in the CPC's power." 
  Speaking of the recent termination of the Sino-British talks 
on Hong Kong's political system, his already rosy face reddened: 
"Colonialists will not resign themselves to withdrawing from the 
stage of history. The British want to continue their colonial 
rule in Hong Kong after 1997." At this time, he took this 
reporter's notebook and pen and wrote: "The ghost of 
imperialism refuses to leave." 
  He continued: "The British attempt will not succeed. 
Whatever tricks it uses will be futile and end up hurting 
itself, like lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet. 
No force can stop China from regaining its sovereignty over 
Hong Kong and achieving national reunification. This is because 
China today is already `a completely different story!'" 
  Partly because of the excitement and partly as a result of 
the cold he has had in the last few days, he felt a little tired 
and was helped by family members to the bedroom to rest. Before 
he left, he introduced his third son, Mao You-li -- who is a 
member of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee -- to this 
reporter. He said: "Please have more chats on the sessions." 
  Wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, Ma You-li [you li 
meaning courteous], like his name, was quite refined and 
courteous and looked like a scholar. Speaking of the Hong Kong 
issue, he was also full of just indignation: "The British are 
guilty of wishful thinking, and nothing good will come of it for 
the British. As Premier Li Peng stressed in the `Government 
Work Report,' `British colonial rule in Hong Kong will soon end, 
and cannot be stopped by any force.'" 
  Although born and brought up in Macao, Ma You-li, 46, was 
quite familiar with the three components of Marxism. He 
believed that the socialist market economy being practiced in 
China is compatible with Marxist economics and that it is a road 
suited to China's reality and essential to its development, a 
road chosen by Comrade Deng Xiaoping by integrating China's 
reality with Marxism. 
  Ma You-li graduated from Hong Kong's Chinese University, 
where he studied economic management. He always came back to 
what he learned when discussing the NPC and CPPCC sessions: "I 
specialize in economics and am engaged in business. Therefore, 
I set great store by economic efficiency. It was pointed out in 
Premier Li Peng's government work report and General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin's recent speech on new development ideas that we 
must shift our approach to development to the path of raising 
economic efficiency and that we must not continue to follow the 
old path of blindly pursuing output value, high development 
speed, and investment expansion. These ideas are quite suitable 
to the reality of China's economic development." He said: 
China has only limited resources and not enough funds. With a 
weak economic foundation, it cannot afford to pour its limited 
funds and human and material resources into construction 
projects that have no or few economic benefits. We cannot 
pursue output value if what is produced is worthless and does 
not create economic benefits. We must rationally, 
scientifically, and effectively distribute our limited 
resources. Only by doing so can we push our economy along the 
path of healthy development. 
  He smiled: "As a matter of fact, I already spoke about this 
issue during the discussion held by the CPPCC's Macao group. I 
also discussed my views on other issues, such as the tide of 
migrating workers. I feel that as a CPPCC National Committee 
member, I should do something concrete during this session. 
Discussing state affairs is our power as well as our duty. The 
government also takes our views seriously and tries its best to 
improve its work. Therefore, we are confident that through 
efforts during and after the sessions, we will achieve 
reunification of the motherland and make our country strong and 
prosperous."

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The State Council, 
China's cabinet, should set up a new top-level population 
managerial department, a senior leader of the Chinese Peasants 
and Workers Democratic Party (CPWDP) said today. 
  The proposal was put forward by Fang Rongxin, an executive 
vice chairman of the CPWDP Central Committee at the second 
public-address meeting of the ongoing second session of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC). 
  Fang is one of ten speakers addressing today's meeting. 
  Over the past few years, China has scored world-acknowledged 
achievements in family planning, Fang said. 
  As a result, population growth has slowed down markedly, and 
the population structure and quality has improved, he told the 
meeting. 
  "However, China is still facing an arduous task in checking 
its population from growing too rapidly," he said. 
  In his speech, Jiang Jingbo, a Standing Committee member of 
the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, made a 
five-point proposal concerning supervision over the work of the 
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government. The proposal 
says: 
  -- CPC committees and governments at all levels should 
increase their contacts with democratic parties; 
  -- The system under which democratic parties participate in 
discussing state affairs should be further improved; 
  -- A system under which democratic parties exercise 
supervision over government work should be established and 
improved; 
  -- Further improve the system under which democratic parties 
and persons without party affiliation assume leading posts in 
governments and judicial departments; and 
  -- Make sure that democratic parties enjoy all rights as 
stipulated in China's constitution. 
  Li Ganliu, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the 
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, expressed the 
hope that the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan accept the CPC 
proposal on direct exchanges of mail, trade and shipping and air 
services across the Taiwan Straits. 
  The Kuomintang in Taiwan should hold talks with the CPC at 
an 
early date, he added. 
  In their speeches Li Zhensheng, a former vice president of 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and He Jindao made proposals on 
how to promote the use of agro-techniques and put a stop to 
environmental pollution. 
  In his speech, Zhu Guangya, vice president of the China 
Association for Science and Technology, emphasized the 
importance of respecting science. 
  In their speeches, Sun Han called for efforts to expand the 
rural cooperative economy, Li Yongchang stressed the need to 
further promote grain production, Jin Jian proposed ways to help 
various nationalities to achieve common prosperity, and Qu 
Shijing aired his views on the need to develop social sciences. 
  Present at the meeting were Li Ruihuan, chairman of the 
CPPCC 
National Committee, and 11 vice chairmen of the committee. 
  Wen Jiabao, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee, State Councillor Peng Peiyun and 
leaders of State Council departments also attended today's 
meeting.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016) and Peng Shujie </F>
(1756 2885 2638) ] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng of the 
State Council this morning separately attended discussions of 
the Henan and Heilongjiang [NPC] delegations at the Great Hall 
of the People to hear deputies' opinions and suggestions on the 
government work report. He said: Both Henan and Heilongjiang 
have scored great achievements in reform and opening up. I hope 
all of you will establish confidence, overcome difficulties, and 
continue to make use of your assets to further carry out 
economic construction. 
  More than 20 deputies from Henan and Heilongjiang expressed 
their views on enlivening large and medium state-owned 
enterprises; increasing agricultural investment, conserving 
energy, ensuring the smooth implementation of reform measures; 
and other issues. 
  After hearing deputies' opinions and suggestions, Premier Li 
Peng spoke on related issues. He said: Since the policy of 
reform and opening up was adopted by implementing the household 
contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to 
output and by developing secondary and tertiary industries, 
great changes have taken place in rural areas -- the development 
of village and town enterprises is especially notable. We have 
been feeding 22 percent of the world's population with only 7 
percent of the world's cultivated land -- this is a remarkable 
achievement. Currently, we have abundant grain in stock, but we 
must not be slack for a moment in grain production. 
  Li Peng said: Now we have many peasant entrepreneurs in 
rural 
areas. Most of them have practiced strict self-discipline; 
worked deligently; continued to improve themselves 
ideologically, politically, and vocationally; and enjoyed a good 
reputation. However, a small number of them have changed 
qualitatively -- some of them even have committed crimes. This 
problem is good food for thought. Part of the reason is because 
these people's educational level is low. Some people tend to 
commit big mistakes after they become rich and powerful if they 
are not subject to supervision. Our cadres and governments at 
all levels also need to be supervised. Party organizations at 
all levels should cherish, help, and educate those who lead 
others to become better off in rural areas, and the masses also 
should exercise supervision over them. At the same time, these 
people, as peasant entrepreneurs, also should continue to 
enhance their understanding of the rule of law. 
  While discussing transforming large and medium state-owned 
enterprises' operating mechanisms, Li Peng said: To establish a 
modern enterprise system and to solve problems concerning large 
and medium state-owned enterprises, we need to transform the 
operating mechanisms and must conduct specific analyses taking 
the reality and specific problems into consideration so that we 
can suit the remedy to the case. One of the very important 
factors that decides an enterprise's efficiency is whether its 
products are readily marketable. 
  Li Peng continued: This year so far we have initiated a 
number of major economic reform measures, enabling us to take an 
important step toward establishing a socialist merket economic 
system. These measures will contribute to fair competition; 
they not only play a positive role in the current economic 
development, but also have far-reaching significance. Problems 
of various natures will come up in the course of implementing 
these measures. Our attitude is to solve problems as soon as 
they come up. 
  Li Peng stressed: Energy conservation is important work. We 
have scored considerable achievements in this area over the last 
few years; however, there is still a lot we can do. Energy is 
keenly in short supply in China. We have to invest a lot of 
money every year in building power plants and coal mines, and, 
compared with advanced countries, our energy utilization 
efficiency lags far behind. We need to work hard to catch up.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- "Give me a minute!" 
"Give me a minute!" several eager voices were resounding through 
one of the meeting halls in the Great Hall of the People, the 
shrine of China's top legislature -- the National People's 
Congress (NPC). 
  Joining in the "shouting contest" were several NPC delegates 
from Heilongjiang Province in northeast China attending a group 
discussion of the province delegation today. They were trying 
to catch the attention of Sun Weiben, the provincial party 
secretary who was presiding over the group discussion. 
  Among other people sitting back in big arm-chairs around the 
hall, Chinese Premier Li Peng was smiling quietly at the scene. 
  Sun spoke out at last, pointing to one delegate: "Please 
speak first." 
  It was 11:45 [0345 GMT] in the morning. Sun had just 
suggested that Li Peng make a final speech at the group meeting 
before the time for lunch. 
  To Sun's surprise, Fang Chunzi, a female deputy of the 
minority nationality of Korean, jumped to her feet and said: 
"Please give me a minute, I want to say just one thing." 
  The presider had no choice but to agree to the request of 
the 
representative of women and minority nationalities, who is also 
a senior engineer working on a forest farm. 
  She said: "Lumbermen work hard all year round and make great 
contributions to the country. But their wages are not stable, 
and their livelihood is difficult. I wonder whether the premier 
knows such problems. I hope that the government will solve them 
as soon as possible." 
  Precisely a sixty-second speech. 
  Before the presider could even utter a word, a woman owner 
of 
a chicken farm stood up at the other end of the hall, saying: 
"Give me a minute too!" 
  Speaking with a strong local accent, Liang Fengying went on 
to say: "I am a representative of farmers. Though I don't till 
in fields, I want to speak on behalf of farmers who elected me 
as an NPC deputy." 
  She used her own example to ask people who get rich first to 
help other people become prosperous. 
  "Why should not the prosperous provinces in the country help 
other less developed regions? They should be able to do what I, 
a farmer, can do." 
  Her simple, frank speech was applauded by everyone in the 
hall. 
  But the speech lasted longer than one minute. It took three 
minutes and fifty seconds, precisely. 
  Although the presider repeatedly announced that time was 
getting late since the premier would attend the afternoon full 
meeting of the NPC session, many deputies raised their hands 
high, saying loudly: "Give me a minute! Give me a minute!" 
  In turn, an engineer, a manager of a state-owned enterprise 
and other persons stood up and took the floor, asking for more 
government support for state enterprises. 
  A smiling Li Peng listened attentively to the speeches of 
the 
deputies throughout the meeting, jotting down something on a 
handy padbook from time to time. 
  He told the deputies that every difficulty that the province 
faces is on the government's note and will be dealt with 
carefully. 
  He called on the deputies to have confidence and make 
concerted efforts from the top to the bottom level, in order to 
bring youthful vigor to the province's out-dated industries. 
  In still another breath, he answered the questions by the 
deputies one by one, saying that the State Council will 
specially study the problems faced by the province in the near 
future and help solve them. 
  When all was said, persisting applauds echoed again in the 
big hall. The deputies expressed their thanks to the premier by 
clapping their hands. 
  Li said with a smile: "I'd like to hear opinions from the 
grassroots deputies very much."

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, this 
morning had a talk with NPC deputies from Shandong Province 
attending the current session of the eighth NPC. 
  At the ongoing NPC session, deputies have already reached 
consensus on many major issues. What is needed to be done in 
the future is to carefully solve problems in line with the 
reality of localities and departments, he said. 
  Shandong, with a population of 80 million, is a large 
province in terms of economy. A total of 174 deputies attended 
the annual session of the NPC, of whom some are from Yimeng 
Mountains, an old revolutionary base. 
  During the liberation war period, Shandong people, 
especially 
people in the Yimeng Mountainous area contributed greatly to 
winning the war, Qiao said. 
  Today it is all the more necessary to carry forward the fine 
tradition in order to overcome difficulties and solve problems, 
he added. 
  He urged deputies to make joint efforts to do a better job 
in 
all fields.

<F P=106> [Exclusive dispatch by reporter (Zhu Jianhua)'s from </F>
Beijing; from the "Provincial News Hookup" program] 
  [Text] On the morning of 14 March, Li Tieying, a member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and minister in 
charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission, arrived 
at the Labor Building -- the Zhejiang delegation's residence -- 
where he joined deputies in examining Premier Li Peng's 
government work report and discussed the great reform plan with 
them. Speaking after hearing the deputies' speeches, Li Tieying 
said: To ensure a smooth implementation of various important 
reform measures this year, we should first of all make sure that 
the system is observed, to be followed by gradual adjustment of 
interests. The two should not go simultaneously. Governments 
at various levels should meticulously organize, conduct in-depth 
studies and investigations, and continuously make adjustments. 
  Touching on Zhejiang's reform and economic development, Li 
Tieying said: Zhejiang's economic development has been quite 
unique; it depends neither on heavy state investment nor large 
Hong Kong, Macao, and foreign funds and achieves development 
with its own special economic potential, reflecting the inner 
quality of its economic development. Zhejiang is leading the 
nation in market construction, securing its leading position in 
China's markets, particularly the commodity market. Li Tieying 
expressed the hope that Zhejiang will continue to give play to 
this superiority; conduct bolder reform and exploration; develop 
intermediary service organizations; and standardize market 
construction by formulating as soon as possible trading rules, 
regulations, or interim regulations. In addition, it is 
necessary to develop markets for production factors. Government 
departments in charge of resources of production factors should 
study ways and means to standardize the production factors 
markets and gradually mature them.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and 
Chinese president, called on party and government officials to 
study economics so that they can better lead the nation in 
developing a socialist market economy. 
  Jiang made the call when he participated in separate group 
discussions attended by deputies to the National People's 
Congress from Fujian, Qinghai and Liaoning Provinces. 
  "Leading officials should learn more about basic Marxist 
economic theories, especially Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking, 
and general knowledge about the market economy," he said. 
  Jiang described studying economics as "an urgent task." 
  "Many party and government officials used to work in the 
fields of natural sciences and engineering," he said. "Today, 
however, they are taking the reins of economic development at 
central and local levels. They need to `make up' their missed 
lessons." 
  In his talks with the deputies, Jiang also stressed two 
major 
issues: development of rural economy and development of large 
and medium-sized state enterprises. 
  "Now that our goal has been set and major policies decided, 
the key to achieving success is to get down to work in a 
concerted way," he said. "Nationwide, we should always pay 
priority attention to two major issues. One is the rural 
economy; and the other is large and medium-sized state 
enterprises." 
  Jiang called on Fujian Province to improve its investment 
environment to attract more capital influx from Taiwan and 
overseas Chinese. 
  When he was with Qinghai deputies, Jiang emphasized the 
importance of maintaining unity among all nationalities in the 
province and the need for the province to exploit its natural 
resources in an efficient way. 
  Liaoning in northeast China has a concentration of state 
enterprises. The province has adopted a policy of invigorating 
such enterprises mainly by way of technology upgrading. Jiang 
expressed appreciation of the policy. 
  The state president also praised Liaoning for achieving 
self- 
sufficiency in grain and foodstuffs.

and Ma Kuijun (7456 7608 0689): "I'll Learn, Practice, and Work 
Together with You -- Sidelights on General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin's Meeting With Hebei Deputies"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- The time was 9 A.M. on 
15 March, and the place was the Hebei Hall of the Great Hall of 
the People. Hebei's 110 deputies, who were deliberating Premier 
Li Peng's "Government Work Report," were very happy when they 
learned that General Secretary Jiang Zemin was coming to see 
them. 
  At 9:10 A.M., General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Deputy Cheng 
Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, 
entered the Hebei Hall of the Great Hall of the People chatting 
to each other. The Hebei delegation of deputies, who were 
waiting to have a group picture taken with the general secretary 
in the hall, applauded warmly in welcome. 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin cordially shook hands and 
chatted with the Hebei deputies. The deputies extended 
greetings to him. The atmosphere in the hall was warm and 
relaxed in the few minutes before the group picture was taken. 
  After the group picture was taken with the delegation, 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an ebullient speech. He 
said: Hebei is very close to Beijing. I think I understand the 
situation in Hebei. Hebei's work was done pretty well last 
year. What I want to say is: The central authorities have 
already set major policies -- that is, Comrade Xiaoping's 
speeches made during his South China tour, the guidelines of the 
14th party congress, and the 50 points set by the Third Plenary 
Session of the party's 14th Central Committee. It is crucial to 
do a good job of implementing them. First of all, we should 
enable leading cadres at all levels to understand and grasp 
these major policies. To help people grasp the 50 points, 
relevant departments have produced a video with narratives for 
study reference. We should study while working. 
  At this point, the general secretary incidentally asked 
Deputy Ye Liansong, governor of Hebei Province: "What did you 
major in college?" "I majored in engineering," Ye Liansong 
answered. Then, the general secretary sighed with emotion and 
said: "Many of our leading comrades majored in engineering and 
technology. Now we are establishing a socialist market economy, 
and it will not work without a knowledge of economics. 
Economics is a great branch of science, but it cannot be 
grasped overnight. So we must make arduous efforts to study it 
and study it systematically." The general secretary then 
continued to say: "Capitalist countries have been engaged in 
market economies for hundreds of years, and they have indeed 
gained some experience which reflects general patterns and it 
would help us to learn. It is the first time that we have 
established a socialist market economy. So it is all the more 
necessary for us to study in practice. We have set major 
policies. We should continue to explore new ways and gain more 
experiences in practice. I place great hopes on you comrades. 
I'll learn, practice, and work together with you." 
  Immediately following the general secretary's remarks, Cheng 
Weigao said: "We will do our work conscientiously." 
  As he said farewell to the Hebei delegation, Jiang Zemin 
cordially remarked: "I hope that Hebei reaps a good grain and 
cotton harvest this year." At this, the deputies burst into 
applause.

XINHUA reporters He Ping (0149 1627) and Xu Jiangshan (1776 3068 
0810)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, CPC 
Central Committee general secretary and state president, called 
on the Fujian delegation to the second plenary session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress this morning. He also 
participated in discussions held by the Qinghai and Liaoning 
delegations. Jiang Zemin emphasized: Now that the guiding 
principles and major policies have been decided, the key to 
achieving success is to get down to work in a concerted way. 
Nationwide, we should always pay priority attention to two 
major issues. One is the rural economy; and the other is large 
and medium-sized state enterprises. When agriculture is truly 
enhanced as the foundation of the national economy, when 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are truly 
invigorated, when the worker-peasant alliance under the new 
situation is truly enhanced, and when, as a result, work in all 
other areas is advanced and the unity of all nationalities is 
consolidated, China's reform, development, and stability will be 
reliably guaranteed. 
  At the Fujian Hall of the Great Hall of the People, Jiang 
Zemin told the Fujian deputies: Fujian and Taiwan -- China's 
precious island -- face each other across the Strait. Fujian's 
development has a special meaning and impact. It is necessary 
to deepen reform, opening up wider, improve the investment 
environment, attract investment by Taiwan compatriots and 
overseas Chinese, promote Cross-Strait economic cooperation and 
trade, and develop Cross- Strait exchanges so as to make still 
greater contributions to the peaceful reunification of the 
motherland. 
  "Zha xi de le!" [preceding words in Tibetan] As Jiang Zemin 
arrived at the Qinghai Hall, the deputies, who were warmly 
discussing the government work report, happily greeted him in a 
style unique to Tibetans. Applause and laughter interweaved as 
they presented the general secretary a hada [a piece of silk 
used as a greeting gift among Tibetans] and a cup of liquor made 
of highland barley. 
  After hearing the speeches by Wang Hanmin, Qinghai executive 
vice governor, and Dajie, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefectural 
Government head, Jiang Zemin said: Qinghai is a province where 
people of minority nationalities live in compact communities. 
In the socialist big family, we should promote the 
inter-ethnic relations of harmony, equality, mutual assistance, 
unity and cooperation, and steer a course toward common 
prosperity. This represents an essential guarantee for the 
success of our causes and it also represents the common wishes 
of people of all nationalities. 
  Jiang Zemin expressed the hope that people of all 
nationalities in Qinghai will further enhance ethnic unity, 
fully and correctly implement the policy concerning religion, 
maintain social stability, and bring about smooth progress in 
reform and opening up amid stability. He emphasized that 
economic development of ethnic regions must be firmly based on 
local conditions and full utilization of local advantages. The 
key is to develop resources. They should boldly introduce 
foreign investment and undertake joint development. Meanwhile, 
the state must also do its best to help them. Other regions -- 
the developed coastal regions in particular -- should actively 
help them so that all ethnic groups and all regions will develop 
side by side toward common prosperity. 
  In the Liaoning Hall, Jiang Zemin discussed ways to deepen 
reform and quickly invigorate state-owned enterprises with 
delegates from Liaoning, a province with a concentration of 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. 
  After hearing a speech by Liaoning Governor Yue Qifeng on 
strengthening agriculture and invigorating state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises, Jiang Zemin said happily: Liaoning is 
a major industrial province. After years of hard work, it is 
now self sufficient in meat, eggs, poultry, and vegetables. 
This is inspiring news. It represents a historic change for 
Liaoning Province. He continued: Liaoning has many large and 
medium-sized enterprises. If these enterprises are invigorated 
in an all-round way, it will have a big impact on the 
rejuvenation of Liaoning and the country as a whole. You have 
upheld a policy of "emphasizing less on new projects and more on 
technical innovations." You have devoted major efforts to 
invigorate such enterprises mainly by way of technology 
upgrading. This policy is absolutely correct. It is very good 
news. It is hoped that Liaoning will create more good 
experience in invigorating state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises. 
  To accelerate the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system and to improve macroeconomic regulation, 
control, and management, Jiang Zemin once again called on the 
leading cadres to study harder. He pointed out: Many party and 
government officials used to work in the fields of natural 
sciences and engineering. Today, however, they are taking the 
reins of economic development at central and local levels. They 
need to make up their missed lessons. They should learn more 
about basic Marxist economic theories, especially Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's economic thinking, and general knowledge about the 
market economy. This is an urgent task. They should learn on 
the job and put into practice what they have learned so that 
they will quickly improve their leadership skills in developing 
China's socialist economy.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Zhu Mei from Beijing; from </F>
the "Morning News" program -- passages within quotation marks 
recorded] 
  [Text] The shopping baskets of Shanghai residents became a 
hot topic of discussion among Shanghai's delegation to the 
National People's Congress [NPC] today [12 March]. At today's 
discussion, Municipal Party Secretary Wu Bangguo and Mayor Huang 
Ju spoke at length to explain once again about Shanghai's 
shopping basket project. 
  Deputy Wu Bangguo said: "I would like to use a common 
expression. I am just like a scale that carries a 1,000-jin 
weight. Shanghai residents will be angry if they do not see 
vegetables for three days. Comrade Zemin used to say in 
Shanghai that the people can see the situation from their 
shopping baskets. I think this is an issue that directly 
concerns the people's interests. Further, we all know that the 
vegetable supply in Shanghai often fluctuates. Sometimes they 
are in short supply and sometimes they are abundant. When they 
are in short supply, urban residents will grumble. When they 
are abundant, on the other hand, vegetable farmers complain. But 
it is not only Shanghai residents who are concerned about this 
problem, the general secretary and the premier also understand 
the problem very clearly." 
  Speaking from the viewpoint of Shanghai residents, Mayor 
Huang Ju talked about his plan for the shopping basket project: 
"A prominent contradiction is the vegetable issue, and the 
prominent contradiction of the issue is how to reduce 
difficulties and enhance our ability to adapt green vegetables 
supplies due to seasonal changes. We should start a 
new-generation shopping basket project, called the green 
vegetable project. We should guarantee [?40,000 mu of land for 
this project]. Once this has been decided, it should not be 
changed for 10 to 15 years. Even if the land is infertile, the 
entire municipality should unanimously implement the policy. No 
changes should be carried out until after new farms have been 
established. Secondly, we should strengthen the establishment 
of agricultural facilities. The municipal government has 
allotted 250 million yuan to construct large sheds on 5,000 mu 
of farmland. [sentence indistinct] If Shanghai has 25,000 mu of 
vegetable farms with large sheds, the supply of vegetables for 
residents can be ensured. Further, we can gear our policy 
toward meeting this goal. Therefore, I believe that in three 
years' time, we can achieve our goal in green vegetable 
production." 
  What should we do about enterprises that incur losses? This 
has been a noticeable problem in Shanghai in recent years. In 
their speeches today, deputies Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju gave us 
their thoughts on how to solve this long-standing problem. Wu 
Bangguo maintained: "We will continue to apply measures taken 
previously to tackle Shanghai's deficit-ridden enterprises one 
by one. The problem is relatively prominent in six out of our 
eight major industrial zones. In Shanghai's industrial zones, 
not all enterprises incur losses, although occasionally some of 
them encounter difficulties. There are about 144 such 
enterprises, involving some 165,000 people. How much is the 
loss? It is (?350 million) yuan. What can these enterprises 
do? My view is that the market economy is different from the 
planned economy. There are no losses in the planned economy 
because the state assumes unlimited responsibility and makes up 
for losses incurred by enterprises. However, in the market 
economy, there are both newly formed enterprises and 
long-established enterprises, leading to a situation in which 
the fittest survive. Deficit-ridden enterprises should not 
always use old methods to solve their problems. They should 
actively explore and apply the laws of the market economy to 
solve their problems. An enterprise may possess market share 
and be known for quality and efficiency, but it may have too 
much plant and equipment. We can help this type of plant by 
reorganizing it into a new enterprise. This is called injecting 
new blood, the purpose of which is to avoid (?collapse). For a 
second type of enterprise, we should undertake what we call 
merger. We may [words indistinct] some deficit-ridden 
enterprises while leasing or auctioning off others. However, 
merger is a very good method. In recent years, Shanghai has 
merged 456 enterprises with relatively good results. This year, 
we have decided to merge between 80 and 100 enterprises. We 
should be determined in tackling bankrupt enterprises. I 
personally feel that if we succeed in tackling the bankruptcy 
issue, it will carry major significance for the establishment of 
the socialist market economic system. This means we will have 
taken another step forward." 
  On ways to help troubled enterprises, Deputy Huang Ju said: 
"Shanghai is currently dealing with this problem. Its approach 
is to rely on the social security system to guarantee the basic 
living expenses of workers. Enterprises and the government 
should support the social security system in order to guarantee 
the basic living expenses of workers and to let everybody derive 
tangible results from reform. Therefore, to do a good job is to 
improve people's lives in the course of economic development. 
In eliminating difficulties, Shanghai will not confine its 
efforts to injecting new blood but will mainly focus on changing 
enterprises' mechanisms and on developing their blood-making 
functions so as to acquire new [words indistinct]." 
  Deputy Huang Ju is very familiar with Shanghai's strengths 
and weaknesses. He is keenly aware of his heavy responsibility 
stemming from what is expected from Shanghai by the central 
authorities. He specifically thanked other provinces and 
municipalities for their support for Shanghai. Today, he told 
fellow deputies and dozens of Chinese and foreign correspondents 
who were present either as visitors or to cover the NPC session: 
"Shanghai is a metropolis as well as a city devoid of energy 
and raw and semifinished materials; it is an open port city with 
a huge population and a limited supply of land. Although we 
have a strong industrial base, we are confronted with the 
question of how to further enliven large and medium state 
enterprises. Some of the measures and methods that we have 
adopted can only be applied to Shanghai; they cannot be promoted 
in other parts of the country. We need the understanding and 
support of fraternal provinces across the country. 
  "Shanghai is worthy of its name in three aspects. It is my 
opinion that we should truly implement Comrade Zemin's 
requirement that we be worthy of our name in these three 
aspects. We should truly justify our leading role among areas 
targeted for development along the Chang Jiang. To do so, we 
must elevate our standards and development baseline. We should 
introduce technology and management expertise from abroad, 
assimilate them, and disseminate without reservation the results 
of our assimilation across the country so that Shanghai will 
truly become a distribution center in this respect. Moreover, 
we should really justify our name as a prospective international 
economic, financial, and trade center. This year, we should 
actually start moving and strive to achieve this goal. Of 
course, turning Shanghai into an international economic, 
financial, and trade center in the Asia-Pacific and West Pacific 
regions is a long-term task which will take about 20 years to 
accomplish. But it does not run counter to our goal of becoming 
a center in another area. Comrade Zemin has specifically called 
on Shanghai to become the Shanghai of the entire nation. We 
feel [?we have come a long way] from the Shanghai of the fifties 
through the eighties to become today the Shanghai supported by 
the rest of the country. Particularly during the nineties, 
Shanghai enjoys the support of other parts of the country in its 
development drive. Of Shanghai's 3 million residents who came 
from other parts of the country, 1 million work in major 
construction projects or in partly or wholly foreign-owned 
enterprises, thus contributing to Shanghai's construction. 
Shanghai should serve, support, and contribute more to other 
parts of the country. To this end, we shall send more people to 
fraternal provinces this year to learn from their valuable 
experience. Also, we shall further explore the means of 
cooperation with fraternal provinces and municipalities in the 
interests of common prosperity."

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Wei (6392 5898)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- At a news conference 
held by the Press Center for the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress and the Second Session of the Eighth 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference today, Zhu Kaixuan, the minister in 
charge of the State Education Commission, announced: According 
to the briefings from people's governments and educational 
departments of 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities nationwide, the government has basically solved 
the problem of delays in the payment of teachers' salaries 
across the country before this Spring Festival. 
  Zhu Kaixuan announced this news while answering a question 
from a XINHUA News Agency reporter. He affirmed the 
achievements in solving the problem of delays in the payment of 
teachers' salaries and pointed out at the same time: Some 
individual localities still owe teachers a small amount such as 
bonuses and subsidies, which are not included in the basic pay. 
Zhu Kaixuan said: We should give in-depth thought to ways of 
preventing the problem of delays in the payment of teachers' 
salaries from recurring. At present, the State Council, 
government departments in charge of education, and local 
governments are working hand in hand in three fields: 1) 
improving and perfecting current regulations on managing and 
raising funds for education, and those on managing and paying 
teachers' salaries; 2) establishing a legal system to protect 
the basic rights and interests of the broad masses of teachers. 
The main thing we should do now is to publicize and implement 
the "Teachers Law." In the "Teachers Law," two articles concern 
legal actions against delays in the payment of teachers' 
salaries. 3) arousing people's awareness of respecting teachers 
and valuing education. The key to carrying out these tasks is 
to establish a responsibility system for major persons in charge 
in governments at all levels. Zhu Kaixuan said: The State 
Education Commission is paying close attention to the problem of 
delays in the payment of teachers' salaries to prevent this 
situation from recurring. 
  A reporter asked him about the issue of requiring students 
at 
institutions of higher education to pay tuition, Zhu Kaixuan 
said: Changing the situation in which the state is responsible 
for arranging students' schooling and jobs is an important 
aspect of China's educational reform. The future reform goal is 
to gradually require students to pay for their tuition and to 
look for jobs on their own. Zhu Kaixuan said emphatically: 
Asking students to pay their tuition does not mean that 
students have to go to school at their own expense. In light of 
the current practical situation, it is difficult for students to 
attend schools at their own expense. After we took two major 
factors into consideration -- the cost of education and the 
people's financial capabilities, we asked students to pay some 
fees for their schooling. Zhu Kaixuan said: The fees for each 
student at colleges and institutions under the State Education 
Commission are 1,000 to 1,500 yuan this year. The cost will go 
up in coming years. However, students who enrolled in colleges 
before the new regulations took effect will not be affected. 
Now more than 50 percent of the 2.5 million college students 
nationwide are from rural areas. They have difficulty paying 
for tuition, which is why we must establish relevant scholarship 
and student loan program. The state has established 
profession-specific scholarships for students trained in some 
special and vigorous professions and in specialized fields which 
enable them to attend school free of charge. Zhu Kaixuan said: 
Under the socialist system, we cannot let students drop out of 
school for economic reasons. 
  Answering a reporter's question on how the educational 
reform accommodates the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure, Zhang Xiaowen, vice minister in charge of 
the State Education Commission, said: First, we should reform 
the administrative system of higher education by changing the 
current multilevel administration to a two-level administration 
by the state and localities and by giving more decision-making 
power to localities and universities. At the same time, we 
should vigorously and smoothly reform the enrollment of college 
students, the collection of tuition and other fees, and the 
employment of college graduates. Second, we should adjust the 
current structures of personnel and courses and should 
accelerate the development of courses related to finance, 
economics, politics, law, and high technology, which are 
urgently needed for social development. 
  When asked whether China was able to realize the goal of 
making nine-year compulsory education universal by the year of 
2000, Liu Bin, vice minister in charge of the State Education 
Commission, said: China needs and is able to basically realize 
nine-year compulsory education by the turn of the century. "To 
basically realize this goal" means that around 85 percent of 
China's population and regions will have nine-year compulsory 
education by that time, while the other 15 percent probably will 
have only six or four years of compulsory education. 
  As for Chinese students studying abroad, Zhu Kaixuan said: 
China has sent 210,000 students to more than 100 countries and 
regions worldwide for study. Of these students, more than 
70,000 have returned home after finishing their studies. The 
Chinese Government has adopted a policy of supporting people 
studying abroad, encouraging Chinese living abroad to return to 
the motherland, and allowing them to come and go freely. We do 
not have any reason to change this policy. We can understand 
that some students want to stay longer in foreign countries for 
various reasons, and some of them have applied for "green 
cards." These students are keeping in close contact with China. 
Some countries use various pretexts or even make laws to 
prevent Chinese students from returning home. In view of this 
situation, the Chinese Government has made serious 
representations to the countries concerned. 
  At today's news conference, persons in charge at the State 
Education Commission also answered reporters' questions on 
investment in education, raising and managing educational funds, 
and maintaining the ranks of teachers.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- The second session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] today held another 
plenary meeting and group discussions to deliberate Premier Li 
Peng's Government Work Report. The deputies enthusiastically 
discussed the goal and tasks for reform and development this 
year in light of the present actual economic situation and 
social life. The deputies pointed out: The establishment and 
improvement of a socialist market economic structure should be 
guaranteed by a sound legal system. It is necessary to pay 
greater attention to the improvement of the socialist legal 
system, speed up legislation, implement laws in a strict manner, 
and guard the sanctity of the law to ensure the smooth progress 
of reform and development. 
  Several leaders of the CPC Central Committee, the NPC 
Standing Committee, and the State Council today visited a number 
of delegations to the ongoing NPC session to deliberate the 
Government Work Report together with the NPC deputies and to 
hear the deputies' opinions and suggestions. Vice Premier Li 
Lanqing said after hearing opinions expressed by the Yunnan 
delegation: We should develop areas where people of minority 
nationalities reside. On the one hand, we should do a good job 
in the construction of infrastructure facilities; and on the 
other hand, we should pay attention to developing education for 
minority people and cultivating capable people in various 
fields. He said: Education for minority people is very 
important in developing the economy of areas where minority 
people reside. Only when we develop education for minority 
people can we better develop the economy of areas where minority 
people reside. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua joined the Hubei 
delegation in deliberating the Government Work Report and 
expressed his opinions in light of questions raised by deputies 
there. He said: We should correctly handle relations between 
reform, development, and stability, and ensure a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the economy. Continuity, 
speed, and soundness are interrelated, and they supplement each 
other. Sound economic development should have rational 
structure and good economic and social benefits. If we only 
stress speed, there will be the danger of imbalance in economic 
development. 
  Li Tieying, Political Bureau member of the CPC Central 
Committee and state councillor, joined the Zhejiang delegation 
in deliberating the Government Work Report and stressed issues 
of reform. He said: Ensuring the smooth implementation of 
reform is important work this year. Governments at various 
levels must organize the work in a careful and meticulous 
manner, conduct investigations and study in a penetrating way, 
and continuously strengthen adjustment and control. He also 
expressed his views on developing intermediary organizations and 
speeding up the development of production factors. 
  Wen Jiabao, Political Bureau alternate member of the CPC 
Central Committee, and State Councillor Chen Junsheng took part 
in deliberating the Government Work Report with the Anhui and 
Hunan delegations. They respectively spoke on the question of 
developing agriculture. Wen Jiabao said: We must proceed from 
reality in developing agriculture, suit measures to local 
conditions, respect the peasants' pioneering spirit, and 
adroitly guide action according to the circumstances. This 
year, we should attach importance to three things in 
agriculture. First, we should ensure the steady increase of 
outputs of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, and do a good 
job in developing the "vegetable basket" project. Second, we 
should continue to find ways and means to increase peasants' 
income. Third, we should ensure social stability in rural areas. 
Chen Junsheng emphatically talked about the question of grain 
production. He said: Judging from the whole country, the grain 
output has set an all-time record. However, the development is 
still uneven in different locales. The agricultural structure's 
adjustment should be conducted under the condition of stabilized 
development and steady increase in grain production. 
  Tian Jiyun, NPC Standing Committee vice chairman, and State 
Councillors Song Jian, Li Guixian, and Peng Peiyun also met with 
the Shandong, Hebei, Heilongjiang, and Fujian delegations to 
take part in deliberating the Government Work Report together 
with deputies of those delegations. 
  In deliberating the Government Work Report, many deputies 
pointed out that the development of socialist democracy and 
improvement of the socialist legal system are important 
component parts of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and are an important guarantee for reform and 
development. Ma Sizhong of the Ningxia delegation said: 
Premier Li Peng has devoted a large portion of his Government 
Work Report to fully expound the building of democracy and the 
legal system. This shows that he has attached great importance 
to the building of democracy and the legal system. Building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is the cause of hundreds 
of millions of people, and so we must give full play to 
democracy. The establishment and improvement of a socialist 
market economic structure must be protected by a sound legal 
system. We should be good at using legal means to administer 
the economy and the society, and we must strive to make progress 
in this respect. 
  Henan Deputy Wang Hongfan said: Attaching great importance 
to building the socialist legal system and properly learning how 
to use legal means to administer the economy and the society is 
very significant to China's reform, development, and stability 
in the future. He said: At present, some leading cadres and 
law enforcement personnel are not familiar with the legal system 
and the situation of using words to replace law and using power 
to prevail over law happens from time to time. This situation 
is unfavorable to reform, development, and stability. We must 
resolutely correct such practices as doing things not in 
accordance with the law, not being strict in implementing laws, 
and not paying attention to the violation of laws. We must 
strengthen education on the legal system for cadres at various 
levels, especially leading cadres, and also enhance all 
citizens' concept of the legal system. Only in this way can we 
guarantee the smooth establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure and social and political stability. 
  Many deputies pointed out: Market economy, in a certain 
sense, means an economy established on a legal system. With the 
change of the economic structure, many disorderly things and 
much confusion have cropped up in social and economic 
activities. We must accelerate the pace in building a legal 
system in accordance with the characteristics and requirements 
of a socialist market economic structure. Li Ligong and Zhang 
Kui of the Shanxi delegation said: Judging from the practice of 
reform and development, the building of the legal system is a 
very important thing. It is important to enact laws, but it is 
even more important to implement laws. Laws will be useless if 
we do not implement them. Only by grasping legislative work and 
implementing laws at the same time can we effectively protect 
reform and development with the legal system.

<F P=106> [News conference held at the Information Center of the </F>
Second Sessions of the Eighth National People's Congress and the 
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference in Beijing on 14 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Unidentified moderator] Today, we have invited Wan 
Xueyuan, Zhejiang governor; Xu Yunhong, Zhejiang vice governor 
and Ningbo mayor; Wang Yongming, Hangzhou mayor; and Chen 
Wenxian, Wenzhou mayor, to answer your questions about 
Zhejiang's reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  [Correspondent] I am a XINHUA correspondent. In his 
government work report, Premier Li Peng stated the need to speed 
up cultivating and developing a market structure. Governor Wan, 
what will Zhejiang, a major province engaging in building a 
market structure, do in this regard? 
  [Wan] Zhejiang already has more than 4,000 commodity markets 
of all descriptions. The volume of transactions reached 65.1 
billion yuan in 1993. The net amount of money that Zhejiang 
recovered from its markets ranked first in eastern China. Some 
of these 4,000 or so markets are super-large in size. Of the 
nation's 600 markets with transactions exceeding 100 million 
yuan per year, Zhejiang has 107. The establishment of these 
markets has expedited the province's economic development. This 
year, we will continue to improve all kinds of services, 
establish all forms of markets of essential goods and services 
-- especially the financial, technology, labor, and real estate 
markets -- so that our markets will become more efficient. We 
will also establish and improve market management, establish 
norms governing market behaviors, tighten the supervision over 
product quality, and device efficient mechanisms governing 
prices. Centering around the several major reform projects to 
be launched in the country, we will also improve our 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and deepen enterprise 
reform. Meanwhile, we will also establish a good social 
security system and the necessary supporting measures to make 
sure that Zhejiang's market economic development will be even 
more successful. 
  [Correspondent] I learned from the information you released 
that, in 1993, Zhejiang's gross domestic product [GDP] increased 
25 percent, and your investment in fixed assets increased 66.2 
percent. Now, the central government has called for a slower 
economic growth, do you have the ability to slow down the high 
economic growth? How much do you think the GDP will be this 
year? 
  [Wan] Zhejiang's GDP increased 25 percent and our investment 
in fixed assets increased 66 percent in 1993. The growth was 
indeed quite high. Such a high growth was achieved when energy 
supply and transportation and communications facilities were 
very tight; but the high growth also gave rise to price 
increases. Therefore, we fully feel the correctness of the call 
made by the party Central Committee and the State Council to 
strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and pay special 
attention to the quality of economic growth. This year, we are 
ready to earnestly follow the central authorities' call and move 
forward to establish a socialist market economic system by 
carrying out several major reform projects, such as those of 
restructuring the financial, taxation, banking, and investment 
systems. The developments over the past decade or so show that 
Zhejiang's annual GDP growth increased 13 percent on the 
average. The [GDP] growth in the past three year was 20 percent 
annually. We plan to control the growth -- especially the 
growth of investment in fixed assets -- through intensifying 
macroeconomic regulation and control. People in all quarters in 
Zhejiang must realize the need not to set up any more 
low-standard construction projects [di sui ping de jian she], 
but to give priority to improving the quality of economic growth 
[ti gao jing ji zeng zhang zi liang] through counting on science 
and technology and improving workers' proficiency. We will pay 
special attention to market research and to enterprises' 
efficiency. This is because the industrial output of Zhejiang's 
village and town enterprises accounts for 65 percent of our 
province's total industrial output, and market information is 
very important for these enterprises. When market prospects are 
good, they will expand their production; but when there is a 
recession, they will readjust their production or produce other 
products. Their adaptability to market changes is quite good. 
We do not worry about how fast our growth may be, but in light 
of Zhejiang's economic growth in recent years, we think 
Zhejiang's economic growth will be about 3 percentage points 
[bai fen dian] higher than the national average. We underscore 
growth which yields returns. 
  [Correspondent] I am a RENMIN RIBAO correspondent. I want 
to ask the Ningbo mayor a question. Ningbo is a major open 
city. What new measures has Ningbo taken to open itself to the 
outside world and bring in more foreign capital? 
  [Xu Yunhong] We should say that Ningbo has achieved 
significant successes in opening itself to the outside world. 
Ningbo's development has been quite fast over the past couple of 
years. Ningbo's total imports and exports reached $1.7 billion 
in 1993. That was a growth of 69.4 percent. In 1993 alone, 
Ningbo approved 1,015 foreign-funded enterprises, which was an 
increase of nearly 60 percent; and the amount of foreign capital 
actually invested in Ningbo reached $370 million, a growth of 
nearly 150 percent. However, I think we should also realize 
that Ningbo still lags behind other coastal cities in opening up 
to the outside world. In future, we plan to work hard in the 
following respects: First, we will speed up building Ningbo's 
infrastructure. I think that only by doing so can Ningbo give 
scope to its opening up potential. We must speed up building the 
additional railway linking Ningbo and Hangzhou so that ports in 
Ningbo can link up with the Hangzhou-Nanchang railway and other 
main railways linking north and south China. Our second project 
is to build an economic development zone and a bonded zone and 
develop (Dashou) Island -- projects approved by the State 
Council. The total area of these two zones and the island will 
reach 60 square kilometers, an unusually large developmental 
project in the country. The third project we will carry out is 
to improve the foreign-funded enterprises already in Ningbo. 
When we people in Ningbo, 5 million in all, make concerted 
efforts in building up Ningbo, we will live up to our 
forefathers' expectations. 
  [Correspondent] I am from ZHONGGUO HAIYANG BAO. Zhejiang has 
come up with the slogan of revitalizing Zhejiang through 
developing its sea. Governor Wan, do you have any specific 
plans and measures for this project? Also, what problems does 
Zhejiang still face with regard to maritime development and 
management? 
  [Wan] One of Zhejiang's strengths lies in its seacoast. 
Zhejiang has a 2,200 km-long coast and 3,050 islands. What we 
are particularly proud of is that we have many deep-water ports, 
such as Ningbo, Zhoushan, Zapu, Taizhou, and Wenzhou. In terms 
of tourism, the well-known Mount Putuo is a popular sightseeing 
spot. Moreover, Zhejiang and Shanghai have plans to jointly 
develop the Shengxi Islands and turn them into a vacationing 
resort on the sea. In recent years, the construction of large 
thermopower and nuclear power plants by taking advantage of 
Zhejiang's deep-water ports has become very well-known, even in 
the world. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant has been operating 
normally over the past year. Along the coast, there are a dozen 
or so places suitable for the construction of thermopower plants 
with generating capacity greater than 2.4 million kw. We are 
confident that, by early next century, eastern Zhejiang will 
become the power base of eastern China. With regard to oil 
development, you all know that, since 1 January this year, 17 
transnational oil companies have been prospecting oil, including 
seabed drilling and physical studies of the earth, within a 
54,000 square km-zone in the sea 150 km east of Wenzhou. So 
people in Zhejiang are very upbeat about their sea. We can say 
that while Zhejiang's land size is quite small, we are a major 
maritime province. Zhejiang's future lies in the sea. 
  [Correspondent] I am a correspondent from the China Central 
Television. I want to ask Governor Wan a question. Zhejiang is 
a province in which village and town enterprises are developing 
quite rapidly. What impact financial and taxation reforms 
promoted by the state this year will have on Zhejiang's economy, 
especially the development of Zhejiang's village and town 
enterprises? 
  [Wan] Village and town enterprises are confronting many new 
challenges during the course of reform today. This is because 
state enterprises, through replacing operating mechanisms, will 
operate with greater vitality. The development of independent 
and private businesses, and also the changes in the market, are 
also challenges to village and town enterprises. Owing to their 
outmoded equipment and inadequate technology, the prospects for 
some village and town enterprises are also quite grim. In 
recent years, the provincial government has drawn up policies 
for cutting the taxes of these enterprises in an effort to 
support their development. These policies will be rescinded 
after the new tax system has been implemented, and some village 
and town enterprises may have to pay more taxes. But we must 
also see that village and town enterprises have developed 
flexible mechanisms governing their autonomy, profits and 
losses, capital accumulation, and development. The motivating 
force and pressure caused by the reform and the pressure caused 
by market changes will very likely prompt village and town 
enterprises to restructure their organization, industrial 
production, and product mix. So these enterprises will have 
problems as well as opportunities. But we think they will face 
more opportunities and hopes than problems. 
  [Correspondent] I am a correspondent from GUANGMING RIBAO. 
My question is addressed to Hangzhou Mayor Wang Youming: A top 
priority of the ongoing reform is to transform the operational 
mechanism of state-owned enterprises and improve their economic 
efficiency. What is the current status in terms of economic 
efficiency of Hangzhou's state-owned enterprises? What measures 
have you taken to improve their economic efficiency. 
  [Wang] Hangzhou has 6,000 state-owned enterprises. Their 
economic efficiency is quite satisfactory. The 1993 state-owned 
enterprises' output value rose 13 percent over 1992; sale volume 
rose 16 percent; and tax receipts and profits submitted to the 
state rose 23 percent. All 6,000 enterprises are operating 
normally. 
  [Correspondent] I am a correspondent from JINGJI RIBAO. 
Zhejiang and Wenzhou have always been models of economic 
development in China. In a place like Wenzhou with a relatively 
developed market economy, how does the city government 
administer its economy and promote the development of 
enterprises. 
  [Chen Wenxian] In the early stages of development, the city 
government adopted the policy of greater latitude first and 
guidance later, greater freedom first and restrictions later, 
circulation ahead of transportation, and prosperity ahead of 
(?city appearance). This policy of reform and enlivening the 
economy has the characteristics of active noninterference. As 
we have completed [word indistinct] accumulation of the initial 
stages, we will try to turn Wenzhou's economy from one noted for 
its lack of order to one that is standard, well-ordered, and 
regulated by law. We will be shifting from growth in volume to 
improvement in quality. We will introduce a smooth-functioning 
and closely integrated market economic structure in which the 
property rights are clearly defined and the mechanisms are 
flexible. We will promote changes in two areas: operational 
mechanism of enterprises and the functions of government 
departments. We will pay close attention to three key points: 
the development of a modern enterprise system, the development 
of a market system, and macroeconomic administration of the 
government. Wenzhou's economy will experience fast economic 
growth with high economic efficiency. 
  [Moderator] That is the end of the news conference.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wu Yuehui: "Correctly Handling Relations </F>
Between Reforms, Development, Stability -- China's Realistic 
Choice"] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The 32 delegations 
attending the current session of the National People's Congress 
(NPC) began this afternoon to discuss things on the second-phase 
agenda following four days of examining the government work 
report delivered by Premier Li Peng. 
  During the first phase, the deputies discussed a wide range 
of topics, ranging from regional economic development to 
national development, from micro-economic activity to 
macro-control measures. Their topics also covered such areas as 
political affairs, economic growth, social development and 
culture. 
  However, the keynote of speeches made by deputies from 
various parts of China and Chinese leaders during group 
discussions is how to correctly handle the relations between 
reforms, development and stability. 
  That topic is not a new one. Before the convocation of the 
current session, Chinese leaders had already elaborated the 
issue during various meetings and their inspection tours of 
grassroots units. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng noted that the deputies have reached 
a consensus on that issue during the ongoing session. 
  Many newspapers overseas have also written articles to 
highlight the issue. It can be noted that the realistic choice 
by China serves as a new angle for the outside world to have a 
new understanding of China and that the choice makes it possible 
to predict the country's future. 
  Media organizations in China have different descriptions of 
the topic, with some calling it a "main melody" and others 
calling it a "concerto." 
  Speaking to the deputies from Shanghai, Chinese President 
Jiang Z emin described reforms, development and stability as 
"three closely interrelated pieces of strategy" on a chess board. 
  According to Jiang, it is imperative to promote reforms and 
development amid stability, while ensuring long-term social 
stability through reforms and development. 
  During the first session of the eighth NPC held a year ago, 
the keynote of speeches made by the deputies was "seizing the 
opportunity for development and speeding up development." 
  During the current session, they also called for efforts to 
seize the opportunity and accelerate development, and yet they 
all emphasized the importance of balancing the relations between 
reforms, development and stability. 
  A deputy from a locality put it well that the change shows 
that the Chinese Government has become more experienced and 
mature in guiding the country's development and reforms, and 
that people have gained a more profound and comprehensive 
understanding of the significance of establishing a socialist 
market economic structure. 
  For deputies from all parts of China, the proper handling of 
the relations between the three aspects is not a philosophical 
question, but a realistic one. 
  This is because all kinds of people -- government officials, 
business executives, workers and farmers -- all face that 
question every day, and that the relations between reforms, 
development and stability is related directly to the immediate 
interests of every Chinese. 
  While backing that strategy formulated by China's policy 
makers, deputies from different localities and industries view 
it from different angles, placing emphasis on different aspects. 
  For example, mayors paid closer attention to social and 
price 
stability, while deputies from underdeveloped central and 
western China emphasized that narrowing the gap between eastern 
and western China is essential to China's long-term stability 
and social stability. 
  Meanwhile, government officials from agricultural provinces 
and farmer deputies stressed that the farming sector serves as 
the basis for development and stability in China. 
  Business executives asked the government to take specific 
measures to arrange the livelihood of workers in financial 
difficulty. 
  The secretary of a provincial committee of the Chinese 
Communist Party pointed out that the anti-corruption campaign is 
a significant measure to correctly handle the relations between 
reforms, development and stability. 
  Facing both economic achievements that have been scored over 
the past few years and deep-rooted contradictions that have 
arisen in economic and social life, the Chinese people now need 
to explore new approaches of development and push forward 
reforms oriented with the establishment of a market economic 
structure. 
  However, reforms also involve the readjustment of the 
interests pattern and risks. This constitutes a major 
background for the central topic during the current NPC session. 
  Public opinions overseas have noticed that it is very 
difficult to balance the relations between reform, development 
and stability. 
  During the current NPC session, deputies have also expounded 
the difficulties China is currently facing in carrying out 
reforms and pursuing development. 
  At the same time, they have also analyzed various favorable 
conditions and made proposals for promoting development and 
maintaining stability. Many of their proposals have been 
submitted in the form of bills to the bill-handling group of the 
NPC session. 
  That indicates that deputies are confident of success of the 
policies formulated by the central government. 
  A number of proposals by deputies coincide with the 
government's consideration. 
  For instance, some deputies were worried that it will be 
difficult to keep this year's price index to below ten percent. 
Therefore, they asked the government to take effective measures 
to curb price hikes. 
  Speaking to deputies from Hunan Province, Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji said that to stabilize the market and curb price rises is 
the key to balancing the relations between reforms, development 
and stability, and also an important task of governments at all 
levels. 
  Recently, the State Council has mandated governments at all 
levels to monitor the change in prices of 22 kinds of 
commodities and service items most closely related to people's 
livelihood. 
  When necessary, governments should examine the increase in 
prices of some of these commodities and service items and step 
in to intervene. 
  The measure, designed to check prices from skyrocketing, has 
been well received by the deputies. 
  The deputies also spoke of other difficulties and factors of 
instability, about which the government is sober-minded. Both 
the deputies and the government stressed the importance of 
carefully organizing and implementing reform measures this year 
and promptly solving new problems that are likely to crop up in 
the course of reforms.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Zhao Wei (6392 5898)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- At the Second Session 
of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], the deputies 
have been discussing reform, development, and stability. 
Naturally, many of them have also discussed the establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure and the ongoing reform 
of the market structure. Whenever they touched on the topic of 
market, some deputies expressed their worries and uneasiness 
about society's misunderstanding of and prejudices against 
markets. 
  At present, there is a representative view on markets: In a 
market economic structure, all things and all departments should 
move into the market; they will be judged by the market and 
their fate will be decided by the market. It seems that the 
market is omnipotent. There is another view: the greatest 
interest of the market is profit-making. It seems that the 
market will certainly lead to "money worshipping." Some 
deputies held that these two tendencies are wrong and that if 
allowed to develop, they may delay or even hinder the reform on 
the establishment of a market economic structure. 
  We have suffered losses from failure to abide by the law 
governing the operation of markets. At a time when a market 
structure was put into operation for the first time, many people 
harbored illusions about markets, the nature of which were not 
familiar to them. To them it seemed that a market was like a 
magic wand which can solve all problems. In fact it is not 
true. A market also has its dead corner. For example, 
government actions, compulsory education, basic science 
research, and quality intellectual products.... It is difficult 
to use market prices and market demands to measure their value 
and functions. This means that there is something the market is 
unable to do. Deputy Li Jingwen said if government institutions 
also act as the main competitors in the market, the move will 
lead to the practice of trading power for money and the 
occurrence of corrupt phenomena. Deputies Tao Xiping and Pan Ji 
held that everyone knows the social benefits created by basic 
education and basic science research, the former is the 
foundation for raising the educational level of the Chinese 
nation and the latter is the mother of all types of applied 
research. However, it is difficult for the market to repay 
these achievements in the form of exchange or according to their 
production value. The state should assume protection of these 
areas. Citing ordinary reading materials and academic works as 
an example, some deputies from the cultural and theoretical 
circles pointed out that by comparison, the value of the latter 
is much higher than the former, but the judgment of the market 
is frequently the opposite. Therefore, the market should not be 
allowed to decide the fate of all things. The plight of 
symphony orchestras, ballet dances, plays, and other magnificent 
arts has invoked strong responses from all sectors of society. 
This situation reflects, to a certain extent, the imbalance 
brought about by allowing the market to regulate everything. 
  As an economist, Deputy Li Jingwen said: Speaking from the 
angle of an enterprise, the purpose of a market economy is to 
seek maximum returns, but this is not the same as the 
profit-before-everything mentality. Speaking of the market 
economic structure itself, what it seeks is optimizing the 
allocation of resources, thereby gaining maximum returns. In a 
sense a market economy means a market governed by laws and 
regulations. It demands that maximum profits be realized 
through legitimate competition on equal terms, and what it 
stresses is reasonable; but the profit-before-everything 
mentality refers to seeking exorbitant profits by resorting to 
unscrupulous means or even fraud and swindling, and is entirely 
different from competition on equal terms. It is groudless to 
assume that a market economy will inevitably lead to money 
worshipping. That is a misunderstanding of or a prejudice 
against the market economy. 
  Many deputies held that to eliminate people's 
misunderstanding of a market economy, the best way is to 
accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic 
structure, deepen the reform of the market structure, and enable 
people to step into the market with an understanding of it and 
the laws and rules governing it. In this way, they will not 
reject or avoid the market, nor will they indulge in 
supersitions about the market. Speaking from the angle of the 
government, the government should render support for the "dead 
corners" of markets and for the areas in which it cannot fully 
get involved. To seek a balanced development in society, the 
government should have explicit policies on what should be 
decontrolled and preserved.

<F P=106> ["China" column from the "Analysis" page by Willy Wo-lap </F>
Lam: "All Beijing's a Stage, Without a Helmsman"] 
  [Text] The New Helmsman has gone on extended 
pre-retirement leave. The current National People's Congress 
(NPC) is the most rudderless since the messy sessions of the 
Cultural Revolution, when the Great Helmsman went berserk. 
Instead of sketching a bold tableau for the Asia-Pacific 
Century cadres addressing the rubber stamp parliament have 
displayed a talent for obfuscation, doublespeak and 
trompe-l'oeil. 
  President Jiang Zemin and Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji 
made much of the fact that reform had reached "the critical 
stage of breaching the fortresses". However, reports delivered 
to the Congress by leaders including Premier Li Peng had more to 
do with the high-wire act of "striking a balance between reform, 
development and stability". This is a tattered euphemism for 
soft-pedalling market reform to keep the workers and farmers 
from hitting the streets. 
  A central plank of Mr Li's strategy for re-imposing central 
-- particularly fiscal --- discipline on the nation is to fix a 
growth rate of nine per cent for 1994. Both the premier and Mr 
Jiang, however, have qualified themselves by pointing out there 
is some leeway in this, particularly for regions whose speedy 
growth is anchored upon rising productivity. As State Planning 
Minister Chen Jinhua put it: "The national economy must at the 
same time maintain the trend of fast-paced growth and pay 
attention to the possibility of the blind pursuit of an 
excessively high speed." 
  Mr Li's opinion on price reform -- deemed the sine qua non 
for liberalisation -- is a study in calculated ambiguity. 
"Defreezing prices does not mean doing away with macro-level 
adjustments and controls," said the premier, who last week 
slapped price controls back on 20 "essential commodities". 
  Provincial leaders attending the Congress have been speaking 
with forked tongues. Former party chief of Jiangsu Shen Daren, 
who lost his job last autumn for sabotaging Mr Zhu's austerity 
programme, surprised observers by the fervency of his 
protestation of loyalty. "Jiangsu will resolutely safeguard the 
authority of the Party Centre everything (in the province) will 
be done from the point of view of the overall situation of the 
country," Mr Shen said. 
  Apparently invoking the "whateverism" of former party 
chairman Hua Guofeng ("whatever Chairman Mao said was correct"), 
Shanghai party boss Wu Bangguo had this to say about toeing the 
central line: "Whatever the Party Centre has made clear, 
Shanghai will carry out resolutely." Mr Shen's subtle irony is 
that his "obedience" is predicated upon there being a central 
authority worth defending. Mr Wu's diabolical cunning consists 
in the fact that since the central Government has so far failed 
to clarify itself on a host of major policies, Shanghai need 
carry out none of them. 
  Beijing's tragedy is that mired in New Helmsman Deng 
Xiaoping's dictum of "crossing the river while feeling out for 
the boulders", the central authorities have been hedging and 
waffling all the way. 
  Take the "dual tax system," the centrepiece of Beijing's bid 
to boost its share of national revenue to 60 per cent. The game 
plan -- whereby Beijing arrogates the most lucrative of the tax 
bases and leaves the less profitable ones to the localities -- 
is supposed to have started on January. However, in the past 
week, top officials have sounded wishy-washy on the 
controversial fiscal regime. Vice Premier Zhu was 
uncharacteristically duplicitous about when the new system would 
begin. When pressed by delegates for a timetable, Mr Zhu said: 
"We'll spend the first year familiarising ourselves with the 
main points (of the levy). The mechanism should be rendered 
stable the following year. Mature implementation should be 
reached the third year." 
  Deputy tax chief Jin Xin was no less murky on the dual-tax 
syndrome. Last Sunday, he mumbled something about synthesising 
the goal of "no direct interference in the vested interests of 
localities" on the one hand, and "localities taking care of the 
national interest" on the other. Mr Jin proved himself a past 
master of newspeak when he tackled the issue of the capital 
gains tax for real estate. "China implements a unified tax 
system and it will not do (for localities) to go their own 
ways," he said with reference to the levy. "Yet there will be a 
rational division of power between the centre and the regions, 
so that the latter will have considerable jurisdiction over 
parts of their taxes." 
  The leadership's policy towards large- and medium-sized 
enterprises is a case of mind-boggling prevarication. No 
clear-cut indication has been given on whether Beijing is ready 
to sunder its umbilical cord to the dinosaurs. Premier Li asked 
local governments to continue "creating a favourable external 
environment" for public sector units. 
  Vice-Premier Zhu, an advocate of radical surgery, said on 
Monday that Beijing would still "take concrete measures to solve 
the historical baggage of government-owned concerns". These 
cryptic remarks give no clue as to for how long Beijing will 
continue underwriting the losses of state firms. 
  Vice-Governor Zhou Zhengqing of the People's Bank of China, 
which is supposed to keep a tight rein on spending, played fast 
and loose with the fiscal conservatism that is supposed to be a 
leitmotif of this NPC. When asked to explain why he had 
released new loans on Monday for the three depressed sectors of 
coal, metallurgy and electricity, Mr Zhou said: "Controlling 
the total volume of credit does not mean a tight-money policy. 
We must provide support for major parts (of the economy)". He 
did not explain what was so "major" about these sunset 
industries. 
  The artful representation of the truth reached an acme 
Tuesday night when two of Mr Deng's daughters, Deng Nan and Deng 
Rong, volunteered information about their father's "excellent" 
health. "My dad walks at least three kilometres every day," said 
Ms Deng Nan. "He likes to swim in the open seas." 
  Premier Li, then, must be saluted for his singular devotion 
to nothing but the truth when he told NPC delegates last 
Thursday that "the responsibility for the breakdown of the 
(Sino-British) talks lies with the Chinese side ... the British 
side." 
  As former Vice-Minister Ying Ruocheng surmised, Mr Li had 
not 
taken up the dramatic arts. So long as the New Helmsman's 
survival seems dependent on his 30-odd medical team, the major 
players in Chinese politics are too consumed with the deathwatch 
as to do anything more meaningful than acting and dissembling.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Deng Nan, daughter of Deng </F>
Xiaoping and vice minister of the State Science and Technology 
Commission, by unidentified reporters in Beijing on 14 March -- 
recorded; from the "Morning News" program] 
  [Text] This morning, Deng Nan, vice minister of the State 
Science and Technology Commission, joined Shanghai deputies to 
the National People's Congress in a group discussion where she 
heard their views, proposals, and criticisms. Because Deng Nan 
is Deng Xiaoping's daughter, reporters from Shanghai were 
already waiting for her when she arrived. Before she stepped 
into the meeting room, the reporters surrounded her and began to 
interview her at lightning speed. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] How do you feel after your 
return from Shanghai? What are your impressions of Shanghai? 
  [Deng] I have new impressions every year. [laughter] 
  [Repporter] What are your impressions of the Yangpu bridge? 
  [Deng] The Yangpu bridge is famous nationally and 
internationally. 
  [Reporter] We saw Comrade Xiaoping on television during his 
trip to Shanghai. He appeared to be thinner than last year. 
Right? 
  [Deng] It is better to be thinner when one gets old. 
  [Reporter] Does Comrade Xiaoping watch television at home or 
how does he.... 
  [Deng, interrupting] He watches television everyday. He is 
very concerned about the NPC and Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference sessions. Thank you for your concern. 
He is in very good health. He is really in very good health. 
Most important, he does not have any real disease. He is only 
getting old with each passing year. [laughter] This is a 
natural process. He has no problems whatsoever with his internal 
organs. 
  [Reporter] How does he learn of national and international 
events? 
  [Deng] He has a lot of information at his disposal. He reads 
many newspapers and reference materials. Everyday, he reads the 
newspapers, watches television, and hears feedback relayed to 
him from various quarters. He is very concerned about national 
development, especially scientific and technological 
development. On many occasions in the past, he said that China 
should carve out a niche in the world in the field of science 
and technology. If people asked for his advice on this issue, 
he would express his views. [laughter] 
  [Reporter] I read in the newspaper that he walks three 
li....[changes thought] three km each day. 
  [Deng] Three km is on the lower side. He sometimes covers 
more distance. Besides taking a walk, he also plays bridge and 
has a good appetite. His appetite has always been very good. 
  [Reporter] Is he still into swimming? 
  [Deng] He only swims in the ocean. He loves the ocean; he 
does not like the swimming pool because it is so oppressive. 
  [Reporter] We hope he will go to Shanghai every year. 
  [Deng] We hope so. [laughter] 
  [Reporter] The people of Shanghai welcome his visit with 
open 
arms. 
  [Deng] Given Shanghai's tremendous changes, it is only 
natural that he go there. [laughter] 
  [Reporter] After 1997, he probably will go to Hong Kong. 
  [Deng] Even if he goes to Hong Kong, he will stay there for 
only a brief period. He will not stay there longer than in 
Shanghai. 
  [Reporter] The changes that have occurred in Shanghai in 
recent years are mainly the result of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
encouragement, concern, and exhortation. 
  [Deng] The people of Shanghai should be largely credited for 
these changes. Shanghai is now in the best period ever; it 
should seize opportunities. 
  [Reporter] You went to Shanghai this Spring Festival. When 
will you go there again? 
  [Deng] We do not have any plan yet. [laughter] 
  [Reporter] The people of Shanghai are very concerned about 
this issue. We hope he will go there every year. 
  [Deng] That is for sure. 
  [Reporter] What are your own impressions of Shanghai? 
  [Deng] Shanghai is the largest industrial, financial, and 
trade center in China. Therefore, it is the most promising city 
in China. 
  [Reporter] What did you study in the past? 
  [Deng] Physics. 
  [Reporter] In your current capacity as vice minister of the 
State Science and Technology Commission, what is your area of 
responsibility? 
  [Deng] Social development [as heard]. 
  [Reporter] Please convey the regards of Shanghai's deputies, 
listeners, and people to Comrade Xiaoping. We wish him good 
health. 
  [Deng] Thank you. I will surely do it. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By staff reporter He Jun: "Foreign Funds To Bolster </F>
Hi-Tech"] 
  [Text] China is setting up a fund with help from foreign 
finance firms to boost its fledgling hi-tech industry, an 
official with the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC) 
said yesterday. 
  The China Torch Hi-tech Industry Investment Fund is expected 
to attract about $120 million as a result of co-operation 
between the SSTC and the foreign firms, said Wang Ruiming, head 
of the commission's Torch Programme Office. 
  The four are Tien Lee (International) Corporation and Wadley 
Corporate Finance of Hong Kong, BBN James Capel of Canada and 
the Arthur Anderson Accountant Corporation of the U.S. 
  The funds are to be poured directly into State projects 
aided 
by the Torch Programme which was set up in 1988 to market and 
develop hi-tech in China. 
  Torch and the foreign firms are now examining about 30 
projects which have applied for the funds. 
  SSTC has approved more than 1,500 Torch projects in the past 
five years and local authorities have launched another 3.600. 
  Figures from about 1,300 State projects show a total output 
of 14.29 billion yuan ($1.64 billion) last year, more than 
double the figure in 1992. 
  Most Torch projects have been set up in the 52 State hi-tech 
industrial development zones around the country. 
  Output of these zones leaped 145.3 percent last year to 
45.83 
billion yuan ($5.27 billion) and their export volume doubled to 
$730 million.

system so administrators can bring research results from the 
archives office and market them at trading or auction centers. 
  Recently a famous Beijing university successively released 
and printed in booklets, three batches of fruits from several 
hundred scientific research projects. However, the university 
only listed research project titles and technology transfer fees 
in the booklets, without making any substantive effort to 
transfer technology. Such a passive work style plus expensive 
technology transfer fees, which was beyond the budget of units 
urgently in need of technology, resulted in very few 
technologies transferred. 
  It is understood that China currently has 17.6 million 
scientific and technical personnel. They complete over 10,000 
province- or department-funded research projects and turn out 
some 20,000 patents annually. However, only 15 percent of the 
research results are put into application, and even fewer are 
used extensively by more than one unit. 
  The gradual establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure poses a new challenge to China's science and 
technology management system. In the past, science and 
technology management departments made inventory of research 
results, evaluated or awarded them, and locked them up in 
archives offices. Such a practice is incompatible with the 
development of the market economy. Research fruits should be 
put into markets, circulated, and exchanged as commodities. As 
enterprises shop in markets for suitable technologies, 
scientists will direct their research and development to meet 
market demands. Therefore, research institute administrators 
should look squarely at the reality and change their perception 
of management in certain ways. 
  According to experts, administrators should not only make 
good inventory of, but also effectively manage research results. 
In managing research results, administrators should work as 
agents, conducting market survey and forecast to match buyers 
with sellers, and working as a catalyst to transactions by 
providing information service. At present there are many 
unauthorized agents with all kinds of qualifications. Quite a 
few are swindlers, and only a handful are professionals with 
real science and technology information and expertise in 
technology transfer. Since Chinese research institutes already 
have an edge in this regard, they should set up various 
management and service organizations to market high-quality 
creditable research results. 
  Experts suggest the use of economic and legal means to guide 
enterprises and scientific and technical personnel to the 
technology market for voluntary buying and selling of research 
fruits. Meanwhile, it is necessary to do everything possible to 
set up auction centers and to increase the rate of auctioning 
technology. As technology investment involves risks, many 
enterprises are hesitant to move ahead. Administrators should 
help enterprises set up the mechanism to deal with investment 
risks so that enterprises have less worries and more hopes for 
successful utilization of new technology.

  [Text] Yichang, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Some 119 Chinese 
experts in water resources and hydro-electric power recently 
gathered at Yichang, in central China's Hubei Province, where 
the Three Gorges dam will be built, to further discuss the 
project's technical design. 
  The project is now at the preparatory stage and the 
construction of the main project will soon be started. 
  To decrease risks, shorten construction period and save 
costs, the Three Gorges project construction committee of the 
State Council has authorized the China Chang Jiang Three Gorges 
Development Corporation to take charge of the examination of the 
technical design. 
  To fulfill the task, the corporation has set up a technical 
committee and eight expert groups which will thoroughly examine 
eight major topics, including the dam, the power plant houses, a 
permanent floodgate, a ship lift, a deepwater coffer dam, sand 
and mud at the dam area and generation installation. 
  Foreign institutions and experts will be invited for 
consultation if necessary, according to Lu Youmei, general 
manager of the corporation. 
  Discussion of the site and the preliminary design have taken 
several decades and Chinese experts concluded after lengthy 
study that China definitely has the ability to solve major 
technical problems. 
  Soon ten symposiums will be held on technical issues 
concerning the project and some major technical issues will be 
deeply discussed. 
  From now on the technical committee will start an overall 
examination of the general layout, the design principle, major 
and key indices of every single project.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wen Hongyan (3306 4767 1750): "Free Electronic </F>
Laser Device, Developed By High-Energy Physics Research 
Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Passes Technological 
Appraisal"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (RENMIN RIBAO)--Another great 
breakthrough was made recently in developing Beijing's free 
electronic laser device, a State 863 key technological project 
undertaken by the High-Energy Physics Research Institute of the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has successfully achieved 
saturated oscillation [bao he zhen dang 7394 0735 2182 5616] and 
passed a technological appraisal conducted by academics Wang 
Ganchang, Wang Daheng, and Chen Nengkuan today in Beijing. 
  The free electronic laser device is a sophisticated 
technology developed in recent decades in the world's 
high-technology field. It is acclaimed by scientists as a "new 
gold mine" in the scientific and technological circles and is a 
strategic research topic for the next century. It can produce 
coherent electromagnetic radiation from infrared to the X 
spectral regions, can continuously readjust and change 
wavelengths, and possesses a huge crest value and an extremely 
large power potential. It will have very broad prospects for 
application in such areas as condensed state physics, material 
sciences [cai liao ke xue 2624 2436 4430 1331], photochemistry, 
bioengineering, military science, controlled thermonuclear 
fusion, and telecommunications and is particularly attractive in 
forming the X-ray holographs [guan xi cheng xiang 0356 1873 2052 
0288] of large biological molecules. 
  At present, the most widely used of free electronic laser 
devices in the high-technology field is the infrared free 
electronic laser device and this is exactly what the High-Energy 
Physics Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
has successfully developed. Of the 10 similar devices being 
developed in Asia, it was the first to actually lase (on 26 May 
1993) and it achieved saturated oscillation the other day, thus 
enabling China to achieve infrared free electronic laser after 
the United States and Western Europe. 
  Beijing's free electronic laser device project was first 
established and initiated in March 1986 and is one of the first 
research topics in the State 863 high-technology field. The 
project was successfully developed by 50 scientific research 
personnel headed by Xie Jialin, academic and research fellow of 
the High- Energy Physics Research Institute of the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences, after eight years of arduos efforts. The 
appraisal members unanimously held that Beijing's free 
electronic laser device has successfully achieved saturation and 
oscillation and confirmed, once again, that China is one of the 
leaders in this high-tech field. 
  It has been learned that the State 863 laser field has 
decided to set up key laboratories for free electronic laser 
devices with Beijing's free electronic laser device as the 
mainstay, offering a good foundation for China to develop in 
that field.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 13 (XINHUA) -- China Southern 
Airlines has ordered the country's first Boeing-777 flight 
simulator from abroad for training pilots. 
  The 20-million U.S. dollar contract was signed today in 
Zhuhai City, one of the country's special economic zones, in 
Guangdong Province, south China. 
  In 1992, the airlines set up a simulation training center in 
Zhuhai for Boeing pilots. With one Boeing-737 simulator and one 
Boeing-757 simulator, the center trained 716 pilots last year. 
  Pilots for Boeing previously had to go abroad for training. 
  The airline has ordered six Boeing-777s, the first of which 
is due for delivery in December this year.

  [Text] Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, pointed out today: The Army must 
adhere to high standards in combating corruption and promoting 
ethical integrity. Leading cadres, particularly high-ranking 
cadres, should strictly implement the systems and rules and 
regulations of the CPC Central Committee and the Central 
Military Commission concerning the party style and the promotion 
of ethical integrity. They should set an example of serving the 
people wholeheartedly and abiding by discipline. 
  Liu Huaqing made these remarks at the all-Army discipline 
inspection work conference. After expounding on the 
achievements made by the Army in promoting the party style and 
ethical integrity in 1993, he pointed out: We should grasp four 
links in this year's work. First, we should further enhance our 
ideological understanding and fully understand that the task of 
combating corruption and promoting ethical integrity has a 
bearing on the survival of the party and the country, and that 
it is a long-term task for the entire stage of socialism. 
Second, it is necessary to made a new breakthrough in 
investigating and handling major cases. Third, more efforts 
should be devoted to dealing with key issues. Fourth, new steps 
should be taken to improve relevant rules and regulations and to 
supervise and inspect their implementation. 
  Liu Huaqing said: The party committees and leading cadres at 
all levels of the Army should set the example in promoting the 
party style and ethical integrity and should resolutely 
implement the decisions of the party Central Committee and the 
Central Military Commission. While we must seriously implement 
rules and regulations, we absolutely must not disregard orders 
and bans. We must truly identify ourselves with the party 
Central Committee politically and ideologically. In promoting 
the party style and ethical integrity, leading cadres should 
display a revolutionary devotion and sense of responsibility and 
set an example of performing more actual deeds than talking and 
of being as good as their word. 
  Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission and 
director of the General Political Department, presided over the 
meeting today. Present at the meeting were Zhang Zhen, vice 
chairman of the Central Military Commission; Chi Haotian, Zhang 
Wannian and Fu Quanyou, members of the Central Military 
Commission; and leading comrades of the three general 
departments of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], all major PLA 
units in Beijing, and the Armed Police Force. The all-Army 
discipline inspection work conference opened on 25 February. 
Zhou Ziyu, deputy director of the General Political Department 
and secretary of the Central Military Commission Discipline 
Inspection Committee, delivered a report to the conference. 
  Those in attendance included members of the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection serving in the PLA, and 
members of the Central Military Commission Discipline Inspection 
Committee, as well as secretaries of discipline inspection 
committees and directors of discipline inspection departments of 
major PLA units and the Armed Police Force headquarters.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429): "The Case of the Civil Aviation Industry's 
Recruitment of Personnel From the Air Force Disturbs Zhongnanhai] 
  [Text] During the switchover from the planned economy to 
the market economy on the Chinese mainland, especially since the 
14th CPC National Congress officially decided to follow the road 
of the market economy in October 1992, the third high tide of 
business activity has begun on the mainland (the first being 
between 1984 and 1985 and the second in 1988) and has involved 
almost all walks of life. Inevitably, many new problems have 
cropped up as a result, including personnel drain. The severity 
of this problem has deeply disturbed the relevant authorities 
for quite some time. In recent years, there have been cases of 
air force pilots being recruited by the civil aviation industry, 
which has shocked the air force leadership, the State Council, 
high-level CPC officials, and the CPC octogenarians. They gave 
instructions and issued orders demanding an end to this 
phenomenon, but the problem has yet to be thoroughly solved. 
<H5>  Personnel Drain in the Air Force Undermines Morale </H5>
  According to informed sources in Beijing, civil aviation 
companies nationwide have been recruiting personnel from the 
People's Liberation Army air force since the beginning of last 
year in order to cover a serious shortage of pilots. As a 
result, over 150 trainers and new graduates from the military 
aviation academies and schools were engaged by those companies 
as pilots and ground personnel, and dozens of air force pilots 
ranking at and above the regiment commander level have applied 
for early retirement or demobilization under various "excuses" 
such as health reasons, after which they joined the contingent 
of civil aviation pilots. Throughout the year, over 500 other 
servicemen in the air force requested early retirement or 
demobilization. In order to achieve their goals, they either 
forged physical examination papers or became disgruntled and 
slacked off in their work. This has shaken the service's morale 
to a certain extent and has undermined the building of the air 
force. 
  Under the impact of the market economy, while air force 
personnel are being tapped, what is happening in other fields? 
With the development of the economy, ocean cargo in mainland 
China has been growing at an annual rate of 20 percent, which 
urgently requires the expansion of the shipping contingent. 
Because the number of ocean shipping college graduates cannot 
meet the demand, there have also been some cases in which ocean 
shipping departments have recruited navy personnel. A report 
issued by the State Council at the beginning of this year shows 
that over 25 percent of the middle-aged scientific and 
technological personnel in the research institutes under the 
ministries of the State Council have left their posts or joined 
other trades, leaving over 20 percent of the institutes at a 
standstill. As many as 30 percent of the senior teachers in key 
middle schools in major cities have left campus. Institutions 
of higher learning have lost over 10 percent of their 
middle-aged teachers. In big cities, 30 percent of the chief 
physicians in hospitals have left, resulting in a serious 
shortage of medical staff. The number of economic and financial 
management personnel in the relevant departments at the 
provincial or ministerial level who give up their original posts 
to set up economic entities or accept jobs with by wholly or 
partially foreign-funded enterprises is constantly growing. In 
Guangdong Province, 30 percent of economic administration 
personnel at the section and bureau level have left their jobs 
on their own accord. In Shanghai Municipality, over 20 percent 
of economic administration personnel at the section level have 
moved into economic entities, financial departments, and wholly 
or partially foreign-funded enterprises. 
  All this shows that the phenomenon of professional personnel 
being tapped, changing profession, or going into business is 
very serious. This will certainly promote the growth of new 
organizations which badly need professionals, but it has caused 
a great deal of difficulty for the organizations where these 
people used to work and has undermined their stability. 
<H3>  The State Council Issues an Order Prohibiting Such 
Recruitment </H3>
  The sources said: The most important cause of such personnel 
drain is that new organizations do urgently need professionals, 
and they offer much more handsome salaries and benefits than the 
units where those people used to work. For example, the 
economic and financial management personnel from government 
departments receive 50 percent to over 300 percent more pay 
after they have transferred to wholly or partially 
foreign-funded enterprises. 
  Take again the case of civil aviation departments tapping 
air 
force personnel. Figures indicate that China's aviation sector 
suffered from a lack of professionals for many years. Beginning 
in the mid-1980's, the industry grew at an annual rate of 25 
percent, but the increase of professionals was only about 12 
percent. Into the 1990's, the industry has maintained a growth 
rate of 25 percent each year, but the annual rate of personnel 
increase has been less than 20 percent. Hungry for qualified 
professionals, the industry turned its attention to the air 
force, flaunting its high salaries and benefits. 
  It has 
been learned that the monthly salary of captains who fly the 
main lines of all aviation companies is normally 4,000 yuan to 
6,000 yuan (renminbi, similarly hereinafter), which is 
equivalent to 10 or 15 times the monthly salary of an active 
military officer ranking at the regiment or division level. 
Besides, those captains are also entitled to housing, job 
placements for their family members, long holidays, and liberal 
benefits. For example, a pilot working for Air China can get 
extras in kind worth 3,000 yuan a year. The extras in kind that 
a flight attendant working for Eastern Airlines can get each 
year are worth nearly 5,000 yuan. Such handsome conditions are 
very attractive to officers on the active list, who would try 
every possible means to retire or demobilize earlier and join 
the civil aviation industry. 
  The civil aviation industry's recruitment of pilots from the 
air force has shocked the air force CPC committee and high-level 
CPC officials, and they had to adopt countermeasures to prevent 
such cases from spreading. In mid-January, General Cao 
Shuangming, commander of the air force, announced the procedures 
for processing officers' applications for early retirement or 
demobilization at an enlarged meeting of the air force. The 
application for early retirement or demobilization of a cadre 
ranking at or above the regiment commander level must be 
submitted to the air force headquarters for examination and 
approval, and a cadre ranking at or above the division level 
must submit these types of applications to the general office of 
the Central Military Commission for review. If the reasons are 
found to have been fabricated or the documentation forged, they 
will be subject to military disciplinary action, which includes 
striking their names off the Army roll and expelling them from 
the party. 
  In the meantime, State Council Premier Li Peng issued a 
"Strict Ban on Recruiting Servicemen as Civil Aviation Air and 
Ground Personnel." This order stipulates: Civil aviation 
companies are not allowed to recruit air and ground personnel of 
the air force on the active list for any reason; or to admit 
into the civil aviation industry military personnel who do not 
hold retirement or demobilization certificates issued by the 
Central Military Commission General Office, the Ministry of 
National Defense, or a given military region; or to recruit 
teachers and students of military aviation academies and schools. 
<H5>  The Permanent Cure Is To Generate More Professionals </H5>
  A personality from the political circles in Beijing pointed 
out: The air force party committee's decision and the State 
Council's order will only curtail the recruitment temporarily 
and do not represent a permanent solution. To effect a thorough 
cure, it is necessary to liberate the mind, deepen reform, and 
bring up more professionals. This matter should be arranged by 
the Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC] under an 
overall plan. 
  According to this personality, the CPC octogenarians and 
high- level party officials frequently discussed the issue of 
training the civil aviation industry's air and ground personnel. 
Last December, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin instructed: 
"To develop civil aviation, priority should be given to 
training civil aviation pilots, ground technical personnel, and 
flight directors as well as expanding the civil aviation 
contingent. Only by so doing can we ensure the quality of civil 
aviation personnel, implement the policy of safety first, and 
show our commitment to the people's cause." The "Decision on 
Certain Questions Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist 
Market Economic System," adopted at the third plenary session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee last November, also clearly 
pointed out: "The establishment of the socialist market 
economic system and the realization of modernization ultimately 
depend on the improvement of the quality of the people and the 
training of professionals." Therefore, "it is necessary to 
resort to a variety of forms and methods to bring up a large 
number of skilled workers and all kinds of professionals." 
Regrettably, this decision has not been conscientiously 
implemented. But there have been signs of change recently. On 
21 February, the very day when the CAAC held the largest-scale 
flight safety work conference in the history of China's civil 
aviation sector, the Northwest Space Training Company [xi bei yu 
hang xun lian gong si 6007 0554 1342 5300 6064 4886 0361 0674], 
a subsidiary of Northwest Airlines of the United States, 
announced that it has reached an agreement with five Chinese 
aviation companies, Southwest Airlines, Eastern Airlines, North 
Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, and Xiamen Airlines, which involves 
training in piloting MD-82 and Boeing 757 passenger planes for 
the 250 pilots of these companies. This company will also 
undertake the training of 30 Boeing 757 flight attendants for 
Xiamen Airlines, and this number may be raised to 200 some time 
later. Now it all depends on whether or not Chen Guangyi, the 
newly appointed CAAC director, can seize this opportunity and 
push the industry's personnel training one step ahead. 
  The personality from Beijing's political circles believed 
that the Army and other fields also need reforms, including the 
reform of salary system, to avoid personnel drain. But this 
depends on the vision and determination of high-level CPC 
officials.

  [Text] Nanning, March 9 (CNS) -- The Guangxi Military 
Region will this year carry out an intensive programme to 
eliminate landmines scattered within the Sino-Vietnamese border 
area covering some 280 districts known as death zones, according 
to the deputy commander of the region, Mr. Hu Jun. 
  The large-scale minesweeping got under way last June in the 
border area between China and Vietnam and has been completed in 
12 ports including Dongxing, Tongzhong, Friendship Pass, and 
Pinxiang as well as at 17 border trade points with 76 
landmine-ridden districts and 118 landmine ranges marked for 
public awareness. A large area was affected by landmines and 
nearly 70,000 landmines of various kinds have been detonated. 
  The military region sent close to 30,000 military personnel 
to carry out minesweeping last year with nearly six tonnes of 
explosives and some 200,000 tonnes of detonators handled without 
incident. An outstanding captain led the minesweeping team on 
100 occasions to wipe out 2,300 landmines last year while he 
pesonally eliminated 800 mines. 
  The new round of minesweeping work set for this year will 
start this month with an expected total of 113 landmine proven 
districts and 187 landmine to be covered this year. The action 
will be completed by the end of this year and the border area by 
that time will be a landmine-free area and open to traffic.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China is making 
strides in the transfer of property rights to invigorate 
stagnant enterprises, especially state-owned ones. 
  During the past year, more than 2,900 enterprises were sold 
or merged through the 16 property rights exchange centers in 
cities like Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Shenzhen. 
Altogether 400,000 workers have been relocated. 
  State-owned assets still make up the biggest proportion of 
total social assets in China today. The assets are under the 
mandate of central or local governments, or various 
administrative ministries. 
  However, under the old planned economic system, state-owned 
enterprises did not have enough latitude to decide their own 
management affairs and their fixed assets could not be 
circulated on the market. 
  It is estimated that about a third of the state-owned 
enterprises are running at a loss while another third are 
running with poor management. 
  The transfer of property rights is mainly conducted by way 
of 
enterprise mergers or transformation into a share-holding 
system. In the 1980s, more than 6,900 enterprises were merged, 
with over eight billion yuan of property rights transferred. 
  Consequently, 4,095 enterprises came out of the red and the 
annual level of losses by state-owned enterprises was reduced by 
522 million yuan. 
  In addition, some other practical methods such as contract 
and leasing systems have been taken to revitalize state-owned 
enterprises and at the same time to prevent the drain of state 
fixed assets. 
  With regard to the share-holding system, in which China 
began 
pilot schemes in the mid-1980s, the government had approved the 
setting up of 13,000 share-holding companies by the end of 1993. 
  By the end of last year, a total of 122 companies, with 
208.6 
billion yuan in capital, listed their stocks on the Shenzhen or 
Shanghai stock exchanges. So far some 25 million Chinese people 
are involved in stock transactions. 
  Hainan, designated to be a province by the State Council in 
1988 and now China's largest economic zone, is striving to 
become a regional center for property rights transactions. 
  The province has about 3,000 state or collectively owned 
enterprises, one third of which are running at a loss. Experts 
say that the small proportion of state-owned enterprises makes 
them easy to be auctioned or merged without too much social 
impact. 
  By the end of 1992, the province had more than 2,000 
foreign- 
funded enterprises and 83,400 industrial and commercial 
enterprises dealing with various industrial sectors, retail 
selling, catering trade, tourism, and real estate. The 
bankruptcy of firms has made transactions in property rights a 
brisk business. 
  The province now has ten auction institutions, with fairly 
experienced auction businessmen, for these transactions. 
  Specialists and bodies handling property assessment, 
transaction notarization and property lawsuits have also come 
into being. 
  So far, the province has 30 bar associations, a dozen 
accountancy offices and some 50 auditing offices. 
  To coordinate the transactions, the province has set up a 
unified social insurance system covering workers in varied 
ownership sectors. The system deals with unemployment, 
pensions, medical care and injuries at work. 
  Sichuan is also one of the country's first provinces to 
implement trial reforms in the transfer of property rights of 
enterprises. 
  In 1993 alone, 408 enterprises in the province eliminated 
losses and began to create profits after their property rights 
were transferred. 
  With the development of the property rights business, China 
has promulgated a series of relevant laws and regulations on 
bankruptcy, company and state enterprises. 
  Economists believe that the development of the property 
rights business will play a more and more important role in 
re-organization of the country's production factors and in 
raising its productivity.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Major Steps To Liberalize Trade Are </F>
Imminent"] 
  [Text] China this week will announce major steps to 
liberalize its trade to help pave the way for its return to 
GATT, the world trade body, said a senior government official. 
  China will ensure "maximum possible flexibility on tariff 
and 
non-tariff measures as well as other issues of interest to GATT 
parties, while maintaining a balance of rights and obligations 
in GATT," said the official, Long Yongtu. 
  Long is in charge of GATT affairs for the Ministry of 
Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec). 
  Long made the remarks in an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY 
on 
the eve of the 16th session of the GATT Working Party on China, 
to be held from March 15-18 in Geneva. 
  Long, who is general secretary of the Chinese delegation, 
which left for Geneva on Saturday, said details of the 
"significant measures" would be announced then. 
  "Some of the measures will be bound to specific 
implementation timetables," Long said. 
  "And," he added, "we will make new commitments to foreign 
exchange reforms." 
  These impending measures should better position China for 
resuming contracting party status in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), economists said. 
  The United States and the European Union (EU) have 
complained 
that China's proposed concessions to the Uruguay Round of GATT 
trade negotiations are not enough. 
  But the U.S. and EU agree that China could be allowed a 
transitional period to revise its proposals after it rejoins 
GATT. Analysts said the new measures by China on liberalizing 
trade can be significant steps in that direction. 
  Long's delegation to Geneva, which is led by Moftec 
Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang, is the largest of any sent by China 
to Geneva. 
  Yu Xiaosong, Vice-Minister of the State Economic and Trade 
Commission which masterminds the nation's industrial policies, 
is vice-chairman of the mission. 
  Long pointed out that the Geneva session on China's re-entry 
into GATT is the first following the conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round of trade talks. 
  "It is high time for China to rejoin GATT," Long said. 
  His opinion is based on three reasons. 
  Firstly, China's economic reforms in the past 15 years, 
particularly those adopted this year, have substantially pushed 
the country's economy onto a market-based track. 
  "Even the U.S. and EU have acknowledged the remarkable 
progress China has made," Long said. 
  U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Dorothy Dwoskin and EU 
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan visited China last month and 
gained an appreciation of China's economic reforms. 
  Secondly, China has accepted the notion of a transitional 
period for it to meet GATT's requirements. 
  Thirdly, China's resumption of its GATT status would be the 
prerequisite for becoming a founding member of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), which is to replace GATT next year as the 
primary international free-trade body. 
  "Without the participation of China as a founding member, 
WTO 
will be incomplete and its universality will be weakened," Long 
said. 
  If China, the world's 11th largest trading nation, should be 
kept outside WTO it would be a setback for the international 
trade system, he added. 
  Long reaffirmed that China would not seek to reduce its 
obligations for maintaining world trade once it rejoins Gatt. 
  "We will not dilute our commitment to GATT or the WTO by 
resorting to treatment as a developing nation," he said. 
  GATT rules, as well as preliminary regulations drawn up by 
the WTO, stipulate different treatment for developing and 
developed nations on certain issues. "We are only insisting on 
being treated as a developing nation when there are different 
stipulations for the two categories," he explained.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- China reported a sharp 
growth in exports and imports in the first two months this year, 
totalling 22.1 billion U.S. dollars, a 17.1 percent rise over 
the same period of last year. 
  Figures from China's customs office show that so far, the 
total exports this year have jumped by 13.6 percent to 10.43 
billion U.S. dollars while gross imports represented an increase 
of 20.5 percent to 11.67 billion U.S. dollars. 
  In the first two months, the general export trade reported a 
rise of 16.3 percent, and exports for the processing industry 
maintained a steady increase of 15.7 percent, hitting 5.17 
billion U.S. dollars, while exports through bartering and border 
trade were reduced by about 41 percent. 
  The figures also show that exports of primary products 
tended 
to go up with an increase of 24.4 percent, despite a sweeping 
export reduction of petroleum and petroleum products. 
  Exports for industrial end-products continued to rise apace, 
with electro-mechanical products, textiles, garments and 
chemical products surging by 10 percent, and steel and 
non-ferrous metal starting to pick up. 
  The total exports for foreign-funded companies jumped by 
44.4 
percent to 3.16 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 30 percent 
of the country's total. The exports of other ventures rose by a 
modest 4 percent, totaling 7.27 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The main influence on hefty imports came from 
foreign-financed firms, whose total imports for equipment 
accounted for one-fifth of the country's total. Another factor 
was the booming processing industry, whose imports for raw 
materials and machine parts in the first two months this year 
accounted for 35.7 percent of the country's total. 
  The main goods imported by a wide margin in this period 
include machinery, plastics, petroleum and petroleum products, 
ships, paper and metal products. 
  The imports of steel, autos and other staples including 
grain 
and flour, fertilizer, airplanes, copper, aluminum and lumber 
saw very small increases or were cut slightly.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese economist Su 
Xing said that economic levers rather than forceful 
administrative means should be used to regulate, or 
"macro-control," the Chinese economy. 
  Su, vice-president of China's top party school, said 
governments of all countries exercise macroeconomic controls in 
varying degrees and with varying intensity for different fields, 
and so should the Chinese Government. 
  After commenting that the Chinese Government's macro-control 
measures of last year have been successful, Su briefly analysed 
problems that prompted the government to act. 
  in their drive for economic growth, he said, localities 
spent 
huge sums of loans that came in the form of inter-bank lending. 
As a result, capital construction went out of control. 
  Spending on real estate development, stock speculation and 
unrestrained investment in "development zones" gobbled huge sums 
of money, most from banks. As a result, the government had to 
pay farmers "IOU" slips instead of cash for their produce, and a 
shortage of funds hobbled the construction of many key state 
projects. 
  In the second half of last year, the central government 
began 
putting banking activities to order. 
  "But a lot of loans could not be retrieved since the money 
had been turned into reinforced concrete in real estate," he 
said. 
  Banks, ordered to get back their loans, cut back operating 
funds of enterprises, which then appealed legitimately for a 
loosening of credit. To avoid a major setback in economic 
growth, the central bank had to grant loans selectively for 
specific enterprises and relax control on credit. 
  Still, he said, banks retrieved tens of billions of yuan and 
ensured funding for more than 90 percent of key construction 
projects. It also used the money to pay farmers. 
  "But the rectifying measures are not a fundamental cure for 
the root problem," he said, referring to excessive fixed assets 
investment. 
  In his view, the fundamental cure is to establish a system 
of 
comprehensive macro-economic controls that rely mainly on 
economic levers to be supplemented with some administrative 
means. 
  "In exercising macro-controls, financial, taxation, pricing 
and banking departments should have coordination among 
themselves," he said. 
  The economics professor expressed concern over the 
government's budget deficit of 130 billion yuan for 1994. 
"However," he said, "the real danger is for fixed assets 
investment to go out of control."

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- The Bank of China has 
recently issued 500 million U.S. dollars worth of Yankee Bonds 
in the United States as part of its effort to support domestic 
economic construction. 
  The issue of the bonds, in terms of five years or twenty 
years, is the first attempt by the bank to raise funds on the 
U.S. securities market. 
  These bonds are the largest total with the longest terms so 
far issued by the Bank of China overseas. 
  The U.S. Morgan Stanley Investment Bank has been the main 
contractor for sale of the bonds. 
  The money raised by issuing the bonds will be invested in 
the 
development of China's domestic projects for communications and 
energy resources.
