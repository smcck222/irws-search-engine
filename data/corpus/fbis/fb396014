  [Text] Shanghai, March 17 (CNS) -- Officials in charge of 
public security departments in 11 provinces, municipalities and 
autonomous regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning and 
Shanghai gathered in Shanghai to discuss with representatives 
from the Hong Kong police force to discuss the fight against 
organized crime committed by black societies. 
  The meeting was held amid the budding of some Hong Kong 
underground groups in the Mainland where they commit various 
kinds of crime posing hazards to social order both in the 
Mainland and in the territory. 
  A representative from the Hong Kong police gave details on 
the illegal groups operating in the territory as well as on 
measures adopted by the Hong Kong police to counter the groups. 
The Mainland police officers elaborated on the infiltration of 
illegal organizations into the Mainland for various kinds of 
crime and they gave an account of the measures being taken 
against such groups. 
  Participants at the meeting believed that the strengthening 
of cooperation between the police in the Mainland and in Hong 
Kong was a necessity for the prevention of crime in the two 
places. 
  Director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the 
Ministry 
of Public Security Mr. Zhuo Feng stressed that underground 
forces from outside the country's borders were in no way given 
shelter in the Mainland. All members of illegal groups were 
harshly punished in accordance with the law once they were found 
guilty of committing crimes inside the Mainland. 
  A Hong Kong police officer said that he hoped police in the 
two places would further boost their cooperation in fighting 
against organized crime related to the Mainland and Hong Kong in 
order to put a halt to the mushrooming of underground forces 
with the aim of safeguarding prosperity and stability in the two 
places.

<F P=106> [By staff correspondent Wang Chien (3769 0494): "Beijing </F>
Discloses for First Time That the Case of MING PAO Reporter Xi 
Yang Will Be Concluded Soon"] 
  [Text] At a briefing on the case of MING PAO correspondent 
Xi Yang, Zhu Mingshan, vice president of the PRC Supreme 
People's Court, told Hong Kong and Macao deputies to the 
National People's Congress [NPC] that Xi Yang is on trial and 
his case is expected to be concluded later this month or early 
next month. This is the first official announcement since Xi 
Yang was arrested and charged nearly six months ago where the 
authorities have disclosed that Xi Yang is being tried and that 
his case will be concluded soon. 
  Zeng Decheng, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, said last night 
that yesterday afternoon, the NPC Secretariat arranged a meeting 
between Supreme Court Vice President Zhu Mingshan and NPC 
deputies from Hong Kong. 
  Zeng Decheng quoted Zhu Mingshan as saying: Xi Yang is now 
on trial at the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court on 
the charge of stealing state secrets. Since Tian Ye, vice 
director of the General Office of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of 
the People's Bank of China and high-level state secrets are 
involved in the case, the hearing is not open to the public, and 
Xi Yang is not allowed to see his family or a representative of 
his employer. 
  Zhu Mingshan said: The Beijing Municipal People's 
Procuratorate Branch lodged an indictment on 14 December 1993 
against Xi Yang in the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's 
Court. On 22 December, the court held a closed-door trial of Xi 
Yang. On 27 January this year, the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court returned the case to the Beijing 
Municipal People's Procuratorate Branch, requesting additional 
information. According to PRC "Criminal Proceedings," the 
procuratorate must supply the requested information within one 
month. On 22 February this year, the Beijing Municipal People's 
Procuratorate Branch supplied the Beijing Municipal Intermediate 
People's Court with the additional information and the trial 
resumed. 
  Zeng Decheng said that according to the provisions, the 
court 
hearing should only last one month, and, in any case, no more 
than one and a half months. Therefore, Xi Yang's case will be 
concluded at the end of this month or by early April at the 
latest. 
  Zeng Decheng said: When Hong Kong NPC deputies inquired of 
Zhu Mingshan about proof of evidence in Xi Yang's case, Zhu 
Mingshan said the establishment of a case did not require 
harmful effects of a criminal act; the intention to do such harm 
would suffice. He termed it criminal intention. 
  Zhu Mingshan further claimed that there is a written record 
which shows Xi Yang declined to hire a lawyer. He also said Xi 
Yang had met his family earlier. Zeng Decheng said that so far 
there was no evidence to show that Xi Yang had been denied his 
due rights, and Hong Kong NPC deputies handed Zhu Mingshan a 
letter from the Hong Kong Journalists Association requesting 
lenient treatment to Xi Yang. He emphasized that as a Hong Kong 
NPC deputy, he hoped the mainland authorities would try Xi 
Yang's case strictly in accordance with the due process of law, 
saying that the fairness of the trial depends on the final 
verdict. 
  On the other hand, CPPCC delegate Xu Simin yesterday quoted 
a 
personal friend of his from the PRC Ministry of Justice as 
saying the week previously: Xi Yang went through his first 
trial hearing in the middle of last month and sentence is 
expected any time soon. Initial signs indicate that Xi Yang will 
receive a suspended jail term of one to two years, and he can 
return to Hong Kong shortly afterward with a bond provided by 
his family or his employer. 
  Xu Ximing qouted concerned personnel as saying that during 
the trial Yang was found to have broken Chinese law. However, 
since he made the mistake while covering events and not in the 
context of any intelligence work, Xu would very likely receive a 
light sentence. Xu Ximing said that if Xi Yang received a heavy 
sentence, he would appeal to the Higher People's Court and 
request permission to be present at the appeal hearing. 
  CPPCC delegate Luo Hsiang-kuo also said during the session 
that he had, in a personal capacity, announced to the conference 
this Tuesday that he hoped the Ministry of Justice would treat 
Xi Yang with leniency and would reveal details of the whole 
matter to the public. He said he would try to bring up the 
matter in a panel discussion. However, the conference did not 
allow him to discuss this matter at the panel meeting for the 
reason that this was an individual matter. 
  A MING PAO spokesman said that he did not know about the 
latest developments in Xi Yang's trial. MING PAO would contact 
the departments concerned today to get updates on the situation. 
The spokesman reiterated his hope that the Chinese authorities 
would treat Xi Yang with leniency.

"Law Drawn Up for the Management of Hunting Guns"] 
  [Text] With the approval of the State Council and the 
promulgation of the order by the Ministry of Forestry and the 
Ministry of Public Security, the "Procedures of the PRC for the 
Management of Hunting Guns" have come into force as of 1 March 
1994. 
  After the founding of new China, in order to protect 
wildlife 
in keeping with the relevant state provisions, the Ministry of 
Forestry, along with the Ministry of Public Security and the 
other relevant departments, have gradually tightened management 
on the production, sale, and use of hunting guns, thus promoting 
the development of undertakings to protect wildlife. 
  Being a special product, hunting guns can inflict 
casualties, 
however. There is not an accurate statistical figure on the 
number of hunting guns across the country, but the actual number 
of hunting guns in the hands of the people is quite 
considerable. Data from the public security departments show 
there are well over 300,000 hunting guns in Hunan Province and 
approximately 110,000 in Hainan Province. The management of 
guns used for hunting involves a wide range of issues and is 
very difficult. This, plus the lack of perfect rules and 
regulations to manage hunting guns in the past, has led to many 
problems in the production, sale, and use of these guns. There 
have been frequent cases of wanton killing and hunting of 
wildlife involving hunting guns. In 1989, the Dongfanghong 
Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province killed a male 
northwestern Chinese tiger with a refitted hunting gun. In the 
same year, Gao Guanghua and three other peasants from Mayingzi 
township in Luanping County, Hebei Province, killed a leopard 
with hunting guns in Beijing's Miyun County. 
  After conducting extensive investigation and study, the 
Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Public Security jointly 
drafted and formulated the "Procedures of the PRC for the 
Management of Hunting Guns." The promulgation and 
implementation of these procedures indicate that China has begun 
the process of institutionalizing the management of hunting 
guns. The procedures have great significance for the normal 
production, sale, and use of hunting guns and for preventing 
their use in illegal and criminal activities, for protecting 
wild life resources, and for safeguarding public order.

  [Text] Honolulu, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Finance ministers 
from the world's biggest and fastest growing economies are to 
meet here from today to explore opportunities for future 
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The meeting is to be held under an agreement reached in 
Seattle last November when leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) met for the first time. 
  Deputy finance ministers met in Honolulu earlier this month 
to work out an agenda for this week's financial meeting, the 
first of its kind. 
  The meeting is expected to address some of the challenges 
facing the region, including ensuring non-inflationary regional 
growth, financing investment and infrastructure development, and 
promoting capital market development. 
  However, no trade or investment breakthroughs are expected 
from the Honolulu talks. But some officials from APEC members 
believe that the talks will pave the way for future development. 
  In all, more than 300 representatives and aides from the 17 
APEC members have arrived here for the meeting. 
  Chile will attend the meeting as an observer, pending full 
membership next year. 
  APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Indonesia, 
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, 
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, and 
the United States. Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong joined the 
regional economic forum as regional economies. 
  Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli arrived here Friday and 
will hold bilateral talks with his counterparts from some APEC 
member states later today.

  [Text] Honolulu, March 20 (XINHUA) -- APEC [Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] finance ministers agreed here today that 
sound macroeconomic policies, stability and cross-border 
exchange would enhance economic development in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  The consensus was included in a joint ministerial statement 
on guiding policy formation of the APEC members which issued at 
the end of the ministers meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC). 
  The ministers recognized the "sound macroeconomic policies 
and stability should remain a pillar of sustained, low-inflation 
growth in the region." 
  "Increasing cross-border flows of goods, services and 
investment should be another pillar for strong economic 
performance in the region," the ministers said in the statement. 
  They also agreed that further development of capital markets 
is needed for effective mobilization and allocation of private 
and business capital. 
  The one-day meeting discussed some of the fundamental 
economic challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region, including 
sustaining growth with low inflation, financing investment and 
infrastructure development. 
  The ministers also discussed the issues of promoting capital 
and market development. It had been stressed at the meeting 
that large and growing inflows of private investment from 
external sources have been, and will continue to be crucial. 
  The ministers agreed that they will pursue policies which 
promote ongoing large and diversified inflows of foreign direct 
investment. 
  The ministers decided to meet again next year in Indonesia 
to 
consult on specific issues as well as regional economic 
development as a whole. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told a press 
conference 
after the meeting that the ministers also "agreed on the 
importance of concluding the Uruguay Round and implementing its 
results." 
  Asked about relations between China and the United States, 
Bentsen said, "I must say that U.S.- China relationship is very 
important to the United States, to China and to all of Asia." 
  The APEC finance ministers meeting was convened under the 
vision statement issued November 20, 1993, in Seattle, when the 
APEC leadership conference was held. 
  APEC accounts for over 40 percent of world trade and over 13 
trillion in output. It groups Australia, Canada, Brunei, China, 
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, 
Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, 
Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States. 
  Chile was invited to the meeting as an observer pending to 
its full membership to the organization in 1995. The 17-member 
group was founded in 1989 as a loose organization aimed at 
promoting trade, investment and economic cooperation.

<F P=106> ["APEC Dialogue Can Be Fruitful, Says U.S. Official" -- </F>
XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Honolulu, March 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Treasury 
Undersecretary Lawrence Summers expressed optimism here today 
about tomorrow's meeting of finance ministers of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries. 
  He told a press conference that "we expect very fruitful 
dialogue at the meeting", which "will cover the issue of 
maintaining growth, the issue of external finance and the issues 
connective with domestic capital market development." 
  However, Summers said that the goal is not "to reach any 
dramatic new agreement, but rather for the ministers to gain an 
understanding of each other's problems and each other's needs." 
  "This is not a form for discussion of financial services 
issues, the exchange rate or current account issues," he added. 
  Summers is here with Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen 
to attend the first APEC finance ministers meeting. 
  Before his departure for Honolulu yesterday Bentsen also 
stressed that the meeting is "an important precedent, because 
we've never all been in the same room at the same time." 
  However, during bilateral talks prior to the official 
meeting, some APEC ministers said they don't want to see the 
meeting formalized due to the diversity of development in the 
region. 
  This conference of APEC finance ministers is an outcome of 
the APEC leadership meeting in Seattle last November, hosted by 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Finance ministers participating include those from 
Australia, 
Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic 
of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United

  [Text] Geneva, March 18 (XINHUA) -- A majority of the 
countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
favor an early resumption of China's GATT membership and make it 
a founding member of a world trade organization to be set up 
early next year. 
  At the four-day 16th meeting of GATT's working party on 
China 
ending today in Geneva, most representatives hoped for an early 
conclusion of the deliberation on the issue. 
  The Chinese delegation, led by Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation Gu Yongjiang, gave the meeting 
detailed reports on China's reforms in its economic and trade 
systems. 
  The delegation also exchanged views with other 
representatives in informal bilateral consultations outside the 
sessions of the working party's meeting. 
  It is reported that the European Union has outlined a draft 
protocol on China's reentry into GATT, welcomed by the Chinese 
delegation as a "positive move," which marked the start of 
substantive talks despite some differences between the two sides. 
  Gu said at the end of the meeting that eight years had 
passed 
since China first asked in 1986 for the resumption of its GATT 
contracting status, an unprecedented length of time in the 
record of application for GATT membership. 
  Still ready to continue its efforts, he said, China will 
submit to the GATT secretariat in the near future systematic 
reports on its management of import and export, foreign 
exchange, price and tariff and non-tariff measures to show a 
full and clear picture of China's economic and trade structures. 
  The meeting did not decide when the working party will meet 
again.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Urges IAEA To Revoke Unjust Decision" -- XINHUA </F>
Headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The decision by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on their recent 
nuclear inspection is unjustifiable, an official of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said here today. 
  The DPRK Central Broadcasting Station quoted a spokesman for 
the atomic energy authority as saying that his country fully 
complied with the February 15 accord during the two-week 
inspection of seven of DPRK's nine nuclear sites which began 
March 1. 
  The results of the inspection were also adequate to verify 
that the DPRK is not developing nuclear weapons, the official 
added. 
  However, the IAEA Secretariat claimed that the inspection 
was 
conducted only in line with the nuclear security agreement and 
did not guarantee the continuity of nuclear security. The DPRK 
spokesman disagreed, and said that the IAEA has now made more 
unreasonable demands. 
  Since the DPRK has shown great flexibility by meeting all 
IAEA demands, the secretariat's reluctance to air the results, 
and threats to call a council meeting, only show that it openly 
violated the February 25 U.S.-DPRK agreement on nuclear 
inspections and has become increasingly unfair. 
  The spokesman said that unless the IAEA Secretariat revokes 
its unjust decision, it must be fully responsible for whatever 
action the DPRK may take.

  [Text] Washington, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
administration decided today to reschedule a joint military 
exercise with South Korean forces this year, an administration 
official said here today. 
  The decision came after top national security aides 
conferred 
to the President for three hours at the White House on how best 
to push the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) toward 
"a resolution that doesn't end in conflict," the official told 
reporters. 
  The U.S. agreed early this month to suspend the joint 
military exercise with South Korea known as "Team Spirit" and to 
resume formal talks with the DPRK in Geneva on March 21 after an 
international inspections began at the DPRK nuclear sites and 
the DPRK and South Korea resumed their dialogue. 
  But with the collapse of Saturday's [19 March] talks between 
the DPRK and South Korea over the issue of nuclear inspections 
and the exchange of envoys, the official said, the exercise 
"will be rescheduled" and the meeting in Geneva "won't happen" 
unless circumstances change over the weekend. 
  The United States also threatened to proceed with plans to 
send Patriot air-defense missiles to South Korea. The United 
States will consult with South Korea on timing for deploying the 
weapons, the official said.

  [Text] Moscow, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Victor Chernomyrdin said here today that Russia's participation 
in the NATO Partnership for Peace program does not necessarily 
amount to giving up its position. 
  At a news conference joined by visiting U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry, Chernomyrdin told reporters that Russia 
has accepted the NATO's partnership proposal without putting up 
any preconditions. 
  The U.S. defense secretary also pointed out that the 
partnership for peace plan would not be practical until the end 
of March, when Russia formally applies for the partnership, the 
first step toward the full NATO membership. 
  The two ministers have worked on the issue of nuclear 
weapons 
and discussed specifically the disarmament of the nuclear 
arsenal in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, reportedly the 
world's third largest. 
  Cooperation on the conversion of military industries into 
civil business and destruction of chemical weapons were also 
among the subjects they discussed, said the Russian prime 
minister. 
  Before leaving Moscow for Alma Ata, Perry and Russia's First 
Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Kokoshin signed an agreement 
on military conversion this afternoon.

XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] United Nations, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Russia differs 
with the United States openly today over the Iraq issue, saying 
that Iraq has made some progress on arms destruction and Russia 
is considering lifting oil embargo against it. 
  Russian UN Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov said today in a 
statement, Russia "noted that there had lately been certain 
positive elements in the actions of Bagdad." 
  Addressing a regular 60-day review meeting of the Security 
Council over the sanctions against Iraq, the ambassador said 
that the position of Iraq should be encouraged. 
  He added that if a thorough and comprehensive compliance of 
Iraq with its obligations is confirmed, Russia would be ready to 
consider lifting the oil embargo in accordance with relevant 
Security Council resolutions. 
  "In this connection, we pronounced ourselves in favors of 
the 
inclusion in the text of the statement by the Security Council 
president of a clause mentioning positive shifts in the Iraqi 
position," he said. 
  China, France and Russia advocated a change in a routine 
presidential statement, so as to give Iraq some encouragement 
for its positive position in arms destruction. 
  The United States and Britain opposed it, by arguing that 
many other issues should be linked to the lifting of the 
embargos.

  [Text] Alma-ata, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Kazakhstani 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev met today with visiting U.S. 
Defense Secretary William Perry to discuss arms control and 
military conversion. 
  During the meeting, Nazarbayev expressed gratitude for the 
U.S. role in helping convert his country's military 
installations into civilian use. He also welcomed the 
U.S.-Russia accord, which compensates Kazakhstan for its 
uranium, an essential material for making strategic missiles. 
  Perry and Kazakhstani Defense Minister Sagadat Nurmagambetov 
signed an agreement today on military conversion, under which 
the U.S. will grant another 15 million U.S. dollars to 
Kazakhstan, raising the amount of promised aid for this purpose 
to 70 million dollars. 
  The U.S. is invited to participate in the privatization of 
the defense industry in Kazakhstan and the conversion of 
military establishments into civil enterprises. 
  At a brief press conference after the signing ceremony, 
Nurmagambetov told reporters that the two sides have discussed 
wide-ranging military cooperation, but there is no immediate 
accord in sight. 
  Liaison will soon be established, however, to expand 
military 
cooperation, he added. 
  William Perry, on a week-long visit to four former Soviet 
republics, will next go to Ukraine and Belarus after visiting a 
renowned spaceflight center in Kazakhstan tomorrow.

  [Text] Moscow, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata arrived here today for a three-day visit 
aimed at further promoting the dialogue launched by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin during his trip to Tokyo last October. 
  In a statement upon arrival at Moscow airport, Hata said the 
aim of his visit was to reaffirm the principles of the "Tokyo 
declaration" concluded during Yeltsin's visit to Japan. 
  He said he will hold talks with his Russian counterpart 
Andrey Kozyrev on international issues, including some problems 
in regions near Japan and the Far East of Russia, a reference to 
the disputed four islands. 
  The local press expected no significant progress during 
Hata's visit on the future of the Kuril Islands, held by the 
Russians since the end of World War Two but claimed by Japan. 
The territorial dispute is the biggest outstanding bilateral 
issue between the two countries. 
  The Japanese foreign minister will also meet with Ivan 
Rybkin, chairman of the lower chamber of parliament.

an agreement on forming a Muslim-Croat federation. 
  The agreement was signed by Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman

over by President Bill Clinton. 
  "The agreement signed today offer one of the first clear 
signals that parties to this conflict are willing to end the 
violence and begin a process of reconstruction," said Clinton. 
  But the accord was signed with the absence of the Serbs, who 
control 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Clinton said that he hoped "the Serbs will join in this 
process toward peace as well." 
  Earlier, the two sides signed a proposed constitution of the 
federation and initiated the principles of confederation between 
the two republics.

  He made the remark prior to the opening of the finance

between the United States and China. 
  Bentsen said that if the United States cannot exert pressure 
on China on the issue of human rights while ensuring that there 
will not be a breakdown of relations, then "we have to explore 
other methods." 
  He said that "viewed from the economic angle, the divorce of 
the United States from China will be harmful to both countries."

  [Text] China's Finance Minister Liu Zhongli has welcomed 
signs that the United States might compromise in its dispute 
with China over human rights and said Beijing was willing to 
discuss the issue so long as it was not linked to trade. Trevor 
Wyatt reports: 
  [Begin recording] Mr Liu said the Chinese Government had 
made it very clear that it was willing to discuss human rights 
with other countries, but it did not like one country imposing 
its values and positions on this issue on the other party. The 
United States is pressing Beijing to redress alleged human 
rights abuses and has threatened to withdraw China's 
most-favored-nation trading status if does not comply. 
Washington's threat not to renew MFN when it comes up in June 
has raised the specter of a rupture in economic relations that 
would not only hurt the two countries involved, but the rest of 
the Asia-Pacific region as well. Faced with that possibility, 
the American Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said last week 
that Washington needed to rethink its strategy for dealing with 
China in order to avoid a damaging breakdown in relations. Mr 
Liu agreed and said that he had heard the remarks by Mr Bentsen 
and appreciated them. He said if human rights and trade were 
linked together, then both countries would suffer. Saying that 
trade was mutually beneficial for both nations, Mr Liu urged the 
United States to renew MFN for China without any conditions. He 
said Beijing had the support of a number of other countries for 
its stance. [end recording]

  [Text] Washington, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton indicated in Washington today that the United States can 
resolve its differences with China over certain issues. 
  Clinton made this remark when answering a question at a 
joint 
press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Asked a reporter: There is now a growing call on the United 
States not to link U.S.-Chinese trade issues to the issue of 
human rights. What is your opinion on this? 
  Clinton responded: "From a long-term point of view, I 
believe we can resolve this problem, strengthen relations 
between the United States and China, and stress our proposition 
on human rights." 
  Clinton added: "We have spent, and will continue to spend, a 
great deal of time on handling the issue of our relations with 
China. Our policy will remain as it has always been, i.e. the 
issue of human rights is important, while other issues are also 
important."

  [Text] Washington, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The White House 
said today that it was confident President Clinton's tax returns 
had been "correctly done" while he was in Arkansas as its 
governor. 
  However, it added, if more money is owed, "any amounts 
underpaid will be paid." 
  Clinton told reporters Friday [18 March] that any mistakes 
on 
his and his wife's tax returns "certainly were not 
intentional.... I don't think we owe any extra taxes, but I'm 
not sure yet." 
  His comments came amid increasing indications that the 
Clintons may have underpaid their income taxes over the past 15 
years. The records are being scrutinized as part of the special 
counsel's investigation into the Clintons' investments in the 
1980s in the Whitewater Development Corp. Inc. in Arkansas. 
  The Clintons' tax returns "have been professionally prepared 
by qualified CPA's (certified public accountants), and we have 
confidence that they were correctly done," the White House said 
in a statement. 
  "Should any facts emerge that indicate that they owe more or 
less in taxes, any amounts underpaid will be paid," the 
statement added. 
  David Kendall, the Clintons' personal lawyer, is reviewing 
the records with regard to their taxes, said a White House aide 
who declined to be named. The official added that it was too 
early to draw conclusions on whether the Clintons owe money. 
  Vincent Foster, the late deputy White House counsel and Mrs. 
Clinton's law partner in Arkansas, discovered that the 
Whitewater Development Corp., which was half owned by the 
Clintons, had not filed tax returns for three years, according 
to the March 21 "TIME" magazine.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter from Beijing: "Wang Dan Calls for </F>
Extension of Most Favored Nation Status for a Year"] 
  [Text] The mainland's most famous pro-democracy activist, 
Wang Dan, yesterday issued a statement calling on the United 
States to renew the mainland's most favored nation [MFN] status, 
adding that the United States should also exercise close 
attention to the mainland's human rights record. 
  The following is the full text of Wang Dan's "statement on 
MFN:" 
  Foreign press circles gave wide publicity to a joint 
statement issued in the names of "Zhou Tuo, Wang Dan, and Min 
Qi" on 11 March 1994. Their reports referred to a sentence on 
"strongly calling on the United States to renew China's MFN 
status." Here I would like to solemnly clarify that this remark 
on MFN, particularly the word "strongly," does not represent my 
personal stand or attitude. Thus a correction is necessary. 
  To clear up this misunderstanding, I am willing to make an 
open statement on my basic stand and attitude concerning the MFN 
status. My opinion follows: 
  1. This year the United States should renew China's MFN 
status, because if the United States abolishes China's MFN 
status, first, this could damage the economic interests of the 
Chinese people; second, this could be unfavorable to speeding up 
the introduction of market economy, whereas the vigorous 
introduction of market economy will fundamentally promote 
China's social progress; third, this could stop U.S.-Chinese 
economic relations, while facts have shown that these relations 
are effective ways to promote social progress in China; 
separation could cut off the channel for the United States to 
urge China for human rights improvement; fourth, this could 
discourage the enlightened leaders in the CPC from pursuing a 
firm reform policy and could provide a pretext for those with 
ulterior motives to hamper reform and opening up; fifth, this 
could ruin China's pro-democracy movement and aggravate the 
situation in which pro-democracy activists find themselves. 
This year is an important and crucial year in China's reform 
process. Any decision beneficial to promoting reform is wise 
and worthy of support. The international community should also 
notice that the Chinese Government has switched from refusal to 
acceptance on the human rights issue and has made some sensible 
moves on some aspects of human rights. This should also be 
encouraged. 
  2. In the meantime, it is also my opinion that MFN status 
should, naturally, be linked to the human rights issue. Not 
only is this the U.S. Government's moral responsibility in 
carrying forward global democratization process, but it is also 
a real issue of whether or not economic interests can be 
guaranteed. But there has not been a major change in China's 
human rights record--it is still quite far from the 
international community's standards. Therefore, when renewing 
China's MFN status for another year, the United States should 
also continue to maintain a close watch on China's human rights 
record and take relevant measures so that this effort will yield 
effective results. 
  In conclusion, my appeal for renewal of China's MFN status 
does not mean that there has been marked improvement in China's 
human rights record, but I am making this appeal out of 
consideration for actual needs. This is my personal analysis 
and opinion, which are not affected by my emotions. Therefore 
the word "strongly" does not represent my stand or attitude. 
  [Signed] Wang Dan, 
  [Dated] 17 March 1994.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yang Qing (2799 7230), and Zhang Huanli (1728 </F>
3562 0448)] 
  [Text] Tokyo, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said here today that Japan and China share a 
common understanding that the two countries should strengthen 
their cooperation in the future on the basis of the already 
matured Sino- Japanese relations, and with the wish to 
contribute to the future and the world. 
  Hosokawa made this statement while receiving members of a 
Chinese press delegation at the prime minister's residence on 
the eve of his visit to China. 
  Hosokawa said: "During my visit, I hope the heads of the two 
countries' governments will reaffirm this understanding so 
friendly relations will continue to develop and broaden. I 
believe the two sides will have very meaningful talks and will 
exchange views candidly [tan shuai di 0982 3764 0966]." 
  On the two countries' economic and trade ties, he said: "The 
volume of Sino-Japanese trade last year (according to Japan's 
statistics) reached $37.8 billion, or 33 fold that of 1972. If 
calculated according to the annual 10 percent growth registered 
in the last decade, the two countries' trade volume will exceed 
$70 billion in 2000 and reach $190 billion in 2010. As of the 
end of September 1993, Japanese investment in China reached 
$5.17 billion." Hosokawa maintained that Sino-Japanese economic 
exchanges not only increased quantitatively, but also changed 
qualitatively. He said: Prospects for cooperation will be very 
bright for Japan and China as partners shouldering heavy 
responsibilities in the world's economic sphere. 
  Hosokawa said he will visit Shanghai. He said people within 
economic circles in Japan and other countries are watching 
Shanghai's development very closely. He believed that Japan's 
nongovernment enterprises will continue to invest in the Pudong 
New District. Hosokawa maintained that Shanghai will play the 
leading role in China's reform and opening up. He said: "As 
far as I am concerned, being able to see the development there 
with my own eyes is of far-reaching significance." 
  In response to a reporter's question, Hosokawa said that 
northeast China is one of the key regions of Sino-Japanese 
economic cooperation because it is closely related to Japan both 
historically and geographically. He said that Dalian and other 
areas in northeast China are actively accepting Japanese 
investment, adding that he hopes northeast China will further 
strengthen its exchange and cooperation with Japan. 
  Hosokawa said: The situation in the Asia-Pacific region is 
gratifying. The rapid economic growth in this region has 
contributed to world peace and prosperity. Although it still 
has worrisome elements of instability, Japan and China can 
contribute significantly to the region's peace and prosperity 
through bilateral and multilateral cooperation. 
  Commenting on the world situation, Hosokawa noted: "In a 
sentence, there are still places where the situation is unclear 
and in a state of unrest. On the whole, the world economy is 
stagnant. Although the economic situation in the United States 
and some European countries is improving, Japan is still in an 
economic recession. China may be the only place in the world 
enjoying high growth." With respect to the political situation 
and security, he noted: There are still conflicts in the former 
Yugoslavia and Somalia. We can say that problems requiring 
solutions are piling up. Japan plans to give economic support 
to the solution of these problems. He stressed: "Within the 
scope defined by the Constitution of Peace, Japan will 
contribute more to developing multilateral international 
cooperation. Meanwhile, Japan will make greater efforts to 
ensure that diversity is respected and the world becomes a more 
stable and prosperous place." 
  Hosokawa also described his family life at reporters' 
request. He said that the five members of his family are keenly 
interested in China, his wife has visited China nearly 10 times, 
and his youngest daughter is now touring Shanghai. He said he 
likes sports, but he has been too busy for sparetime activities 
since he became prime minister eight months ago. He joked: "I 
want to become a free man as early as possible!"

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said here today that the Chinese Government attaches great 
importance to its good-neighborly friendship and 
mutually-beneficial cooperation with Japan. 
  He made these remarks during the two-hour talks with 
visiting 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse here this morning. 
  Li said looking towards the future and the 21st century, 
China will work together with the Japanese side to strengthen 
their coordination and develop their bilateral ties in all 
fields, and will make joint efforts with it for peace and 
prosperity in Asia and for turning the 21st century into a 
century of peace and development. 
  Li noted the Japan visit by General Secretary Jiang Zemin of 
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the China 
visit by the Japanese emperor and empress in 1991 has ushered 
the Sino-Japanese relations into a new phase of development. 
  Since then, Li said, high-level exchanges have increased and 
economic and trade cooperation has developed rapidly. This is 
the result of the joint efforts made by the two governments and 
peoples for a long time, and should be cherished by both sides. 
  Li said that since Hosokawa took office as prime minister, 
he 
has continued to attach great importance to Japan-China ties, 
and has devoted himself to the friendly bilateral cooperation. 
"We express our high appreciation for this," Li added. 
  The Chinese premier emphasized that China and Japan are two 
important countries in the region. After the Cold War, the 
status of Asia is rising obviously, and the impact of the 
Sino-Japanese relations has been felt beyond the scope of 
bilateral ties. 
  Hosokawa said that through joint efforts of the two 
countries, Japan-China relations have entered a new stage of 
development. The Japanese Government highly values the 
bilateral ties. 
  Japan will continue to support China's reform and open-up 
policy and modernization construction, he said. 
  In the past, Hosokawa said: "The Japanese invasion and 
colonial rule had brought intolerable sufferings to the people 
of various countries in Asia." 
  "We deeply deplore at this," he said, adding that Japan 
will, 
on the basis of the introspection of the past history, make 
continued efforts to establish its friendly ties with China and 
ties that will look towards the future. 
  Premier Li appreciated Hosokawa's position and views, and 
said, "It is our consistent stand that while taking a correct 
attitude towards history, we should also look towards the 
future." 
  "The statesmen of the two countries should have their eyes 
on 
future and the 21st century," Li said. 
  He described the rapid development of the bilateral economic 
and trade relations as an important sign that the Sino-Japanese 
ties have entered a new stage. 
  The premier said the economies of the two countries are 
mutually complementary, and the economic development of China is 
focused on energy, transportation and telecommunications in 
which Japan is strong. 
  So further growth of bilateral cooperation will have 
tremendous potential, and will benefit both countries, Li said, 
adding that industrialists and entrepreneurs of the two 
countries have a better understanding of this and have showed 
high initiative. 
  "The two governments should seize the opportunity to promote 
this trend, " he said. 
  Li and Hosokawa called on the Sino-Japanese 21st Century 
Friendship Committee to put forward proposals on how to develop 
bilateral ties with an eye on the 21st century when it holds its 
meeting this year. 
  On China's military budget, Li said that China pursues an 
independent foreign policy for peace, and has not a single 
soldier stationed abroad. 
  China is among the countries whose military budgets are the 
lowest in terms of both absolute and per-capita figures, he said. 
  China's military budget is only 52 billion yuan or over five 
billion U.S. dollars this year, he said, adding that the 
increase of the absolute military expense is mainly for 
offsetting the influence of inflation, so as to maintain the 
daily expenditure of the army and improve the life of the 
servicemen. 
  In contrast, the military budget of the United States is 
more 
than 200 billion U.S. dollars, and Japan's is over 40 billion 
U.S. dollars, he said. So any worry abroad about the increase 
of the absolute figure of China's military budget is groundless, 
he added. 
  Hosokawa expressed his understanding of this. 
  The Japanese prime minister said that the two countries both 
have responsibility for the world, and he was pleased that as 
Japan's trade with and investment in China are expanding in the 
recent years, the interdependent relations between the two 
countries have been deepened. 
  The rapid development of the Chinese economy has attracted 
worldwide attention, and has produced positive effect on the 
Japanese economy, he said, adding that the prospect for 
strengthening bilateral cooperation in various fields is bright. 
  He said that Japan would continue to support the resumption 
of China's status as a contracting party in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and take a cooperative attitude 
towards this. 
  He expressed his hope that China's status in the GATT will 
be 
restored at an early date. 
  Li thanked Hosokawa for this and appreciated his position. 
  On the fourth batch of yen loans to be offered by Japan to 
China, Hosokawa said that he had given an instruction to 
departments concerned to propose an amount of loans which would 
contribute to the Japan-China friendship in the future. 
  He reaffirmed that Japan will strictly abide by the 
principles of the Japan-China joint statement, and will not 
develop any official relations with Taiwan. 
  Li Peng expressed his appreciation for this. 
  During the meeting, the two leaders also exchanged views on 
the nuclear issue related to the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea. 
  Premier Li elaborated China's basic position, and stressed 
that the issue should be solved through dialogues and 
negotiations. 
  He said that to maintain the stability on the Korean 
peninsula would be beneficial to its neighboring countries 
including Japan and to peace and stability in the region. 
  Hosokawa said Japan also held that it is better to solve the 
issue through negotiations. 
  He expressed his worry about the current developments of the 
issue. 
  Among those present at the talks were Chen Jinhua, chairman 
of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and minister in 
charge of the State Planning Commission, Xu Dunxin, Chinese 
ambassador to Japan, and Michihiko Kunihiro, Japanese ambassador 
to China.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- An agreement on 
environmental protection between the Chinese and Japanese 
Governments was signed here today. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa attended the signing ceremony after their two-hour 
talks. 
  Signing of the accord marks that a successful Sino-Japanese 
cooperation on environmental protection over the past decade has 
made another step forward. 
  Xie Zhenhua, head of the Chinese State Bureau of Environment 
Protection, and Michihiko Kunihiro, Japanese ambassador to 
China, signed the agreement on behalf of their respective 
governments. 
  According to Xie, China and Japan started cooperation in 
environmental protection as early as in the 1980s. Since then, 
frequent visits, joint research, personnel training, joint 
scientific and technical projects have been going on between 
Chinese and Japanese technicians and environmental managers. 
  According to an exchange of notes between the two 
governments 
in 1991, the Japan donated 10.2 billion Japanese yen to China to 
set up a Sino-Japanese friendship environmental protection 
center in Beijing which is under smooth construction and due to 
be completed by the end of 1995. 
  Between 1992 and 1993, with the aid of the Japanese 
Government, the two countries carried out an investigation of 
the water pollution in Boyang Lake in east China and a 
purification program, which has achieved satisfactory results. 
  During the past few years, China and Japan also stepped up 
cooperation in regional environmental protection such as in 
northeast Asia and northwest Pacific ocean. 
  According to the new agreement signed today, the two 
countries will cooperate in the fields of prevention and control 
of air pollution, acid rain, water pollution and the disposing 
of harmful wasted gases, research in the impact of pollution to 
human health, improvement of urban environment, protection of 
ozonosphere, and protection of natural ecological environment 
and biological varieties. 
  The two sides will strengthen the exchanges of scientists 
and 
technical personnel and of technical information and data 
concerning research and development of environmental protection.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa surprised Chinese Premier Li Peng on Sunday 
[20 March] by asking China to lend Japan a pair of ibis for 
breeding, Japanese officials said. 
  Hosokawa made the request during a two-hour meeting with Li, 
the officials said. The subject of the ibis, though, was not 
originally on the agenda for the talks with the Chinese premier. 
  Hosokawa told Li there are only a pair of ibis now in Japan 
and they are too old for artificial breeding, they said. 
  He asked China to lend Japan a pair for breeding, saying he 
has heard that there are a number of captive ibis in China that 
have either artificially or naturally produced offspring, they 
said. 
  Li replied that he basically supports Hosokawa's idea but he 
will ask experts to work out such a loan, the officials said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa voiced grave concern Sunday [19 March] over 
recent situations surrounding North Korea's alleged development 
of nuclear weapons, saying the international community's 
patience is nearing its limit, Japanese officials said. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng said, however, the international 
community should try to solve the problem through patient 
negotiations, the officials said. 
  Li was also quoted as saying it is important to call on 
North 
Korea to accept complete international inspections but giving 
North Korea "what it needs" is also important, they said. 
  The Chinese premier, however, did not specify what North 
Korea needs, the Japanese officials said. 
  During a two-hour meeting at the Diaoyutai Guesthouse, 
Hosokawa said Japan has "grave concern" that inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of North Korea's 
nuclear facilities ended insufficiently despite Pyongyang's 
accord with the IAEA, and talks between Seoul and Pyongyang 
failed because of North Korea's negative stance, the officials 
said. 
  "If this problem goes as it is, the possibility of this 
problem being raised in the U.N. Security Council is becoming 
high," Hosokawa was quoted as telling Li. 
  He also said the international community's patience is 
"nearing the limit" although Japan, China, the United States and 
South Korea have held common acknowledgement that it is best to 
solve the problem through dialogue and negotiations. 
  "Looking at North Korea's stance up to now, the 
international 
community cannot but feel that it is trying to procrastinate," 
Hosokawa was quoted as saying. 
  He said it is vital to call on North Korea to accept all 
inspections by the IAEA and to exchange envoys between Seoul and 
Pyongyang. 
  Hosokawa also told Li China has an important role to play in 
conveying the mood of the international community properly to 
North Korea, the officials said. 
  Li told Hosokawa China supports nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons and also does not wish the emergence of a new nuclear- 
possessing country. 
  He said, however, that by trying to solve the problem 
patiently through negotiations "the results will naturally come 
out," the officials said. 
  "It is very important to cope with this problem by taking 
more time," Li was quoted as saying. 
  Since South Korean President Kim Yong-sam is to visit Japan 
and China next week, the problem of North Korea's alleged 
nuclear weapons is expected to be discussed among Japan, South 
Korea and China. 
  In the talks that covered a wide range of topics, Hosokawa 
referred to japan's wartime responsibilities and said he wants 
to "foster future-oriented Sino-Japanese relations" based on his 
policy speech at the Diet last August. 
  In the speech, he expressed "deep remorse and apologies for 
the fact that past Japanese actions, including aggression and 
colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for so 
many people." 
  It was the first time for a Japanese prime minister to use 
the words "aggression and colonial rule" in a policy speech in 
referring to Japan's actions during World War II. Millions of 
Chinese are believed to have died during the Sino-Japanese war 
that lasted from 1931 through 1945. 
  Li welcomed Hosokawa's remarks, telling him it was the "most 
frank and sincere attitude" he has ever heard, the officials 
said. 
  Also during the meeting, Hosokawa urged China to make its 
military spending "transparent." Li replied that china will 
make efforts to increase the transparency, they said. 
  Hosokawa also told Li that Japan is particularly interested 
in extending yen loans to projects involving environment 
preservation and agriculture, and in shifting emphasis to inland 
china from the coastal regions, they said. 
  Li expressed concern over Taiwan's "vacation diplomacy," 
alluding to Taiwan President Li Teng-hui's series of visits to 
the Philippines, Indonesa and Thailand in mid-February. 
  The Chinese premier told Hosokawa he wants Japan to cope 
with 
the matter based on the 1972 Sino-Japan joint communique that 
restored diplomatic ties between the two countries. 
  In the document, Japan endorses Beijing's position that 
Taiwan is part of China. China strongly opposes any attempt to 
create "two Chinas" and the notion of "One China, One Taiwan." 
  During the meeting, Hosokawa voiced support for China's bid 
to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, while Li 
did not openly support Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the 
U.N. Security Council, the officials said. 
  Hosokawa and Li agreed to meet again in Tokyo, they said. 
  In the cultural field, Hosokawa pledged to provide 1 million 
dollars through the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) to help preserve the Hanyuan Palace in the 
ancient capital of Xian. 
  Earlier in the day, he visited the monument to the People's 
Heroes in Tiananmen Square and placed flowers in front of the 
monument.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji had separate discussions 
with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on 
furthering Sino-Japanese relations and other issues here today. 
  According to a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jiang 
praised Hosokawa for focusing seriously on bilateral ties and 
for actively promoting Sino-Japanese friendship. He also 
expressed the conviction that Hosokawa's visit will be useful in 
enhancing the bilateral ties. 
  He noted that the rapidly developing Sino-Japanese ties over 
the past 22 years following the normalization of diplomatic 
relations between the two countries have entered into a new 
period of "all-round development." 
  Jiang said that China and Japan have their own strong and 
weak points; therefore they are partners in cooperation. "So 
long as the leaders of our two countries have a clear 
understanding on this, the two sides can surely foster a long 
and sustained relationship of mutually beneficial cooperation," 
he stressed. 
  He also believed that it is a historical trend for China and 
Japan to live in peace from generation to generation. 
  Discussing international issues, Jiang said that under the 
turbulent international situation of today, a rare chance has 
emerged in Asia, which now enjoys relative stability and fast 
economic development. 
  He continued that as the 20th century is approaching to an 
end, the leaders of the Asian countries must answer a question 
of major importance, namely, what kind of Asia will they take 
into the 21st century. 
  Jiang said that the Chinese leaders, while concentrating on 
domestic issues, will foster better coordination and cooperation 
with Japan. 
  China, Japan and other Asian countries should make joint 
efforts to keep long-term stability in the continent and to 
establish a new international order under which countries, big 
or small, rich or poor, can live in peace and deal with each 
other on an equal footing, Jiang said. 
  This is Hosokawa's second meeting with Jiang, following 
their 
meeting in Seattle last November. 
  Hosokawa told Jiang that his meetings with Premier Li Peng 
and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji show that the two sides have 
identical or similar views on many issues. 
  He said that he was confident that Japan and China will 
build 
a forward-looking relationship of long-term and stable 
cooperation. 
  Hosokawa conveyed the Japanese emperor's invitation for 
Jiang 
to visit Japan. Jiang thanked the emperor and asked Hosokawa to 
convey his good wishes to the emperor and empress. 
  Zhu Rongji met with Hosokawa and his wife and hosted a 
luncheon in their honor earlier today, thanking the Japanese 
Government and people for their hospitality accorded him during 
his recent visit to Japan. 
  Hosokawa said that he was very pleased to meet Zhu again.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa urged Chinese President and Communist Party 
leader Jiang Zemin on Sunday [20 March] not to conduct nuclear 
tests, Japanese officials said. 
  During an hourlong meeting with Jiang, Hosokawa called for 
China's active participation in the negotiations on an 
international treaty designed to impose a comprehensive ban on 
nuclear tests. 
  There was no immediate response from Jiang, however, the 
officials said. 
  Prior to the meeting with Jiang, Hosokawa talked with 
Premier 
Li Peng and voiced grave concern over recent situations 
surrounding North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons. 
  Also during the meeting with the president, Hosokawa 
reiterated his remarks on Japan's wartime responsibilities, 
referring to his policy speech made in August which expressed 
"deep remorse and apologies for the fact that past Japanese 
actions, including aggression and colonial rule, caused 
unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people." 
  Jiang told Hosokawa Japan and China should look at their 
bilateral relations from a long-term perspective. 
  The president was quoted as saying the two nations have 
common points and the two sides are "partners, not rivals," 
despite differences in the social system between Japan's 
capitalism and China's socialism. 
  Hosokawa is currently on a three-day visit to China 
beginning 
Saturday. 
  Jiang referred to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's visit to China earlier this month and said he told 
Christopher that "fighting is the beginning of becoming friends." 
  If the two sides engage in patient negotiations and confide 
in each other instead of resorting to pressure, the negotiations 
would be successful, Jiang was quoted as saying. 
  The Chinese president also said the U.S. extension of most- 
favored-nation (MFN) trade status to China will be mutually 
beneficial. 
  Washington has linked MFN extension to improvement in 
China's 
human rights record. China refuses any such linkage. 
  Jiang also told Hosokawa that patience is necessary to solve 
the problem of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development. 
  Jiang said he realizes there are expectations for China in 
helping solve the issue but that it is necessary to engage in 
"patient and fair" negotiations. 
  Jiang also brought up defense matters and said China's 
military facilities are for defense purposes and will not be 
used for aggression. 
  At the end of the meeting, Hosokawa extended an invitation 
for Jiang to visit Japan again, officials said. Jiang visited 
Japan in 1992.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa arrived in Beijing Saturday [19 March] 
afternoon and immediately began a sightseeing trip that took him 
on a subway ride and to a free market. 
  After being met at the airport by State Planning Commission 
Minister Chen Jinhua and Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, the 
prime minister was whisked away to the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse. 
  His populist tour of Beijing began almost immediately with a 
ride on the newest section of Beijing's subway, taking him from 
Fuxingmen station in the western district to the busy market 
area of Xidan near the city center. 
  Subway officials eagerly answered Hosokawa's questions as an 
empty train rolled into the station for the small entourage. 
  Security was tight at both stations, and remained so the 
rest 
of the afternoon as Chinese police made sure that no unruly 
incidents took place in front of the Japanese premier. 
  Crowds appeared curious along the entire route and didn't 
seem to be bothered by traffic inconveniences caused by the 
Hosokawa entourage. 
  Leaving Xidan, Hosokawa returned to the motorcade and was 
taken to Tiananmen Square where he climbed the rostrum 
overlooking the square and stood on the spot where Mao Zedong 
declared the beginning of the People's Republic of China in 1949. 
  After touring the Palace Museum, residence of the Yuan, Ming 
and Qing dynasties, Hosokawa retook his populist posturing while 
visiting a crowded northern Beijing free market. 
  While making inquiries into a variety of goods, including 
several varieties of rice and Chinese herbs and spices, his wife 
Kayoko Hosokawa purchased small quantities of black rice and 
some Chinese herbs. 
  Commenting on the large variety of foodstuffs, the prime 
minister lingered longest around stands selling soft-shelled 
tortoises, asking sellers about the taste and price. 
  Before leaving he stopped by a fruit stand and was offered a 
large watermelon, which he gladly accepted as the crowd of 
onlookers applauded. 
  During his sightseeing tour, there was no sign of activists 
demanding war compensation from Japan. More than a hundred such 
activists were rounded up Thursday and Friday before the visit. 
  Saturday evening, Chinese Premier Li Peng held a welcome 
banquet for Hosokawa in the Great Hall of the People. 
  The premier is expected to meet with President Jiang Zemin, 
Li and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji on Sunday.

Peng briefed visiting Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
on U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent visit to 
China at a dinner given in his honor last night, according to 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin today. 
  The spokesman quoted Li Peng as saying that both the Chinese 
and U.S. sides elaborated their respective positions on the 
most-favored nation trade status, human rights and other issues 
during Christopher's four-day visit. 
  The Chinese side held that the discussions were useful in 
helping to increase mutual understanding, Wu said. 
  Thanking Li for the detailed and all-round briefing, 
Hosokawa 
held that it is somewhat unwise to impose the western concepts 
of democracy on other countries. 
  Moreover, he said, he also fully understands Li's viewpoint 
and position on human rights, according to the spokesman. 
  Hosokawa recalled that China had played an active role for 
the adoption of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights during 
the World Conference on Human Rights last year. 
  Japan deems that it is the duty of all countries to work for 
the materialization of the basic principles and guidelines of 
the declaration, Hosokawa said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- China's Foreign Ministry 
downplayed Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's statement 
urging China to make human rights improvements Saturday [19 
March], offering a different version of the comment. 
  According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin, 
Hosokawa "expressed his view that it is not sensible for Western 
countries to impose their own values of democracy upon other 
countries." 
  "He also pointed out that various countries in the world 
should make joint efforts to realize the principles and spirit 
enshrined in the Declaration (on Human Rights)," Wu quoted him 
as saying. 
  The prime minister, however, at a press conference Sunday 
said, "I told him (Li) with the declaration on human rights the 
international community accepts human rights as a universal 
issue and each country should make efforts." 
  "I don't think China has any objections to this view," 
Hosokawa said. 
  The statement by Hosokawa came at a welcoming banquet given 
by Premier Li Peng on Saturday night after Li briefly introduced 
details of a visit to Beijing by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher earlier this month. 
  During those talks the United States insisted on the 
universality of human rights and strongly urged the Chinese to 
make improvements in the area as a condition to renew China's 
most-favored-nation trading status. 
  China, however, refused to accept linkage of human rights 
conditions to trade and lambasted the U.S. for interfering in 
China's "internal affairs." 
  Japan's Foreign Ministry had its own version of the matter, 
opting to strengthen the prime minister's statement. 
  "Prime Minister Hosokawa told Mr. Li Peng that the Japanese 
Government considers that human rights is a universal question," 
Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kishichiro Amae said. "Each 
country has to endeavor to respect human rights." 
  In a related matter, a group of Chinese calling themselves 
the "Association of Chinese Patriots" sent an open letter Sunday 
to Hosokawa urging him to place human rights and democracy on 
Japan's foreign policy agenda.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- At today's news 
conference, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin briefed 
correspondents on the Chinese leaders' meeting with Japanese 
Prime Minister Hosokawa and answered a question about human 
rights. 
  A correspondent asked: At the dinner hosted by Premier Li 
Peng in honor of Prime Minister Hosokawa, did they discuss human 
rights? 
  Wu Jianmin responded: At the dinner, on his own initiative 
Premier Li Peng briefed Hosokawa about U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher's visit to China. He quoted Li Peng as saying both 
the Chinese and U.S. Governments elaborated their respective 
positions concerning the most-favored-nation trade status, human 
rights, and other issues. China held that the discussions were 
useful in helping to increase mutual understanding. Thanking 
Premier Li Peng for the detailed and all-round briefing, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa held that it is unwise [bing bu ming zhi 1629 
0008 2494 2535] to impose Western concepts of democracy on other 
countries. Prime Minister Hosokawa said he fully understands 
Premier Li Peng's viewpoint and position on human rights. Prime 
Minister Hosokawa recalled that China had played an active role 
for the adoption of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights 
during the World Conference on Human Rights last year. Japan 
deems it the duty of all countries to work for the realization 
of the basic principles and guidelines of the declaration.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- An open letter made 
public Sunday [19 March] and addressed to Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has called on the premier to push the 
Chinese Government toward more democracy and human rights. 
  The letter, signed by a previously unheard of group called 
the Association of Chinese Patriots and sent to Japanese news 
agencies in Beijing, hails Hosokawa's visit and asks him to 
continue the efforts started last week by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher on human rights and democracy. 
  "The Chinese people have long carried in their hearts a bad 
image of the Japanese Government," the letter said. "This is 
not only because of the history of the Japanese invasion. But 
more importantly because all previous Japanese Governments have 
paid scant attention to democracy and human rights in China." 
  While blaming Japanese aggressors for killing millions of 
Chinese 50 years ago, the letter attacks China's "one-party 
dictatorship" and accuses it of allowing "tens of millions of 
unlucky Chinese citizens" to perish in a series of disasters 
brought on by the Communist Party. 
  "We sincerely hope Your Excellency Morihiro Hosokawa, who 
was 
able to end the long-term rule of Japan's Liberal Democratic 
Party, will also be able to end a Japanese diplomatic history 
which has paid no attention to human rights and democracy," it 
said. 
  During a welcoming banquet at the Great Hall of the People 
on 
Saturday, Hosokawa urged China to improve its human rights 
record, saying the international community recognizes human 
rights as a universal value. 
  Hosokawa made the call after Premier Li Peng briefed him 
about exchanges that took place between Christopher and Chinese 
leaders over human right. 
  The Japanese prime minister, who is currently on a three-day 
visit to China through Monday, met Li again and then President 
Jiang Zemin.

<F P=106> [Statement by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at a </F>
news conference with foreign and Japanese correspondents at the 
New Century Hotel in Beijing -- live, with passage-by-passage 
translation into Mandarin] 
  [Text] [Unidentified Japanese official] I am sorry for 
keeping you waiting. Please, take your seats. Now we will hold a 
news conference by Prime Minister Hosokawa. The prime minister 
will make a statement before fielding questions. 
  [Hosokawa] I would like to say a few words before fielding 
questions at this news conference. I am visiting China at the 
invitation of Premier Li Peng. During a series of meetings with 
Premier Li Peng, President Jiang Zemin, and other Chinese 
leaders, I was able to have a candid and significant exchange of 
views. I had hoped to visit China as soon as possible after I 
took office and I am very pleased to realize my visit to this 
country. I would like to express my gratitude to Premier Li Peng 
and other Chinese officials for warmly greeting me. 
  I have valued Japan-China relations as one of the most 
important pillars of Japan's foreign policy. Japan-China 
relations have entered a new stage after marking the 20th 
anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations and the 
15th anniversary of the conclusion of the peace and friendship 
treaty, and our relations have continued to make good 
development. As you know, the emperor and empress recently 
visited China. I had a candid exchange of views with Chinese 
leaders on how to develop Japan-China relations, which have 
entered the new stage, into a future-oriented relationship that 
will be able to make contributions to the world in the 21st 
century. I confirmed with Chinese leaders to strengthen 
cooperative ties between both countries. 
  I and Chinese leaders touched on many aspects of Japan-China 
relations. I believe that China's reform and open up policy has 
been contributing to peace and prosperity not only in China, but 
in the region, and Japan will provide all possible support to 
China's efforts. It will provide the fourth yen-based loan and 
cooperate with China's bid for GATT membership from the 
standpoint of Japan's intention to assist China's efforts. 
  During my stay in Beijing, Japan-China accord on cooperation 
in protecting environment was concluded and I think the 
conclusion of the accord is very meaningful as a specific 
indication of bilateral cooperation between the two countries. 
  Regarding the Japan-China economic relations, both trade and 
investment have largely expanded between the two countries in 
the past few years and I think this is a very desirable 
development and the future of relations between the two 
countries is bright. We confirmed that both Japan and China will 
continue to exert efforts for further development of our 
economic relations. 
  I and Chinese leaders confirmed the need to promote the 
exchange of youths and culture between the two countries. In 
this connection, both Japan and China have cooperated for 
preserving the Changan Palace in Chengdu, capital of Tang, which 
was a major city in the history of exchanges between Japan and 
China. 
  At the series of meetings, I and Chinese leaders affirmed 
that Japan and China will cooperate for and make vigorous 
contributions to the world peace and prosperity. Specifically, I 
think that I was able to have a candid exchange of views with 
Chinese leaders on the issue of North Korea's nuclear 
development, Japan-China cooperation in the Asian and Pacific 
region, arms control and disarmament, military moves in the 
region, and human rights. As for the issue of North Korea's 
nuclear development, during a series of meetings with Chinese 
leaders, I told them that Japan is deeply concerned over the 
insufficiency of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency and the failure of North-South working-level talks 
to reach any agreement. Since this is an important issue related 
to the security of northeastern Asia, Japan and China share the 
same [ninshiki] understanding. I believe that we were able to 
confirm the importance of having close contact with each other 
for a settlement of this issue. 
  In my speech to the Diet in August 1993 shortly after I took 
office, I expressed my feeling from the standpoint of looking at 
the past as it was. During the series of meetings with Premier 
Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin, I told them that I intend to 
further develop a future-oriented relationship with China from 
the standpoint of reflecting upon what Japan did to China in the 
past. I intend to work to develop Japan-China relations in the 
future. 
  Although my visit to China is brief, I have been able to 
witness major changes taking place in China and Chinese people 
full of confidence, and I am greatly impressed by them during my 
stay in China. I will stop tomorrow in Shanghai and am looking 
forward to touring the New Pudong Area that symbolizes China's 
reform and open up policy.

<F P=106> [News conference by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro </F>
Hosokawa with foreign and Japanese correspondents at the New 
Century Hotel in Beijing, with passage-by-passage translation 
into Mandarin -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified Japanese official] Please, will the 
designated correspondents come forth before the microphones and 
state their names. 
  [Ono] I am Ono from YOMIURI SHIMBUN. The issue of North 
Korea's nuclear development was a major item on the agenda of 
the Japan-China summit talks. The prime minister himself has 
expressed deep concern over the issue. Prime Minister, you held 
a series of meetings with Chinese leaders. I would like to ask 
you how the Chinese leaders view the present situation regarding 
North Korea's nuclear development, and how China will exercise 
its influence on North Korea. Prime Minister, you have said 
that the Japanese Government will deal with the issue of North 
Korea's nuclear development within the framework of the 
Constitution. If the issue is referred to the UN Security 
Council, and the council decides to impose economic sanctions 
against North Korea, what sort of actions will Japan take? 
  [Hosokawa] North Korea refused to allow nuclear inspections 
of certain nuclear sites by the IAEA, and as a result nuclear 
inspections by the IAEA ended insufficiently; the North-South 
working-level talks ended with no agreement being reached. I am 
deeply concerned over this situation. As for economic sanctions 
against North Korea, I would like to refrain from making any 
specific comment at this moment. As a general rule, I think if 
the UN Security Council decides to take some kind of sanctions, 
Japan for its part will also have to take responsible action. 
As regards North Korea, China is its most friendly nation, and 
my understanding is that the role to be played by China is very 
important and great. 
  [Aoyama] I am Aoyama from KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Prime 
Minister, I would like to ask you about human rights in China. 
Speaking at a welcoming banquet hosted by Premier Li Peng, you 
stressed human rights as a universal value. I assume you made 
the remark out of consideration for the positions of both China 
and the United States. Since the issue of human rights affects 
the livelihood of ordinary Chinese people, I would like to ask 
you to explain the issue of human rights in China in a manner 
that we can easily understand. I would also like to ask you if 
China needs to improve its human rights record. Prime Minister, 
what do you think of China's position regarding the Untied 
States' deamnd for improving human rights in China that it is an 
intervention of China's internal affairs? Prime Minister, you 
mentioned human rights in the welcoming banquet hosted by 
Premier Li Peng, but did not raise the human rights issue in 
China at the official summit talks. Did you not raise the issue 
out of some consideration? 
  [Hosokawa] You asked me about human rights in China. I 
would like to answer your question by explaining why I mentioned 
human rights at the banquet yesterday. Our substantial talks 
began yesterday. From the outset of the banquet yesterday, 
substantial talks without protocol have already begun. During 
the substantial talks, human rights in China was raised for 
discussion. 
  During the banquet, Premier Li Peng explained to me about 
what he and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher discussed. In 
response, I told him that each nation should make its own 
efforts to deal with the issue of human rights which has 
universal value, and I do not think China has objection in this 
respect. You asked about the issue between the United States 
and China, but I would like to refrain from commenting on it. 
  You asked if violations of human rights exist in China. I 
think you asked the question with China's recent detention of 
dissidents in mind. I also would like to refrain from making 
any comment about that. 
  [Shimada] I am Shimada from NHK. I would like to ask you 
about China's military expenses. ASEAN member nations and other 
neighboring countries of China are expressing their concerns 
about continuously growing Chinese defense budget. China is 
explaining that the inflation and other matters are the causes 
of the increase. However, some people point out that Japan's 
economic cooperation will be consequently linked to the 
expansion of or be used for defense expenses in China. Do you 
feel that the concerns were dispelled by the series of meetings? 
  [Hosokawa] The question is about the trend of China's 
military expansion. Probably, the Chinese military expenses 
grew due to the current state of its military equipment, 
inflation rate, and foreign exchange rate. Improvement of 
military personnel's living standard may be involved in it, too. 
Replacement of old military equipment was the main cause of the 
increase. I do not think it will immediately become a threat to 
Japan. At any rate, the most important thing is that China 
should make efforts to increase openness of its military 
programs and this will lead to assuring a sense of security and 
improving trust in China in the international community. I 
believe it is very important for China to disclose its military 
programs to the rest of the world. In this regard, I believe 
the Chinese leaders and I share the same understanding. 
  The reporter, who asked the question, also pointed out that 
various types of aid from Japan may be used for military 
expenses. Regarding the economic cooperation, I have candidly 
explained to the Chinese leaders that in connection with the 
outline of its recent official development assistance, the 
Japanese people are increasingly interested in China's 
increasing defense expenses. I believe that the Chinese leaders 
understood this point. 
  [Unidentified Japanese official] Three Japanese reporters 
have asked questions so far. Now, we will give Chinese 
reporters a chance to ask questions. Since all the faces look 
alike, I will ask Japanese reporters not to raise your hands. 
  [Unidentified Chinese reporter] Earlier, you referred to the 
Sino-Japanese economic ties. Judging from the recent movement, 
various European and American businesses are rapidly making 
inroads into the Chinese markets. Also, China is planning to 
build five subway systems, three bullet train systems, and the 
Sanxia dam. What are your views of these projects? Can you 
explain not as a representative of industries but as a 
politician. Also, can you tell us what kind of relations do you 
want to establish with China in the future? 
  [Hosokawa] I had discussions with Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji 
during a lunch with him this afternoon. At that time, Deputy 
Premier Zhu said that economic power of Japanese industries has 
become weak. Premier Li Peng pointed out the same thing during 
a dinner last night. I myself felt the same. I frankly told 
them what I felt when I arrived in Beijing. There are so many 
Volkswagens in Beijing. I told them that I felt Japanese 
companies may not be exerting enough efforts to sell Japanese 
cars in China and that because of that, Japanese companies may 
need to do some soul searching. Anyhow, I think Japanese 
companies need to exert efforts. 
  The amount of trade between Japan and China was about $37.8 
billion dollars last year. This is about three times as much as 
that of 1972. The amount of Sino-Japanese trade changed 
significantly each year in the last 10 years. on average, 
however, it increased by more than 10 percent each year. Amount 
of bilateral trade will exceed $70 billion in 2000 and reach 
$190 billion in 2010 if the trade between Japan and China 
continues to grow at the current rate. Deputy Premier Zhu 
Rongji said today that the amount may become more than that. 
However, the figures I have just quoted were results of 
calculations based on the current growth rate. Moreover, the 
total amount of Japanese investments in China was $5.170 billion 
as of the end of September last year. More than third of that 
amount was invested after 1992. This tells us that the scale of 
economic relations between the two countries is larger than 
bilateral ties between any other countries in the world. I 
believe that it will be very important for both countries to 
maintain such large trade relations. 
  Economic relations between Japan and China have changed from 
vertical ties [suichoku kankei] of the past to horizontal 
cooperative ties [suiheiteki kyoryoku kankei]. Both countries' 
ties with international economy became stronger than before. It 
is very important for Japan and China to promote cooperation as 
responsible partners for the world economy. I am confident that 
the future of economic relations between Japan and China will be 
bright. 
  [Reporter] I am Sun Dongmin from RENMIN RIBAO. I would like 
to ask about relations between China and Japan. The purpose of 
your visit to China is to foster future-oriented relations 
between the two countries. It is often said that answering the 
question on how to handle and perceive historical problems 
between the two countries is the starting point to establish 
friendly ties. To establish future-oriented relations, how 
should the two nations handle historial problems? Or how should 
they make efforts to resolve them? I would like to ask you 
about these. 
  [Hosokawa] When I took office last August, I disclosed my 
views on historical problems between the two countries in my 
inaugural speech to Diet. At my meetings with Premier Li Pend 
and President Jiang Zemin, I said that I will make further 
efforts to nurture future-oriented bilateral ties on the basis 
of self-examination of the past history. In response, the 
Chinese leaders expressed their approval. I am fully aware that 
Chinese people still have negative feeling. As I said at the 
outset, I have been talking about this feeling since last year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa pledged further economic commitments Sunday 
[20 March] to support China's liberalization and reforms. 
  Japan will push forward its already promised loans, support 
China's membership in an international trade body and take 
further measures to facilitate investment by Japanese companies, 
Hosokawa said at a news conference after meeting Chinese leaders. 
  Hosokawa held separate talks with Premier Li Peng and 
President Jiang Zemin on the second day of his three-day 
official visit to China. 
  "It is important for Japan and China to cooperate as 
responsible partners in international society," he said, 
predicting the two nations would realize "an unprecedentedly 
big" bilateral trade relationship in the world. 
  Hosokawa renewed his pledge to extend a fourth package of 
yen-denominated loans. 
  Hosokawa brushed aside concern that Japan's economic aid 
might have been used for China's military spending that is 
recently on the rise. 
  "I don't think it (higher military outlays) will become an 
immediate threat," he said. 
  Hosokawa said Japan's official development assistance is 
based on stern scrutiny and China's increased defense spending 
reflected recent high inflation, currency exchange and other 
technical factors as well as improved living standards for 
military personnel. 
  But Hosokawa said he urged China to make its military plans 
transparent for "international relief." 
  Hosokawa said Japan will support China becoming a member of 
the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an 
international organization to oversee free trade. 
  Meanwhile, Hosokawa faced criticism from the Chinese press 
over Japan's low-key, private-level direct investment compared 
with recent active entry by U.S. and European firms. 
  Hosokawa said the visit made him recognize that Japan 
"lacked 
efforts." 
  "I just wondered why Volkswagen cars were notable on the 
streets in Beijing," Hosokawa said. 
  But he said trade between Japan and China has increased 
steadily at an average annual pace of 10 percent. 
  Last year, Japan-China trade totaled 37.8 trillion dollars, 
jumping 33 times over the level in 1972, when the two countries 
restored diplomatic ties, Hosokawa said. 
  He said bilateral trade is expected to reach 70 billion 
dollars in 2000 and 190 billion dollars in 2010. 
  Hosokawa said President Jiang also showed a stronger outlook 
for bilateral trade.

<F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa reiterated strong concern Sunday [20 March] 
about North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, 
saying Japan plans to take "responsible" action if the matter is 
brought to the U.N. Security Council. 
  Hosokawa told a news conference he expressed "strong 
concern" 
in talks with Chinese leaders that the inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency ended insufficiently and the 
dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang failed. 
  He refused to comment on specific actions Japan will take if 
the issue is brought to the Security Council. 
  "But generally speaking, if some kind of action is decided 
at 
the U.N. Security Council, Japan will consider a responsible way 
to cope," Hosokawa said. 
  He said China plays an important role because it has deep 
relations with North Korea and he strongly urged the Chinese 
Government during talks with the Chinese leaders to play a major 
role in solving the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  Hosokawa, currently on a three-day visit to China which 
started Saturday, held talks with President Jiang Zemin and 
Premier Li Peng prior to the press conference at the Beijing New 
Century Hotel. 
  He said he could have "frank discussions" with the Chinese 
leaders on issues such as North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons, Japan-China cooperation in the Asia-Pacific 
region, disarmament, arms control and human rights. 
  Hosokawa said he wants to build future-oriented relations 
with China based on Japan's remorse for its wartime actions. 
  In talks with Li earlier in the day, Hosokawa referred to 
his 
policy speech in August in which he expressed "deep remorse and 
apologies for the fact that past Japanese actions, including 
aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and 
sorrow for so many people." 
  Li welcomed Hosokawa's remarks, telling him it was the "most 
frank and sincere attitude" he has ever heard, according to 
Japanese officials. 
  The prime minister told the news conference he agreed with 
the Chinese leaders that the two nations will make efforts to 
further develop economic and diplomatic relations between the 
two sides. 
  Hosokawa said he did not think the Chinese leaders have 
"objections" to his view that human rights are a "universal 
value recognized by the international community." 
  He declined to comment, though, on a row between China and 
the United States over China's human rights record. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who visited 
China earlier this month, urged China to improve its human 
rights record as a condition for extending most-favored-nation 
trade status with Beijing. 
  Hosokawa also declined to comment on specifics, such as the 
treatment of pro-democracy activists. 
  In talks with Li on Saturday, Hosokawa called for 
improvement 
in China's human rights record by referring to a declaration 
adopted at an international conference on human rights held last 
June in Vienna. 
  The declaration notes that promotion and protection of human 
rights are legitimate items for concern for the international 
community.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said here today that Japan will 
develop its relations with China with an eye on the future and 
on contributions to the world. 
  He made the remarks at a press conference here this 
afternoon. 
  During his current visit, he said, he exchanged views with 
Chinese leaders frankly and meaningfully. 
  Hosokawa said that he has always regarded Japan-China 
relations as one of the most important pillars of Japan's 
relations with foreign countries and have attached great 
importance to them. 
  He described the bilateral relations as having entered a new 
period of development. 
  He said the two countries have developed their relations 
very 
well. 
  "China's reform and opening policy is of great significance 
not only to China itself, but also to peace and prosperity in 
this region," he said, "so we should support it as far as 
possible." 
  The two countries will continue their cooperation on the 
fourth batch of loans offered by Japan to China and on the 
restoration of China's status as a signatory party to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Hosokawa said. 
  The signing of the agreement on environmental protection 
cooperation between the two countries during the visit is a 
concrete move to strengthen the bilateral cooperation in this 
area, he noted. 
  Recent years have witnessed great expansion of the bilateral 
trade and Japanese investment in China, said the Japanese prime 
minister, adding that he was pleased to see the broad prospects 
for further development in the economic relations and trade 
between the two countries. 
  The prime minister said that the two sides reaffirmed the 
necessity to expand cooperation in culture. He said that the 
two sides have decided to cooperate in protecting the Kaiyuan 
Palace, a famous ancient Chinese building constructed in the 
capital of Tang Dynasty, Changan city (now Xian city, capital of 
northwest China's Shaanxi Province). 
  Hosokawa said that the two sides have agreed to further 
their 
cooperation in order to make positive contributions to world 
peace and prosperity. 
  The leaders of two countries also frankly exchanged views on 
the nuclear issue of the Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK), 
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, military budgets and 
disarmament and human rights, he said. 
  Hosokawa said that Japan and China shared the view that the 
DPRK nuclear issue is an important one that concerns the safety 
of northeast Asia and the two sides promised to keep close 
contacts with each other in order to solve the problem. 
  The Japanese prime minister reaffirmed Japanese serious 
attitude toward history, saying that Japan will make greater 
efforts to develop Japan-China relations with an eye on the 
future on the basis of introspection of the past. 
  He said that he saw with his own eyes the great changes that

  [Text] Shanghai, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, concluding his official China visit, 
left here for home by special plane this afternoon. 
  Before departure, the prime minister said that both Japan 
and 
China should further enhance friendly cooperation, adding that 
the expansion of economic cooperation between the two countries 
would push forward the world economy. 
  He noted that China plays an important role in the 
development of the world economy. 
  Hosokawa said that although his China tour was short, he had 
been impressed by the country's booming economic development. 
  He expressed the belief that more Japanese entrepreneurs 
would invest in China. 
  Among those seeing Hosokawa off at the airport were Chen 
Jinhua, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee 
and minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, and 
Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai. 
  This morning, Hosokawa and his party toured the Yangpu and 
Nanpu Bridges in Shanghai and the Pudong New Area, an economic 
development zone in the eastern part of the city, where he hoped 
more Japanese investment would be engaged. 
  The mayor of Shanghai hosted a luncheon in honor of Hosokawa 
and his party.

<F P=106> [By John Kohut] </F>
  [Text] Chinese police defused a potentially explosive 
protest yesterday by detaining more than 100, mainly elderly 
people, as they attempted to demonstrate against Japan on the 
eve of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's arrival in Beijing 
today, according to witnesses and sources close to the protest. 
Scores of elderly people, some in their 80s, seeking reparation 
for Japan's occupation of China during the 1930s and 1940s, 
began descending upon the Japanese embassy in Beijing just after 
it opened yesterday morning. 
  The authorities had apparently been tipped off about the 
protest and surrounded the embassy with about three dozen 
uniformed policemen and several times that many plain-clothes 
police. 
  Protesters from across the country were supposed to converge 
on the embassy at 10 am, but they started arriving much earlier 
and were bundled off into jeeps and taken to a police station 
near the embassy, according to the sources. They said some 300 
petitioners appeared at the embassy and more than 100 were taken 
away by police. Some of the protesters detained were carrying 
letters addressed to Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
  Gao Minke, 82, who works in a hospital in southern China, 
wrote in a protest letter that Japan should apologise for war 
crimes and compensate relatives of the victims. Mr Gao, who was 
detained, said he lost more than 10 relatives at the hands of 
Japanese soldiers in a rural part of Jiangsu Province in 1938. 
An estimated 10 million Chinese died during the occupation. 
  Others tried to deliver copies of a letter signed by the 
Preparatory Committee of Chinese Civilians Seeking Reparations 
from Japan saying "problems left over by Japan's war of 
aggression have not been solved". "We representing 500,000 
living sufferers and relatives of the dead victims, resolutely 
request that you give a formal apology to the Chinese people and 
a definite reply to the reparation demands of the Chinese 
civilian victims," the letter to Mr Hosokawa said. 
  Police also intercepted more than 100 protesters at a train 
station in the southern part of the city, the sources said. 
  Tong Zeng, a researcher in his 30s who has been one of those 
behind the movement for Chinese civiliansto get billions of 
dollars in war reparations, was reportedly taken into custody 
yesterday. When contacted last night, his family said: "He is 
out and will be away for a few days ... They have taken him 
away." 
  Those detained came from as far afield as Hubei, Jiangsu, 
and 
Zhejiang in the south and Liaoning Province in the northeast. 
Most were in their 60s and 70s. It was not clear whether they 
were still being held last night. "They didn't really 
understand why they were detained. They thought, they were just 
delivering a letter and expressing their opinion. It's totally 
legal," said a source close to the protest. 
  Diplomats inside the embassy said they were unaware of the 
protesters' presence. 
  China gave up all claims to war reparations from Japan when 
the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1972. 
Still many ordinary Chinese believe their government was wrong 
to do so. During this session of the National People's Congress, 
32 representatives from the province of Hubei presented a war 
reparation proposal to the motions department of the 
rubber-stamp parliament calling for a Japanese apology and 
reparations. The delegates argue that while their government 
has given up its rights to reparations, there is nothing in any 
accord with Japan which rules out civilian compensation. The 
delegates and followers of the preparatory reparations committee 
demand US$180 billion in compensation. 
  Mr Hosokawa is expected to meet Prime Minister Li Peng 
today, 
and President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji tomorrow.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 KYODO -- A group of 500 Chinese 
intellectuals sent an open letter to the ongoing National 
People's Congress (NPC) on Monday [21 March] demanding the 
release of war compensation activists detained by Chinese 
security authorities. 
  The letter says more than 100 victims of Japanese aggression 
during World War II were detained Friday in front of the 
Japanese Embassy in Beijing, a day before Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa arrived in China for a three-day official 
visit. 
  "According to eye witnesses, there were no marches, 
demonstrations, petitions, sit-ins, shouting or similar 
disturbances. On the contrary, they expressed themselves 
peacefully and had an orderly attitude," said the letter, 
describing the activists. 
  "All were crippled after receiving injuries and being forced 
to labor for the Japanese Army during the time of the Japanese 
invasion," it said. "The oldest is 85 and the youngest is 56." 
  The letter also called for the release of Tong Zeng, a 
leader 
of the compensation movement, who since 1992 has received 
support from NPC delegates on the matter of demanding 
compensation from the Japanese Government, it said. 
  Sources close to the movement said the 100 elderly activists 
were released and sent home Sunday evening, but that Tong's 
whereabouts were still unknown. 
  Tong's wife also made inquiries into her husband's 
whereabouts, but was told by police that nothing was known of 
his case, the sources said. 
  Police took Tong from his home Friday morning after he 
refused to follow orders of his work unit to leave Beijing 
during the Hosokawa visit, they said. 
  A group of 32 NPC delegates at the ongoing session of the 
NPC, China's legislature, earlier filed a motion demanding 
compensation for civilian victims of the war from Japan and a 
formal apology by Hosokawa, but the motion has reportedly been 
shelved by central authorities. 
  Informed sources said the Movement for War Compensation is 
potentially huge as elderly Chinese still harbor rage at the 
Chinese Government's agreement to give up demands for war 
reparations from Japan as stated in the 1972 Sino-Japanese joint 
communique which restored diplomatic ties between the two 
countries. 
  Police have singled out Tong because of a letter, forged 
with 
Tong's signature and sent to thousands of victims calling them 
to come to Beijing during Hosokawa's visit, one source said. 
  The one-page letter, which also urges the NPC to make 
security departments apologize, is accompanied by seven pages of 
names of mostly elderly Chinese intellectuals. 
  "The play in front of the Japanese Embassy and acted out by 
public security organs was utterly outrageous, ridiculous and 
lamentable," the letter said. "This is very incomprehensible 
and has left us outraged."

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 KYODO -- China's Public Security 
Bureau released more than 100 Chinese protesters late Sunday 
night [20 March] after detaining them for two days for demanding 
war compensation from Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, 
informed sources said Monday. 
  The protesters, including now elderly victims of Japan's 
wartime aggression, were taken into custody Friday on the eve of 
Hosokawa's arrival in Beijing for an official visit to China. 
  Many of the elderly came to the Chinese capital by train 
from 
Hebei and Jiangsu Provinces, the sources said, adding they will 
be turned over to the Beijing offices of their home provinces. 
  The sources said Tong Zeng, leader of the unofficial victims 
of Japanese War Crimes Reparations Committee, was still in 
police custody Sunday. He was arrested Friday morning. 
  They said a petition drive to win Tong's freedom is under 
way 
among Chinese intellectuals in Beijing. 
  In a welcoming banquet speech on Saturday, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa called on China to improve its human rights record, 
saying human rights are a universally accepted value. 
  The Chinese Government has been sensitive about demanding 
war 
compensation for civilian casualties from Japan reportedly 
because it is afraid it could damage favorable official ties 
that include as much as 1.2 trillion yen in loans.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident Bao Ge 
was detained for questioning Monday in Shanghai just after 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa arrived there. 
  Bao, 31, had recently written a letter asking Japan to 
apologize and pay war reparations for crimes committed during 
the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese War. Bao was detained at about 10 
a.m. (0200 GMT) by several police officers when he left his 
home, a close associate said. He had been under constant 
surveillance for three days, since Hosokawa arrived in China, 
the source said. 
  A resident of Shanghai, Bao fought for years for war 
reparations from Japan and has already been to prison several 
times for this reason. He is also a democracy movement 
activist. Last Thursday, he published a letter in which he 
directly addressed the Japanese prime minister, asking him to 
apologize and to pay war reparations. 
  On Friday, several elderly Chinese were detained for 
questioning when they tried to protest in front of the Japanese 
embassy in Beijing. 
  Hosokawa ended his visit to China Monday in Shanghai. During 
the visit, he recalled that he had, at the time he took office 
last August, apologized for the crimes committed by the Imperial 
Japanese Army in China. China officially gave up its demands 
for war reparations in 1972.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The eighth working- 
level contact between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK) and South Korea closed unfruitfully at Panmunjom today, 
without setting a date for the next round of contact. 
  The eighth contact held at the truce village was designed to 
arrange for inter-Korea exchange of special envoys, but it only 
lasted for one hour, the shortest of the eight contacts made 
thus far. 
  Pak Yong-su, head of the DPRK delegation, told reporters 
after the talks ended that the major cause leading the contact 
to failure was the south's "sudden change in its attitude". 
  The south side declared that it would "take a strong 
position" against the north, restore the suspended Team Spirit 
'94 joint military exercises with the United States, advance 
with its plan on the deployment of "Patriot" missiles in the 
south, and take part in international sanctions against the 
DPRK, Pak said. 
  This showed that the south side did not intend to realize an 
inter-Korean exchange of envoys, the chief DPRK negotiator said. 
  He added that the north side had demanded the south change 
its tough position, but had received no response.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 21 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said today it will not send a 
delegation to Geneva for the third round of U.S.- DPRK 
high-level talks because of the U.S. violations of their New 
York agreement. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement that DPRK 
had honestly fulfilled its obligations by receiving the 
inspection group of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
and providing all conditions for their inspections. 
  The DPRK has also held several rounds of working contacts 
with South Korea on an early exchange of envoys. 
  However, the statement said, the United State has fulfilled 
none of its obligations specified in the New York agreement 
reached on February 25. 
  The United States has threatened to resume the "Team Spirit" 
joint military exercises with South Korea in 1994 if the DPRK 
refuses more nuclear inspections and envoy exchange. In 
addition, the U.S. will not attend the Geneva talks and will 
present the nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council. 
  The statement accused the United States of trying to isolate 
and stifle the DPRK through the Geneva talks. 
  The statement added that under such circumstances, the DPRK 
will neither regard it as its obligation to ensure the 
continuity of nuclear safety nor send a delegation to the Geneva 
talks. 
  The statement said if the United States continues to 
exercise 
power politics and exert pressure on DPRK, DPRK will have no 
alternative but finally withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign

impossible for the rice exported to Japan to go moldy before 
shipment. 
  Wu made the remarks when asked to comment on a report in the 
Japanese media that China exported moldy rice to Japan. 
  He said that the Chinese State Administration for the 
Inspection of Import and Export Commodities had re-examined the 
samples of the rice exported to Japan before shipment and 
established that there was nothing wrong. 
  The spokesman noted that officials from the Japanese 
Ministry 
of Agriculture and Fisheries also admitted that the 
responsibility of the rice going moldy was not on the Chinese 
side and that the Japanese press reports had over-exaggerated 
the incident.

implementation of the 1993 National Economic and Social 
Development Plan and the draft plan for 1994, the report on the 
implementation of the 1993 state budget and the draft budget for 
1994, and the work reports of the Supreme People's Court and the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate. The session noted: Over the 
past year, people of various nationalities in our country have 
fully implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and have triumphantly advanced along the path of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our country 
has enjoyed economic development, political stability, national 
unity, and social progress, achieving significant results in 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization as well as 
creating new prospects in all fields of work. The government 
work report realistically summed up the work carried out by the 
government over the past year. The basic principles guiding the 
work in 1994, and the various key tasks outlined in the 
government work report, are feasible and inspiring. CPPCC 
members who attended the session expressed concern about some 
current salient contradictions and problems such as the 
overextended scale of investment in fixed assets, substantial 
price increases, the relatively weak status of agriculture as 
the foundation of the national economy, production and 
management difficulties in some state-owned large and medium 
enterprises, problems that merit attention in spiritual 
civilization, various corrupt practices, and the poor state of 
public order in some localities. They enthusiastically offered 
their opinions and suggestions, and expressed the hope the 
government would take strong measures to solve them in earnest. 
  The session noted: Realizing the great cause of reunifying 
the motherland in accordance with the principles of "peaceful 
reunification and one country, two systems" represents the 
common aspiration of all Chinese people, including the 
compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao as well as Chinese 
nationals residing abroad. People from various parties and mass 
organizations attending the CPPCC session, as well as people of 
all nationalities and from all circles, firmly support the 
various preparations made by our government to ensure a smooth 
change of government and a smooth transition in Hong Kong and 
Macao in accordance with the basic laws of the Hong Kong and 
Macao Special Administrative Regions and with the relevant 
resolutions made by the NPC and its Standing Committee. They 
also firmly support our government's solemn stand on resuming 
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule, and on 
maintaining Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. The 
session firmly opposed all attempts at or actions of splitting 
the motherland, expressing the hope that differences between the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait would be solved through increased 
contacts and consultation in accordance with the principle of 
one China. We pin our hopes on the Taiwan authorities, 
especially on the people of Taiwan. 
  The session maintained: 1994 is vitally important for our 
country's advancement of reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization. We must steadfastly follow the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the CPC's basic line; fully 
implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; 
expedite the pace of building a socialist market economic 
structure; and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development in the national economy. We must also strengthen 
democracy, the legal system, and socialist spiritual 
civilization; maintain political stability; and promote overall 
social progress. The overall task of the entire country is to 
seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote 
development, and maintain stability. All kinds of work in 
people's consultation should submit to and serve this overall 
task. 
  The session urged: All units involved in people's 
consultation, CPPCC organizations at all levels, and CPPCC 
members should raise the banner of patriotism and socialism and 
follow the principles of "long-term coexistence, mutual 
supervision, treating each other with all sincerity as well as 
sharing weal and woe." They should earnestly implement the 
guidelines of the current session, conscientiously improve 
people's consultation and democratic supervision while taking 
economic construction as the central task; actively participate 
in the administration and discussion of state affairs; and keep 
forging ahead in an uplifted, pioneering, and arduous spirit so 
as to make fresh contributions to socialist modernization and 
the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The 12-day Second 
Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) ended here today after 
adopting a resolution calling for CPPCC work to better serve the 
general task of the Chinese Communist Party and the government. 
  The resolution calls on CPPCC organizations at various 
levels 
to take an active part in political consultations and democratic 
supervision, involve themselves in the discussion and management 
of state affairs, and make new contributions to the country's 
modernization and the peaceful reunification of the country. 
  All kinds of work of the CPPCC, the resolution says, should 
be subordinate to and serve the country's general task of 
"seizing development opportunities, deepening reform, opening 
China wider to the outside world, promoting development and 
maintaining stability." 
  Present at the closing meeting were Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the CPPCC National Committee, vice chairmen of the committee, as 
well as party and government leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao 
Shi, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren. 
  The meeting was presided over by Wu Xueqian, vice chairman 
of 
the CPPCC National Committee and was attended by 1,762 members 
of the CPPCC National Committee. The meeting elected two new 
vice chairmen, seven new Standing Committee members and a new 
secretary- general for the current National Committee. 
  The two new vice chairmen are Zhu Guangya, president of the 
Chinese Association of Science and Technology, and Wan Guoquan, 
vice chairman of the China Democratic National Construction 
Association. Zhu Xun, minister of geology and mineral resources, 
was elected the new secretary-general. 
  The session expressed satisfaction over the work of the 
CPPCC 
National Committee in the past year, approved its work 
arrangements for this year, and adopted a revised constitution 
of the CPPCC, which takes effect as of today. 
  The session received 1,893 proposals, of which 1,851 will be 
delivered to relevant party and government departments for 
handling. 
  In his closing speech, Li Ruihuan said CPPCC should improve 
the system of multi-party cooperation and political 
consultation, which is the main form of China's socialist 
democracy, and make it more effective. 
  He said publicly-acknowledged practices and experiences that 
are of universal significance and embody the principle of people 
being masters of the country should be incorporated in China's 
political system by legal means so that they become 
commonly-abided rules in the political life of the society. 
  A fairly complete legal system should be established in 
China, he said. This is to make sure that systems and laws do 
not change with changes of leadership or with changes in the 
views and attention of leaders, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, a top 
Chinese leader, said today it is both necessary and possible to 
promote progress in socialist democracy vigorously and steadily. 
  Addressing the Second Session of the Eighth National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC) that closed here today, Li said developing 
socialist democracy is an important part of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. 
  It is also a common task for the Communist Party of China 
(CPC) and various democratic parties, and constitutes a 
prerequisite for stepping up China's economic construction and 
restructuring, said Li, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. 
  "Without democracy, it would be impossible to fully arouse 
people's initiative or realize broad-based unity; and without 
democracy, there would be neither socialism nor socialist 
modernization," he said. 
  Li, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political 
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, noted that as democracy is 
historical, specific and relative, it will be certainly subject 
to restraints by economic, political and economic factors in 
society. 
  Therefore, progress in democracy cannot deviate from the 
reality or transcend historical stages, he added. 
  Seeking democracy by neglecting specific conditions will not 
only make it impossible to achieve the objective of developing 
democracy, but also produce adverse effects on economic growth 
and social stability, he said. 
  According to Li Ruihuan, China is currently deepening 
reforms 
and establishing a socialist market economic structure, while 
the people are steadily improving their cultural standards and 
enhancing their sense of becoming involved and competition 
concepts. 
  All this has made it possible to promote progress in 
democracy, he noted. 
  He said that studying the development of modern Chinese 
democratic politics must proceed from conditions in China, be 
based on the reality of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and be guided by the fundamental tenets of 
Marxism. The fundamental task of socialism is to liberate and 
develop productive forces. 
  "This point of view influences and decides many aspects in 
China, including the development of democratic politics," he 
said. 
  The essence of socialist democracy is to let people be 
masters of their country. 
  Therefore, positive and steady development of socialist 
democratic politics must always adhere to the principle of doing 
everything for the people and always depending on the people, he 
added. 
  It is necessary to observe people's feelings carefully, 
learn 
their wishes timely, and do real things for them unswervingly. 
"We should be good at pooling people's wisdom, fully respect 
their initiatives and voluntarily accept their supervision. We 
should cultivate a democratic style of work, boost the sense of 
democracy, create and accumulate the experience of developing 
democratic politics through close links with the people," he 
said. 
  Li Ruihuan called for combining development of democracy 
with 
that of a legal system. It is necessary to legalize and 
systemize practices and experiences which are recognized by the 
public as having universal significance and which reflect the 
principle of people being masters of the country. 
  It is necessary to establish a sound legal system so that 
systems and laws will not change with a change of leadership or 
with a change of the views and attention of leaders, he said. 
  It is necessary to maintain the authority of laws, help 
people better protect their rights and interests according to 
law, stop and punish any deeds that infringe upon people's 
democratic rights, and ensure that people enjoy all their 
democratic rights, he said. 
  Li said that the National People's Congress system and the 
Communist Party-led multi-party cooperation and political 
consultation system are the main forms of China's socialist 
democracy, which must be adhered to and improved. At the same 
time, various democratic forms must be established and improved 
at the grassroots level to enable people to play their role as 
masters of the country in grassroots-level social and political 
life. 
  In short, Li summarized, "Based on national conditions, we 
must absorb and borrow all achievements of human civilization 
and make every effort to develop a socialist democracy with 
Chinese characteristics, which carries forward our fine 
traditions, has features of the times, reflects the basic tenets 
of socialism and meets the requirements of a socialist market 
economy."

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Li Ruihuan at the closing ceremony of </F>
the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on 19 
March 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Mar (XINHUA) -- Fellow CPPCC members 
and comrades: 
  Thanks to the joint efforts of all CPPCC members, the Second 
Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee has successfully 
completed its tasks in accordance with the planned agenda. The 
session examined and approved the work report delivered by Vice 
Chairman Ye Xuanping on behalf of the Eighth National CPPCC 
Committee Standing Committee, as well as the "Constitution of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
(Amendment)." It elected additional leading CPPCC National 
Committee members. CPPCC members attended the Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress as non-voting delegates, 
and heard and discussed Premier Li Peng's government work report 
and other important reports. Displaying a highly responsible 
spirit, they offered many excellent opinions and suggestions 
regarding reform, opening up, modernization, and major issues 
that affect the vital interests of the broad masses of people. 
The session was democratic, realistic, united, and motivational. 
<H5>  I. </H5>
  During the past year, people of all nationalities throughout 
the country seriously implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress; continued to advance along the course charted 
by Comrade Deng Xiaoping for building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; and scored new and tremendous achievements in 
reform, opening up, and modernization. During the past year, 
the CPPCC accommodated the new situation, carried forward its 
fine tradition, strengthened itself, and actively performed its 
various functions, thereby making new progress in all fields of 
work. CPPCC members earnestly studied Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; deepened their 
understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; further enhanced their awareness and initiative 
in fully implementing the basic line during the initial stage of 
socialism; conducted special investigations and studies on major 
issues regarding material and spiritual civilization; and scored 
a number of significantly valuable achievements. They also made 
great efforts to publicize and implement the principles of 
"peaceful reunification and one country, two systems"; carried 
out a great deal of useful work in promoting the great cause of 
reunifying the motherland; actively fostered friendly contacts 
with other countries; enhanced friendship and cooperation 
between people in our country and in other parts of the world; 
strengthened CPPCC organs; and enlivened the work of various 
special committees under the CPPCC National Committee. Our work 
commanded widespread attention in all social sectors and 
generated extensive interest among people living abroad, 
demonstrating the CPPCC's important status and unique 
superiority in the country's political life. The work carried 
out by the current term of the CPPCC got off to a good start, 
laying the foundation for the work over the next four years. 
  This year is of vital importance to our country's reform, 
opening up, and modernization. In his "government work report," 
Premier Li Peng explicitly expounded the principles and tasks 
regarding this year's economic construction and the drive for 
deepening reform. It should be noted that the completion of 
these tasks is of paramount importance to fully implementing the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to 
establishing a socialist market economic structure; to solving 
deep contradictions in economic life; to maintaining sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development in the national economy; to 
maintaining political stability; and to promoting overall social 
progress. 
  It should be noted that there are bound to be many problems 
and difficulties in the course of accomplishing these tasks: 
during the transition from an old economic structure to a new 
one, new contradictions are frequently found intermingling with 
old ones, and new advantages often come with new disadvantages; 
the timing, intensity, and implementation of new reform measures 
are often subject to various restraints; and it is usually 
difficult to accurately anticipate what chain reaction 
readjustment of the pattern of interest sharing will trigger. 
It should also be noted that there are many favorable 
conditions for the accomplishment of these tasks: Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics has been firmly established as our guidance; the 
publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping has provided us a powerful ideological weapon; 
thanks to reform, opening up, and the modernization drive in the 
past decade or more, China's economic structure has undergone 
profound changes and our overall economic strength and national 
strength are growing at an unprecedented rate; a broad-based 
consensus has taken shape among the people on the question of 
establishing a socialist market economic system and our ability 
to stand the impact of reform has improved markedly; leading 
cadres at all levels have constantly intensified their 
understanding of reform, development, and stability and their 
experience in solving complex issues is growing by the day; 
peace and development remain the two principal themes of the 
present-day world and the international situation is, on the 
whole, favorable to us. The overall task for the whole nation 
this year is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up 
wider, promote development, and maintain stability. Work in all 
quarters and all sectors must be subordinated and serve this 
overall task. The CPPCC must find its proper place in this 
overall task, give full play to its strong points, and make even 
greater contributions. 
<H5>  II. </H5>
  Developing socialist democracy is an important part of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is also a 
common task for the CPC and various democratic parties, and 
constitutes a prerequisite for stepping up China's economic 
construction and restructuring. Without democracy, it would be 
impossible to fully arouse people's initiative or realize 
broad-based unity; and without democracy, there would be neither 
socialism nor socialist modernization. It is provided in the 
PRC constitution, the CPC constitution, and the constitutions of 
the democratic parties that we must work hard to turn China into 
a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and 
modern socialist country. In his government work report, 
Premier Li Peng pointed out we must build socialist democracy 
and the legal system and called for making new progress in 1994 
in this regard. The CPPCC represents a major organizational 
form giving play to China's socialist democracy. Over the years, 
it has accumulated useful experience in building democracy. 
Under the new historical conditions, we must continue our 
in-depth exploration, improve our work, and giving greater play 
to our role. 
  As democracy is historical, specific and relative, it will 
certainly be subject to restraints involving social, economic, 
and political factors. Therefore, progress in democracy cannot 
deviate from the reality or transcend historical stages. 
Seeking democracy by neglecting specific conditions will not 
only make it impossible to achieve the objective of developing 
democracy, but also produce adverse effects on economic growth 
and social stability. Democracy will certainly develop along 
with the development of society. China is currently deepening 
reforms and establishing a socialist market economic structure, 
while the people are steadily improving their cultural standards 
and enhancing their awareness of becoming involved and concepts 
involving competition. Advancing socialist democracy in an 
active but steady manner is not only required by the objective, 
but is also realistically possible. 
  To study the current construction of democratic politics in 
China, one must proceed from China's reality, based on the 
objective reality of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and persist in being guided by the basic 
principle of Marxism. There are two basic concepts in Marxist 
historical materialism. One is the concept of productive 
forces; another being the concept of the masses. The concept of 
productive forces perceptively demonstrates that productive 
forces are the ultimate and decisive factors in all social 
development. The fundamental task of socialism is to liberate 
and develop productive forces. Since the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we have, based on this 
concept, conscientiously summed up historical experiences, 
corrected the "left" mistake of "taking class struggle as the 
key link," upheld the guiding principle of economic construction 
as the central task, and taken the path of reform and opening 
up, thus bringing about a fundamental change in our country's 
outlook. The mass concept profoundly shows that the masses are 
the creators of history, are the main bodies of practice and 
cognition, and are the impetus of propelling the progress of 
human society. This concept has not only decides on and 
influences many tasks in contemporary China, but also has an 
impact on our country's construction of democratic politics. 
The Communist Party of China has made serving the people 
wholeheartedly its ultimate purpose, the mass line of coming 
from the people and returning among the people its fundamental 
work line, and seeking interests for the masses in all 
activities as its starting point and goal; herein lies the 
actual operation of the mass concept in the party's activities. 
The essence and contents of socialist democracy lie in helping 
the masses become the masters of their country. The masses, 
through diverse forms and channels, understand the country's 
situation, take part in major state affairs, exercise the rights 
of managing the country and social affairs, supervise ruling 
party and government work personnel, and bring into play the 
enthusiasm and initiative of building socialism. These are the 
vivid reflections of the mass concept in the state's political 
life. The mass concept is closely related to our country's 
construction of democratic politics. Integrating the 
construction of democratic politics with a Marxist world view, 
with the ruling party's leadership method and work style, with 
the government's various functions and work, and with the 
masses' practical activities will endow a scientific and 
theoretical basis and build a profound social foundation for our 
country's construction of socialist democratic politics. 
Carrying out the construction of democratic politics under the 
guidance of the mass concept and embodying the mass concept in 
the construction of democratic politics are not only the marked 
characteristics and traditional advantages of our country's 
democratic politics, but also the inevitable route and basic 
method for developing our country's democratic politics. 
  To positively and steadfastly promote the construction of 
socialist democratic politics, it is necessary to always persist 
in doing everything for the masses and relying on the masses for 
everything. We should try our best to detect the mood of the 
masses; understand the wishes of the masses in a timely manner; 
tirelessly do concrete work for the masses; be skillful at 
pooling the masses' wisdom; fully respect the innovative spirit 
of the masses; voluntarily accept the masses' supervision; and 
in the course of forging close ties with the masses, foster a 
democratic work style, enhance democratic consciousness, and 
create and accumulate experiences for the construction of 
democratic politics. It is necessary to integrate democratic 
building with the building of a legal system; to confirm in a 
systematic and legal manner the methods and experiences that are 
socially accepted, that are of universal significance, and that 
will help the masses become the masters of their country, so 
that their rule will become the norm for social and political 
life; to gradually establish a sound and relatively perfect 
legal system, to realize the systematization and legalization of 
democracy, so that this kind of system and law will not change 
with the replacement of leaders, and will not change with the 
change in leaders' views and focus; to help maintain the 
sanctity and authority of the law and the legal system; to 
enhance the awareness of the masses to protect their own rights 
and interests according to the law; to put to an end acts that 
infringe on the democratic rights of the masses; and to provide 
the masses with a reliable guarantee so that they will enjoy 
various democratic rights. The system of the people's congress, 
the system of multiparty cooperation, and the system of 
political consultation under the leadership of the Communist 
Party are the major forms of our country's socialist democracy 
which need to be further upheld in future practice, so that they 
will be perfected and become more concrete and effective. At 
the same time, we need to constantly establish and improve 
various forms of democracy at grassroots levels along with the 
development of the situation, so as to enable the masses to 
better play their roles as the masters of their country in 
social and political life at grassroots level. All in all, we 
need to take the actual situation of our country into 
consideration, absorb and borrow the results of the civilization 
of human society, strive to build a kind of socialist democracy 
with Chinese characteristics that inherits an excellent 
tradition, that is enriched with the characteristics of the 
times, that reflects the basic system of socialism, and that is 
adapted to a socialist market economy. 

<H5>    III. </H5>
  The just-adopted CPPCC constitutional amendment bill has 
included political participation and discussion as major 
functions of the CPPCC. It is the general summing up of the 
CPPCC work and the major achievement of the current session. 
  Political participation and discussion are in line with 
political consultation and democratic supervision. The major 
contents and basic characteristics of the CPPCC's political 
participation and discussion are political consultation and 
democratic supervision. Political participation and discussion, 
however, should not be simply equated with political 
consultation and democratic supervision, for they are the 
expansion and extension of political consultation and democratic 
supervision. Generally speaking, political consultation and 
democratic supervision treat the state's and region's major 
policies, principles, and issues as major topics; make various 
levels of leading organs their specific objects of 
consideration; and adopt the holding of meetings as a major 
concern. Political consultation and democratic supervision 
proceed in accordance with certain procedures and rules. As for 
political participation and discussion, they are not completely 
restricted by the aforementioned conditions; they are more 
extensive as far as objects are concerned, are richer in 
content, more diverse in form, and more flexible in their 
methods. Incorporating political participation and discussion 
into the CPPCC's major functions will increase and widen the 
channels and spheres of CPPCC work, provide more opportunities 
for CPPCC members to come into contact with people from various 
circles and to give play to their special skills, and create 
excellent conditions for all levels of CPPCC organs to 
effectively organize political consultation and democratic 
supervision, to select topics for discussion, to collect of 
information, to accumulate materials, and to organize personnel. 
  All levels of CPPCC organizations and CPPCC members are 
urged 
to rally closely around the central task of economic 
construction, and in the course of establishing a socialist 
market economic system and integrating their respective 
realities, carry out the work of political participation and 
discussion in a vivid and effective manner. It is necessary to 
establish and improve various systems of concrete work in line 
with relevant stipulations of CPPCC constitution, so as to make 
CPPCC's meeting system, inspection system, motion system, 
special committee activities system, and contacts committee 
better able to adapt to the demands of political participation 
and discussion. To enable political participation and 
discussion activities to proceed in an organized manner, topics 
which are of concern to the masses, which receive party and 
government departments' attention, and which CPPCC organizations 
are able to handle should be selected and plans should be worked 
out for discussion. Improvements should be made in existing 
forms of political participation and discussion, and new forms 
of political participation and discussion should be created so 
that political participation and discussion activities will 
become more flexible and diverse, and so that the enthusiasm of 
CPPCC members will be given better play. The formation of 
special committees should be strengthened. Closer contacts with 
relevant departments, democratic parties, and social groups 
should be promoted so as to further give play to their basic 
roles in political participation and discussion. It is necessary 
to fully bring into play the CPPCC's advantage in possessing a 
vast pool of talent; and to make good use of the CPPCC's 
advantageous conditions of both maintaining close ties with 
various social circles and with the CPC Central Committee to 
reflect the mood and will of the masses and to advance opinions 
and suggestions. Work styles and work efficiency at organs must 
be improved and raised so as to better serve CPPCC members and 
to foster political participation and discussion. It is my 
belief that with successful experience in CPPCC work in the 
past, with the common efforts of all members, and with great 
support from various social circles, we should and we can raise 
the work of the CPPCC's political participation and discussion 
to a new level. 
  Members and comrades: 
  A stable and harmonious social situation is the common goal 
of all people of all nationalities, and is also an important 
reason for seeking benefits for the people and the necessary 
conditions for doing a good job in all spheres of work. The 
CPPCC is the most extensive of all the patriotic united front 
organizations, which should and can give play to its unique role 
of consolidating and developing a stable and harmonious 
situation. 
  The great spirit of unity and struggle is one of the 
excellent traditions of the Chinese people, which is a powerful 
impetus for the Chinese nation to score glorious achievements 
after having gone through all kinds of hardships and 
difficulties, and is our basic guarantee to accomplish the 
historical mission of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The CPPCC is the symbol of great unity, which 
should and can make outstanding contributions to maintaining and 
carrying forward the spirit of unity and struggle.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The ongoing session of 
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held its fourth meeting here 
today in the Great Hall of the People. 
  Ten CPPCC members made speeches at the meeting. 
  Wang Zhaoguo, Qian Zhengying, Sun Fuling and Henry Ying-tung 
Fok presided over the meeting. Also present were Vice-Premier 
Zou Jiahua and some ministers. 
  Shi Ningsun, member of the Central Committee of the China 
National Democratic Construction Association, called for curbing 
inflation. 
  "To maintain social stability and ensure a healthy growth of 
the national economy, the most important thing to do is to curb 
inflation," he said. 
  Luo Yuanzheng, professor of the Beijing Institute of 
Economics, called for a vigorous development of an 
export-oriented economy. 
  Chuang Wing-king from Hong Kong called for the government to 
adopt preferential policies for the five provinces and 
autonomous regions in northwest China and encourage them to 
explore CIS, West Asian and Western European markets through 
Xinjiang. 
  Tsui Sze-man, chairman of the Mirror Post Cultural 
Enterprises Corp., Ltd. of Hong Kong, said any attempt to 
introduce a premature administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong 
people under the pretext of accelerating the democratization of 
Hong Kong violates China's sovereignty, goes against the 
aspirations of the Chinese people and is doomed to fail, he said. 
  "Whenever British colonialists leave a country or region, 
they are sure to create problems and adopt policies aimed at 
dividing the local people. This has been experienced by the 
people of Hong Kong," he said. 
  Wang Wenguang, vice-chairman of the Jiu San Society, called 
on the government to increase expenditures on the application 
and commercialization of scientific and technological findings, 
establish a technology market and enact a relevant law. 
  CPPCC members Wang Xihua, Wu Jing, Zhu Shuhao and Kang Ling 
also made speeches at the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a meeting of 
the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] on 
Hong Kong's situation and development, Tsui Sze-men, CPPCC 
National Committee member from Hong Kong, pointed out that with 
the Mainland remaining stable, Hong Kong is bound to prosper. 
  Tsui Sze-men said: According to the Sino-British "Joint 
Declaration," the British Government must terminate all its 
governing activities in Hong Kong (including Kowloon and the New 
Territories) on 30 June 1997 and smoothly hand over sovereignty 
and governing power over Hong Kong to the Chinese Central 
Government, and it may not recant or evade its obligations under 
any pretext. Now, only a little more than 1,200 days before the 
return, Chris Patten, the last British governor and politician 
who was defeated in election in his own country, on numerous 
occasions openly broke the country's promise under various 
pretexts, culminating in the termination of Sino-British talks. 
Without the Chinese Government's approval, he unilaterally 
submitted the so-called "Chris Patten political reform program" 
-- a program that infringes on China's sovereignty -- to the 
"Legislative Council" [Legco], which functions entirely under 
British colonial rule, for implementation after its "approval." 
  Tsui Sze-men said: Every time they withdraw from a country 
or region, the British colonialists use tricks to create 
contradictions and divide the country or region. Their habitual 
tricks have been personally experienced by Hong Kong compatriots 
today, and the British Government's two sinister attempts 
pursued by Chris Patten on its behalf have been completely 
exposed to the light of day. Its first attempt is to create a 
pro-British legislative body on the basis of Patten's political 
reform program, a body that listens to London and imposes itself 
on Hong Kong after 30 June 1997. Another is to plunder every 
penny of the Hong Kong Government's fiscal surplus of 130 
billion Hong Kong dollars, ignoring the past friendship between 
Britain and China and British long-term interests. Making 
Chinese Government's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong 
ineffective and plundering Hong Kong's fiscal surplus are Chris 
Patten's two most despicable attempts. These short- sighted 
sinister attempts are not only opposed by the great majority of 
the Hong Kong compatriots, they are also opposed by more and 
more people in business and diplomatic circles in Britain itself. 
  Tsui Sze-men pointed out: At this crucial moment, the 
Chinese Government issued a resolute statement which solemnly 
points out that with the termination of "Letters Patent" and 
"Royal Instructions" in Hong Kong by 30 June 1997, all the 
legislative bodies created unilaterally by British politicians 
at various levels in Hong Kong will be disbanded. According to 
the Basic Law and the relevant provisions of the National 
People's Congress [NPC], legislative bodies at various levels 
which embody China's sovereignty will be organized, beginning on 
1 July 1997. The NPC Standing Committee was far-sighted in 
adopting the decision on organizing the Preliminary Work 
Committee [PWC] for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region [HKSAR]. Since then, the members 
from Hong Kong and those from the mainland in the PWC have 
cooperated faithfully with each other and stepped up the study 
of the organization of the HKSAR Government, the selection of 
its chief executive, and the election of its legislative bodies 
at various levels. First, the second group of nearly 100 Hong 
Kong affairs advisers are seriously putting forward opinions and 
suggestions and playing the role of a collective body of wisdom. 
The third group of advisers will be hired soon. The PWC itself 
will be properly strengthened. Nearly 300 Hong Kong district 
affairs advisers, many of whom are from the grass-roots level, 
were hired on 5 March. These talented people are working with 
one heart and one mind in making a preliminary exploration of 
ways for Hong Kong people to administer Hong Kong. Tsui Sze-men 
was convinced that the Chinese Government has both the 
determination and the ability to ensure Hong Kong's smooth 
transition and continued stability and prosperity. Hong Kong 
will certainly be prosperous so long as the motherland's 
mainland enjoys stability and economic development. 
  Tsui Sze-men said: One country with two systems, 
administering Hong Kong by the Hong Kong people, and a high 
degree of autonomy can be realized according to the Hong Kong 
"Basic Law" only after China's central government completely 
recovers Hong Kong's sovereignty and administration. Reliance 
on foreign forces and use of the pretext of accelerating 
democracy and making Hong Kong people administer Hong Kong 
sooner are in violation of both China's sovereignty and the 
Chinese people's aspirations. None of the attempts can succeed. 
  Tsui Sze-men said: As a representative of overseas Chinese, 
I took part in the flag-raising ceremony for Burma's 
independence in Burma on January 4, 1948. I also attended the 
last Burmese governor's flag-lowering ceremony. I witnessed 
Britain's Major General (Lance), holding a British flag, walk 
out of the governor's office in tears. It will be my pleasure 
to witness the last Hong Kong governor walk out of the 
governor's office. It will be different from what I did in 
Burma. At that time, I was invited to attend the ceremony as a 
guest. Next time, I will attend the ceremony as the host and 
will be particularly happy and honored. 
  Tsui Sze-men said: Premier Li Peng said in his "government 
work report": "I hope the PWC will unite the Hong Kong 
compatriots in a comprehensive way, make good preparations for 
establishing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its 
first government and legislative body, and live up to the 
expectation and great trust placed in it by the people across 
the country." Since I heard this passage, I have felt that the 
responsibility resting on my shoulders is very heavy and 
important because I am a PWC member. I will unite with all the 
forces in Hong Kong that I can and will make the greatest 
efforts for Hong Kong's smooth transition in the second half of 
the transitional period and for its successful reversion.

the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, CPPCC, on the Examination of Proposals 
Submitted to the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee -- Adopted at the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC 
National Committee on 19 March 1994"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Mar (XINHUA) -- By 1700 on 14 March, the 
Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee has 
received 1,893 proposals submitted by 1,413 committee members, 
or 67.4 percent of the total number of committee members. 
Committee members from the Revolutionary Committee of the 
Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China 
Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants and 
Workers Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Dang [Party for 
Public Interests], the Jiusan [September 3] Society, and the 
Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League submitted a total of 13 
proposals under the name of their respective parties and 
organizations. 
  In accordance with relevant provisions in the "Regulations 
of 
the CPPCC National Committee for Work Related to Proposals" and 
the work plan for this session, the Motions Committee divided 
itself into several groups to earnestly examine the proposals 
and then placed 1,851 proposals, or 97.8 percent of the total, 
on file for further action. Among them were 726 proposals, or 
39.2 percent, on economic construction; 556 proposals, or 30 
percent, on science, education, culture, public health, and 
sports; 373 proposals, or 20.2 percent, on political, legal, as 
well as labor and personnel affairs; and 196 proposals, or 10.6 
percent, on united front work as well as matters related to 
nationalities, religions, and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan 
compatriots and overseas Chinese. A total of 42 proposals 
falling short of the requirements for further action were 
instead handled as letters from committee members, after the 
consent of the committee members concerned was obtained through 
consultations. 
  Acting in accordance with the current session's guidelines 
of "promoting democracy, seeking truth from facts, achieving 
unity, and going all out" and focusing on the overall tasks of 
seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and preserving stability, committee 
members presented many positive views and suggestions on major 
issues vital to the country's lasting peace and prosperity and 
on flash-point issues of concern to the masses of people, such 
as how to improve macroeconomic regulation and control, 
strengthen infrastructure construction, strengthen the role of 
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, 
invigorate state-owned large and medium enterprises, support 
economic development in ethnic minority regions, strengthen 
environmental protection; maintain the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the economy; accelerate the establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure, stabilize commodity 
prices, perfect the tax system, improve the market mechanism, 
develop science and technology, revitalize education, promote 
cultural prosperity, push the reform of medical and public 
health structures, strengthen the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization, perfect the legal system, combat 
corruption and promote clean government, improve public order, 
ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition, and promote the 
motherland's peaceful reunification. Many proposals, 
particularly those presented by various parties and groups, were 
developed on the basis of careful investigation and study. 
Their arguments are well grounded, and they not only point out 
problems but also provide methods and approaches for solving the 
problems. 
  After studying the proposals on record, the Motions 
Committee 
decided to forward them separately to 145 units for handling. 
They include relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee; 
relevant ministries, commissions, and departments under the 
State Council; the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee's General Office, the Central Military Commission's 
General Office, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, relevant people's organizations; and party 
committees and people's governments of the relevant provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities. While the CPPCC 
National Committee was still in session, the Motions Committee, 
based on proposals by some CPPCC National Committee members, 
requested leading comrades of the State Education Commission to 
visit the members' districts to brief the localities on the 
implementation of the "Teachers Law" and to exchange views on 
it. The Motions Committee also promptly consulted relevant 
units on 10 urgent proposals and had these handled while the 
National Committee was still in session. 
  After the end of the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC 
National Committee, the National Committee's General Office is 
to hold a meeting of the responsible persons of the general 
offices of the various units undertaking to handle the proposals 
to discuss matters related to their implementation.

<F P=106> ["CPPCC, Symbol of China's Democratic Politics" -- XINHUA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- The newly-amended 
constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC), which has strengthened the role of CPPCC in 
China's political life, is another symbol of China's progress in 
developing its democratic politics. 
  CPPCC, the broadest patriotic united front formed in the 
long 
struggle of the Chinese people, played a vital role in history. 
Before the eve of the founding of New China on October 1, 1949, 
CPPCC exercised the power of the National People's Congress and 
announced the birth of New China. After the convention of the 
first National People's Congress in 1949, CPPCC has continued to 
play an important role in the country's political and social 
life. 
  The amended CPPCC Constitution further clarifies and 
strengthens the position and role of CPPCC, pointing out CPPCC 
is an important institution for multi-party cooperation and 
political consultation under the leadership of the Communist 
Party of China (CPC). 
  Observers here noted this marks a new development after the 
addition of "the political consultation system will exist and 
develop for a long time" to the constitution of the People's 
Republic of China in an amendment last year. 
  Scholars from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said 
the 
amended CPPCC Constitution stipulates the main functions of 
CPPCC, including the main content, form and procedures of 
"political consultation and democratic supervision." For 
instance, consultations are necessary not only before decisions 
are made on state policies, principles, important political, 
economic and social issues but also during their implementation. 
This shows that political consultations have become broader in 
scope and richer and in content. 
  The amended constitution also adds stipulations on the 
rights 
and obligations of CPPCC organizations and members. The 
stipulation that CPPCC participating units and individuals have 
the right to expose and investigate acts violating laws and 
disciplines will further enable CPPCC organizations and members 
to exercise the right of administering state and social affairs. 
  Wu Jianfan, a jurisprudence researcher of the Chinese 
Academy 
of Social Sciences, said that, though the CPPCC Constitution is 
not a law, it has a binding force since the political 
consultation system has been recognized by China's Constitution. 
  Wu regarded the amended CPPCC Constitution as an important 
link in the development of China's democratic politics in recent 
years. 
  Since China instituted reform and open policies 15 years 
ago, 
democratic politics has developed steadily. The country's two 
basic political systems -- the people's congress system and the 
multi- party cooperation and political consultation system -- 
have been improved and strengthened. 
  In the people's congress system, deputies to people's 
congresses at the county level and lower are now directly 
elected; and for the national people's congress, there are more 
candidates than membership. China's Constitution stipulates 
that the tenure of office of the president, chairman of the NPC 
Standing Committee and premier should not exceed two terms, 
terminating virtual life tenure of office of the past. 
  Other important steps taken in this direction include: in 
the CPPCC organizations, CPC members should not surpass 40 
percent; non- communist persons have been recommended to assume 
posts in the government, establishment of a civil service 
system, and the adoption of strict examination procedures for 
the appointment, promotion and removal of officials. 
  A senior jurist said that the amended CPPCC Constitution 
marks another milestone in the development of China's democratic 
politics. 
  The amended CPPCC Constitution stipulates "participation in 
running and discussing state affairs" as a main function of 
CPPCC. The addition will not only expand the channels and scope 
of CPPCC participation but also has a far-reaching significance 
for the development in the country of socialist democratic 
politics with Chinese characteristics.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Well-known nuclear 
physicist Zhu Guangyan, 69, was made a vice chairman of the 
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in a by-election here today. 
  Zhu is now chairman of the China Association for Science and 
Technology, director of the Science and Technology Committee 
under State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for 
National Defence, and academician of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences. 
  In the 1960s, he was one of the organizers of researches in 
China's atomic and hydrogen bombs. 
  Born in December 1924 in Yichang of Hubei Province, Zhu 
graduated from the Physics Department of Southwest Associated 
University in 1945. Recommended by professor Wu Dayou, he went 
to the U.S. to study nuclear physics in 1946. After obtaining a 
doctorate in physics from the University of Michigan, he 
returned to China in spring 1950. He served as associate 
professor of Beijing University, and professor and director of 
Teaching and Research Section, Northeast China People's 
University. 
  In 1955 Zhu started to teach New China's first group of 
nuclear physics students in Beijing University. Two years 
later, he engaged in the study of reactor physics in the Atomic 
Energy Research Institute of the Nuclear Ministry. He joined 
the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1956. 
  In the early 1970s, Zhu was transferred to State Commission 
of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence and 
organized preparations for the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, and 
research and development of nuclear fuel and application of 
radioisotope. In the 1980s he masterminded part of the "863 
Program" -- a program for China to follow the latest development 
of high technologies in the world. 
  Zhu was an alternate member of the 9th and 10th CPC Central 
Committees, a member of the 11th-14th CPC Central Committees, a 
deputy to the 3rd-5th National People's Congresses and a 
Standing Committee member of the CPPCC 8th National Committee. 
  Professor Zhu likes cycling, classic music, classic 
literature and playing ping pong and basketball.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- "It is our duty to 
catch up with world advanced levels in nuclear fusion research," 
a Chinese researcher said here today. 
  Yang Size, a research fellow of the Physics Institute, the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a member of the Eighth National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC), noted that there is a gap between China and 
the United States, Japan, Russia and West European countries in 
nuclear fusion research. 
  Yang, also head of the Taiwan Fellow-Students Association, 
went in 1972 from Taiwan to the United States, where he won a 
doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley 
in 1978. He came to the Chinese mainland afterwards, engaging 
in nuclear engineering research in the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences as head of a research project. "On the mainland I can 
do what I want to do," he said. 
  The 47-year-old physicist and his research group won 
financial assistance from the state natural science fund this 
year. 
  Yang is one of China's tens of thousands of returned 
students. A number of them have become leaders in various 
fields. 
  Since 1978 China has sent over 200,000 students to study in 
over 100 countries and regions, including the United States, 
Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and Russia. 
  So far, 70,000 have returned to China. A number of them have 
opened new research areas, some have become 
internationally-known scholars and others have been recognized 
as leaders in their respective fields. 
  In the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
83 
percent of the 6,847 returned students have made at least one 
research achievement or patent each. Winners of state prizes 
number 905, and winners of ministerial prizes, 277. 
  In 1993, the Chinese University of Science and Technology 
promoted 33 returned students to the rank of professor, 
accounting for 65 percent of the newly promoted. 
  Gan Zizhao, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
and chief of the National Superconductor Expert Committee, and 
other members of the CPPCC National Committee suggested that 
China further improve political and economic conditions for 
young scientists. 
  In July 1985, China instituted its post-doctorate system, 
which has led to the establishment of 300 post-doctorate 
stations with 1,800 post-doctorate researchers throughout China. 
  Dalian and other coastal cities have erected residential 
buildings for post-doctorate researchers. 
  The Chinese Academy of Sciences, which sent 11,736 persons 
to 
study abroad between 1978 and 1993, has adopted flexible 
policies to encourage Chinese students studying abroad to 
contribute to China through multiple channels, including 
carrying out short-term research projects.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (CNS) -- Member of the CPPCC and 
associate researcher of the Chinese Academy of Geological 
Sciences Mr. Wang Mili said today that a grim situation was 
facing the Chinese geological sector as a result of a shortage 
of geological resources and investment as well as a draining of 
talented people from this field. 
  Mr. Wang said that the serious shortage of investment in 
geological prospecting had resulted in known mineral deposits 
not being able to meet the country's needs. Of 45 proven main 
mineral resources, 12 will be in short supply within this 
century and half of the 45 mineral deposits will not keep pace 
with the demands of economic development in the 21st century. 
  Meanwhile, investment in mineral production was falling, 
taking inflation into account, by 10.3 percent annually, 
resulting in a half-closure of one-third of geological 
prospecting teams, with their salaries and living standard 
falling to below the average level in the country. Four such 
teams in Guangdong which had made a great contribution to 
geological work were living in poverty, and similar workers in 
Qinghai Province working on the plateau area for dozens of years 
where oxygen is thin continued to live in bad housing 
conditions, with their children unable to find work and 175 
households, of whom had a per capita income for their daily 
expenses of less than RMB 35 [renminbi] monthly. [sentence as 
received] Such situations had caused many talented people to 
move out of the sector. 
  The mismanagement of mineral deposits was serious resulting 
in environmental pollution, and the safety of workers and public 
order had also been affected. 
  Mr. Wang called for more attention to be given to geological 
work to meet the needs of China's economic development. The 
caring for the country's natural resources should, like the 
control of population and protection of the ecology, be seen as 
a fundamental national policy.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The performing arts in 
China are at a crossroads at a time when a market economy taking 
shape in the country is offering them both opportunities and 
challenges. 
  Some members of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) expressed 
their mixed feelings for the current cultural situation at the 
ongoing CPPCC session. 
  Since the government adopted a series of measures to support 
classic and traditional arts last year, classic and traditional 
arts have had a revival of sorts after withering for a period. 
  Sponsored by some enterprises, the China Opera Troupe 
recently staged performances in Guangzhou for the second time. 
Its first performance took place in Guangzhou 33 years ago. 
Wang Shiguang, director of the troupe, said its visit to the 
southern city marked the beginning of the troupe's normal 
operation. 
  Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other big cities 
successfully staged New Year concerts. The number of 
performance programs of classic and traditional arts has 
increased remarkably. 
  In Shanghai, all specialized troupes have arranged their 
performance programs for the year. 
  The Guangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra has resumed its normal 
rehearsals and performances, while a new ballet is being 
organized there. 
  Some big companies have also sponsored classic and 
traditional arts. For instance, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has 
decided to donate 2.5 million yuan to the Central Philharmonic 
Orchestra. 
  But, noted writer Wu Zuguang said quite a number of 
companies 
seek promotion of their corporate images through donations and 
some companies even asked troupes to change their names after 
themselves. "It's shocking," he said. 
  Some members suggested that state adopt preferential 
policies 
to bankroll classic and traditional artistic institutions so as 
to create favorable conditions for the development of cultural 
undertakings. 
  CPPCC members from literary and art circles also suggested 
that China accelerate cultural legislation to promote cultural 
prosperity. 
  Famous writer Li Zhun said that policies governing 
literature 
and arts should meet the needs of the new era. "It is necessary 
to ban pornographic and obscene arts. What is more important, 
however, is to let literature and art prosper," he said. 
  Huang Shuqin, a woman director of the Shanghai Film Studio, 
said that reform and open policies have ushered in a diversified 
social structure, and the feelings of the public have changed 
too. "If our policy governing literature and art does not 
proceed from the reality, it is impossible for them to serve 
people in the era," she said. 
  On relations between classic and pop music, Professor Wu 
Zuqiang from the Central Conservatory of Music said that there 
is not an unsurmountable gap between classic and pop music. "We 
should support classic music and develop pop music as well," he 
said. 
  The influx of smuggled film tapes and compact disks has also 
caused concern among CPPCC members. They expressed their 
support for a government ban on smuggled film tapes and compact 
disks. 
  Famous film director Xie Jin stressed it is necessary to 
create a more relaxed environment for artists and encourage them 
to produce competitive films. 
  He said that artists should emancipate the mind and have a 
better understanding of the multiple social functions of 
literature and art rather than stressing its educational 
function only. 
  Wu Zuqiang said that upgrading the existing philharmonic 
orchestras and creating high-quality music products will be the 
key for the classic music to turn around.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin today called for efforts to speed up economic 
development in China's central and western regions and maintain 
an appropriate growth rate there. 
  While meeting with National People's Congress deputies from 
Hainan, Gansu and Henan Provinces, Jiang emphasized the 
importance of proceeding from specific local conditions and 
accelerating China's economic growth in a "down-to-earth" manner. 
  "China has a huge population, vast territories and uneven 
economic development between different regions," said Jiang, who 
is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee. 
  He said that the state will take effective measures to 
narrow 
the economic gap between the coastal areas and the central and 
western regions. 
  While the state increases assistance for central and western 
regions, developed areas should try to help underdeveloped 
regions, he noted. 
  The leader called on officials and people in central and 
western regions to catch up with developed regions through 
self-reliance. 
  "Our goal is to achieve common development and prosperity," 
he said. 
  He also emphasized the importance of paying close attention 
to unity in areas inhabited by people of various minority 
nationalities. 
  He called on people of all nationalities to hold high the 
banner of patriotism and socialism and work hard for the 
prosperity of the Chinese nation.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Spokesman for the 
current session of the National People's Congress (NPC) said 
here today that a bill on the Hong Kong issue has been submitted 
to the NPC Law Committee. 
  Zhou Jue, the spokesman, said that some NPC deputies of the 
Guangdong provincial delegation raised a bill suggesting that 
the National People's Congress make a decision to organize the 
legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) 
and its district organizations in 1997 after the termination of 
the political structure of Hong Kong established by the British 
government. 
  The Third Meeting of the presidium of the NPC Second Session 
decided to submit the bill to the NPC Law Committee first for 
deliberation, he said. 
  Zhou said that Sino-British negotiations on Hong Kong's 
1994/95 electoral arrangements broke down because of the 
sabotage of the British side. Under such circumstances, the 
last political structure elected according to British Hong Kong 
government's legislation will come to an end with the 
termination of the British jurisdiction over Hong Kong. "It 
cannot extend beyond June 30, 1997," he said. 
  The preliminary work committee for the SAR will unite with 
Hong Kong compatriots, and make preparations for the SAR, its 
first government and legislature in accordance with the NPC 
decision on organization methods of the first government and 
legislative assembly of the SAR, Zhou said. 
  "No matter what happens, the Chinese government and people 
have the determination and capacity to resume the exercise of 
Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, realize smooth transition of 
power and maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and 
prosperity," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The Presidium of the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) 
held its third meeting here this morning. 
  The meeting first approved a report delivered by NPC Law 
Committee Chairman Xue Ju on the examination result of a draft 
Budget Law. NPC deputies maintained that it is necessary to 
formulate a budget law since it can strengthen the distributive 
and supervisory functions of budget, improve state management 
over budget, step up state macro-economic controls and ensure a 
sound economic and social development, Xue said. 
  According to Xue, most deputies agreed that the draft of the 
Budget Law is basically mature and should be submitted to the 
current session for examination and approval. The meeting 
adopted his suggestion. 
  The Presidium meeting also approved to submit to the current 
NPC session for examination a draft decision on empowering the 
Xiamen City People's Congress and its standing committee with 
the power to formulate laws and regulations for implementation 
in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone. 
  The Presidium approved a draft resolution on the work report 
of the NPC Standing Committee and decided to distribute the 
resolution to all NPC delegations for examination and then put 
it to a vote at a full meeting of the session. 
  Today's Presidium meeting also approved a draft resolution 
on 
the work reports of the Supreme People's Courts and Supreme 
People's Procuratorate and decided to put the draft resolution 
to a vote at a full meeting of the current session. 
  The meeting also approved a list of candidates for new 
members of the NPC Standing Committee to be elected at a full 
meeting. A draft resolution on a list of the general scrutineer 
and scrutineers in the election was also approved at today's 
meeting and will be submitted to a full meeting for approval. 
  Cao Zhi, deputy secretary-general of the current NPC 
session, 
delivered a report on the handling of bills and suggestions 
raised by deputies. 
  He said that the current session has received 63 bills by 
delegations and 660 bills each raised by at least 30 deputies. 
In addition, by March 18 deputies had also raised 1,600 
suggestions and criticisms about work in various fields.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- Teachers and students 
of the Central University of Nationalities today held a ceremony 
to change its name. 
  The university was originally named the Central Institute of 
Nationalities. Last November, the State Education Commission 
approved a name-change to the Central University of 
Nationalities. 
  Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and general secretary of the 
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, inscribed the 
nameplate for the university. 
  At the ceremony, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing unveiled the 
nameplate. 
  He said that the development of educational services for 
minority nationalities is important to the revitalization of 
minority nationalities and the ethnic people's autonomous 
regions and prefectures. 
  He said that the central university has played a very 
important role in cultivation of high- and mid-level officials 
and technical know-how in minority nationalities inhabited areas. 
  He urged the university to make a new start and turn itself 
into a university with its unique characteristics so as to 
contribute to higher education among minority nationalities. 
  Set up in Beijing in 1950, the university now has over 20 
departments and 30 research institutes with more than 100 
disciplines. 
  By the end of last year, more than 30,000 had graduated from 
the university. 
  Among those who attended the ceremony were Vice-Chairmen of 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress 
Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe and Tomur Dawamat, 
Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and 
State Councillor and Minister in Change of State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission Ismail Amat.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Mar (XINHUA) -- Since the opening of the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], 
many leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee, the NPC 
Standing Committee, and the State Council have separately 
participated in discussions held by various provincial, 
autonomous regional, municipal, and People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] delegations. They attentively listened to deputies' views 
and suggestions on work in various fields and gave their views 
on many issues of concern to the deputies. 
  Tian Jiyun, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member 
and 
vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, took part in the 
Guizhou delegation's discussions. He said: In the course of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, the NPC's 
legislative responsibility has become heavier and heavier. In 
conducting legislative work, it is necessary to take into 
consideration China's conditions and foreign experience as well 
as the question of compatibility with international practice. 
  He said: We have been carrying out construction and 
legislation under a social condition where the sense of the 
legal system is weak and the legal system is not very 
comprehensive and sound. Because of this, not only do we 
shoulder a very heavy legislative responsibility, but we also 
shoulder an even heavier responsibility in supervising law 
enforcement. We must do a tremendous amount of hard work for an 
extended period to ensure that our people and cadres have a 
higher sense of the legal system and that laws are adhered to 
and strictly enforced in administering state affairs. Only when 
we have done so can we ensure the establishment of a socialist 
market economy, the irreversibility of our reform and opening 
up, and the success of socialist modernization. 
  During discussions with the Jiangxi delegation, Li Lanqing, 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and vice premier, 
said: Reform provides the fundamental solution to education. 
First, we must readjust education's macro structure, 
concentrating our principal energy on basic education. Second, 
we must not impose uniformity in promoting nine-year compulsory 
education. We must not demand uniform education, ignoring 
differences between urban and rural areas and between developed 
and underdeveloped areas. Third, we must step up reform with 
the goal of improving educational standards and increasing the 
beneficial results of higher education. We must encourage people 
to pool their resources to set up and operate schools. Fourth, 
we must strengthen moral education. 
  During a discussion with the Shandong delegation, Jiang 
Chunyun, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, said: 
To ensure the smooth progress of reform in all fields, we must 
firmly cultivate an overall point of view; correctly handle 
relations between partial and overall interests and between 
immediate and long-term interests; stress discipline and the 
overall situation; consciously safeguard the authority of the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council and take concerted 
steps with them. We must fully arouse and bring into play the 
initiatives and creativity of the broad masses of people. Reform 
is an undertaking involving the broad masses of people. We must 
channel their initiatives to reform so that they will concern 
themselves with reform, support it, and successfully carry it 
out. 
  During a discussion with the Ningxia delegation, Qian 
Qichen, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and vice 
premier, said: Helping the poor involves a transitional period. 
We must earnestly implement the state's program to support the 
poor, make concentrated efforts to make full use of the 
program's funds, work hard to improve the production conditions 
in poor areas, and help them vigorously develop village and town 
enterprises and intensive processing industries. He stressed: 
Stability is a major issue. Because national minority regions 
lag behind in economic, educational, and cultural development, 
strengthening unity among nationalities and properly resolving 
ethnic and religious issues have become all the more important. 
Only in this way can we have a stable foundation to develop the 
economy in national minority regions and gradually narrow the 
difference between national minority regions and developed areas. 
  During a discussion with the Guangdong delegation, Xie Fei, 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, said: The state 
has announced a series of reform measures related to finance, 
taxation, banking, foreign trade, and enterprises since the 
beginning of this year. We must make efforts to implement these 
measures, promptly resolve new problems discovered in the course 
of implementation, and take steps to improve the measures and 
gradually develop a mechanism for operating a socialist market 
economy. At the same time, we must step up our efforts to 
establish a mechanism for rule of law and democratic 
supervision. This will be a main focus of Guangdong's political 
structural reform, which will be undertaken simultaneously with 
its economic structural reform so that political structural 
reform will support economic reform and ensure the healthy 
development of the socialist market economy. 
  In discussions with the Shanxi delegation, Ren Jianxin, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, said: 
Currently, China enjoys economic development, political 
stability, national unity, and social progress. The situation 
is generally good. However, we must also realize that 
safeguarding social stability and public order is an arduous 
long-term task. We must mentally prepare to take all realistic 
and effective measures to go all out to safeguard social 
stability. We must uphold the policy of doing two types of work 
at the same time, attaching equal importance to both. We must 
handle the work of safeguarding social stability in the same way 
we handle the economy. 
  Speaking at a discussion held by the Hubei delegation, Ni 
Zhifu, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said: In 
building a legal system for the socialist market economy, we 
must use Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide, 
use the Constitution as the basis, proceed from reality, and 
vigorously but prudently carry out the work in a spirit of 
reform. He said: We have achieved remarkable results in the 
legislative field in the last few years. However, law 
enforcement remains a weak link. Failure to observe the law 
strictly is still quite serious, and this has led to complaints 
from many quarters. We must place as much importance on 
supervising and monitoring law enforcement as on legislation. 
Only by doing so can we safeguard the authoritativeness of the 
law. 
  During a discussion with the Hebei delegation, Wang 
Bingqian, 
vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said: In 
developing the economy, we must pay attention to both quantity 
and quality, that is, to the unity between speed and efficiency. 
We must pay closer attention to economic efficiency, without 
which speed is not only worthless, but may even be harmful. We 
must pay attention to resolving "bottlenecks" and promote 
short-term as well as long-term development. We must pay 
attention to mobilizing positive factors in various economic 
sectors and jointly develop social productive forces to make 
people rich and the country strong. We must give equal emphasis 
to development and conservation to achieve greater, faster, 
better, and more economic results in production and construction. 
  During a discussion with the Inner Mongolia delegation, 
Buhe, 
vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said: There is a 
gap between national minority regions and advanced areas in 
economic development. Doing a good job in national minority 
work has a positive impact on the stability, development, and 
prosperity of the entire society. Equality, unity, and mutual 
assistance among different nationalities serve as a guarantee 
for economic development and social progress in national 
minority areas. We must use the Marxist outlook on 
nationalities to educate the masses of people and to codify and 
institionalize our national minority work along a correct path. 
We must comprehensively and correctly implement the policy 
toward religion and strengthen management of religious affairs 
according to the law. 
  Taking part in discussions with the Jiangxi delegation, 
Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peiyao noted that 
this year's economic targets are not set very high. He said: 
This has created relatively good conditions for reform. In 
administering macrocontrol last year, we found a successful 
experience, that is we must carry out macrocontrol through 
financial means instead of administrative means. He also said: 
On the issue of safe production, we learned some lessons last 
year. The Government Work Report stresses the importance of 
safe production more than in the past. Due to the change from 
the old system to a new one, safe production is particularly 
important and we must pay good attention to the matter. 
  Vice Chairman of the NPC Stannding Committee Wu Jieping took 
part in the Shanghai delegation's discussions. He said: The 
achievements of our country's reform, opening up, and economic 
development have attracted worldwide attention. However, there 
are still some problems and contradictions which must be solved 
by further carrying out reform. At present, we are 
strengthening macrocontrol, and we must carry forward the spirit 
of taking the situation as a whole into consideration and 
"firmly implement the central guidelines and unified planning 
without exception." We should work with concerted efforts and 
take the interests of the whole into consideration. We should 
firmly and truly implement the principle of seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development and maintaining stability. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng said during discussions with 
deputies of the Guangdong delegation: Judging from the 
situation of the whole country, total grain output in 1993 
increased and set an all-time record. Nevertheless, there are 
shortages in the supply of food grain in some locales. This is 
mainly due to the imbalance in supply and demand. Take the 
situation in Guangdong for example, the annual grain output was 
more than 30 billion jin, but the total demand is more than 40 
billion jin. Guangdong must buy 10 billion jin of grain from 
other provinces to make up for its shortage. Moreover, there are 
many migrants in Guangdong who must also eat. Guangdong must be 
determined to ensure adequate acreage of land sown in grain 
crops and raise grain output. We should not only pay attention 
to economic results, but also pay attention to social benefits. 
We must strive to raise the level of reliance in the supply of 
food grain. 
  State Councillor Ismail Amat took part in discussions with 
the Tianjin delegation. He pointed out: We are establishing a 
socialist market economic structure, and the biggest difference 
between China and the Western countries is that, in China, all 
activities throughout the nation are coordinated like pieces in 
a chess game and there is a great unity among people of all 
nationalities. We should be proud of this at all times. In 
past decades, various provinces and municipalities in the 
country have provided great support to areas resided in by 
minority people. In the future, the more developed coastal 
cities and areas should, while developing their economies, 
further support and help the development of areas resided by 
minority people. 
  Ding Guangen, Li Tieying, Yang Baibing, Wu Bangguo, Zou 
Jiahua, Chen Xitong, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Wang Hanbin, 
Zhang Zhen, Chen Muhua, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, 
Li Ximing, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Wang Guangying, Cheng Siyuan, 
Lu Jiaxi, Tomur Dawamat, Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Peng Peiyun, 
Luo Gan, and Zhang Siqing also took part in discussions, 
respectively, with delegations from various provinces, 
autonomous regions, municipalities, and the People's Liberation 
Army.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central 
Committee United Front Department and the Nationalities 
Committees of the National People's Congress [NPC] and the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] 
National Committee gave a tea party at the Great Hall of the 
People this evening in honor of minority deputies and members 
attending the Second Sessions of the Eighth NPC and the Eighth 
CPPCC National Committee. 
  Qiao Shi, NPC Standing Committee chairman; Li Ruihuan, 
chairman of the CPPCC National Committee; and Comrades Tian 
Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Cheng Siyuan, Tomur 
Dawamat, Ismail Amat, Yang Rudai, Qian Zhengying, and Liao 
Hansheng attended the party and joined the minority deputies and 
members coming from all parts of the country to mark the 
victorious convocations of the two meetings. 
  Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, 
chaired the tea party. Addressing the party, NPC Standing 
Committee Vice Chairman Buhe said: Directed by the guidelines 
laid down by the 14th national party congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and 
proceeding along the path of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, our great motherland attracted worldwide 
attention with our high economic growth, political stability, 
national solidarity, and social progress last year. This year 
is crucial for restructuring the economic system, and the 
success of the second sessions of the Eighth NPC and Eighth 
CPPCC National Committee will be significant for properly 
handling the relations between reform, development, and 
stability and expediting all national projects in all fields 
through accomplishing the task of overall importance -- "seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the 
outside world, expediting development, and maintaining 
stability." 
  Buhe said: The current situation is very favorable for 
China's reform, opening up, and modernization; and the situation 
also provides minority regions with a good opportunity for 
promoting economic and cultural development. Just as Premier Li 
Peng stated in his government work report: "Through reforms and 
opening up to the outside world, minority regions, with state 
support and economically developed areas' assistance, certainly 
will demonstrate their own strengths, have stronger vitality for 
economic development, gradually reduce the gap with economically 
developed areas, and achieve prosperity with them together." 
While this reflects the consistent policy of our party and 
government, it is also the experience acquired from years' of 
actual work. As long as we are united as one and work hard 
earnestly, minority areas certainly will achieve new and greater 
victories in their economic and cultural development. 
  He said: Deepening reform, opening wider to the outside 
world, maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy national 
economic development, and ensuring the successful implementation 
of all reform measures are major issues we must make special 
efforts to deal with today. Only when we work together to 
safeguard and develop political stability and unity and 
consolidate and develop our socialist national relations marked 
by equality, solidarity, and mutual assistance can we build our 
great motherland into a happy and harmonious home of people of 
all nationalities. 
  Artists of the central national song and dance ensemble and 
the Central National University Department of Choreography 
staged an art show at the reception.

(2799 0948 6874)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- While taking part in 
the discussions held by the Hebei delegation, Liu Huaqing, 
member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, said emphatically: In the new situation of deepening 
reform and opening up wider to the outside world, party, 
government, and military departments in all localities must 
further carry out the work of supporting the government and the 
army and cherishing the people and of building spiritual 
civilization through the joint efforts of the army and the 
civilians to guarantee and promote the country's reform and 
construction. 
  Liu Huaqing joined deputies from Hebei today to discuss the 
"Government Work Report" and the work reports of the NPC 
Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate. He said: Strengthening unity between 
the army and government and between the military and civilians 
is an important element for ensuring the smooth progress of 
reform and development. It is also vital to maintaining the 
country's political and social stability. 
  He continued: Past experience shows wherever the work of 
"double support" and "building spiritual civilization through 
joint efforts" is successful, production will develop faster and 
social order will improve. Therefore, we must adopt new ways to 
promote the building of spiritual civilization while carrying 
out the building of material civilization. 
  After hearing the speeches of seven other deputies, Liu 
Huaqing spoke on the role of agriculture in the national economy 
and the reform of state-owned large and medium enterprises. He 
pointed out: Party committees and governments at all levels must 
pay closer attention to agriculture and rural work, particularly 
grain and cotton production. A large country like China cannot 
do without sufficient grain and cotton. Agriculture is not 
simply a matter of feeding the people; it is also a major issue 
vital to China's lasting peace and stability. Currently, we 
must do a good job of raising the peasants' farming initiatives 
and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living. In 
developing agriculture and promoting the entire rural economy, 
we must seek to reduce peasants' burden and give them tangible 
benefits. 
  Speaking about reforming large and medium enterprises, he 
said: Among large and medium enterprises, many are old military 
industrial enterprises. As the focus of the country's agenda is 
shifted onto economic construction, many old military industrial 
enterprises have begun to produce civilian goods. In 
consideration of the country's needs, we must still retain some 
of the essential military enterprises. Relevant departments of 
the state are studying measures to help large and medium-sized 
military industrial enterprises to overcome their difficulties 
after shifting to production of civilian goods. It is hoped 
that military industrial enterprises will improve internal 
management and make concerted efforts to raise economic benefits 
through reform, as other enterprises have done. 
  Liu Huaqing said: Hebei achieved great success in all fields 
of work last year. Not only did its economy developed faster, 
but its social atmosphere and public order were also quite good. 
Liu Huaqing urged all localities to deepen reform; open up 
wider; educate people in patriotism, socialism, and 
collectivism; stress the larger interests of the collective and 
the state; and work with one heart and one mind to make greater 
progress in socialist modernization.

(1566 0076 7893)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, member of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and 
chairman of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee, visited the NPC deputies from Fujian and Xinjiang at 
the Great Hall of the People this morning. 
  Meeting with the deputies from Fujian, Qiao Shi said: With 
the Xiamen Special Economic Zone, Fujian is at the forefront of 
reform and opening up. The discussion of giving Xiamen 
legislative power is part of the NPC agenda. Fujian's 
development has been quite fast since the adoption of the policy 
of reform and opening up, especially in recent years. While the 
fast growth can be attributed to the policy, it can also be 
attributed to the hard work of people in Fujian. Fujian not 
only has made substantial headway in opening up to the outside 
world, but also in developing relations with overseas Chinese 
and countrymen in Taiwan, and you have also attached importance 
to intensifying material and spiritual construction in the 
province. 
  Qiao Shi expressed the hope that Fujian will achieve even 
greater success under the leadership of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government. 
  On assisting the poor, Qiao Shi said: Fujian is a historical 
revolutionary bastion. Fifteen months after the Jinggangshan 
resolutionary base [in Jiangxi] was established, Chairman Mao 
came down from the mountain and visited western Fujian. In 
helping the poverty-stricken areas, the central government has 
been giving preferential treatment to central and western China 
and has given Fujian the assignment of supporting western Fujian 
and other poverty-stricken areas in the province. It is hoped 
that Fujian, while promoting coastal areas' economic 
development, will also work with determination to build up 
western Fuijian and other historical and mountainous areas in 
accordance with the central government's requirement that areas 
which have become affluent first should help impoverished areas 
achieve prosperity. Historical areas are unlikely to improve 
without outside assistance. The central government has 
deliberately given Fujian this assignment so that aid-the-poor 
programs will be successful nationwide. The central government 
will have problems if it has to shoulder all the aid-the-poor 
programs alone. I hope you will make a success of this project. 
  While meeting the deputies from Xinjiang, Qiao Shi said: 
Xinjiang is the largest and strategically important region in 
western China. In recent years Xinjiang has made substantial 
progress in promoting industrial and other developments as well 
as in promoting agricultural production and animal husbandry. 
Of course, Xinjiang's economic development still lags behind 
that in coastal areas for historical reasons. From now on, 
Xinjiang must think of some ways to develop itself in various 
fields. Xinjiang, a region where minority nationalities live in 
compact communities, has been quite successful in promoting 
national solidarity. I hope Xinjiang will continue to 
strengthen and consolidate the solidarity among people of all 
nationalities and build up Xinjiang on this basis. 
  Commenting on relations with neighboring countries, Qiao Shi 
said: Xinjiang is a neighbor of Central Asian countries. We 
should develop friendly, equal, and mutually beneficial 
cooperation with them on the basis of the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence. While this is very important for 
maintaining national stability and creating a good international 
environment for modernization, it is also helpful for 
strengthening the solidarity among people of all nationalities 
and for safeguarding national unity. In this regard, people of 
all nationalities in Xinjiang have a very important mission to 
accomplish. 
  Qiao Shi said: Xinjiang also has relatively rich natural 
resources. In addition to coal, it also has considerable oil 
reserves and other natural resources. Of course, Xinjiang also 
has its developmental problems, but these problems can be 
gradually resolved during the course of reform. 
  Qiao Shi said: "I wholeheartedly hope people of all 
nationalities in Xinjiang will unite more closely, work together 
in carrying out the task of building Xinjiang, and build 
Xinjiang into an even better place." 
  Qiao Shi also hoped the current NPC session would further 
unite people in Xinjiang, boost their morale, and encourage them 
to do an even better job in all areas. 
  The NPC deputies from Fujian and Xinjiang pledged that they 
certainly will expedite economic construction and national 
solidarity according to the plan drawn up by the party central 
committee.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Deputies to the 
National People's Congress (NPC) have agreed that despite risks 
involved, new reform measures taken this year will enable China 
to make a big step towards the establishment of a systemized, 
standardized and legalized market economy. 
  Deputies attending the current NPC session expressed their 
understanding of and support for these measures which will 
involve a readjustment of interests among social sectors. 
  The hottest topics during group discussions of the current 
NPC session include reform of the taxation, finance, investment 
and foreign trade systems, and the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system, since problems are likely to crop up in the 
course of carrying out these reforms. 
  Sichuan Provincial Governor Xiao Yang said that reform 
measures are formulated from a macro-economic angle with the 
interests of the entire nation and its long-term interests in 
mind. 
  Therefore, it is impossible to enable everyone to enjoy the 
same benefits at the same time. "This is quite normal so far as 
reforms are concerned," Xiao said. 
  He said that it is inevitable that some localities, 
industries, enterprises or individuals will suffer relative 
interest losses of varying degrees. "I think this problem can 
be solved gradually in the course of pushing ahead with 
reforms," he noted. 
  Inflation is also one of the hottest topics of group 
discussions by NPC deputies. 
  Ye Gongqi, a deputy from Shanghai, said, "People are 
concerned most with their rice bags, vegetable baskets and 
cooking oil bottles." 
  If prices rise too rapidly, it will be impossible to 
stabilize popular feelings, he noted. "While expanding a 
socialist market economy, we should never take a hands-off 
policy on prices," he said. 
  Huang Da, a deputy from Beijing, said society's capability 
to 
accept reforms is tested primarily by prices. 
  Specific conditions in China indicate that an annual rise of 
around 10 percent in prices is the limit that consumers can 
accept, he said, noting that exceeding that limit would cause 
instability. 
  Many deputies also emphasized the importance of viewing 
things from the angle of development. 
  They pointed out that no country in the world has thoroughly 
eliminated inflation. 
  With a population of 1.1 billion, China needs a high 
economic 
growth rate, they said. At the same time, inflation should be 
curbed to allow people to gain more tangible benefits. 
  Another hot topic is how to step up agricultural development 
and narrow the gap between developed east China and 
underdeveloped west China. 
  Many deputies agreed that agriculture is a sector essential 
to social stability, as well as a sector with poor foundations. 
  That is why under no circumstances should rural work and 
farmers' interests be neglected. However, farmers' incomes now 
do not increase simultaneously with agricultural development, 
nor do they keep pace with income increases of urban workers, 
they pointed out. 
  While complaining that increased production did not result 
in 
increased incomes, farmer deputies talked more about how to 
bring about a relatively comfortable life for farmers. 
  They agreed that township-run enterprises will play a 
significant role in helping farmers live a better life. 
  Despite the fact that reform often means changes in existing 
patterns of wealth distribution, reform is popular among the 
deputies. 
  A survey shows that, of the nearly 3,000 deputies, no one 
expressed objection to reforms, but some made proposals on and 
voiced criticisms of specific reform measures. 
  Li Zemin, secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of 
the Chinese Communist Party, expressed the consensus reached by 
many deputies that although reforms involve risks, they 
represent the general trend and must continue. 
  Li said that it is imperative to carefully organize the 
implementation of reform measures and reduce the risks to a 
minimum in order to avoid wide repercussions on society.

<F P=106> ["Jottings" by XINHUA reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and </F>
Wu Yilong (1566 1150 7893): "We Should Let Farmers Make A 
Profit"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Mar (XINHUA) -- It might sound somewhat 
contradictory that peasants, being those who have to brave the 
winds and the rains to produce the world's most valuable and 
special commodities, are the ones often suffering from the 
difficulties of having a low income. Deputies attending the 
Second Session of the Eighth NPC reported that a sharp rise in 
the prices of chemical fertilizers, diesel fuels, and other 
means of production, as well as a slow increase in grain 
procurement prices in recent years, have caused the gap between 
the prices of industrial and agricultural products to widen 
progressively. 
  Deputy Ge Lanmei, a peasant from Jiyang Town in Fujian 
Province's Jianou City, cited her home town as an example: The 
price of quality chemical fertilizer supplied by the 
agricultural materials department according to grain output 
suddenly surged to 1,300 yuan a metric ton in 1993 from 538 yuan 
in 1992, registering a sharp rise of 142 percent; while that of 
quality chemical fertilizer for centralized distribution rose to 
1,300 yuan a metric ton in 1993 from 775 yuan in 1992, up as 
much as 68 percent. 
  Figures provided by the state statistics departments also 
can 
illustrate a host of facts: Chinese peasants' per capita net 
income for 1993 was 921.4 yuan, an increase of 3.2 percent in 
real terms from the previous year. This growth rate represented 
a 2.7 percentage point decline from the previous year and was 
lower than that of agriculture and the rural economy. 
  Although their grain harvests piled up like small hills, the 
peasants' wallets did not expand simultaneously. The production 
enthusiasm of quite a number of peasants was thus dampened. A 
deputy from Liaoning Province said: Last year more than 500 
farming households at the province's Changtu County gave up a 
total of 110,000 mu of farmland they had contracted. A Zhejiang 
deputy put it in an even more acute way: In the past, the 
peasants were trying by hook or by crook to get more farmland, 
but now they are asking again and again to return the land 
instead. If things go on like this, who is going to farm in the 
future? With what are we going to fill up our rice sacks and 
vegetable baskets? 
  How should we solve the problem of slow growth in peasants' 
income? Deputy He Zhukang, secretary of the Jilin Provincial 
Party Committee, believes that the key to increasing peasants' 
income lies in further improving the overall efficiency of 
agriculture, in addition to rendering supportive policies and 
state protection. Deputy Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of the 
Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, said: At present we should 
concentrate our efforts on solving four problems: First, we 
should strictly control the margin of increase in the prices of 
capital goods. Second, we should stabilize and develop grain 
and cotton production and develop a diversified rural economy. 
Third, we should coordinate well the relationship between input 
and output and implement as quickly as possible the central 
policy of emphatically aiding 500 major counties for commodity 
grain and 150 major counties for quality cotton. At the same 
time, we must increase input into agriculture, especially in the 
central and western regions where we should give some policy 
preferences. Fourth, handle well the relationship between the 
primary industry and the secondary and tertiary industries, 
consolidate and develop village and town enterprises, and 
vigorously develop the tertiary industry.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- The economic gap 
between China's east and its central and western regions has 
been a hot topic of late in the country, so has it during the 
ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), 
with a different emphasis. 
  NPC deputies are more interested in discussing the 
significance of developing central and western regions for the 
future of China and in discussing ways to narrow the gap under a 
market economy. 
  Since the opening of the NPC session on March 10, dozens of 
NPC deputies have aired their views on this issue. 
  Due to geological, historical and cultural causes, the gap 
has always existed. Among the 328 poverty-stricken counties, 
295 are in the central and western regions. 
  NPC deputies from the central and western regions said that 
it is necessary to adopt a realistic attitude towards the gap 
and narrow it through hard, long-term work. 
  Cheng Kejie, chairman of the people's government of the 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said: "The same policies of 
reform and openness apply to the central and western regions as 
well as to east China. This should be our point of departure 
for narrowing the gap." 
  Yunnan Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang pointed out, "An 
economy that depends on state support, on an egalitarian policy, 
or on a mandatory division of market has neither vitality nor 
future." 
  A policy researcher from Gansu Province said, the central 
and 
western regions should develop through market competition and 
improvement of efficiency, though state assistance and support 
from eastern areas are indispensable for the time being. 
  In the past 10 days, top Chinese leaders exchanged views 
with 
NPC deputies of some 20 provincial-level delegations, of which 
the overwhelming majority are from central and western provinces 
and regions. The leaders have repeatedly underscored the 
central authorities' concern for the economically underdeveloped 
areas. 
  A number of motions submitted to the current session demand 
that narrowing the gap between the east and the rest of China be 
slated for economic legislation and that economic laws include 
support for economically underdeveloped areas. 
  In short, accelerating development of central and western 
regions is a consensus reached at the current NPC session. 
  The central and western regions account for 89 percent of 
China's land area, people there take up 64 percent of the 
national population, and borderline extends more than 20,000 
kilometers. 
  Some NPC deputies said, the central and western regions have 
opportunities and advantages to accelerate development. With 
implementation of the new opening up strategy, the vast central 
and western regions will play a role of growing importance. 
  Rich natural resources are another main advantage of the 
central and western regions. A guideline for China's economic 
development in the next decade is to shift the energy- and raw 
material-gobbling industries to areas which have rich energy and 
other natural resources. 
  The industrial shift will bring opportunities for western 
areas. For instance, Qinghai Province will have the unique 
advantage of developing power, mining, metallurgical and salt 
chemical industries. 
  Many deputies pointed out, the large number of old 
enterprises, military industrial firms and strong technological 
force in the central and western areas provide a sound basis for 
attracting overseas funds. 
  Some deputies from the western regions have identified their 
deficiencies in comparison with eastern areas. Cui Lintao, 
mayor of Xian city in Shaanxi Province, said that the eastern 
areas have mobilized, organized and made good use of economic 
factors such as labor, professionals, technology and funds while 
in the rest of China, especially in Shaanxi Province, many 
economic factors are lying idle or being wasted. "This should 
be solved from the causes of the system and concepts," he said. 
  The Chinese Government has decided to implement a program 
rooting up poverty and helping the 80 million people below the 
poverty line have sufficient food and clothing by the turn of 
the century. NPC deputies expressed their hearty support for 
the program. 
  They said economic development in the central and western 
areas should give priority to agriculture, especially the 
construction of water conservancy projects. They also stressed 
the development of local resources and rural enterprises. At 
present rural enterprises in the central and western regions 
accounted for only 35 percent of the national total. 
  The State Council has decided to earmark loans to support 
rural enterprises in central and western regions from 1993 to 
2000. 
  Moreover, the Ministry of Agriculture has worked out a 
program to promote cooperation of rural enterprises between the 
east and the rest of China, including 100 pilot cooperative 
zones and 1,000 pilot projects. 
  Some economists among the NPC deputies said that such 
cooperation will benefit both sides. With the development of 
productive forces, new industries, products, technology and 
management expertise should shift from the east to other parts 
of the country. Otherwise, further development in the east will 
be impeded. 
  Jiangsu Province Governor Chen Huanyou said the coastal 
provinces must find the driving force for their economies from 
the central and western regions if they want to maintain a 
long-term high growth rate. "Without development of the central 
and western parts, development of the eastern areas will be 
restrained in the long run," he added. 
  Jiangsu, which has developed processing industries but lacks 
natural resources, has established good relations with Xinjiang 
Uygur and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions and Gansu and Shaanxi 
Provinces in the northwest. It has provided skilled workers, 
equipment, technology and information while setting up a number 
of enterprises to develop local resources. 
  Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said the cooperation of the eastern 
part with the rest of China means integration of advanced 
technology, financial resources and management experience in the 
east with rich raw materials, energy and labor force in the rest 
of the country. The integration will promote development of 
rural enterprises in the central and western areas while 
expanding new channels for the east to adjust its industrial 
structure and update products. 
  Deputies from Shanghai and coastal provinces such as 
Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang and Shandong said they have 
established various economic ties with central and western 
regions. 
  Deputies from the central and western regions have also 
reported encouraging news of their economic progress during the 
current NPC session. Many sleepy, remote border towns have 
become busy trade centers. 
  When talking with deputies from Shaanxi Province, Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji said that the vast central and western 
regions have a great potential. The economic takeoff of China's 
central and western regions is the country's hope in the 21st 
century.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- When China set the 
goal to invigorate state-owned enterprises years ago, 
farmer-turned entrepreneurs reacted with indifference since they 
did not regard state enterprises as their rivals on the market. 
  Times have changed, however. At the current session of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), rural entrepreneurs among the 
NPC deputies claimed, "rural enterprises will face fierce 
challenges from state-owned enterprises in fair market 
competition." 
  Li Xianguo, an NPC deputy from northern Jiangsu and a 
farmer- 
turned entrepreneur, used a vivid phrase to express his sense of 
crisis -- "When the tiger comes down from the mountains, what 
can the monkey do?" 
  Li is the general manager of the Zhaonian Industrial 
Corporation, a rural enterprise in the suburbs of Xuqian city. 
His corporation has 13 factories building ships, making steel 
window frames and processing grain. 
  In Li's parlance, "the tiger" refers to state-owned 
enterprises and "the monkey" refers to rural enterprises like 
his own. He was talking about state enterprises entering the 
market and constituting a challenge to rural enterprises. 
  Rural enterprises created by farmers came into China's 
economic arena as a new, sudden rising force in the 1980s and 
gradually developed to take a one-third share of the national 
economy. 
  Last year rural enterprises produced 3,000 billion yuan 
worth 
of products and made pre-tax profits of 300 billion yuan. 
  Today, 20 million rural enterprises nationwide have become 
"reservoirs" that absorb rural surplus labor as well as "money 
bags" for farmers. By the end of last year rural enterprises 
had employed 110 million farmers. Two-thirds of farmers' 
increased income comes from rural enterprises. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng said in his government work report, 
"If the countryside is to become moderately prosperous, it is 
essential to develop township and village enterprises." 
  Rural enterprises' role in ensuring social stability in 
rural 
China, boosting its economy and narrowing the gap between urban 
and rural areas cannot be ignored. 
  The reason why rural enterprises have developed rapidly is 
that they have management flexibility which state-owned 
enterprises lack and that they outpaced state-owned enterprises 
in entering the market when the latter emphasized production to 
the neglect of sales. 
  When reforms are changing the way state-owned enterprises 
operate and creating conditions for them to compete on an equal 
footing with their rural counterparts on the market, the latter 
are beginning to feel the heat, in terms of market share and 
relative advantage. 
  Li Guilian, a woman farmer-entrepreneur from northeast 
China, 
said, "We rural enterprises outdid state enterprises when their 
hands and feet were bound by central planning. Previously we 
had the advantage of being flexible; and now they are becoming 
more flexible, too. We and state enterprises now face the same 
market and are at the same starting point. Rural enterprises 
will have a hard time ahead." 
  Li is the chairman and general-manager of the Dayang Garment 
Company Group in Liaoning Province. Her enterprise was started 
14 years ago by dozens of women farmers with their own sewing 
machines. Today, the company group employs 7,000 people and has 
42 factories with total assets of 510 million yuan. Fourteen of 
its 16 garment factories have used foreign investment and export 
90 percent of their products. Last year their foreign exchange 
earnings amounted to 56 million U.S. dollars. 
  Li, 48, who is an NPC deputy for a second five-year term, 
said, "I often tell my workers that rural enterprises are now 
under the threat of a mountainous wave. We must learn swimming 
in the big wave to avoid being buried." 
  Many farmer-turned entrepreneurs maintain that rural 
enterprises are in a disadvantageous position because of their 
scattered distribution and small scale. An overwhelming 
majority of rural enterprises are located in villages, with only 
12 percent in towns and one percent near county seats. They are 
far from markets and ill-informed. 
  Moreover, they are innately deficient in terms of equipment, 
technology, management and worker quality. 
  With the introduction of a new tax system, rural enterprises 
have lost their previous tax breaks. Other factors have also 
eaten into their erstwhile advantages: more expensive land 
resulting from a state policy on paid use of all land, more 
expensive labor, more expensive loans resulting from more 
channels of lucrative investment for idle money. 
  Farmer-turned entrepreneurs maintain that, faced with 
challenges, rural enterprises in different localities and with 
different capabilities will feel different degrees of pressure. 
For instance, well-established rural enterprises in the south 
and coastal areas are more adaptable to the challenges. 
  Li Xianguo from Jiangsu Province said that since rural 
enterprises have outpaced state-owned enterprises in entering 
the marketplace, they have more highly qualified salesmen and 
are not overburdened by retirees. 
  Li Guilian from Liaoning Province said that, since the 
market 
system is improving, it is possible to compete on a fair basis 
according to laws of the market. Rural enterprises are also 
granted with export right. The new tax system makes her company 
sustain an additional tax of three million yuan, which she said 
is acceptable. Last year her company paid 10 million yuan in 
taxes. 
  You Junming, president of the Jiangsu Hongyu Group Company, 
a 
rural cosmetic enterprise, said his company will adapt to the 
challenges with calm, by expanding scale, introducing a 
shareholding system, modernizing management and opening 
international markets. 
  Wu Renbao, manager of the Huaxi Industrial Corporation in 
Jiangsu Province, said that, in market competition, rural 
enterprises and state-owned enterprises have more cooperative 
opportunities and they can share their advantages and seek 
common development under common interests. 
  In his government work report, Chinese premier emphasized 
that the government will continue to support township and 
village enterprises, especially in the central and western 
regions. To this end the government has already adopted a 
series of measures.

<F P=106> ["Jottings on the Two Sessions" by reporters Zhang Jinsheng </F>
(1728 6930 0524) and Li Anding (2621 1344 1353): "The Dialectics 
of the Scale and Amounts of Investment"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- When discussing the 
excessively large investment scale -- a major contradiction in 
the country's current economic operations -- deputies attending 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC] focused their discussions on the scale and amounts of 
investment -- they tried to use this dialectical relationship to 
ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. 
  Last year, China's total investment accounted for nearly 50 
percent of the country's national income, and the investment 
structure was irrational. Then, just how big an investment 
scale is appropriate? The deputies said we should follow the 
principle proposed by experts in this field -- that is, the 
proportion of a nation's investment should be decided based on 
the nation's economic development stage, the level of its 
economic development, and its current economic development 
conditions. If the investment scale is too small, it is 
difficult for its economy to develop rapidly. If the investment 
scale is too large, its industrial production will inevitably 
grow at a high speed, directly resulting in excessive currency 
issuance and acute shortage of funds, consequently prompting 
sharp increases in the prices of capital goods and retail 
prices. The scale of investment has a direct effect on whether 
a basic balance can be maintained between the total supply and 
the total demand -- we must never underestimate its effect. 
  In investing, another problem warrants our attention -- that 
is, we should properly handle the amounts of investments. The 
deputies were of the opinion that good steel should be used for 
making the knife's edge -- we should use more funds for 
developing the "bottleneck" industries, such as the 
transportation, communications, energy, and raw and processed 
materials industries, which have impeded the country's economic 
development; and should not invest a lot of money in building 
luxury houses and recreational facilities and in real estate 
development. In other words, we should refrain from doing 
things that are not in line with the country's current economic 
development level and the people's living standards. The 
deputies said: We should do things according to economic law and 
set our eyes on the overall situation and long-term objectives. 
We must invest more where we need to and resolutely curtail 
investment where we need not to invest large amounts -- we must 
not put the cart before the horse.

  [Text] As early as 1982, during talks with Margaret 
Thatcher, Comrade Deng Xiaoping hit the nail on the head when he 
pointed out that there might be major man-made disturbances 
during the transitional period before Hong Kong's return to 
China, and these disturbances would be created not just by 
foreigners--chiefly the British--but also by the Chinese. In a 
recent interview with station correspondent Li Xiaoqi, Zhou Nan, 
member of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee and director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch, 
specially spoke about Comrade Deng Xiaoping's farsightedness and 
great insight as regards the Hong Kong issue. 
  Zhou Nan said: [begin recording] With his farsightedness 
and great insight, Comrade Xiaoping long ago said we are not 
worried about the future of Hong Kong after 1997, because the 
Chinese people and their government will honor their words after 
1997. What we are worried about is the transitional period. As 
of (?1984) there were still more than a dozen years before the 
transitional period came to an end. He was worried that 
problems might occur during this time. Some might try to create 
disturbances. He particularly mentioned that these disturbances 
could be created chiefly by the British. Further, he also issued 
certain warnings to the British, asking them not to engage in 
certain acts such as removing all money reserves or wasting 
money in a flagrant manner. At the same time, he also warned 
them not to attempt to put together a ruling apparatus to impose 
on the special autonomous region. It turned out these are the 
very things the British are doing. Everything Comrade Xiaoping 
warned them about doing at the time has been done by them. [end

  [Text] Listeners, there are only three years left before 
the Chinese Government begins to exercise China's sovereignty 
over Hong Kong. Over 100 years of British colonial rule in Hong 
Kong will soon end. In light of Britain's uncooperative 
position, and pursuant to a National People's Congress [NPC] 
Standing Committee decision, the Preliminary Working Committee 
of the Preparatory Committee [PWCPC] of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] has begun its work. 
  Speaking about Premier Li Peng's instructions to the PWCPC 
in 
his government work report, Zhou Nan, PWCPC vice chairman and 
director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch, said: [begin 
recording] The PWCPC has become operational, entering the stage 
of practical work. Its main mission is to guarantee Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability in the last stage of Hong Kong's 
transitional period, and to ensure a smooth transition in 1997. 
This is its major task. The PWCPC will undertake effective 
preparations for the SAR Preparatory Committee. The PWCPC 
shoulders a grave responsibility. However, I do not envision any 
unsurmountable difficulties. As a result of Chris Patten's 
fracas, Hong Kong compatriots have obtained a deeper 
understanding of Chris Patten's true face. For people across 
the country, it is a living education in patriotism. I believe 
we can successfully carry out the tasks entrusted to us by the 
NPC Standing Committee, live up to the expectations of people 
across the country, and complete preparations for Hong Kong's 
triumphant return to the motherland and the Chinese Government's 
exercise of sovereignty over the region. We are confident of 
accomplishing these tasks. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By station reporter Yang Fan; from the "NPC and CPPCC </F>
Special Sessions" program -- passages within quotation marks 
recorded] 
  [Text] Listeners and friends, the party and government 
have always showed much concern for the productivity and lives 
of people in impoverished areas, and attached much importance to 
aiding them. Tremendous achievements have been made in the work 
since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee. In particular, since reform and opening up, the 
party and government have taken various measures to strengthen 
work for helping the poor. For example, funds have been 
increased and traditional means of helping the poor have been 
readjusted and improved to change the nature of such work from a 
relief to a development orientation. 
  It has been proven in practice that implementing 
development-oriented work for aiding the poor by taking into 
account market demand, relying on scientific and technological 
progress, as well as developing and utilizing resources of 
impoverished areas to promote commodity production, not only can 
solve the problem of inadequate supplies of food and clothing, 
but can also help get rid of poverty and encourage prosperity. 
Currently, the measures have fairly rapidly changed the outlook 
of a considerable number of long impoverished areas. 
  However, as China is a fairly large country with different 
local situations and unbalanced development, progress in some 
areas is still fairly slow and a number of people have yet to be 
extricated from poverty. In particular, a small number of 
people in especially poor areas are still living under very 
difficult conditions. 
  Recently, the State Council formulated a program aimed at 
extricating 80 million people from poverty in seven years, and 
declared a final war against poverty. During the ongoing two 
sessions [the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress and the Second Session of the Eighth Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference National Committee], this 
station reporter Yang Fan interviewed State Councillor Chen 
Junsheng, head of the State Council's Leading Group for the 
Economic Development of Impoverished Areas. 
  Yang Fan: "Mr Chen, I am a reporter from the China National 
Radio. One of our government's major tasks this year is to help 
impoverished people. Can you tell us what the government's 
tasks are in this regard?" 
  Chen Junsheng: "The goal of our program for aiding the poor 
is to extricate 80 million people from poverty in seven years. 
We will help them solve the problem of inadequate food and 
clothing. We will help them get rid of poverty and ultimately 
become prosperous and achieve a comfortable standard of living. 
We should not wait until the next century, but must accomplish 
this task within the present century."

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, a top 
leader of China's Armed Forces, today urged the Army to better 
support the government and cherish the people, and the 
governments to better support the army and cherish the people. 
  Liu, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said 
that strengthening the unity between the Army and the government 
and between the Army and the people is essential to the success 
in reforms and economic growth, and to China's political and 
social stability as well. 
  Both the Army and the people should make concerted efforts 
to 
promote ideological and cultural progress, he said. 
  Committees of the Chinese Communist Party and governments at 
all levels must pay close attention to agriculture and rural 
work, particularly grain and cotton production, he said in a 
group discussion about the government work report with deputies 
from Hebei Province to the National People's Congress. 
  Liu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the 
Political 
Bureau of the party Central Committee, described agriculture as 
an issue closely related to China's long-term stability. 
  "At present, we must arouse farmers' initiative for 
production and help them achieve relatively comfortable living 
standards," he said. 
  To this end, it is imperative to relieve farmers' financial 
burdens and enable them to gain tangible benefits, he added. 
  The leader said that many major state-owned enterprises are 
military factories, adding that the government is formulating 
new measures to help these factories manufacture civilian goods 
and solve their problems in operation. 
  Liu Huaqing also asked local governments to educate the 
local 
people in patriotism and collectivism in the course of speeding 
up reforms and opening wider to the rest of the world.

<F P=106> [Article by XINHUA correspondent Lou Wanghao (2869 2598 </F>
4110) and XINHUA reporters Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 2639) and 
Liu Haimin (0491 3189 3046): "Xinjiang's Three Chairmen Discuss 
Unity"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Mar (XINHUA) -- "The Han Nationality 
cannot live apart from minority nationalities, and minority 
nationalities cannot be separated from the Han nationality." 
  "The greater the unity among various nationalities, the more 
secure reform and development. Xinjiang attests to this point." 
  Xinjiang deputies Ismail Amat, Tomur Dawamat, and Abulaiti 
Abudurexiti made these remarks when they met together at the 
ongoing National People's Congress [NPC] session. Their 
discussion invariably reverted to the topic of strengthening 
unity among various nationalities. 
  Ismail Amat, currently state councilor and minister in 
charge 
of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, was formerly 
chairman of the Sixth Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional 
Government. Tomur Dawamat, currently vice chairman of the 
Eighth NPC Standing Committee, was formerly chairman of the 
Seventh Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Government. Abulaiti 
Abudurexiti was recently elected as chairman of the Eighth 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Government. They are good 
friends and native-born Uygur cadres, who have devoted 
themselves to Xinjiang's social construction. When they got 
together during the current session, they talked about 
Xinjiang's past, present, and future, particularly dwelling on 
the importance of strengthening unity among various 
nationalities, which is the cornerstone of national stability 
and unity. 
  Ismail Amat said: "Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report 
got it right and struck a chord with people of various 
nationalities. The report was especially on target regarding the 
question of unity and stability." 
  Tomur Dawamat and Abulaiti Abudurrexiti nodded in agreement 
and said: "Tuohela, tuohela (Uygur for `that is right')." 
  The three men found time to get together during a break from 
the deliberation of the Government Work Report by the Xinjiang 
delegation. Ismail Amat said insightfully: "Ours is a united, 
multinational country. Strengthening unity among various 
nationalities serves the fundamental interests and reflects the 
common aspirations of people of various nationalities across the 
country. Xinjiang is a multinational region where the task of 
promoting unity among various nationalities is vitally 
important. Practice has proved this truth. When our task of 
promoting unity was successful, our society would enjoy 
stability and our economy would develop rapidly." 
  Tomur Dawamat added: "Unity among various nationalities in 
Xinjiang has stood the test and is firmly founded." He made a 
gesture and said: "Since reform and opening up, Xinjiang's 
economy has been on an upswing, with the agricultural sector 
reaping bumper harvests for 16 consecutive years and the people 
enjoying ever-improving living standards. What did we rely on? 
The party Central Committee's correct leadership aside, a very 
important factor has been unity among people of various 
nationalities, without which Xinjiang would not have found 
itself in a favorable situation characterized by prosperity. 
Today, people of various nationalities in Xinjiang are 
increasingly aware that the Han nationality cannot live apart 
from minority nationalities, and that minority nationalities 
cannot be separated from the Han nationality." 
  Abulaiti Abudurexiti, who is attending the session as a 
nonvoting delegate, worked at the grass-roots level for many 
years after graduation from university. He grew soulful when 
discussing this matter. He said: "Unity among people of 
various nationalities is the prerequisite and guarantee for 
national stability and development. Without unity, there would 
be no rallying power and we would not be able to accomplish the 
tasks entrusted to us by history. Xinjiang's development in 
recent years testifies to this point." 
  Ismail Amat said in a ringing and forceful voice: "While 
people of various nationalities should show unity, there is a 
greater need for leading cadres of various nationalities to lead 
the way in promoting unity. This is an important aspect of our 
work." 
  "Tuohela!" 
  "Tuohela!" 
  The other two leaders nodded their approval. 
  These are sincere words that reflect true feelings; they 
also 
convey the wishes of 16 million people of various nationalities 
in Xinjiang.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] A provincial leader of poverty-stricken Gansu has 
shrugged off the central Government's order for a slower pace of 
economic growth. 
  Lu Ming, a vice-governor, said Gansu needs a more rapid 
growth rate to lift the people out of abject poverty. 
  He said: "(Vice-Premier) Zhu Rongji can make his criticism. 
We will be going ahead with our own plan. We are so poor that 
(a slow growth rate) should not be applied to us." 
  "Gansu is a piece of land without God's blessing," he 
lamented, referring to the poor physical condition of the 
central province. 
  Rain has fallen mainly on the mountainous area in the 
eastern 
part of the province while the vast plains to the west, suitable 
for cultivation, have been scorched by drought. 
  The average annual income of farmers in Gansu last year 
stood 
at 550 yuan (HK$488). Four million people, most of whom live in 
the mountainous area, earned less than 400 yuan. They are part 
of the 80 million people across the nation classed as not having 
enough food and clothing. 
  Mr Lu said the only way to solve the problem was to quicken 
the speed of reform towards building a market economy. 
  "Now that the central leadership has abandoned the planned 
economy and adopted the road of the market economy, it is a 
golden opportunity for us. 
  "We will promote the growth of the private economy," he 
said. 
  Unlike ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet, 
where there are racial disputes, Gansu has not been a priority 
on the list of recipients of subsidies from the central 
government. 
  "Funding is our major problem. Our annual total revenue is 
about 5.3 billion yuan. But very little is left for 
construction after paying salaries (for government workers). 
  "We will have to rely on local funds. There is more than 
seven billion yuan in the hands of the people." 
  Mr Lu is hoping the modest funds will be pooled and used in 
the most cost effective way to enliven the economy. 
  The poor region will also take measures to keep the funds of 
local enterprises in the province, following an outflow of 
capital to the coastal region for speculative activities such as 
real estate development last year. 
  Mr Lu believed that the momentum of growth in Gansu would be 
no less than in other regions of the mainland. 
  "Our growth rate this year will be an average figure for the 
nation. I believe that will be above nine percent. We will 
stick to nine percent as the starting point, but we hope to go a 
bit faster," the provincial leader said. 
  "China is at the early stage of industrialization... The 
phenomenon of part of the population getting rich first will 
exist. 
  "We (were the first to) raise the issue of the gap in income 
between the west and east. Efforts from both the central 
Government and the regions are needed if we want to solve the 
problem," he said.

<F P=106> [By reporters Xu Jiangshan (1776 3068 0810) and Gao Shuhua </F>
(7559 3219 5478)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- At the Beijing 
International Hotel this morning, Sun Weiben, chairman of the 
Heilongjiang Provincial People's Congress [PPC] Standing 
Committee, and Lu Chuanzan, chairman of the Hebei PPC Standing 
Committee, answered Chinese and foreign reporters' questions on 
issues concerning local people's congresses. 
  Commenting on difficulties in supervising "local 
governments, 
courts, and procuratorates," Sun Weiben said that the biggest 
problems are people's concepts, understandings, and habits. On 
the one hand, people's congresses have to develop their skills 
in executing their supervisory tasks; on the other hand, "local 
governments, courts, and procuratorates" need an adjusting and 
accepting process for such supervision. He said that at present 
they are gradually resolving the problems. 
  Chinese and foreign reporters were concerned what powers 
local people's congresses have and how they use them. Lu 
Chuanzan provided a four-part answer to a reporter's question. 
He said: First, the Hebei PPC has made major progress in 
legislative work. As of the end of 1993, the Hebei PPC and its 
standing committee have formulated and approved 92 local laws 
and regulations; have made 19 legal resolutions and decisions; 
and have approved 6 autonomous regulations for autonomous 
counties. The total number was 117. Second, the PPC exercises 
its supervisory power over "local governments, courts, and 
procuratorates," mainly by hearing and deliberating their work 
reports, and by organizing deputies to inspect and examine the 
enforcement of laws and regulations, and to evaluate their work 
performance. Third, the PPC discusses and decides major issues 
affecting its various administrative areas. Fourth, the PPC 
chooses, appoints, and dismisses leaders of local state organs 
according to law. 
  A reporter asked: What issues has local legislation 
emphasized? Sun Weiben answered: Between 1979 and 1993, the 
Heilongjiang PPC has formulated 98 local laws and regulations, 
mainly relating to economic tasks. The number of economic laws 
and regulations accounted for 60 percent of the total number of 
formulated regulations. Besides, our legislative work has also 
stressed promoting scientific and technological progresses and 
achievements. The general requirement is that our local 
legislation on economic tasks should basically enhance the 
establishment of a socialist market economy. 
  A reporter, interested in Sun Weiben's concurrently holding 
posts as secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party 
Committee and chairman of the Heilongjiang PPC, asked him how he 
handled the relations between the two posts. Sun Weiben said: 
The two posts, in principle, do not conflict with each other. 
Both the party's guiding principle and the people's congress's 
work objectives aim at the same end. As the party committee and 
the executive organs differ in their natures and work styles, 
their functions are not interchangeable. The provincial party 
committee supervises "local governments, courts, and 
procuratorates," mainly by implementing political and 
ideological principles; whereas the PPC mainly supervises the 
enforcement of laws and regulations and work performance of 
"local governments, courts, and procuratorates."

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (CNS) -- The future status of 
Shanghai as an international financial centre can in no way 
replace Hong Kong's status, but the two cities will have a 
complementary relationship with each other, deputy to the 
National People's Congress and acting president of the Shanghai 
branch of the Bank of China Mr. Liu Jinbao said today. He added 
that the advantages resulting from a place in the international 
market by Shanghai and Hong Kong would play an irreplaceable 
role for China's economic development. 
  Mr. Liu said that he believed both places had their own 
merits. Shanghai as a financial centre in the Far East since the 
1930s has seen a vast annual amount of imports and exports by 
reason of its sound geographical location. The municipality now 
boasts a strong economic base with many financial professionals. 
The 350-sq. kilometre Pudong economic development zone will be 
of great economic might with branches of 28 foreign-funded banks 
and representative offices of 60 other foreign-funded banks 
there at present, ranking the municipality first among the 
cities in the country in terms of the number of such 
establishments. 
  Shanghai, however, cannot replace Hong Kong as an 
international financial centre in Far East Asia for several 
reasons, including, first, the well-established financial system 
in Hong Kong which had made it an international financial centre 
widely recognized for its sound operation. The territory 
possesses a free port, the gathering of professional personnel 
in various fields and good investment and geographical location, 
while Shanghai cannot develop into a free port in near future. 
  Second, Shanghai is scheduled to become an international 
financial centre by the year 2010. Before that date, the 
municipality can only be a domestic financial centre and lag 
behind Hong Kong for at least 20 years. 
  Third, once the municipality becomes an international 
financial centre, the Chinese government will have no intention 
of replacing Hong Kong with Shanghai nor will it weaken the 
territory's function and status. It is recognized that the two 
places can at the same time do good to China with their status 
in the international financial market. 
  The Shanghai government, according to Mr. Liu, has called 
for 
the removal of the headquarters of the Bank of China to the 
municipality. He, however, believed that such an idea was 
loaded with difficulties, including communications and transport 
which are yet to be improved. The idea could, however, be 
achieved in two phases involving first the removal of the 
international department of the bank to Shanghai and then the 
department as well as capital would go to Hong Kong after 1997, 
while the headquarters remained in Shanghai. Such a move had 
precedents in the international community with Japan, for 
example, where many banks have their headquarters in Osaka, 
while their international businesses departments remain in Tokyo.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese leader Qiao 
Shi paid a visit to Fujian and Xinjiang deputies to the Eighth 
National People's Congress (NPC) here today. 
  Qiao, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and one of the 
top seven leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, said that 
Fujian Province has developed rapidly thanks to the reform and 
open policies and efforts made by local people and officials. 
  He hopes that Fujian provincial authorities will help old 
revolutionary bases, mountainous areas and other poor places 
develop economy and get rid of poverty. 
  Talking with deputies from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, 
Qiao said that Xinjiang is not only the biggest region in land 
area in China, but also has a very important strategic position. 
  Bordering on Central Asian countries, Xinjiang is inhabited 
by many minority nationalities and abounds in coal and petroleum 
resources. 
  He urged the region to strengthen unity of all nationalities 
and develop its economy and other undertakings. 
  On relations with neighboring countries, Qiao said that 
China 
will develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis 
of the five principles of peaceful co-existence and cooperation 
of mutual benefits so as to provide favorable international 
conditions for China's modernization program.

<F P=106> [Article by XINHUA reporters Wang Haizheng (3769 3189 1767) </F>
and Li Pei (2621 3805): "Walk Out of the Basin To Join in the 
Orderly Flow -- Sichuan Deputies Freely Discuss the `Wave of 
Laborers'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- Last year, 5 million 
peasant laborers from Sichuan remitted more than 5 billion yuan 
to the "land of plenty" after a year's hard work. 
  Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party 
Committee and a deputy to the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC], told the reporters: Premier 
Li Peng's government work report stated: A rational flow of 
labor is an objective requirement for and an inevitable trend in 
economic development. We should actively steer this flow and 
strengthen our management in an organized and step-by-step 
fashion. Premier Li Peng's remarks are amply correct. A 
rational and orderly flow of labor, rather than a haphazard and 
unrestrained one, will not only satisfy the demands of 
economically developed regions but will also help people in less 
developed regions cast off poverty and become well-to-do. 
Sichuan is a densely populated farming province with 93 million 
peasants. In carrying out rural work, Sichuan should develop 
village and town enterprises and export labor services while 
stabilizing grain output, increasing revenue, and making 
structural readjustments. What we need to do is to provide 
active guidance and intensify our efforts to manage and serve 
the labor market. 
  In recent years, the massive flow of surplus rural labor to 
the cities turned into a "wave of laborers," gradually becoming 
one of the hot topics of concern to people in all circles. Some 
deputies from Sichuan said: The "wave of laborers" has indeed 
created strong pressure for railways, public security, 
communications, and labor departments. However, this is a 
problem that has surfaced in the course of reform and 
development and should therefore be solved through the means of 
reform and development. We should provide guidance through such 
measures as speeding up communications and urban construction 
projects, developing small towns, and improving rules and 
regulations governing labor markets and related matters. 
  Sichuan Governor Xiao Yang said: Large labor-exporting 
counties that each provide more than 100,000 laborers and earn 
100 million yuan have sprung up in Sichuan Province. Every 100 
outbound laborers can help one village cast off poverty. Rural 
laborers working outside the province can save grain, earn 
money, and even "be educated" in that they bring back technology 
and information; some of them even set up enterprises after 
returning to their hometowns. Regions that bring in such 
laborers gain even more benefits because the laborers help fill 
the "gap" in their work forces, lower production costs, and 
accelerate economic development. This is the "third wave" of 
rural labor migrating to other regions since the promotion of 
the household contract responsibility system with remuneration 
linked to output and the ascendancy of village and town 
enterprises. Some deputies maintained: Compared to the 
"journey to the Northeast" and the "trip through the western 
gateway of the Great Wall," today's "wave of laborers" is no 
longer a flight from famine to eke out a living elsewhere but an 
"offensive" launched of the laborers' own accord in the quest 
for a comparatively comfortable living standard. Deputy Zuo 
Mingzhong said: "Peasant laborers, peasant laborers! They have 
contributed to reform. [no closing quotation marks as received] 
In dealing with the "wave of laborers," we should follow the 
example of Li Bing [an ancient water conservancy expert] and his 
son in repairing the Dujiang Weir, properly steering the wave to 
ensure that it will become a rational and orderly flow, rather 
than a haphazard and unrestrained one.

<F P=106> [Interview with Heilongjiang Governor Shao Qihui by reporter </F>
(Yang Zhaopan); place and date not given; from the "News and 
Press Review" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] Listeners, since the opening of the sessions of the 
National People's Congress [NPC] and the National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], 
the 20-character principle, namely seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability, has become the consensus of deputies and 
members. (Yang Zhaopan), correspondent of this station, 
interviewed Deputy Shao Qihuai, governor of Heilongjiang 
Province, on this principle. 
  [Yang] Governor Shao, the central authorities have proposed 
the principle of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability as the overall interests for the work of the entire 
party and state. Could you talk about your views on this issue? 
  [Shao] The central authorities' 20-character principle 
concerning the overall interests not only tallies with the 
national situation, but also completely conforms to the 
(?overall) situation. The essence of the 20-character principle, 
namely opportunity, reform, opening up, development, and 
stability, is brought up in a definite and appropriate way. For 
example, seizing the opportunity. As opportunities do not last 
long, we must seize them. As far as Heilongjiang is concerned, 
a very important opportunity for the province these years has 
been the central authorities' (?policy) concerning opening up 
border areas. By opening up border areas, Heilongjiang has made 
significant development in economy and foreign trade over the 
past years. I have noticed that the central authorities are 
particularly concerned with the problems of agriculture and 
large- and medium-sized enterprises. Under the current 
situation, we should seize the opportune time at which the 
development of agriculture and invigoration of large- and 
medium- sized enterprises are proposed by the central 
authorities to boost the development of these two sectors in 
Heilongjiang. 
  As for deepening reform, reform has been launched for a 
decade or so; how we should deepen reform is [words indistinct]. 
Talking about opening up wider, although Heilongjiang Province 
has been stepping up the pace of opening up border areas in the 
past few years, the key lies in opening up to all directions. 
After all, we cannot attach importance to opening up border 
areas only, and ignore countries in Southeast Asia and Latin 
America. Therefore, the central authorities [words indistinct] 
proposed this year that we open up border areas on the one hand, 
and open up to Southeast Asia and Latin America in an all-round 
way on the other. 
  [Yang] Governor Shao, what is your view about correctly 
handling the relations among reform, development, and stability? 
  [Shao] I believe the handling of relations among the three 
is not only to address problems in the past, more importantly it 
is to set a higher standard and demand social and economic 
development in the new situation. To properly handle the 
relations among reform, development, and stability, I believe we 
must face actual [words indistinct] and problems, think them 
over and reform them. There are indeed some problems among 
reform, development, and stability that have plagued us for a 
long time. The key to solving these problems lies in developing 
the tertiary industry step by step. For example, Heilongjiang 
Province has reaped bumper harvests in agriculture for several 
years in a row, and attained expected results every year. It 
should have [words indistinct]. On the contrary, however, 
peasants' incomes did not increase rapidly and Heilongjiang's 
revenue is getting worse. This means there is no healthy cycle 
among production, development, and stability. This problem has 
something to do with properly handling the relations among the 
above three things. Therefore, the proposal of correctly 
handling the relations among reform, development, and stability 
has (?addressed the actual problem). Why are the relations 
among the three not handled properly sometimes? The crux of the 
matter lies in the criteria for work, and whether reform and 
development can be assessed by the three criteria as proposed by 
Comrade Xiaoping? As far as reform is concerned, we cannot 
reform for the sake of reform and oversee the (?overall 
interests) for the partial needs. Therefore, I think the key to 
properly handling the relations among reform, development, and 
stability lies in tackling the actual problems and adopting a 
definite criterion.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Shanxi is rich, as it 
supplies four fifths of the coal under unified state 
distribution in China. 
  Shanxi is also poor, as its Luliangshan region is one of 
China's 18 major poor regions. Among the province's 118 
counties, cities, and districts, 14 are national-class and 36 
are provincial-class poor counties. This is a harsh reality 
that Shanxi must face during the course of development. 
  Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee 
and NPC deputy, discussed the topic and talked a great deal 
about new options for future development. 
  Hu Fuguo said: We have made proper readjustments of the 
province's development strategy. It can be summed up into eight 
words, "coal excavation, electricity generation, road 
construction, water diversion." 
  Hu Fuguo said: Shanxi is a major energy source province. 
Our strategy for developing the energy industry is to enter the 
market, reduce bottleneck restrictions, engage in a fairly 
large-scale operation, make rational exploitation, do intensive 
processing, and advance toward the world market. In accordance 
with this strategy, Shanxi basically accelerated its 
construction of energy and chemical industry bases last year. 
  On the strategy of emphasizing both coal and electric power, 
Hu Fuguo said: Shanxi will take advantage of its coal to 
develop the electric power industry. With the State Planning 
Commission's approval, we recently started the construction of 
Yangchuan No. 2 Power Plant and the Liulin Power Plant, bringing 
the total capacity of power generating projects under 
construction in Shanxi up to 3.6 million kw. At the same time, 
the Yangcheng Power Plant will be built with imported technology 
and equipment and with funds from outside the province. During 
the first stage of its construction, generators with a total of 
2.1 million kw capacity will be installed. The preparatory work 
for its construction is being stepped up. After completion, it 
will supply electric power exclusively to Jiangsu Province. 
Feasibility reports on building power plants in Hequ, Wangqu, 
and Hejin have been prepared. Shanxi's thermoelectric power 
generating capacity will double by the end of the century. 
  Hu Fuguo said: The construction of roads and water diversion 
projects is in full swing in the province. The Taiyuan-Yulin 
first- class highway has been completed and is open to traffic. 
The construction of two express highways and three second-class 
highways has started in an all-around way. By 1997, Shanxi's 
highways will be able to transport annually more than 100 
million tonnes of goods out of the province. The construction 
of the Wanjiazhai project for drawing water from the Huanghe has 
started. After completion, the project will solve Shanxi's 
water shortage problem once for all. The Taiyuan airport and 
railroad are under renovation. 
  On the province's abundant coal resources, Hu Fuguo said: It 
will not do without excavating coal, but coal excavation alone 
cannot solve all our problems. The establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure has created a development opportunity 
for an energy-rich province like Shanxi. Complete decontrol of 
coal prices will help rationalize Shanxi's coal management 
system and create new opportunities for Shanxi's enterprises to 
accumulate capital funds and develop themselves. The 
establishment and development of the production-factor market 
will make it possible to market electricity as a commodity and 
will enable us to realize the strategy of emphasizing both coal 
and electric power industries. Shanxi's electric power 
development will enter a golden age. So long as we seize the 
development opportunity, new progress will be made in Shanxi's 
economic construction.

1150 7893)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- Jia Qinglin, secretary 
of the Fujian provincial party committee and governor who is 
attending the ongoing Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress here, said: As a result of China's opening up 
wider to the outside world, Fujian has formed an export-oriented 
economy. 
  As one of China's pioneer provinces that began implementing 
the opening-up policy, Fujian currently has special economic 
zones, economic and technological development zones, coastal 
open cities, coastal economic open areas, Taiwan investment 
zones, free trade zones, new and high-technology industrial 
development zones, national tourist resorts, and scores of 
minidevelopment zones that have been totally funded and operated 
by foreign investors. Fujian topped China's provinces in their 
levels of opening up, in providing various types of services, 
and in involving provisions of various policies. As of the end 
of 1993, Fujian has approved nearly 13,000 foreign-funded 
enterprises. Foreign businessmen have actually supplied more 
than $5.98 billion of funds for investment projects, and the 
number of the three types of partially or wholly foreign- owned 
enterprises that have begun operations and production totaled 
more than 5,700. 
  Jia Qinglin said: Fujian's 1993 gross domestic product [GDP] 
increased 25.4 percent over that of 1992, thereby quadrupling 
the 1980 GDP seven years ahead of schedule. Meanwhile, Fujian 
has improved its industrial structure; production and sales have 
grown simultaneously; and efficiency has risen remarkably. 
Fujian's 1993 financial revenues were more than 10 billion yuan 
for the first time, up 48 percent over that of 1992. Further 
progress in its export-oriented economic sector was a major 
factor favorably enhancing Fujian's economic development: 
Fujian's total 1993 export value was $5.7 billion, or 53 
percent of its GDP. Foreign investors have actually supplied 
more than $3 billion of funds, and their investments on fixed 
assets amounted to 43.8 percent of Fujian's total investments on 
fixed assets. The output value of the three types of partially 
or wholly foreign-owned enterprises that have begun operations 
amounted to 24 percent of Fujian's total industrial output 
value. More than 50 percent of the output value newly created 
in 1993 has been propelled by the export-oriented economic 
sector. 
  The export-oriented economic sector has undoubtedly played a 
crucial role in facilitating Fujian's economic development. 
Since the beginning of 1994, the export-oriented economic 
sector has been developing favorably, even though China began to 
implement new measures including new tax systems and a 
dual-track system on foreign exchange rates [hui lu bing gui 
0565 3764 1629 6510]. During January and February 1994, the 
three types of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises 
that have newly contracted to supply $1.33 billion of foreign 
funds have actually supplied $380 million, up 11.2 percent and 
49.5 percent respectively over that of the same period in 1993. 
Fujian's total export value was $840 million, increasing 44.1 
percent over that of the same period in 1993. In 1994, Fujian 
plans to reach $7 billion in export value and to use $3.5 
billion of foreign funds; both figures are considerably higher 
than that of 1993.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The building of a 
socialist market economy is indispensable of macro-economic 
control and necessary measures to the effect does not mean 
following the old road of planning economy. 
  This has turned out to be consensus reached by the deputies 
to the ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC). 
  Necessary macro-control measures reflect the actual needs of 
the current Chinese economy with initial features of the market 
economy, some deputies held. Under such circumstances, it is 
impossible to bring the economy completely onto the track of the 
market economy at one stroke on the basis of decades-long 
practice of the planning economy. 
  To some extent, market economy is in essence an economy 
under 
a developed legal system and characterized of fair competition, 
no matter in a socialist or a capitalist country, said Tao 
Dayong, a noted economist from the Beijing delegation. 
Therefore, the development of a socialist market economy 
without strengthening macro-economic control will give rise to 
economic disorder. 
  Wu Shuqing, president of Beijing University and also a 
renowned political economist, said China started its 
modernization drive from a comparatively backward economic base. 
If China develops its economy by relying on the economic 
evolution out of its course, the market economy process will be 
longer and harder and the economy will be in no way competitive 
in the world. 
  Facing the imminent task of curbing inflation and the 
disorderly capital investment, forceful macro-control measures, 
including some administrative means, will be entirely necessary 
and proper, some deputies said. In this aspect, the central 
bank should effectively control money supply and stabilize money 
value. 
  The deputies voiced unanimous support to the various reform 
measures with regard to strengthening macro-control including 
the introduction of the tax-revenue sharing system, which they 
said is one of the most important elements in the whole 
macro-control system. However, the system should proceed 
steadily as it might exert more financial pressure on 
enterprises, those in coastal areas in particular, deputies from 
the coastal areas said. 
  To effect a less uneven economic development between the 
east 
and west parts of the country, appropriate macro-control 
measures will help bring about a comparatively balanced economic 
development towards common prosperity, a provincial governor 
from northwest China has said. 
  While agreeing the macro-control measures will be of benefit 
to the national economy as a whole in long-term prospective, 
some of the measures will possibly cause temporary financial 
problem in the immediate future, deputies from the 
underdeveloped regions said. 
  For example, more investment will flow to coastal areas once 
commercial banks to be established start operation because the 
investment returns there is much better than in the west parts 
of the country. As a remedy, some deputies from the west 
suggested that preferential monetary policies be introduced and 
that development banks with more competitive rates and 
exclusively for western parts of the country be established.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng is always seen carrying a small notebook during the ongoing 
session of the National People's Congress (NPC) whenever he 
attends group discussions by NPC deputies. 
  He took notes while listening to opinions and suggestions 
voiced by deputies about his report on government work. 
  During the past eight days, the premier has attended 
discussions by seven deputy delegations. 
  According to one of his aides, 18 pages of the premier's 
notebook have so far been filled, with the opinions and 
suggestions of 34 deputies. 
  Said the premier: "The National People's Congress provides a 
good opportunity for government officials to learn about popular 
concerns." 
  During the same period, Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji, Zou 
Jiahua, 
Qian Qichen and Li Lanqing, and other members of the cabinet 
also joined deputies in their discussions and listened to their 
opinions. 
  On many occasions, the premier made a point of inviting 
deputies from grassroots units to speak up, and those invited 
did not refrain from speaking their mind. 
  Li jot down the main points of whatever they said, be they 
criticisms or suggestions. 
  The premier said: "Some problems raised by the deputies 
cannot be solved immediately, but their opinions are good for 
revising the government work report and reducing errors in our 
work." 
  No matter how busy he is during the day, the premier always 
sorts out his notes at night, the aide said. 
  As early as when he worked in the former Ministry of Water 
Conservancy and Power Industry, Li Peng had the habit of taking 
notes, according to those familiar with the premier. 
  Since he took office as premier, Li Peng has always carried 
a 
notebook wherever he goes, even on his visits to foreign 
countries. Besides the notebook, the premier has an electronic 
calculator with him, which he uses to check figures and amounts 
for "quantitative analyses."

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- China must continue to 
resolutely wage an anti-corruption campaign, this is a consensus 
reached by deputies attending the National People's Congress 
(NPC) now in session and members of the National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). 
  They agreed that initial successes have been achieved in the 
anti-corruption campaign throughout the country. 
  However, eradication of corruption remains an arduous task 
for a long time to come because corruption has infiltrated into 
almost all aspects of social life. 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning provincial party 
committee, said that the anti-corruption campaign is crucial for 
China's economic growth and long-term stability. 
  "Therefore, we must do everything within our power to make 
the campaign a success," he said during a group discussion. 
  Both NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members 
emphasized the importance of viewing the anti-corruption 
campaign from the height of correctly handling relations between 
reform, development and stability. 
  Feng Tiyun, a CPPCC National Committee member and 
vice-minister of supervision, said that some officials abuse 
their power for personal gains through loopholes in legal, 
supervisory and managerial systems. 
  He called these officials "borers of reforms and opening 
up," 
noting that they must be punished according to law. 
  With regard to anti-corruption measures to be taken in the 
future, the deputies and members called for efforts to perfect 
China's legal system and establish an effective supervisory and 
restraint system. 
  Gu Jinchi made a three-point proposal in that regard: 
  -- It is necessary to clearly define the duties and 
functions 
of CPC committees and governments at all levels and establish a 
supervisory system; 
  -- It is imperative to establish and perfect an open and 
standardized system regarding the use and management of 
personnel, public money and materials, and subject 
administrative power holders to supervision by the people; and 
  -- It is necessary to institute a system under which leading 
officials will declare their incomes. 
  Han Peixin, chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
Jiangsu 
Provincial People's Congress, said that many corruptive 
phenomena have resulted from disciplinary problems in the style 
of work of officials. 
  For this reason, it does not suffice to crack down on 
corrupt 
officials only in the economic area, he noted. 
  The eradication of corruption requires the solution of deep- 
rooted problems in political life, with the key lying in 
perfecting the personnel system, he added. 
  Li Jinpei, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National 
Committee, proposed promoting the anti-corruption campaign by 
tightening legal restraints, improving supervisory measures, 
increasing civil servants' salary and stepping up ideological 
education.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The Environmental 
Protection Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), 
China's parliament, will be renamed the Environmental and 
Resources Protection Committee of the NPC. 
  The Third Meeting of the Presidium of the Second Session of 
the Eighth NPC today adopted a bill on changing the name of the 
committee submitted by the NPC Environmental Protection 
Committee, and a draft decision on the bill submitted by the 
secretariat of the session. 
  Both the bill and the draft decision will be submitted to 
NPC 
delegations for deliberation. 
  In the bill, the environmental protection committee said 
that, since its establishment, many government departments and 
people have regarded it as being engaged primarily in 
environmental protection, thus paying little attention to the 
committee's work aimed at protecting natural resources. 
  The bill says China now faces serious problems in terms of 
natural resources, including shortages of water resources, 
insufficient farmland resources, vegetation damage, soil 
erosion, desertification and a decrease in the number of 
wildlife. 
  The bill describes the damage and waste of resources as a 
major factor causing environmental pollution. 
  That is why it is necessary to combine legislation and 
supervision in the field of resources protection with those in 
the field of pollution control to make sure that the 
Environmental Protection Committee will be able to better 
perform its duties and functions, the bill says.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese who even 
did not know what joint ventures were 15 years ago are now 
exploring various ways to absorb foreign investment. 
  They are now experimenting with establishing foreign-funded 
shareholding companies, using the BOT (build-operate-transfer) 
mode in infrastructure projects and establishing foreign-funded 
trust and investment and foreign investment companies. 
  China has so far approved establishment of 170,000 
foreign-funded enterprises, of which about half have gone into 
operation, and used 60 billion U.S. dollars in foreign 
investment. 
  Now the Chinese have begun to think deeply over how to use 
foreign investment more efficiently and push ahead the opening 
up program to a higher level while opening wider. 
  This new tendency can find expression in discussions among 
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) on the 
government work report at the current NPC session. 
  China began to open to the outside world in the late 1970s 
and since then five special economic zones have been established 
in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen cities and Hainan 
Province. 
  Shenzhen Mayor Li Youwei and Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi 
maintained that under the new situation, special economic zones 
should pay due attention to readjusting the foreign investment 
structure and develop new and high-tech industries. 
  In the future, while continuing serving as showcases for 
absorbing foreign investment, technology and management 
expertise, special economic zones should fully play an exemplary 
role to other areas in establishing a socialist market economy, 
boosting economic growth by relying on science and technology 
and exercising economic management according to law, Hong 
Yongshi said. 
  As a step to open wider to the outside world, China 
successively opened 14 coastal cities, cities along the Chang 
Jiang River and borders and inland provincial capital cities, 
and Pudong New Development Area in Shanghai. 
  Since then an all-round opening up pattern has taken shape 
in 
China. 
  Under such a situation, opening wider not only means opening 
more fields for foreign investment and opening domestic markets, 
but also means priority of preferences will be shifted to 
industries instead of to certain regions. 
  NPC deputies from economically under-developed central and 
western areas made a strong call for opening their areas wider 
to the outside world, saying this is a major measure to narrow, 
step by step, the gap between economically developed eastern 
areas and western areas. 
  Wang Youjie, secretary of Luohe city party committee in 
Henan 
Province, called for pushing ahead with opening in various 
fields in central and western areas, while deputies from Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shaanxi Province suggested such 
areas attract foreign investment to develop agricultural and 
animal husbandry, communications and energy and exploit their 
abundant resources. 
  What the deputies suggested coincides with policies the 
Chinese Government is preparing to institute. These policies 
are explained by Chinese Premier Li Peng and State Planning 
Commission Minister Chen Jinhua in their reports to the current 
NPC session. 
  Another Chinese senior leader further explained that to 
encourage central and western areas to use foreign investment 
and encourage flow of foreign investment into infrastructure and 
basic industries are the "same thing in essence." 
  During a group discussion with NPC deputies from Gansu 
Province, Hu Jintao, member of the Political Bureau Standing 
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, 
emphasized the significance of opening to the development of 
central and western areas, saying that opening wide can promote 
development. 
  State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises afflicted 
with 
difficulties have been a difficult problem for the Chinese for 
years. Jin Zhezhu, vice-governor of Jilin Province, an old 
industrial base, and an NPC deputy, pointed out that to actively 
use foreign investment for technical renovation for enterprises 
is an important approach to raise efficiency of state-owned 
enterprises. 
  To make sure that the opening program moves towards a higher 
level, many deputies said, efforts should be made to perfect 
relevant laws and regulations and more attention be paid to 
assimilation of imported advanced foreign technology while 
improving investment environment. 
  Chen Bingzhen, professor of Qinghua University, maintained 
that in importing foreign technology, the old practice of 
importing by different channels, redundant, blind and disorderly 
import of overseas technology and equipment and import of 
isolated parts should be abandoned. 
  Deputies expressed their belief that along with the opening 
moving towards a higher level, China will expand its scale of 
using foreign investment, technology and advanced management 
expertise, and will be more mature and efficient in this regard. 
China's economy will converge with the world economy in a 
faster pace.

<F P=106> [Recorded video report on the 12 March news conference of </F>
the Ministry of Agriculture sponsored by the press center for 
the Second Sessions of the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC) and Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC); from the program: 
"Special News From the Second Session of the Eighth NPC"] 
  [Text] [Unidentified moderator] The press center for the 
NPC and CPPCC National Committee sessions holds its second news 
conference here today. We are glad to invite several 
responsible persons of the Ministry of Agriculture to answer 
your questions on China's agriculture, as well as rural economic 
reform and development. Attending today's news conference are 
Minister Liu Jiang as well as Zhang Yanxi and Wan Baorui, vice 
ministers of the Ministry of Agriculture. You are now welcome 
to raise questions. 
  [NONGMIN RIBAO correspondent] I am a correspondent from 
NONGMIN RIBAO [PEASANTS' DAILY]. I would like to ask Minister 
Liu Jiang these questions: How do you view the current 
situation in agriculture? What kind of new work plans does the 
Ministry of Agriculture have? Thank you. 
  [Liu] China's agricultural and rural situations were good 
last year, as demonstrated by the series of figures in Premier 
Li Peng's Government Work Report. Last year our grain output 
posted a record high, exceeding the previous feat and effecting 
an overall balance in supply and demand. Output increased 
across the board for products included in the "vegetable basket" 
project, as we term it, such as meat, poultry, eggs, milk, fish, 
vegetables, and fruit. The development of high-yield, 
high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture accelerated 
further. Village and town enterprises enjoyed synchronized 
development in their growth rates and economic returns. 
Peasants saw continued growth in their incomes, a lessening of 
their burdens, and bigger steps being taken in reforming the 
system of grain procurement and marketing. The cooperative 
share-holding system and the integrated management of trade, 
industry, and agriculture were developing in the right 
direction. There remained some agricultural problems in spite 
of a relatively good situation in agriculture and rural economic 
development. The major ones were the relatively slow growth in 
peasants' income; the declining relative efficiency of 
agricultural production, particularly grain production; 
inadequacies in measures to support, protect, guide, as well as 
regulate and control agriculture; and a somewhat unstable 
grass-roots system and contingent of personnel for popularizing 
agricultural techniques. Turning to our work plans for 1994, we 
intend to center our work on rural reform and development. The 
focus of our work can be summarized into paying attention to 
these three areas: 1. Developing the rural economy; 2. 
Reforming the rural economic structure; 3. Increasing peasants' 
income. In paying attention to developing the rural economy, we 
will focus on the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing 
crops; the production of products included in the "vegetable 
basket" project; and the development of village and town 
enterprises. In paying attention to reforming the [rural] 
economic structure, we will mainly lay stress on improving the 
system of overall regulation and control of agriculture, 
maintaining the basic stability of the farm produce market and 
prices, pushing on with the building of a market system centered 
on the wholesale markets for agricultural and sideline products, 
and further advancing the development of the rural cooperative 
share- holding system, and the integrated management of trade, 
industry, and agriculture. In paying attention to increasing 
peasants' income, we will, after stabilizing and increasing 
grain and cotton production, mainly continue to safely readjust 
the setup of production; develop high-yield, high-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture; lessen the burden on peasants; and 
do a good work in aiding the poor through developing production. 
  [REUTERS correspondent] Some southern provinces saw a drop 
in grain output last year. I would like to know how many 
provinces in China are now suffering from a shortfall in grain 
production and are relying on supply from other provinces. 
  [Liu] At a recent national work conference on aiding the 
poor, General Secretary Jiang Zemin talked about the issue of 
rice shortages in the south. He addressed the need to maintain 
an overall and regional balance in supply and demand. As we 
have reaped bumper grain harvests over the past few years, we 
began to readjust the agricultural structure last year, or 
rather the year before. As part of this campaign of readjusting 
the agricultural structure, the grain mix has been readjusted 
under the precondition of maintaining the aggregate supply. We 
were, therefore, still able to turn out a record grain output in 
1993 while readjusting the structure of production. Last year's 
grain production was marked by growth in the north which 
included substantial increases in wheat, corn, and soybean 
production; and an output drop in the south. The southern 
region suffered from a paddy shortage, as it had carried out 
readjustment mainly in (?early rice) plantation. As asked by 
the REUTERS reporter just now: what are the actual numbers of 
provinces needing grain supply from other provinces and of 
supplying provinces? In general, about 10 provinces and 
municipalities are receiving grain, 10 provinces and 
municipalities are supplying grain, and another 10 provinces and 
municipalities are basically maintaining a balance. 
  [Central Television correspondent] I am a correspondent 
from Central Television. Minister Liu, as you mentioned in your 
statement just now, peasants' incomes grew at a relatively low 
rate over the past few years. Can you explain the reasons? 
What measures do you intend to take to continually increase 
peasants' incomes in the future? Thank you. 
  [Wan Baorui] There are three main reasons behind the slow 
growth. The farming efficiency of peasants, particularly those 
planting mainly grain, is relatively low, thus affecting their 
income. This is one reason. The second reason is the lack of 
career choices for peasants. Peasants in most rural areas, 
except those along the coast, concentrate on the sole business 
of planting, which cannot provide enough jobs for the entire 
work force. The third problem is the present rise in the cost 
of the means of production which eats into peasants' income. 
These three reasons all contribute to the relatively slow 
growth of peasants' incomes. At present, we are taking six main 
measures to increase peasants' incomes: 1. To appropriately 
raise the prices of farm produce; 2. The state, [words 
indistinct], and individual localities must all increase 
investment in agriculture; 3. To readjust the setup of 
production to develop high-yield, high-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture; 4. To integrate production, 
supply, and marketing of crop-farming, animal husbandry, and 
processing of farm produce; 5. To emphatically develop 
secondary and tertiary industries, and in particular village and 
town enterprises; 6. To carry out the plan for extricating 800 
counties from poverty within seven years [ba qi gui hua]. 
Peasants' income will be increased mainly through these six 
measures. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a correspondent from Hong 
Kong. I would like to ask Minister Liu about the state plan to 
set up an agricultural development bank this year. What impact 
will this policy bank have on national agricultural development? 
  [Liu] The State Council recently decided to form the 
Agricultural Development Bank of China, which will serve as a 
policy bank. The existing Agricultural Bank of China will 
become a commercial bank. The policy bank will play a positive 
role in increasing the injection of agricultural credit funds, 
guaranteeing the prompt extension and effective use of 
policy-related loans, and strengthening the state's overall 
regulation and control of agricultural production and 
circulation of farm produce. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What measures will the Ministry 
of Agriculture take this year to guarantee a steady and 
sustained growth of the so-called vegetable basket? 
  [Zhang Yanxi] For the period ahead, the Ministry of 
Agriculture will attach even greater importance to work related 
to the vegetable basket. We intend to continue paying attention 
to this matter from three aspects. First, we will continue 
taking good charge of production development. Second, we will, 
in coordination with commerce departments, take good charge of 
the establishment of a market system centered on wholesale 
markets. Third, we will help peasants and agricultural 
production units develop the integrated management of 
production, supply, and marketing, so as to forge even closer 
relations between production and management. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a correspondent from 
France. Mr. Minister, you said you had made various efforts in 
agriculture, but last year many peasants continued to leave the 
countryside for urban areas. Do you have specific figures on 
the flow of peasants or any plans to take whatever measures to 
deal with this issue? 
  [Liu] This problem is known in China as tides of laborers 
from rural areas. This problem is caused by two basic factors 
in the country -- the large population and limited land 
resources in rural areas, and the differences between urban and 
rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, in 1993 about 
50 million people left their homes to work, including 20 million 
who left their homes to work in provinces and regions other than 
their own. There are about 430 million rural laborers in China 
today. Owing to the fast development of village and town 
enterprises, 112 million former rural laborers are now employed 
in these enterprises. In recent years, the number of rural 
laborers these enterprises employed was increasing by about six 
million annually. 
  Nevertheless, the rural areas still have some surplus 
laborers. Because of the development zones and the many 
processing industries established along coastal areas in 
southeast China, many farmers in central and western China are 
moving to coastal areas and cities, causing the annual outflow 
of 50 million people, including the 20 million who leave their 
own provinces and regions, each year. For this outflowing 
population, we follow the principle of guiding, enlightening [su 
dao], and serving them. We have also taken some measures to 
make the flow more rational. Moreover, we plan to set up a 
consolidated, nationwide labor market to regulate the supply and 
demand of laborers between cities and rural areas. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter from the U.S. 
WALL STREET JOURNAL. You just mentioned that you have taken 
some measures for increasing the purchase of grain and cotton. 
It is likely that the purchase of these products will decline 
this year? To what extent will it decline? Moreover, has last 
year's problem of IOU's been completely resolved? Have there 
been any other measures taken to prevent the recurrence of this 
problem? Thank you. 
  [Liu] Let me answer your last question first -- the IOU 
problem. We have taken care of this problem which occurred in 
the agricultural sector in 1993. Now, no more IOU's have been 
given for agricultural purchases. Now for the question about 
purchasing quantities: we fulfilled the 1993 state plan for 
grain purchase but we did not fulfill the state plan for cotton 
purchase. This is primarily because the plan set for cotton 
production was not fulfilled as a result of natural disasters 
and smaller acreage for cotton last year. We only fulfilled 70 
percent of the cotton purchasing target. This lady [the WALL 
STREET JOURNAL reporter] and many other reporters have asked the 
question about the balance of total grain supply and demand. 
Let me answer your question with some figures. Last year when 
I attended a conference of the FAO [UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization], I gave a report on China's grain output in recent 
years. Comparison of the statistics released by the FAO and 
China shows that, on average, China produced 31 kg of every 
additional 100 kg of grain the world produced during the 12- 
year period from 1980 to 1992; and that China produced 40 kg of 
cotton, 34 kg of oil-bearing crops, 37 kg of aquatic products, 
and 54 kg of meat of every additional 100 kg of these goods the 
world produced during that 12-year period. That is to say, 
except for cotton, the production of which declined in China in 
1993, the output of all other crops -- cereal and oil bearing 
crops, aquatic products and meat -- exceeded the average. The 
Chinese population now accounts for 22 percent of the world 
population. In other words, the output of the goods mentioned 
above was proportionally higher than 22 percent. This also 
shows that the Chinese people's living standards are improving, 
and the quantities of agricultural and livestock products they 
consume far exceed the world average even though China's 
population is increasing by 15-16 million each year. At a time 
when the Chinese people are striving for better living 
conditions and a comparatively comfortable life, I think the 
vast number of hard-working Chinese farmers as well as 
intelligent and capable scientists and technicians can, under 
the leadership of the CPC Central Committee headed by Jiang 
Zemin, accomplish the historical mission of improving their 
livelihood and becoming comparatively well off.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Local legislatures 
will expand their role as a watchdog of the people while 
stepping up their law-making work in the process of building a 
socialist market economy, leaders of two provincial people's 
congresses (PPC), or legislatures, said here today. 
  Sun Weiben, chairman of the Heilongjiang PPC, said at a 
press 
conference that local legislatures have the right to supervise 
local governments, courts and procuratorates according to a 1993 
amendment to China's Constitution. 
  The Heilongjiang PPC, he said, assesses the performance of 
the provincial government by listening to its work reports and 
examining its enforcement of laws and regulations. 
  While legislatures' supervision has been carried out 
smoothly 
at all levels of governments, courts and procuratorates, he 
said, government institutions have yet to take greater 
initiative to accept supervision by local people's congresses. 
  "A major obstacle comes from people's understanding of the 
role of people's congresses. On the one hand, people's 
congresses have to be more mature in exercising their 
supervisory power; on the other hand, local governments, courts 
and procuratorates need time to become accustomed to such 
supervision," he said. 
  Lu Chuanzan, chairman of the Hebei PPC, said that local 
people's congresses play their role in four fields: lawmaking, 
supervision over the work of local governments, decision-making 
for local major issues, and election of officials and personnel 
appointment. 
  "The provincial people's congress has the power to appoint, 
elect and dismiss government officials, including the governor, 
and the province's top judge and procurator," he said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- When interviewed by this 
reporter at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress, Tian Qiyu, vice minister of public security and an NPC 
deputy, said that public security organs will work hard to 
create a social environment favorable for reform, opening up, 
and economic construction. 
  Tian Qiyu said: The situation of China's public security can 
be summed up in three sentences: 1) Society is generally safe 
for reform, opening up, and economic construction; 2) the number 
of criminal offenses, especialy major, heinous crimes, is 
increasing; and 3) in certain areas, the public security is 
poor, crimes are rampant, and people feel unsafe -- just as 
Premier Li Peng noted in his government work report. 
  Tian Qiyu said: The major reform measures the state will 
carry out in the financial, taxation, banking, and investment 
sectors this year certainly will bring about all-around social 
progress. But we must also realize that, compared with those 
introduced in the last decade or so, the reform measures to be 
introduced this year are both the largest in number and the most 
difficult to carry out, and society certainly will feel some 
pains because of their introduction. We must have sufficient 
understanding of this problem. 
  Tian Qiyu said: Public security organs' main mission is to 
make all-out efforts to maintain political and social stability. 
Public security organs will continue to come down hard on 
criminal offenses; give priority to "cracking major cases, 
striking criminal gangs, and pursuing fugitives;" and carry out 
special, priority crackdown projects in a way appropriate to the 
local situations. In areas where problems of public security 
are conspicuous, collective county, city, or even more 
widespread campaigns will be organized to crack down on crimes. 
Priority will be given to cracking down on murder, robbery, 
theft, and organized crimes. In rural areas, hooliganism 
jeopardizing local safety will be harshly punished according to 
law. A fight against guns, narcotics, smuggling, and illegal 
emigration will be launched in some provinces and municipalities. 
  Tian Qiyu said: This year we also underscore the need of 
setting higher goals for cracking cases. We will crack more 
major cases, step up prosecution of cases that have been 
cracked, act more efficiently in handling cases, enforce the law 
strictly, and firmly correct the problem of reducing penalties, 
such as accepting fines in lieu of imprisonment. 
  On controlling public offenses, Tian Qiyu said: Public 
security organs will give priority to controlling guns and 
explosives, and to controlling the floating population and 
crime-prone places. We will collectively put in order 
problem-ridden stations, ferry piers, trains, and recreational 
districts; increase the intensity of wiping out social viles; 
and continue to promote and improve the system of assigning 
policemen to patrol duty.

<F P=106> [Commentary from station correspondent (Cui Tong): "Greater </F>
Efforts Should Be Made To Change Government Functions"; from the 
"News and Press Review" program] 
  [Text] We have talked about changing government functions 
for several years. The conferees of the Second Session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and the Second Session 
of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] believe today it is 
more imperative for the government to change its functions 
during the accelerated shift from the old to the new economic 
structure. Government departments at all levels should do a good 
job in making the change with a greater sense of urgency. 
  In fact, changing the government functions means readjusting 
the government's functional powers so the administrative 
authority plays a more effective role. Presently some 
localities are not putting their efforts on changing government 
functions. Instead, they are making superficial organizational 
changes. An NPC deputy from Hebei said: Over the last two 
years, some county-level organizations have become even more 
overstaffed after so-called streamlining. Instead of reducing 
the number of departments, they have set up additional ones, 
which means an increase of personnel. So all the additional 
financial burdens created by the additional departments are put 
on the shoulder of the people. 
  Some deputies cited the procedures for examining and 
approving new projects submitted by enterprises as an example. 
It is a matter of course that an enterprise should assume full 
responsibility for its own projects, respective of whether they 
are feasible or profitable. However, our government departments 
are minding the business of enterprises, holding many meetings, 
and affixing many seals. Hainan deputy Ruan Chongwu likened the 
examining and approving procedures to theater entrance and 
ticket collectors. He said: Enterprises do not need to go 
repeatedly through many theater doors and one ticket collector 
after another. What they actually need is a better environment. 
The government's business is to improve its social management 
function and investment environment. Last year Hainan began the 
system of enterprise registration which has greatly simplified 
the formalities for establishing a new enterprise. 
  Similar reforms have been successfully carried out in 
Liaoning's Anshan and Fujian's Shishi. In the words of deputy 
Zeng Haorong, a common characteristic of these reforms is that 
the government has become very small and no longer minds other 
people's business, while the non-governmental sector has become 
very large and whatever problem should be solved by the market 
is being solved by the market. Premier Li Peng has explained 
very clearly in his government work report: The government's 
main function is to do a good job in macroeconomic regulation 
and control, overall coordination, and social management. For 
instance, planning and industrial policies which embody the 
macroeconomic regulation and control function must be formulated 
by the government. The government's responsibilities also 
include key construction projects which have a bearing on the 
national economy and the people's livelihood; protection and 
exploitation of natural resources; cultivation of the market 
system; maintenance of market order; improvement of social 
security; development of education, national defense, and public 
security; and combating corruption and promoting ethical 
integrity. 
  Deputy Huang Baozhang has worked in the Planning Department 
for many years. When asked whether he felt he had lost 
something after the change of government functions, he replied: 
I feel my job has become even more substantial because the 
Planning Department is taking on an even more important 
task--macroeconomic regulation and control. Now I can put more 
efforts on using industrial policies to readjust the economic 
structure and plan key construction projects; in the past, my 
job included examination and approval of trivial matters, such 
as the construction of a toilet. 
  Deputy Chen Shiwei said: In exercising macroeconomic 
regulation and control, the government must follow the law of 
the market economy; it must not interfere with economic 
development according to its subjective wish as it did in the 
past under the system of a planned economy. 
  Many NPC deputies and CPPCC members suggested the government 
should ensure social stability and development by means of 
administrative regulations, policies, planning, coordination, 
balancing, and sanctions. At the same time, the government's 
powers should be standardized. They earnestly hope government 
departments at all levels will make greater efforts to change 
their functions and improve their work efficiency, and will 
achieve greater success in this regard this year.

<F P=106> ["Commentary on NPC and CPPCC Sessions" by XINHUA reporters </F>
Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524), Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900), 
and Wang Haizheng (3769 3189 1767)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- In discussing issues 
related to Chinese economic development, deputies and members 
attending the Second Sessions of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] and the Eighth Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee held that 
while the country scored tremendous successes in economic 
development last year, some conspicuous contradictions and 
problems have cropped up. Hence, they proposed that in 
continuing to develop the economy, it is necessary to search for 
new ideas instead of following the trodden path of emphasizing 
speed alone. 
  In searching for new ideas for development, it is necessary, 
first of all, to proceed from the national strength and 
conditions in deciding a scientific rate of economic growth. 
Deputies and members said: Despite a marked increase in our 
overall national strength in recent years, the country's 
financial and material capabilities remain rather limited 
because of its low starting point. Therefore, we must decide on 
a growth rate and construction scale that are within our 
capabilities. Citing an example, deputies recalled the housing 
and real estate boom last year that led to a rush in the 
construction of luxurious apartments, tourist resorts, and 
modern recreational facilities in disregard of actual benefits, 
demands, and capabilities. On the surface, such a construction 
boom could accelerate the pace of development and improve the 
economy; but in actuality, it caused a series of problems, such 
as capital shortages, price increases, and strains on 
"bottleneck" industries. 
  Second, it is necessary to strive to develop the national 
economy with high efficiency and quality. Describing low 
efficiency and high growth rate as the most salient 
characteristics of a "bubble economy," deputies said: Local 
governments and enterprises should guard against one-sided 
emphasis of high output value and speed; and should concentrate 
efforts on upgrading technology, improving management and 
operation, developing new products, conserving energy to lower 
consumption, and tapping potential. To this end, they should 
adopt effective measures to raise major indices reflecting 
economic efficiency, such as the sales rate of manufactured 
goods, profit and tax payment rates of industrial capital, 
profit rates of costs and expenses, turnover rates of working 
funds, and all- personnel labor productivity. 
  Moreover, it is necessary to proceed from the realities of 
each locality, making the best possible use of favorable 
conditions and avoiding the unfavorable, and refraining from 
demanding a unified speed. Because of the vast differences in 
geographical locations and resources, economic development is 
extremely uneven throughout the country, with an enormous gap 
between the eastern and western regions. In developing the 
economy, localities should not pursue the same target and speed, 
but should proceed from local conditions in exploring the most 
effective way of developing local economy. For examples, 
Zhejiang should rely on Pudong's opening up and development in 
achieving new economic advances; Henan should transform itself 
from a major agricultural province with rich resources into a 
major industrial province as a motive force for scaling new 
heights in economic development; Sichuan should energetically 
develop transportation and communications as an important way to 
taking off from its southwestern region-oriented economy and 
converge its economy with the international market; and Gansu 
should expedite the development of village and town enterprises 
and help poor mountainous areas cast off poverty and become well 
off as this is crucial to narrowing the gap between the western 
and eastern regions. These measures for developing the 
economies, which correspond with the local realities, can avoid 
aimlessness, overcome one-sidedness, and allow each locality to 
develop on its own while ultimately contributing to an excellent 
situation characterized by a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy.

<F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA correspondents Min Fanlu (7036 0416 </F>
6424) and Li Anding (2621 1344 1353): "Stress Efficiency in 
Promoting `Healthy' Development -- Assessing the Relationship 
Between the Three Aspects of Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy 
Development From What Was Said at the `Two Sessions'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- China's economy has 
grown 13 percent for two years in a row. This figure is 
particularly striking at a time when the world economy is in a 
recession. To maintain the strong momentum in our country's 
economic development, in his government work report Premier Li 
Peng underscored the six- character principle of "sustained, 
rapid, and healthy" development. 
  The principle was formulated after careful consideration of 
the actual state of our country's economic development. The 
characters denoting "healthy" were recently introduced into this 
six-character principle. It is the most discussed element among 
National People's Congress [NPC] deputies and members of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], both during and after session. 
It is viewed as a sign of maturity in the guiding ideology for 
our country's economic construction. 
  The six characters constitute a dialectical unity and must 
be 
managed carefully. Seeking rapid development without regard to 
sustained and healthy growth will hamper much-sought-after 
progress, ultimately keeping us from proceeding rapidly. We 
should place greater emphasis on quality and efficiency than on 
quantity and growth rate. In the words of Tianjin deputy Gao 
Dezhan, we should actively create conditions and stress both 
quantitative and qualitative growth in economic development, 
placing greater emphasis on the latter, so as to truly shift 
toward the track of improving economic efficiency. 
  Healthy development and efficiency are interconnected. By 
taking "efficiency" as the central task, we can find a 
prescription for curing the on-again, off-again overheating in 
China's economy in recent years. The two characters denoting 
"healthy" are what people hope for and which serve as the 
prerequisite for sustained and rapid economic development. 
  What is meant by healthy development? This means adapting to 
market demands, stressing quality and efficiency, seeking 
realistic growth rates, and avoiding intermittent bouts of 
overheating and drastic fluctuations. CPPCC member Tian Yinong 
said in vividly descriptive terms: "Suppose the economy is a 
person with a fever. In the heat of an economic expansion, 
people would rush headlong into mass action, and this would 
result in an overextended investment scale. On the surface, the 
economy would seem to be developing rapidly and spectacularly, 
but once problems occurred, it would be subject to readjustment 
and would contract. This erratic pattern would cause tremendous 
losses, in effect slowing the economy." 
  Some aspects of our country's economy are clearly far from 
satisfactory, despite the rapid economic development of recent 
years. Hunan deputies Gao Jinping and Han Jian said: Some 
localities are now trying to find a solution through an expanded 
investment scale rather than through improved economic 
efficiency. Not to be outdone, various localities are vying with 
each other to start projects and seek fast growth rates. 
Shandong deputy Mu Chengze said: "Once in office, town and 
township cadres would take out loans, recklessly establish new 
organizations, start projects, and walk away before witnessing 
any results." These instances are not isolated cases. In the 
end, it is the state which suffers. This kind of development 
cannot be described as healthy. 
  According to information from the State Statistical Bureau, 
the total investment made in fixed assets in 1993 amounted to 
1,182.9 billion yuan, an increase of 50.6 percent over 1992; the 
annual increase was the largest since the 1980's. The deputies 
believe excessive investment causes fund shortages as well as 
greater "bottlenecks" and inflation. 
  The NPC deputies and CPPCC members felt enlightened by re- 
studying a passage of Comrade Xiaoping's brilliant exposition on 
economic efficiency: "In our economic development, we should 
strive to raise it to new levels every few years. Of course we 
are not encouraging unrealistically high growth rates. We 
should work in a down-to-earth manner, stress efficiency, and 
achieve a steady and coordinated development." Comrade Jiang 
Zemin has recently pointed out: "We should have new ideas for 
our development, and should truly switch it onto the track of 
enhancing economic efficiency. We must not continue taking the 
road of blindly seeking high output value and growth rates, and 
expanding the scale of investments." Shandong deputy Guo 
Xinzhang had the following to say: Development includes 
increased quantity and improved quality. Over the last several 
years, the stress of our work has been placed on solving the 
problems of insufficient total supply and of meeting the 
people's basic needs in food and clothing. Now, some localities 
should shift the stress to improving economic and product 
quality. Economic quality includes economic structure, economic 
efficiency, and labor quality. 
  It is precisely out of a consideration of enhancing economic 
efficiency and stressing healthy development that the State 
Council has set the 1994 growth rate at 9 percent. During their 
discussion of the government work report, the NPC deputies 
approved of the rate. They believe we will certainly make 
remarkable achievements with sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development so long as we maintain a healthy and genuine 9 
percent growth rate for a number of years in a row. 
  Stress on economic efficiency is not a new topic, but it is 
very difficult to ensure economic efficiency under the purely 
planned economic structure. Our national economy has already 
developed to a very large extent, and it cannot be further 
developed healthily with artificial arrangements. The 14th 
Party National Congress has made a policy decision on 
establishing a socialist market economic structure. In order to 
create the motive force for economic development, we must rely 
on market forces to distribute resources rationally, and we must 
stress economic efficiency. 
  While planning was law in the past, our production is now 
guided by the market demand. Such a change has made it possible 
for China to turn its "growth-rate-increase economy" into an 
"efficiency- improvement economy." During the change of 
operational mechanisms, many enterprises "turned to the market 
instead of the mayor" in order to solve their problems. NPC 
deputy and economist Li Boxi stated: Presently the economic 
efficiency of our investment is very low because investment 
ignores market demands. Many enterprises under construction are 
bound to be losers. When they are completed, there will be no 
market for their products, and a large quantity of their 
products will lie idle in warehouses. For this reason, we must 
reform the existing investment system and improve investment 
efficiency. The key to success in this regard is to change the 
government functions and allow enterprises to become the main 
investors. 
  How can we enhance economic efficiency and maintain healthy 
development? In pondering the question, many NPC deputies and 
CPPCC members tried to get an answer from structural 
readjustment and repeatedly emphasized optimization of the 
industrial structure. Deputy Ni Zhifu pointed out: China is a 
large country in which different regions have different economic 
foundations and natural resource conditions. Each region must 
consider its own reality and choose suitable main industries, as 
well as other related industries. At the same time, it is 
necessary to ensure the rational division of labor and 
cooperation among regions and avoid uniform industrial 
structures, so that all localities can give play to their 
strength and make effective and full use of their economic 
advantages and resources. Liaoning Governor and NPC Deputy Yue 
Qifeng discussed Liaoning's second economic progress. He said: 
In transforming an old industrial base, it is necessary to have 
new ideas and not to blindly follow other's practices. It is 
necessary to use high and new technology in developing a number 
of new enterprises and transforming a number of old enterprises. 
It is necessary to close down a number of old enterprises which 
do not merit transformation. It is necessary to constantly 
optimize the product mix and develop a number of 
technology-intensive products which are high value-added, highly 
marketable, bring high economic returns, and which will help 
promote the province's economic development. Deputy Wang 
Guangying, who is of noble character and high position, 
suggested the use of foreign capital and technology in 
invigorating inefficient large and medium state-owned 
enterprises. 
  Economic efficiency is inseparable from product quality, 
marketability, and after-sale service. During the two sessions, 
Deputy Ma Yue, who is general manager of the Dongfeng Automobile 
Company in Hubei, visited the Beijing service center of Dongfeng 
automobiles and Fukang-brand sedans to seek users' comments on 
15 March, which happened to be the "Consumer Rights Day." He 
said: In the past, enterprises were responsible for planning 
only. Now, they must be earnestly responsible to the users. If 
we do not enlarge the scale of production rapidly to lower costs 
and produce cars of a high level of technology, good quality, 
and reasonable prices to satisfy users, we will not be able to 
do anything but watch foreign companies seize all of China's 
automobile market. 
  Only healthy development is genuine development, and only 
effective development is genuinely healthy development. To put 
more effort into "healthiness" and efficiency is the common 
aspiration of the NPC deputies and CPPCC members attending the 
two sessions, as well as the common aspiration of the people 
across the country. If everyone in our country enhances his 
awareness of efficiency and tries in every possible way to raise 
economic efficiency, we will be able to promote the country's 
modernization in a sustained, rapid, and healthy way.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station reporter (Cai Xiaoling): "Let the </F>
Sprit of Law Enforcement Strike Root in Economic Life"; from the 
"News and Press Review" program] 
  [Text] Improvement of the legal system has been a focal 
topic at the National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] sessions year 
after year. In his latest government work report, Premier Li 
Peng again emphasized the needs for a sound legal system to 
guarantee the establishment and perfection of a socialist market 
economic system; and the necessity of governments at all levels 
to learn to use legal means to govern economic and social life. 
  We may as well say that notable achievements have been made 
in improving the legal system, especially economic legislation, 
over the past more than a decade. However, we should also 
realize that law enforcement and awareness in the Chinese 
economic life leave much to be desired. Many NPC deputies and 
CPPCC members have deplored a pervasive weak sense of law 
enforcement and failure to observe laws, strictly enforce them, 
and punish lawbreakers in economic life. In reality, 
legislation is important, but law enforcement is even more 
important. Failure to enforce laws is tantamount to 
lawlessness. Only by paying equal attention to law enactment 
and enforcement can the legal system serve as a guarantee for 
economic development. 
  Deputies and members said: At present, a considerable number 
of officials, including those directly engaged in economic work, 
often interpret market economy simply as free economy. As a 
result, lawbreakers are not aware of their violation of the law 
and, when confronted by law enforcement personnel, defend their 
actions with perfect assurance. There were even such strange 
occurrences of law violators adamantly filing law suits against 
baffled law observers. Apparently much remains to be done to 
enable the people to reach a consensus of identifying market 
economy with the economy ruled by laws. 
  It is heartening that the Eighth NPC and its Standing 
Committee have, since their inauguration, given top priority to 
accelerating legislation, especially economic legislation. Of 
the laws currently in force, some 170 were promulgated between 
the PRC's founding and the end of 1992. However, during their 
tenure, the Eighth NPC and its Standing Committee have planned 
to enact 152 laws. So far, a number of important laws for 
developing the market economy, standardizing the norms for the 
market, keeping the market in order, and tightening 
macroeconomic regulation and control -- such as the Company Law, 
the Law Against Unfair Competition, and the Law for Protecting 
Consumers' Rights and Interests -- have been promulgated; and 
efforts are being stepped up to formulate the Securities Law. 
Last year is the year in which the largest number of laws and 
decisions on laws were examined and approved since the founding 
of the country. We are convinced that along with the continuous 
improvement of China's legislative work, the concept of law 
enforcement will surely strike a deeper root in the hearts of 
the people and their economic life, and that the goal of 
establishing a socialist market economy will certainly be 
smoothly realized with the guarantee of a sound legal system.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (AFP)--At least two protestors 
Monday [21 March] scattered pamphlets in Tiananmen Square here 
as a group of delegates to China's parliament were passing, 
witnesses said. Police immediately grabbed the camera of an 
Agence France-Presse photographer who had taken pictures of the 
protest and opened it to expose the film. A plainclothes 
policeman filmed the entire incident. 
  Witnesses said several hundred people were gathered behind 
security barriers on the eastern side of the square to watch the 
delegates leave the parliament building when, about 10:45 a.m. 
(0245 GMT), the pamphlets were scattered by at least two 
protestors stationed at different parts of the square. 
Uniformed and plainclothed police, who have been controlling 
access to the square since parliament opened its annual session 
March 10, quickly moved to disperse the crowd and seal off the 
area. The pamphlets were also hastily gathered up. It was not 
known if any arrests were made. 
  Tiananmen Square was the scene of massive pro-democracy 
protests which were crushed by the Army during the night of June 
3-4, 1989. Since delegates from all over China arrived for the 
parliament session, dissidents and intellectuals have made 
several attempts to put across their pro-democracy and pro-human 
rights views. Three open letters have been sent to delegates, 
but Monday was the first time dissidents have openly defied the 
police. 
  Before the session began, police launched a massive campaign 
to intimidate opposition with the arrest of some 15 dissidents, 
forcing some of the better-known to stay away from the capital 
while parliament met. 
  In a separate development, a Chinese carrying a letter 
addressed to communist party and parliamentary leaders calling 
for democracy was arrested just after meeting journalists, 
several witnesses said. 
  Gao Hongming, a civil servant in his 40s, was detained by 
plainclothes police and pushed into a black car as he came out 
of the Jianguomenwai foreigners' compound on the east side of 
the capital in early afternoon. The letter, dated March 7, had 
already been sent to the party Central Committee and parliament, 
Gao said before his arrest.

<F P=106> [Dispatch: "The Ministry of Public Security Standardizes </F>
the Names and Codes of Coast Guard Boats"] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, 15 Mar (XINHUA)--To counter the chaotic 
state of marine antismuggling operations which began last year, 
in which some departments who were not involved in antismuggling 
operations were prompted by personal interests to send their own 
men to sea, leading to a number of incidents in which foreigners 
were involved, the Ministry of Public Security [MPS] issued the 
following regulations a few days ago: As of 1 April this year, 
coast guard boats that are responsible for marine security and 
antismuggling operations will all follow a standardized code 
system. Their boats are to be named in accordance with a 
nationally standardized code system beginning with "Public 
Security Border XYZ" and will be issued a forgery-proof "marine 
patrol duty pass" by the Ministry of Public Security. Duty 
personnel on board will all wear a uniform arm band for 
identification purposes. 
  Li Huan, deputy director of the MPS Frontier Guard Bureau, 
said at a coastal border guard seminar opening today that the 
standardization of boat names and codes and the requirement for 
duty personnel to wear uniform bands have been prompted by the 
need to rectify the marine situation and maintain order, and are 
part of the public security border units' effort to regularize 
their forces. A new and uniform identification system will help 
prevent other boats from going out to sea to hunt for smugglers 
while masquerading as public security border units. Domestic 
and foreign ships and the personnel on board can refuse [ke yi 
ju jue jie shou 0668 0110 2147 4815 2234 2392] to be inspected 
when a boat in violation of the above-mentioned regulation 
demands a provisional [lin shi 5259 2514] inspection.

<F P=106> [By Wang Huizhen (3769 1920 6297) and reporter Li Yin (2621 </F>
0692): "NPC Deputy Xiao Rong Says Deng Xiaoping Shows Great 
Concern for the NPC and CPPCC Sessions"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (JIEFANGJUN BAO) -- "Although my 
father, Deng Xiaoping, did not attend the NPC session as a NPC 
deputy, he is very concerned about the convening of the Second 
Session of the Eighth NPC and the Second Session of the Eighth 
CPPCC, as are all other deputies and people of all nationalities 
across the country." 
  Xiao Rong, an NPC deputy of the PLA, who had just hurried 
back home from Japan after participating in a ceremony for the 
first publication of the Japanese edition of the book My 
Father, Deng Xiaoping, made the above remarks in an 
interview with these staff reporters at the plenary session of 
the NPC delegation of the PLA today. 
  The reporters asked: "What is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
current health?" Xiao Rong said: "He is very health now. Of 
course, at his old age, he is not like he used to be. But for a 
90-year-old man, his health is not bad. He reads a dozen or so 
papers daily and he watches news bulletins on television. Like 
other NPC deputies, he also reads some documents about the 
current NPC session. 
  The reporters asked Xiao Rong whether Comrade Xiaoping also 
reads JIEFANGJUN BAO daily, and she said without hesitation: 
"Of course, JIEFANGJUN BAO is an important paper. My father 
has to read it every day because he is a veteran serviceman. 
From the Red Army to the Eighth Route Army to the PLA, and 
finally acting as the chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, he has always been very concerned about army 
building. Although he is retired now, he likes to read 
JIEFANGJUN BAO as he used to." 
  Xiao Rong also answered this question: "Why has Comrade 
Xiaoping spent the Spring Festival in Shanghai over the past 
seven years?" Xiao Rong said: "My father likes Shanghai. He 
attaches special importance to Shanghai's important position in 
China's reform and opening up and economic development. He 
thinks Shanghai's role cannot be replaced by any other place. 
During my father's stay in Shanghai over the last Spring 
Festival, he witnessed its huge changes and happily commented: 
`It's really good!' He had never said this before." 
  Then Xiao Rong smilingly recalled and said: When my father 
saw the newly built Yanggao road in Pudong he was very cheerful 
and composed an "impromptu poem:" "Seeing the road today is 
better than reading for one hundred years." At that time, I 
said: You've never composed a poem before, why have you come up 
with one today? My father said seriously: "These words are 
from my heart." As he said this, everyone on the spot laughed 
including Shanghai Municipal Party Secretary Wu Bangguo and 
Mayor Huang Ju. 
  Finally, the reporters asked: "When will the second volume 
of My Father, Deng Xiaoping, (whose author is Mao 
Mao, that is, Xiao Rong) which has long been expected by 
readers, be published?" Xiao Rong disclosed: "I am now making 
preparations to write the book."

<F P=106> ["Text" of 19 March RENMIN RIBAO Editorial: "Maintaining </F>
Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy Economic Development"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- The basic principle for 
the work of the whole party and country this year is, using 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as guidance, 
to thoroughly carry out the guidelines set by the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee; to quicken the step of building a socialist 
market economic system; to maintain sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development; to preserve political stability; 
and to promote progress in all social sectors. Party committees 
and governments at all levels should take their local reality 
into consideration; study the situation well; unify their 
thinking, steps, and action; and thoroughly carry out this 
guiding principle in a positive manner. 
  The current economic situation is good -- all localities 
have 
placed great importance on agricultural production, they started 
early and have paid great attention to it, and all measures 
taken have been quite effective. Industrial production has 
continued to grow rapidly and efficiency has improved to some 
degree; the state's key construction projects have been carried 
out smoothly; the consumer products market has been brisk and 
active; and people's lives have continued to improve. However, 
some difficulties and relatively conspicuous contradictions 
still exist in economic work -- agriculture's relative 
efficiency has dropped; the peasants' income remains to be 
increased; the scale of fixed asset investment is still larger 
than desired; the efficiency of some large and medium 
state-owned enterprises is poor; and the industrial structure is 
not completely rational. It should be said that, following high 
economic growth in the last two years, constraints caused by the 
"bottleneck" and pressure of inflation have increased, and the 
entire economic climate is uneasy. 
  This year is a very crucial one for development and reform. 
We are advancing reform of the economic system amid rapid 
economic development, and need to maintain a high economic 
growth while accelerating the process of transforming the 
system. In particular, it is not easy to properly organize and 
implement the various major reform measures that have been 
initiated for the purpose of building a socialist market 
economic system, because these measures involve many sectors and 
industries. To do this, we must shore up our conviction that we 
can defeat all difficulties; keep cool heads; judge the hour and 
size up the situation; grasp the overall situation of reform, 
development, and stability; and properly handle the dialectical 
relationships between sustainment, rapidity, and healthiness 
while developing the economy. 
  China has achieved good results in sustaining its economic 
development and this has drawn worldwide attention. Practice 
proves the fundamental reason why we have been able to sustain 
our economic development is that we have used reform and opening 
up as a powerful driving force for development, that we have 
followed the socialist market economic law in doing practical 
work, and we have prevented drastic ups and downs. This year 
China's reform centers on establishing a new system and a series 
of major reform measures have been launched. Properly 
organizing and implementing these measures will inject a 
powerful driving force to the further, sustained development of 
the economy. Of course, reform and development are a very 
complicated systems project -- it takes courage and prudence as 
well. This demands we properly handle the relationships between 
various contradictions; and we take positive, cautious, and 
appropriate action in designing strategy, in making use of 
opportunities, in grasping the rhythm, and in devising specific 
steps and measures. Only by doing so can we avoid sharp twists 
and turns, and drastic ups and downs. Currently, leading cadres 
at all levels should properly use the materialist dialectical 
viewpoint to analyze the situation, handle problems, prevent 
ideological one-sidedness and one-sidedness in understanding 
things, and prevent mistakes, especially big mistakes, in making 
decisions. 
  The economy should develop more rapidly -- this is a wish 
of people across the country as well as a pressing demand posed 
by the international and domestic situations. What we mean by 
rapidity is rapidity with efficiency. We do not mean to 
maintain the high growth simply by increasing investment, 
expanding the investment scale, launching new projects, and 
expanding [wai yan, 1120 1693] development. Experience proves 
that speed without efficiency and that does not conform to 
economic law is not real speed. This kind of speed not only 
cannot yield the results of rapid development, on the contrary, 
it will increase our burden and eventually impede rapid economic 
development. The macroeconomic regulation and control measures 
timely adopted by the central authorities last year have 
effectively solved the prominent contradictions and problems 
cropping up in the course of development; have forcefully 
rectified the financial order; checked the real estate fever, 
development-zone fever, and excessive growth in investment; and 
stabilized the economy and supported the state's key 
construction projects, thereby alleviating problems in some 
areas and making new improvements to the economic development 
climate. But, the trend of launching new projects regardless of 
whether conditions permit or not is still quite strong in some 
localities. For this reason, we should continue to strengthen 
and improve macroeconomic regulation and control to prevent the 
recurrence of inflation. In preparing this year's development 
plans, all localities should proceed from reality, take the 
overall situation into consideration, be scientific, keep cool 
headed, be realistic, set development objectives according to 
actual needs and feasibility, and must not blindly compare 
themselves with each other. They should shift their minds from 
pursuing speed to paying attention to real development; and 
place the center of their economic work on deepening reform, 
transforming mechanisms, improving the industrial structure, 
strengthening management, promoting technological progress, and 
increasing productivity. This has extremely great significance 
for our future economic development. 
  Whether the economy can develop rapidly and in a sustained 
manner primarily depends on whether it can develop in a healthy 
manner. Healthy economic development requires a comparatively 
coordinated and rational industrial structure, and a set of 
economic functioning mechanisms that can maintain 
highly-efficient economic operations. This year we still need to 
pay attention to improving the industrial structure. We should 
further consolidate and strengthen the role of agriculture as 
the foundation of the national economy, increase agricultural 
investment, ensure a good agricultural harvest this year, and 
increase the peasant's income. We should continue to seriously 
implement the "Regulations Governing the Transformation of 
Operating Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," 
properly manage large and medium state-owned enterprises, take 
various measures to increase enterprises' vitality, and properly 
organize the experimental work on building a modern enterprise 
system. We should guide enterprises to forcefully open up 
international and domestic markets, timely adjust product mix 
according to market demand, and provide active support to the 
production of readily marketable products. We should continue 
to step up the construction of infrastructural facilities, 
ensure the state's key construction projects, and gradually 
alleviate constraint caused by the "bottlenecks." Construction 
of infrastructural facilities also needs to be carried out 
according to the importance and urgency of a project, and to the 
resources available; we should make the best use of our limited 
financial and material resources. We should strengthen and 
improve macroeconomic regulation and control, and strive to 
maintain a basic balance between total supply and total demand. 
Improving the industrial structure is fundamental work that 
involves many sectors and industries, so we must take the 
overall situation into consideration. We should consider the 
nation's overall situation in deciding the priority and 
importance of a project. At the same time, by deepening reform, 
we should further straighten out the relationships between 
various sectors and truly solve problems concerning the economic 
system and economic functioning mechanisms. Of course, by 
healthy development we do not mean there should be no faults at 
all; what we demand is that we should prevent major problems 
from occurring, and should discover problems and take effective 
measures to solve them as soon as they begin to surface. 
  Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, broadening the 
scope of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability -- this is the general work of the whole party and 
country this year. Work in all areas should be subordinated to 
and serve this goal. Judging from the situation early this year, 
the situation on the economic front is good. We should continue 
to maintain the work style of being modest and cautious, and of 
guarding against arrogance and rashness; we should keep our cool 
heads and work in a down-to-earth manner; we should meticulously 
organize our work and work diligently to ensure the economy 
develops rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner; we 
should endeavor to do this year's economic work better than we 
did last year's.

  [Text] Honolulu, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Finance ministers 
from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations opened a 
meeting here today to discuss how to continue economic growth 
and increase outside investment in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The ministers hope the discussions will help address some of 
the challenges facing the region, including ensuring 
non-inflationary regional growth and financing investment and 
infrastructure development. 
  The meeting is held in accordance with the vision statement 
issued on November 20, 1993, in Seattle, when the APEC 
leadership conference was held. 
  In an opening statement to the meeting today, U.S. Secretary 
of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen said that the meeting represents "the 
first opportunity for regional discussions about basic issues 
like economic growth and financial challenges." 
  "It would be hard to imagine a group of finance ministers 
with more of a reason to consult. The region includes the 
world's fastest-growing economies. We account for half the 
world's output, half the world's foreign exchange reserves, and 
nearly half the world's population. 
  "And trade within our region has reached 1 trillion dollars 
a 
year," he said. 
  Bentsen said, "All this growth brings with it a need for a 
broadened perspective. In today's interdependent world, this 
kind of economic performance cannot be sustained in a vacuum. 
We all share an interest in economic strength for the region as 
a whole." 
  He said that uneven and divergent economic performance in 
the 
region "creates uncertainty, uncertainty retards investment, and 
investment is essential to sustained growth." 
  "That is why we need to consult and to cooperate in 
identifying successful economic strategies for the future," 
Bentsen said. 
  Attending the meeting are finance ministers and their 
deputies from APEC nations of Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, 
Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New 
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand 
and the United States. 
  Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei are also participating in the 
meeting as regional economies while Chile, which has applied for 
APEC membership, is attending as an observer. 
  No specific agreement was expected at today's meeting. 
  A draft summary of the meeting has been handed out to the 
delegates. But changes are expected during discussions among 
the ministers. 
  Also speaking at today's meeting, Indonesian Finance 
Minister 
Mari'e Muhammad said that "foreign capital can play a 
significant role in promoting the efficiency of domestic 
resources." 
  He said Indonesia recognizes that its resources cannot meet 
all of its financial needs, particularly in the area of 
infrastructure development. 
  Analysts say that over the next decade, Asia will need 
investments totaling some one trillion U.S. dollars to develop 
highways, airports, telephone lines, ports and power plants.

<F P=106> [By Yang Qi] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said today he will reaffirm a future-oriented 
Japan-China relationship when he meets with Chinese leaders in 
Beijing this weekend. 
  Before flying to Beijing on Saturday [19 March] for his 
first-ever three-day official visit to China, he told a group of 
Chinese journalists here that "Japan's relations with China have 
entered a new stage." Tokyo and Beijing should double their 
efforts to develop "the already mature relationship" into a 
future-oriented one that will benefit the international 
community, said the prime minister who assumed office last 
August. 
  "I hope that the two sides will hold very meaningful talks 
and exchange views frankly with each other," the prime minister 
said. 
  Hosokawa is scheduled to meet President Jiang Zemin and 
Premier Li Peng in Beijing to discuss bilateral and 
international issues. The trip will also take him to shanghai, 
China's largest city. 
  Trade between the two countries totalled 39 billion U.S. 
dollars last year, a 33-fold increase over 1972, the year China 
and Japan normalized relations. 
  Japan became China's largest trading partner last year, 
while 
China emerged as Japan's second biggest after the United States. 
  The prime minister expects trade between the two countries 
to 
reach 70 billion dollars by the end of 2000, and 190 billion 
dollars by the end of 2010 if it maintains an average annual 
growth of 10 percent. 
  He said that Japan's investment in China amounted to 5.17 
billion dollars by the end of last September, one third of which 
was invested in fiscal 1992. 
  The prime minister told the Chinese journalists, who are 
here 
on a week-long visit at the invitation of Japan's Foreign 
Ministry, that Japan will "pay much attention" to development in 
Shanghai's Pudong Development Zone, China's industrial hub, 
which he will visit Monday. He also said that his country will 
provide more aid to China's northeastern provinces. 
  On security in the Asia-Pacific region, Hosokawa voiced his 
concern over "unstable elements," an apparent reference to the 
alleged nuclear development program on the Korean peninsula. 
  He hoped that Tokyo and Beijing will work hard to seek 
solutions to this problem through bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation. 
  Expressing concern over the prolonged conflicts in the 
former 
Yugoslavia, Somalia and other troubled areas, the prime minister 
said that Japan will offer economic support to help resolve 
these problems. 
  The prime minister said his government will work under 
Japan's war-renouncing Constitution to "make greater 
contributions" to world peace.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa leaves here Saturday [19 March] for Beijing on 
a three-day official visit to China where he hopes to emphasize 
the development of future bilateral ties between the two 
neighboring countries. 
  During his first official China trip since taking office 
last 
August, Hosokawa will hold talks with President Jiang Zemin and 
Premier Li Peng on bilateral and international issues, Chinese 
and Japanese officials said. 
  He will also fly to Shanghai on Monday to visit the Pudong 
Development Zone, the officials said. 
  The prime minister told a group of Chinese journalists today 
that he hopes to reaffirm the consensus arrived at by Japanese 
and Chinese leaders that the bilateral relationship should be 
future-oriented and contribute to the world. 
  "I hope that the two sides will hold very meaningful talks 
and exchange views frankly with each other," he said. 
  Hosokawa's visit comes at a time when there are no major 
pending issues between Japan and China, a Japanese Foreign 
Ministry official said. 
  Both countries feel satisfied over the smooth development of 
bilateral ties and hope to further develop them toward the 21st 
century, the officials said. 
  They said recent exchanges between Chinese and Japanese 
leaders have brought the mature relationship into "a new era of 
development." 
  Jiang visited Japan in April 1992, while Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko toured China in October of that year in 
celebration of the 20th anniversary of the normalization of 
diplomatic ties. 
  Under Hosokawa's government, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
met his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen in September, and 
Hosokawa held talks with Jiang in Seattle in November when they 
met at an unofficial summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Forum. 
  In January this year, Hata visited Beijing and Chinese Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji came to Japan last month. 
  The bilateral trade volume reached 39 billion U.S. dollars 
last year, when Japan took over Hong Kong to become China's 
largest trading partner while China became Japan's second 
largest trading partner after the United States. 
  The officials said Hosokawa will express Japan's continued 
support for China's reform to shift to a market economy and 
backing for Beijing's bid to become a full member of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Hosokawa will also supervise the signing of an environment 
cooperation treaty during his visit, they said. 
  Under the accord to be signed, Japan will provide China with 
technology to combat acid rain, and air and water pollution in 
the wake of China's rapid industrialization, according to the 
officials.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Pyongyang and Seoul 
exchanged accusations today over the collapse of inter-Korea 
talks, each side urging the other to change positions. 
  The eighth working-level contact between the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea broke down at 
the truce village of Panmunjom, deadlocking the planned 
inter-Korea exchange of special envoys. 
  Pak Yong-su, head of the DPRK delegation, told reporters 
after the one-hour meeting that the collapse occurred because of 
a "sudden change" in South Korea's position. 
  The south would "take a strong position" against the north, 
restore suspended joint military exercises with the United 
States, go ahead with its plan to deploy "patriot" missiles in 
the south, and take part in international sanctions against the 
DPRK, Pak said. 
  Chief South Korean negotiator Song Yong-tae accused the 
north 
of blocking the exchange of special envoys, warning that if the 
nuclear issue remains unsettled, Pyongyang would face 
"unpredictable consequences." 
  However, his North Korean counterpart denied the charges, 
saying his country was ready to respond to either dialogue or 
war. 
  Each side called on the other to soften its tough stand, but 
no date was set for the next round of talks. 
  South Korean Deputy Premier and Minister of National 
Unification Yi Yong-tok issued a statement this afternoon 
expressing his disappointment over the failure of the talks. 
  Seoul will cooperate closely with the international 
community 
in seeking a solution to the problem arising from the suspected 
North Korean nuclear weapons development program, Yi said. 
  He added that there was no change in South Korea's position 
on finding a peaceful solution to this problem through dialogue, 
and hoped that the north will return to the negotiating table as 
soon as possible.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) today approved the government 
work report delivered by Premier Li Peng. 
  A political resolution of the session adopted today affirms 
the "great achievements" the Chinese people have scored over the 
past year in reforms, opening up and the modernization program. 
  According to the resolution, the principles for various 
kinds 
of work and tasks in China spelled out in the report are 
"practical and inspiring." 
  It says that CPPCC National Committee members voiced their 
concern over a number of prominent problems, such as the 
overextended scale of investment in fixed assets, high price 
rises, a weak agricultural base, difficulties faced by some 
major state- owned enterprises, corruption and poor social order 
in some localities. 
  "We hope that the government will take effective measures to 
solve these problems promptly," the resolution says. 
  It points out that the reunification of China in accordance 
with the principle of "peaceful reunification and one country, 
two systems" reflects the common aspiration of the Chinese 
nation, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and 
overseas Chinese. 
  It says that all parties, people's organizations and people 
of various nationalities and from all walks of life who have 
joined CPPCC express full support to the Chinese Government for 
its preparatory work to ensure a successful transfer of 
sovereignty and smooth transition in Hong Kong and Macao, in 
accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, the Basic Law of the Macao Special 
Administrative Region and relevant resolutions of the National 
People's Congress Standing Committee. 
  They all resolutely support the solemn and just stand of the 
Chinese Government to resume exercising China's sovereignty over 
Hong Kong on schedule and to ensure the long-term stability and 
prosperity of Hong Kong, the resolution says. 
  The session resolutely opposes any attempt and move to split 
the motherland and hopes that differences across the Taiwan 
Straits will be resolved by adhering to the principle of one 
China and through increased contacts and consultations. 
  The session places hopes on the Taiwan authorities and, to a 
greater extent, on the Taiwan people. 
  The central task for China in 1994 is to seize development 
opportunities, deepen reforms, open the country wider to the 
outside world, promote development and maintain stability, the 
resolution says. 
  All kinds of CPPCC work must comply with and serve this 
task, 
it says. 
  The resolution calls on participating units and 
organizations 
at all levels, as well all members of the CPPCC, to make 
political consultations and supervision a success, and actively 
participate in managing and discussing state affairs in order to 
make fresh contributions to China's modernization and peaceful 
reunification.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- An amendment to the 
Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC) was adopted today at a meeting of the Second 
Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee. 
  The guiding principle governing the amendment of the CPPCC 
Constitution is to highlight the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, basic policies for China's current 
primary stage of socialism, and the multi-party cooperation and 
political consultation system under the leadership of the 
Communist Party of China (CPC). 
  The amended constitution contains some important additions, 
which include: "the Constitution (of China) stipulates: the 
multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under 
the CPC leadership will exist and develop for a long time to 
come" and "the CPPCC is an important body for multi-party 
cooperation and political consultation under the CPC leadership." 
  The second addition above has been incorporated into an 
amendment to China's Constitution adopted by the National 
People's Congress last year. 
  The amended CPPCC Constitution also provides for major 
duties 
and functions of CPPCC organizations, as well as the forms and 
procedures of political consultation and supervision. 
  The amendment says that the CPPCC's main functions are to 
engage in political consultation and exercise democratic 
supervision, and organize participating parties, people's 
organizations and persons of various nationalities and from all 
walks of life to participate in running and discussing state 
affairs. 
  Political consultation means holding consultations on state 
and local policies and principles, as well as on major issues in 
political, economic, cultural and social life, before relevant 
policy decisions are made and in the course of implementing such 
decisions. 
  In line with proposals by the CPC, the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress, governments, democratic parties 
and people's organizations, the CPPCC National Committee and 
local committees may hold meetings for such consultations to be 
attended by leaders of various parties and people's 
organizations, as well as people from all nationalities and 
social sectors. 
  Democratic supervision means the exercise of supervision, by 
making proposals and criticisms, over the implementation of 
China's Constitution, laws, regulations, and major policies and 
principles, as well as the work of government departments and 
workers. 
  The amended constitution also adds stipulations on the 
rights 
and obligations of CPPCC organizations and members. 
  It notes that CPPCC participating units and individuals have 
the right to expose and investigate acts violating laws and 
disciplines, and may, through proposals and other forms, make 
proposals to and criticisms of government departments and other 
relevant organizations. 
  Added to the amended CPPCC Constitution is also the phrase 
"Hong Kong and Macao compatriots should be encouraged to 
contribute to the maintenance of prosperity and stability in 
Hong Kong and Macao" and to the development and reunification of 
the motherland. 
  The amended CPPCC Constitution comes into force as of today.

<F P=106> ["`Be Forever an Honest Friend of the CPC' -- An Interview </F>
With Newly Elected CPPCC Vice Chairman Wan Guoquan"; by XINHUA 
correspondents Luo Guojun (7482 0948 7486) and Liu Siyang (0491 
1835 2254)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Mar (XINHUA) -- Wan Guoquan, an 
executive vice chairman of the Central Committee of the China 
Democratic National Construction Association [CDNCA], has been 
elected this month as vice chairman of the National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], 
which is also the month of his 75th birthday. For Wan Guoquan, 
who has maintained close cooperation with the CPC for nearly 
half a century, this is an event worthy of celebration. 
  Wan Guoquan frankly revealed his feeling to XINHUA 
correspondents after he was elected a CPPCC vice chairman: "As 
an honest friend of the CPC, I would like to thank the CPPCC 
members for trusting in me. I will devote the rest of my life to 
doing my job well." 
  Wan Guoquan has been a friend who cooperated closely and 
shared weal and woe with the CPC. He is also an honest friend 
who handles matters impartially. In the early days following 
the liberation of China when Wan Guoquan was manager of an 
enterprise in Tianjin, he responded to the call of the party and 
took the lead in introducing public-private joint management to 
the enterprise under his management. Since then, he has been 
serving under the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce 
[ACFIC] and the CDNCA. Comrades who know him have lauded him as 
"a democratic person devoted to his work who handles party work 
very well and dares to speak frankly." 
  "I came from a warlord family in northeast China, and it was 
natural I was not spared misfortune during the `Cultural 
Revolution.' I was made to work in a cow shed; I was subjected 
to criticism and struggle; I was made to work as a construction 
worker, a carpenter, and a cook. But this has not shaken my 
confidence in the CPC." With deep feeling, Wan Guoquan recalled 
events of the past: "After the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, I resumed my work in the Tianjin 
branch of the ACFIC and CDNCA. Later, I was transferred to the 
post of specialized vice chairman of the CDNCA Central 
Committee. My contacts with high- ranking leaders of the CPC 
have further convinced me that the CPC is truly concerned about 
and cherishes us, treating the democratic parties as its partner 
of cooperation." 
  Wan Guoquan recalled an event which involved him personally. 
When Deng Yingchao inspected work in Tianjin in a certain year, 
she learned that Wang Guoquan's father had done something for 
our party. She intentionally chose "1 July" as the date for 
inviting Wan Guoquan and his wife to be her guests. While 
holding Wan Guoquan's hands, Deng Yingchao told him: "You are a 
good friend of our party." Wan Guoquan was moved to tears after 
hearing the remark. After that, Deng Yingchao used to inquire 
about his living conditions. 
  "The democratic parties want to become honest friends of the 
CPC precisely because it regards us as friends," said Wan 
Guoquan. He added: "Treating each other with full sincerity 
and sharing weal and woe, political consultation, and democratic 
supervision-- this is a function of the parties participating in 
the administration of state affairs and the CPPCC. Personally, 
I dare not forget this even for an instant." 
  It has been learned that Wan Guoquan conducts investigations 
and studies at basic-level units every year, and writes motions 
and proposals on economic construction. Last year, together 
with some experts and scholars of the CDNCA, Wan Guoquan visited 
five provinces and autonomous regions in northwest China to 
conduct investigations. On behalf of the CDNCA Central 
Committee, he submitted to the party Central Committee and the 
leadership of the five provinces and autonomous regions a report 
on some issues regarding economic development in the five 
provinces and autonomous regions. During the three years since 
he assumed the post of executive vice chairman of the CDNCA 
Central Committee, many of the motions submitted by the CDNCA 
have been adopted by the party Central Committee and other 
relevant departments. Last year, the central leadership 
attached great importance to CDNCA-submitted motions and 
proposals on constitutional amendments, to strengthening rural 
and agricultural work, to reform of existing banquet systems to 
promote the transformation of customs and habits, and to 
invigoration of large and medium state-owned enterprises. As 
these remarks were being made, Wan Guoquan waved his hand in a 
modest gesture, saying: "These tasks were completed by everyone 
under the leadership of Chairman Sun Qimeng. I only served as a 
link in reporting conditions at grass-roots levels to the top 
leadership." 
  After awhile, Wan Guoquan said what he would do after 
becoming a CPPCC vice chairman: "First, with the change of 
status, one must not change the style of being hardworking, 
honest, and self- disciplined. As the people have given me the 
right, I must change the purpose of serving them. Second, 
knowing that I have a heavy responsibility to bear, I must set 
stricter demands on myself. I will strengthen political and 
professional studies, knowing that knowledge is never 
sufficient. Third, I will do my best to fulfill my 
responsibility of reflecting the opinions and proposals of 
60,000 CDNCA members and other members of the democratic parties. 
  "Through actual deeds, I will forever be an honest friend of 
the CPC." Wan Guoquan said these concluding remarks resolutely.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (AFP) -- Agence France-Presse 
protested to the Chinese foreign ministry Monday after police 
grabbed the camera of an AFP photographer who had been taking 
pictures of a protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. AFP's 
Beijing bureau chief, Gilles Campion, filed a verbal protest 
with the authorities after police seized the camera of 
photographer Manuel Ceneta and opened it up to expose the film. 
  Witnesses said several hundred people had gathered behind 
security barriers on the eastern side of the square to watch 
delegates leave the Chinese parliament building. At about 10:45 
a.m. (0245 GMT), two protesters stationed at different parts of 
the square hurled pamphlets at the passing delegates. Uniformed 
and plainclothed police, who have been controlling access to the 
square since parliament opened its annual session on March 10, 
quickly moved to disperse the crowd, seal off the area and 
destroy the photographer's film. 
  The official news agency Xinhua later issued a dispatch 
quoting a foreign ministry spokesman, who criticised AFP. It is 
"improper for foreign journalists to cover news in China without 
going through necessary formalities," the dispatch cited the 
spokesman, who was not identified, as saying. "The spokesman 
also said that two Chinese women were stopped by other citizens 
for disturbing public order this morning," the agency said, 
without saying whether the two had been arrested or had any 
connection with the pamphlet incident. 
  Tiananmen Square was the scene of massive pro-democracy 
protests which were crushed by the army during the night of June 
3-4, 1989. 
  Dissidents and intellectuals have made several attempts to 
put across their pro-democracy and pro-human rights views ever 
since delegates began arriving from all over China for the 
parliament session. 
  Three open letters have been sent to delegates, but Monday 
was the first time dissidents have openly defied the police. 
  Before the session began police launched a massive 
intimidation campaign with the arrest of some 15 dissidents, 
forcing some of the better-known to stay away from the capital 
while parliament met. Four foreign correspondents were briefly 
held for questioning by police after they met with dissidents 
during the visit to Beijing by US Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher March 11 to 14.

  [Text] Vienna, March 21 (XINHUA) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution here today 
urging the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to allow 
it to complete all the requested inspection of nuclear 
facilities in the country. 
  During a special meeting of the IAEA's 35-member board, 25 
members voted for the resolution. Some members, including 
China, abstained while the other members did not participate in 
the balloting. 
  The resolution calls on the DPRK "immediately to allow the 
IAEA to complete all requested inspection activities and to 
comply fully with its safeguards agreement." 
  IAEA Director-General Hans Blix briefed board members during 
the meeting on details of the IAEA's inspection of the DPRK's 
seven declared nuclear power sites earlier this month. 
  He said that because the inspection team was barred from 
carrying out necessary inspection activities at a radioactive 
chemical laboratory, the IAEA could not draw any conclusion on 
whether nuclear materials had been diverted or reprocessed in 
the laboratory since February 1993. 
  Thus, the IAEA is ready to renew inspection of nuclear power 
sites in the DPRK, the director-general said. 
  But he stressed that there was no proof that the DPRK had 
done anything suspicious since February 1993 when the last full 
inspections were carried out. 
  The DPRK insists its nuclear program is for peaceful 
purposes 
only. 
  According to reports from the United Nations, the DPRK 
issued 
a statement today saying it had "accepted the IAEA inspection 
necessary for the continuity of safeguards from March 1 to 15." 
  The IAEA inspection team was able to carry out 
satisfactorily 
all the activities in the DPRK's nuclear facilities as specified 
in the Vienna agreement, it said. 
  The statement said the DPRK side showed "flexibility as an 
expression of its good-will by agreeing to the impertinent 
demands from the IAEA Secretariat" during the inspection. 
  "If the IAEA Secretariat tries to provoke us in an attempt 
to 
launch another pressure kickup against DPRK," the statement 
warned, "we will have no other alternative but to respond with 
our resolute countermeasures." 
  In a speech to the board's meeting, Chinese delegate Chen 
Shiqiu said that as a board member seriously concerned with the 
developments, China always hopes that the efforts to resolve the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula will continue and be in 
the right direction until a satisfactory settlement is achieved. 
  China has all along been opposed to the exertion of 
pressures, because any pressure will be futile, Chen said.

  [Text] Washington, March 21 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton said today that the United States will send Patriot 
air-defense missiles to South Korea. 
  "It is our national interest and in the interest of the 
security of the people of South Korea and the security of our 
armed forces there to send Patriot missiles at this time and we 
are going to do that," Clinton told reporters when he arrived in 
Deerfield Beach, Florida, for a health care meeting. 
  Clinton described the deployment as "purely defensive in 
nature" and as part of a continued modernization of U.S. armed 
forces in South Korea. 
  There are about 37,000 American military forces in South 
Korea. 
  The United States has also decided to resume a joint 
military 
exercise with South Korea and suspended the third round of 
formal talks scheduled today in Geneva with the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  "As to the next issues, I think we just have to wait and see 
what will happen. I can't say more today," Clinton claimed.

2734): "See How Economic Superpowers Play `Karate'"] 
  [Text] Karate and white karate clothes give us a calm 
feeling. Yet every stroke a karate player makes is intended to 
hurt his opponent and make him fall. He relies on his own 
strength which cannot be questioned in the least. 
  It seems that the United States and Japan, the two economic 
superpowers, also have been playing "karate" these days. The 
United States, which is running a trade deficit of nearly $60 
billion with Japan, was unable to free itself from being held by 
Japan by the side of its waist. Now, Clinton has lifted up the 
big stick of "Super 301" and Japan can do nought but back away. 
Five days before the big stick hit, Japan made concessions on 
the question of the U.S. Motorola Telecommunications 
Corporation's access to the main part of its mobile phone 
market, thus temporarily avoiding a vicious war. But has the 
storm subsided? People withg an understanding of the issue 
would say: It may not have. 
  What is "Super 301?" It came into being six years ago and is 
an amendment to article 301 of the "1974 U.S. Trade Act." The 
amendment provides that the United States can carry out 
investigations of and talks with, within limited periods, any 
country whose trade behavior it regards as "unfair" and 
"illegal" and, if the talks fail, it can unilaterally adopt 
compulsory retaliatory measures. 
  However, just at the end of last year, over 100 countries 
signed the GATT Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations 
Agreements in Geneva, which urged all countries to resolve 
global trade disputes through participation and cooperation. 
But now, the United States has openly threatened Japan with 
unilateral sanctions and the agreements are freshly made. 
Public opinion around the world maintains that Clinton has 
violated competition laws and regulations. In this regard, 
countries like Australia, Britain, and France have made loud 
noises. The Australian Trade Minister McMullan [mai ke ma lun 
7796 0344 7456 0243] [Bureau records show Peter Cook as 
Australian Trade Minister] pointed out that forcing Japan to 
increase imports of U.S. products by compulsory means will 
undoubtedly sacrifice the interests of other countries. 
European countries like Britain and France are currently 
experiencing acute trade friction with the United States and are 
overtly and covertly receiving similar threats from the United 
States. Therefore, their criticisms are particularly sharp. 
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur even criticized the 
United States for pursuing trade hegemony and seriously damaging 
the international free trade system. 
  Given the fact that "Super 301" has caused Japan to make 
some 
concessions within a few days and the strong responses this has 
evoked around the world, can it really radically change the 
United States' trade deficit with Japan? The answer is that it 
may not. In fact, "Super 301" directly originated with the 
Japanese-U.S. trade frictions and with the absence of progress 
in trade talks. The United States also directed it at Japan when 
it made use of the article last time and succeeded in forcing 
Japan to open its timber, supercomputer, and satellite markets. 
Despite this, the United States has kept an increasingly large 
trade deficit running with Japan. The dispute has already been 
brewing for quite some time. Moreover, the concessions Japan has 
made under pressure from the United States are merely one aspect 
of their trade dispute. The "victory" Clinton has won by using 
the big stick in violation of the rules will probably be only 
good enough for him to win a few votes in the upcoming interim 
elections. 
  On the last two occasions the United States brandished the 
big stick of "Super 301," it only lifted it up but did not 
strike anyone. The interests of Japan and the United States are 
intertwined. In playing karate they have to be serious, while 
also having to be not so serious, and each side has to hit the 
other's vital parts while not hurting itself. Only the two 
countries themselves have a tacit understanding of their own 
interests and own advances and withdrawals.

  [Text] Moscow, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev said Friday [18 March] that his country 
can not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
  The defense minister told reporters during an inspection of 
the Baltic Sea Fleet that all European countries should be equal 
on the issue of realizing European security and stability and 
that no country's interests should be harmed, the INTERFAX news 
agency reported. 
  He stressed that Russia will not follow some East European 
and Baltic states who see participation in the "partnership for 
peace" plan proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton as a 
transition to full NATO membership. 
  Grachev said that there are three reasons for Russia's 
position on the issue. 
  First, a country that intends to join NATO must reconstruct 
its defense system to suit NATO's commanding system. This will 
undoubtedly mean bankruptcy for a big country like Russia which 
has a 2.3-million-strong armed forces. 
  Second, Russia can not meet the requirement that a country 
must be equipped with the same weapons and equipment as a NATO 
member before it enters the military bloc. 
  Third, few NATO countries have strategic rocket troops like 
Russia. 
  Meanwhile, Grachev said that Russia will build a "special 
defensive zone" in its western region of Kaliningrad this year 
to defend the country's western sea and air borders.

  [Text] Moscow, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The most important task 
of the Interparliamentary Conference of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) is to seek a legal basis for the 
drafting of a CIS economic union treaty, said Russian Federation 
Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko today. 
  Shumeyko, also chairman of the conference, made the 
statement 
at the opening ceremony of the conference's fourth session held 
in St. Petersburg. 
  He stressed that the CIS members should make joint efforts 
to 
tide over the economic crisis which the 12 countries have 
suffered since the 1991 disintegration of the former Soviet 
Union. 
  Only eight of the 16 CIS states, including Russia, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia, 
attended the conference. 
  The conference today also approved its own peacekeeping 
role, 
saying it should take an active part in resolving regional and 
ethnic disputes on the CIS countries, including conflicts in 
Abkhazia, Georgia, and in Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- One cannot use human 
rights as a pretext for sticking one's nose into the internal 
affairs of other countries, according to a signed article in 
today's "GUANGMING" DAILY [GUANGMING RIBAO]. 
  While calling for an end to this practice, the article said 
that some people abroad would always like to use human rights as 
a pretext and flagrantly interfere in China's domestic affairs. 
  Time and again they put forward lists of names of allegedly 
persecuted people of various kinds and ask, in disregard of the 
laws of China, for earlier release of prisoners on the lists. 
They threaten otherwise to impose sanctions on China or to 
cancel certain favorable treatment. 
  A country must have its own laws and regulations compatible 
with its internal conditions, the article said. "It is 
universally acknowledged that people who break the laws must be 
punished according to relevant laws in that country." 
  It is unacceptable, even though it is laughable, that the 
lists of names of such alleged victims of human rights and the 
so-called facts published are often based merely on hearsay and 
rumors. 
  For instance, some of the people on the lists are just 
described as having the name of so and so, with no other 
detailed information such as age, address or origin. 
  On some occasions, the handful of overseas critics simply 
distort the facts and stick labels of high-sounding noble causes 
-- such as for the cause of democracy or for political 
differences or for religious beliefs -- on listed criminals who 
have actually been convicted in China of various crimes, such as 
arson or murder. 
  These foreigners with ulterior motives falsely allege that 
criminals who are actually receiving fair treatment and enjoying 
sound health have been cruelly tortured and are on the verge of 
death. 
  China rules itself, and will always do so, only in 
accordance 
with its own laws and regulations. Others may have different 
opinions about such laws and regulations, but they can never be 
authorized to change them or to ask China to handle its domestic 
affairs in line with the laws and decrees of another country. 
  People abroad who would like to use the laws and regulations 
of their own country as a model and to force other countries to 
accept these laws are in practice interfering in other 
countries' affairs. 
  A country, as well as its laws, has its dignity. Relevant 
bodies in China will put on trial people who have broken the law 
on the Chinese mainland, in accordance with the laws and 
regulations of China. The Chinese Government does not allow any 
other foreign country to interfere in such affairs. All these 
efforts are aimed at safeguarding the dignity of the country and 
its laws, the article said. 
  It is a right and proper duty of all governments of 
different 
countries to defend their own laws and order, and vindicate the 
political stability of their countries, but it is not justified 
for some foreign people to stick their nose in China's domestic 
affairs, the article stressed.

<F P=106> [By Wang Nan: "Ford To Fully Participate in China's Auto </F>
Industry"] 
  [Text] Dearborn, Michigan, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Ford Motor 
Company, expecting to announce its first joint venture in China 
as early as next month, is fully prepared to tap the Asian 
country's vast vehicle market. 
  The Ford-China joint venture, which has been under 
consideration for nearly two years, was expected to be announced 
"in next couple of months or even sooner than that," James 
Paulsen, president of the Ford China operations, said in an 
interview with XINHUA here today. 
  "We are optimistic that we can put together a good program 
and meets the needs of the Chinese people and Chinese business," 
Paulsen said. "We will get the approval we would like to see." 
  Paulsen became the president of the newly established Ford 
China operations on March 1. With some 60 people involved in 
China businesses in the Ford's world headquarters here, Paulsen 
described the principle task of his unit as "to provide one 
voice for Ford and a single point of contact" with China, with 
the top priority of exploring manufacturing joint venture for 
vehicles. 
  He said that since the Chinese government is still in the 
process of rationalizing and harmonizing China's auto industry, 
Ford is prepared to fully participate in China's efforts of 
industrial consolidation. 
  Paulsen noted that in China, whose economic growth is the 
fastest in the world, vehicles presently may not be affordable 
to average individuals. 
  "There certainly is a great institutional need for more 
vehicles," he said, adding that when the individual market for 
cars develops in the future, "we will be there." 
  "With the volume and expected growth (in China's car sales), 
there is much more potential than what is already in place 
there," the president of Ford's China operations said. 
  According to Paulsen, the sales of passenger cars in China 
is 
expected to increase from the present 200,000 units a year to 
1.8 million by the year 2000. The Chinese market for the car, 
which carries seven to eight passengers with enough space for 
luggage, will witness "very very high growth rate," he said. 
  China's vehicle market is as large as one million units a 
year, with 80 percent of domestic production and 20 percent of 
imports. Annual sales of vehicles will reach two million by the 
year 2000, China said. 
  Paulsen noted that a great deal of feasibility studies were 
still going on in Ford as to produce what kind of vehicles in 
China. Besides multipurpose vehicles, ford is reportedly showing 
interest in the market of cargo trucks in China. 
  "We need to look at the market demand and understand what 
the 
demand is," Paulsen stressed. 
  Ford sold over 3,000 and 6,200 vehicles in China in 1992 and 
1993 respectively, including the Tempo, Taurus, Crown Victoria, 
Aerostar and Lincoln town car, mostly coming from government 
purchase. Ford is reportedly targeting China's private sectors 
for car sales of as many as 4,000 units this year. 
  As early as in 1987, when Henry Ford II became one of the 
first U.S. businessmen to visit the people's republic, the 
company showed interests in the development of the automotive 
industry in China. 
  Its 750 F-series trucks sold in China in the middle of 1979 
were the first of its kind coming from the U.S. since 1949, the 
piece of history that Ford today still proudly recalls. 
  Despite its time and energy in negotiating a joint venture 
in 
China, Ford, the fourth largest manufacturer in the world, is 
still behind the General Motors Company and Chrysler Corp. in 
locating vehicle assembly lines in China. 
  "Our products are the best in terms of quality and value. 
They are well-styled, well-designed to represent the very high 
value for dollar and yuan," which is the Chinese currency, 
Paulsen said. 
  He said, "our objective would be to participate fully in the 
(Chinese) market, eventually have a full line of vehicles that 
would meet the various market needs in China. It takes time." 
  Paulsen, who will be in Washington next week, said, in 
particular, that ford hopes that the Clinton administration 
would support Ford's on-going efforts in China. 
  On the Most Favored Nation trade status (MFN) for China, 
Paulsen stressed that "if MFN is not extended, it will be more 
difficult for us," calling it "disruptive" which might force 
Ford to change its China strategy. 
  "As a businessman, I would hope that the MFN is extended. I 
believe that business prospering in China should help the 
Chinese people to raise economy and I think that would also help 
the social situation," he said. 
  Ford's operation in China is now mainly in the form of 
component manufacturing, technology licensing and joint 
scientific and technology research. It has dealers in 10 major 
Chinese cities plus some service facilities. 
  Paulsen, 55, described his first two weeks in office as 
"very 
very busy." he will visit China for three weeks in April to 
announce the finalists for Ford-China Joint Research Fund, with 
Ford contributing 800,000 U.S. dollars.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with James Paulsen, president of </F>
Ford's China operations, by XINHUA correspondent Wang Nan (3769 
2809) at Ford's world headquarters in Michigan; date not given; 
"Ford Is Marching Into China With Big Strides -- An Interview 
With Ford's China Operations"; this version replaces a previous 
version transmitted at 0239 GMT on 20 March; differences between 
the two items noted below] 
  [Text] Dearborn, Michigan, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- "China is a 
huge, developing automobile market. Ford is prepared to fully 
participate in the development of China's automobile industry." 
This statment was made by James Paulsen, newly-appointed 
president of Ford's China operations, during an interview with 
this correspondent at Ford's world headquarters. 
  Ford, the second largest automobile manufacturer in the 
United States and the fourth largest in the world, established 
operations in China on 1 March to coordinate automobile business 
related to China. As Paulsen stated, its top priority is to 
establish as early as possible a joint venture with vehicle 
assembly lines in China, and to help modernize China's 
automobile industry. 
  Business exchanges between Ford and China go back a long 
time. As early as 1978, Henry Ford II visited China and was 
received by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The 750 F-series 
trucks it later sold to China were the first of its kind 
imported from the U.S. since 1949. In 1984 and 1985, Ford 
entered into negotiations with China to establish an automobile 
joint venture; Ford sold over 3,000 and 6,200 vehicles in China 
in 1992 and 1993 respectively. 
  Paulsen told this correspondent: "Ford was the first to 
undertake efforts to establish a joint venture with China. This 
will be helpful to our cooperation with China. .... [ellipsis as 
published] Our goal is to produce the best quality products 
suited to the Chinese market." [The 0239 GMT version reads: 
"Compared with other automobile companies, Ford was the first 
to undertake efforts to establish a joint venture with China. 
This will help better ensure that ours products will be the 
best among all the joint-venture automobile enterprises in China 
in terms of quality and value. Our goal is to produce the best 
quality products suited to the Chinese market."] 
  This correspondent has learned that the number of people 
involved in the China operations at Ford's world headquarters 
has increased to over 60. Ford's operations in China are now 
mainly in the form of component manufacturing, technology 
licensing, and joint scientific and technology research. All 
its operations are successful or making progress. Last year 
Ford established dealers in 10 major Chinese cities, and its 
service facilities are expanding. 
  "The considerable base of China's automobile industry may 
serve as a basic condition for cooperation between China and 
Ford. Ford's investment in China will continue to focus on 
things like vehicle technology," said Paulsen. Last October, 
Ford supplied $800,000 to establish a vehicle technology fund 
together with the China National Science Foundation. Grants for 
25 basic research projects will be officially awarded in April 
this year. This shows Ford's cooperation with China is more 
oriented to the future, according to Paulsen. 
  Ford personnel told this correspondent that the naming of a 
president for operations in China equivalent in rank to vice 
president of the head office clearly indicates the company's 
resolve to enter the Chinese market. [The 0239 GMT version 
reads: Ford personnel told this correspondent that the naming 
of a president for operations in China equivalent in rank to 
vice president of the head office clearly indicates the 
company's resolve to march into the Chinese market with great 
strides]. Paulsen will soon move his office from Ford world 
headquarters to China. 
  Paulsen, who visited China last year, told the 
correspondent: 
"I very much want to go to and work in China. I am eager to 
learn about China's business environment and automobile 
industry; I also want to learn about China's culture, 
humanities, and history." 
  Speaking of the domestic debate in the United States 
regarding China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status, 
Paulsen said he hopes the Clinton administration will support 
Ford and other automobile companies in their efforts to expand 
overseas. He said: "As a businessman, we hope the government 
will extend China's MFN trade status." He believes the Clinton 
Government's decision in June regarding China's MFN trade status 
will mark a turning point in Ford's operations in China.

<F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Yu Haisheng (0060 3189 3932): "Just </F>
When Things Are Being Moistened by the Spring Rain -- Assessing 
Sino-Japanese Relations from High-level Contacts"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (XINHUA) -- It may be called vivid 
to liken the development momentum of recent Sino-Japanese 
relations to the "springing up of bamboo shoots after spring 
rain." From President Jiang Zemin's meeting with Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle to Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's 
visit to China last January, and from Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's 
visit to Japan at the beginning of spring to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's current visit to China, frequent high-level 
Sino-Japanese contacts have left a profound mark on the history 
of friendly relations between the two countries. 
  If Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Japan induced the 
emergence of a "China craze" in the Japanese archipelago and the 
willingness to forge further cooperation with China, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's official visit to China has heated up the 
"Sino-Japanese cooperation craze." Prime Minister Hosokawa 
stressed: Japanese-Chinese ties are "one of the most important 
pillars" in the foundation of Japan's foreign affairs, and Japan 
will actively support China's modernization. 
  The increasing warmth of Sino-Japanese relations has erased 
certain doubts in Japanese business circles, further enhancing 
their confidence toward investment in China. The Japanese side 
felt that more Japanese capital and technology will enter China 
in the next five years. 
  People here feel that the "Sino-Japanese cooperation craze" 
is an important legacy of the overall change in post-Cold War 
international relations, China's rapid economic growth, and 
Japan's domestic economic readjustment. 
  In the process wherein the current international order is 
changing from polarization to multipolarization, it is of great 
benefit for the Chinese and Japanese economies, the stability 
and development of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as for 
establishing a new international political and economic order, 
for China and Japan, two important countries in Asia and the 
world, to develop friendly and cooperative relations. The 
frequent contacts of Chinese and Japanese leaders have shown 
that the two countries have reached common understanding in this 
aspect, symbolizing a new era of mature and comprehensive 
development in Sino-Japanese relations. 
  People have noticed that high-level contacts between the two 
countries are biased toward economic issues. Economic and trade 
cooperation has taken the "leading role" in Sino-Japanese 
relations. Last year, economic and trade relations between the 
two countries created three "firsts": Sino-Japanese trade volume 
reached a record $39 billion and Japan became China's largest 
trading partner; Japan's technology exports to China constituted 
the largest portion of China's technology imports; and Japanese 
enterprises led the rest in investing capital in China. These 
three "firsts" have not only favored China's economic 
construction, but have also injected new vitality into the 
Japanese economy, which is now in recession. 
  However, speaking on the potential of Sino-Japanese economic 
and trade cooperation, the level of these three "firsts" is 
still not high. Since the Chinese and Japanese economies 
strongly supplement each other, there is wide scope for further 
development. China's major development areas involve 
transportation, energy, and communications fields, in which 
Japan is strong. It can be foreseen that once Japan's 
technology and capital continue to increasingly integrate with 
China's market and resources on a wider scope, it will 
definitely become a reality in the near future for the annual 
trade volume of the two countries to reach $390 billion, an 
amount predicted by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji when he visited 
Japan. 
  Of course, Sino-Japanese relations are not limited to 
economic and trade cooperation. The similarity of viewpoints of 
the two sides on many major international issues is clear proof 
of this. Following continued deepening of mutual understanding, 
the two countries have bright prospects for cooperation in 
political, cultural, and environmental protection areas. 
  In a few more years, mankind will move into the 21st 
century. 
Despite the turmoil in much of today's world, Asia is 
experiencing a general trend of rapid economic development and 
relative stability. Just as President Jiang Zemin pointed out 
when he met Prime Minister Hosokawa, this is Asia's "rare 
development opportunity in history." China and Japan have 
clearly expressed that the two countries should seize 
opportunities, join hands, as well as establish a long and 
stable relationship involving mutually beneficial cooperation to 
jointly meet the challenge of the new century. Frequent 
contacts between high-level Sino-Japanese officials are a 
visible sign of efforts made toward achieving this goal.

<F P=106> ["Sino-Japanese Relations Develop With Momentum" -- XINHUA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- The recent momentum 
of the development of the Sino-Japanese relations can be 
described as "bamboo shoots after a spring rain." 
  Following the meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle last 
November, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata visited Beijing 
in January and then Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji toured Japan 
this spring. The series of high-level contacts between China and 
Japan were brought to a climax as Prime Minister Hosokawa came 
to China. 
  If Vice-Premier Zhu's visit to Japan had resulted in a 
"China 
fever" in Japan, then Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to China 
has made the "Sino-Japanese cooperation fever" even hotter. 
  The Japanese prime minister stressed that Japan-China 
relations are one of "the most important pillars" in Japan's 
foreign diplomacy and that Japan will provide effective support 
to China's modernization drive. 
  The development momentum in the bilateral relations has 
swept 
away doubts in Japan's business circles. The Japanese side 
expressed that more Japanese funds and technology will be 
brought into China in the coming five years. 
  Observers here believed that the "China-Japan cooperation 
fever" is the result of the evolution of the international 
relations following the Cold War, China's high-speed economic 
development and Japan's inside economic adjustment. 
  Now the international situation is experiencing a 
transitional process from two poles toward a multi-poles. The 
development of the friendly relations and cooperation between 
China and Japan, two important countries in Asia and in the 
world, will enhance the stability and development of the economy 
in the two countries and in Asia, and in the establishment of a 
new international political and economic order. 
  The frequent exchanges between the leaders of the two 
countries show that the two sides have reached common 
understanding and also signaled that Sino-Japanese relations 
have entered a period of maturity. 
  People have noted that the exchanges between the top 
officials of the two countries have striking economic features. 
  Last year the trade value between the two countries was 39 
billion U.S. dollars, hitting a record high. 
  Japan has become the no. 1 trade partner of China; Japan's 
technology exports to China rank no. 1; the rate of the actual 
investment from Japan to China ranks no. 1. 
  But in view of the potential in Sino-Japanese economic 
cooperation, much remains to be done. 
  China is stressing the development of the communications and 
transportation, energy and telecommunications sectors while 
Japan is exactly quite strong in these sectors. 
  It can be said that once Japan's technology and funds are 
combined with China's market and resources, the trade value of 
the two countries may reach 390 billion U.S. dollars, just like 
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji predicted in his recent visit to Japan. 
  Of course, Sino-Japanese relations are not confined to 
economic cooperation and trade. The two sides share identical 
views on major international issues. With the deepening of 
mutual understanding, the two countries will surely make further 
progress in their cooperation in the areas of politics, culture 
and environmental protection. 
  The 21st century is approaching. At present, Asia is 
experiencing a period of rapid economic development and relative 
stability. In his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, Chinese President Jiang Zemin noted that Asia has 
created an unprecedented opportunity of development in its 
history. 
  The two sides agreed that they should seize the opportune 
moment to establish long-term stable friendly relations and 
cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit so as to meet the 
challenges of the new century. 
  The frequent exchanges of visits between Chinese and 
Japanese 
leaders show the two sides are working toward this end.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren, at a meeting with a delegation from the Japan 
External Trade Organization (JETO) here today, said that 
all-round Sino-Japanese cooperation, economic cooperation in 
particular, will be expanded following Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's China visit. 
  Rong said that the prime minister's visit, which ended 
yesterday, plays a major role in the development of the two 
countries' relations. 
  He noted that the annual sessions of the Chinese National 
People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference focussed on issues of 
economic development. 
  Rong said that China will extend its reforms, widen its 
opening- up, promote development and keep stability, adding that 
the country will maintain the annual growth rate for the economy 
at around 9 percent. 
  Rong stressed the importance of close cooperation between 
China and the rest of the world in the economic construction. 
  He expressed his appreciation of JETO's long-term efforts in 
strengthening Sino-Japanese economic and trade cooperation. 
  Chairman Tooru Toyoshima of JETO, who heads the delegation, 
said his organization will continue to contribute to the two 
countries' exchanges in such fields as trade and investment. 
  The delegation came here at the invitation of the China 
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). The 
two sides will exchange views on issues including the promotion 
of China's product export to Japan.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Japan has become a 
major economic and trade partner of Shanghai as the total volume 
of imports and exports between the two in 1993 hit 2.79 billion 
U.S. dollars, 51.6 percent up on 1992. 
  These figures were cited by Wang Zukang, director of the 
Shanghai Foreign Economic and Trade Commission. 
  Shanghai's exports to Japan were worth 1.62 billion U.S. 
dollars (35 percent up on the previous year), while its imports 
from Japan reached 1.17 billion U.S. dollars, 82 percent up. 
  By the end of 1993, Japanese investment projects in Shanghai 
numbered 637, with a total contracted investment volume of 1.19 
billion U.S. dollars, or 9.2 percent of all foreign investment 
projects in Shanghai, with a contracted investment percentage of 
8.7. 
  Among those projects, 100 are solely foreign-funded with a 
contracted investment of 352 million U.S. dollars; 444 are joint 
ventures, with contracted investments of 673 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  Wang believed that the economic and trade cooperation 
between 
Shanghai and Japan has a bright future. 
  He said that Shanghai will develop new areas more actively 
for using foreign funds and learn from Japanese businesses. 
  Shanghai is also to seek new forms of foreign trade under 
the 
system of the socialist market economy, including the 
possibility of setting up joint foreign trade ventures, he said.

before returning to Phnom Penh on April 8 for Khmer New Year. 
  A Western diplomat said that after his anti-cancer

  [Text] Manila, March 20 (XINHUA) -- Philippine President 
Fidel Ramos today praised Filipino-Chinese for their outstanding 
contributions to the development of the country. 
  "Chinese-Filipinos have help build this country -- with 
their 
blood, their toil, their resources, and their enterprise," the 
president said during his speech at the 40th anniversary 
celebration of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (FCCCI), an umbrella organization of 
Filipino-Chinese corporations. 
  Ramos cited what the FCCCI have done in improving education 
infrastructure, reducing impact of natural and man-made 
calamities and providing free medical aid to poor residents. 
  "I must also acknowledge your contributions to help improve 
peace and order, especially in Metro Manila," he added. 
  Ramos pointed out that the FCCCI have made contributions to 
peace and order in the country by donating police patrol cars 
and other equipments to the police and stabilizing prices of 
basic goods through its influence on businessmen during abnormal 
times. 
  "Your most important contribution, however, has been to help 
develop our economy and generate jobs," the president stressed. 
  Despite accounting for only one percent of the country's 65 
million population, he said, "Chinese-Filipino companies 
generate a full third of the sales of all domestically owned 
firms." 
  The president also reiterated his government's efforts to 
level the playing field of business competition for all 
businessmen, including Filipino-Chinese. 
  While praising the FCCCI's "sterling service" to the country 
during the past 40 years, Ramos urged the federation to play "a 
lead role in moving our nation towards our shared vision of 
'Philippines 2000'." 
  The president has issued a proclamation declaring March 23 
to 
29 of every year as the "Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers 
of Commerce and Industry Week." 
  "It is but fitting that it should be given a period within 
which to focus public attention to the role being played by the 
federation in national development," Ramos said in his 
proclamation.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Wang Yong: "Guangxi Land Woos </F>
Firms From Singapore"] 
  [Text] Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region 
plans to earmark 667 hectares for companies from Singapore. 
  This was announced over the weekend in Beijing by Cheng 
Kejie, chairman of the regional government. 
  In June, Cheng is to visit Singapore to negotiate the 
specific terms of the deal. 
  "We expect a bundle of large projects financed by Singapore 
to be finalized soon in the Tieshangang area," Cheng told a 
press conference held during the ongoing National People's 
Congress. 
  Guangxi, the potential trade thoroughfare between China and 
Southeast Asia, is the latest investment target of Singapore, 
which is moving a large chunk of its business to China. 
  Singapore has already agreed to set up tens of billions of 
dollars worth of industrial projects in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. 
  Guangxi, however, is closer to Southeast Asia. It has 1,595 
kilometres of coastline capable of supporting 21 ports. 
  Many believe foreign investors would find it an easy 
springboard to enter the country's vast West. 
  Hong Puzhou, head of Guangxi's Planning Commission, said the 
region is expected to set up one of the nation's few electronics 
and automobile manufacturing bases within the next couple of 
years. 
  And Beihai, a port city on the Beibu Gulf, has gained State 
support to become an international economic hub. 
  Economists have predicted that Beihai will be part of an 
emerging international economic centre formed by Vietnam and 
China. 
  To date, most foreign investment in Guangxi has gone into 
Beihai. 
  Cheng also said that Guangxi will build or renovate five 
major airports capable of handling Boeing 747 planes in three 
years. 
  And it should have an additional installed capacity of 4 
million kilowatts next year when five power plants come on 
stream. 
  Cheng added that the State plans to set up a 4.2 million 
kilowatt hydropower plant in Guangxi soon. Despite Guangxi's 
plans, poverty remains the biggest problem.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman seriously condemned here today the anti-China 
practice of some Indian parliamentarians. 
  It was reported that an all-party Indian parliamentary forum 
for Tibet held a meeting in India recently and condemned the 
Chinese Government for violating human rights in Tibet and 
called for supporting the independence of Tibet. 
  The so-called "All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for 
Tibet" was initiated by a small number of Indian 
parliamentarians in collusion with the international anti-China 
force, the spokesman said while commenting on the issue at the 
request of some Beijing- based reporters. 
  He said they openly trumpeted for "liberation of Tibet" on 
the ground that there were human rights problems in Tibet. This 
anti-China act and gross interference in China's internal 
affairs has aroused great indignation of the whole Chinese 
people including the Tibetan compatriots, the spokesman noted. 
  "We sternly condemn the anti-China clamors made at the 
meeting. We deeply deplore that such anti-China political 
activities had not been forestalled on the territory of India," 
he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (AFP)--China strongly criticized 
India Tuesday [22 March] for failing to prevent a recent 
conference on Tibet from being held in New Delhi, slamming the 
event as a "gross interference" in its internal affairs. "We 
deeply deplore that such anti-China political activities had not 
been forestalled on the territory of India," said a foreign 
ministry spokesman, referring to last week's All-Party Indian 
Parliamentary Forum for Tibet. 
  The three-day convention, attended by parliamentarians from 
30 countries, "openly trumpeted for `liberation of Tibet' on the 
grounds that there were human rights problems in Tibet," the 
spokesman said. "This anti-China act and gross interference in 
China' internal affairs has aroused great indignation of the 
whole Chinese people including the Tibetan compatriots," he said. 
  The conference statement denounced alleged Chinese human 
rights abuses in Tibet, urged the release of all Tibetan 
political prisoners and expressed concern over Chinese nuclear 
testing in the region -- which Chinese troops entered in 1951. 
It also called on China to open unconditional talks with the 
Dalai Lama and urged the United Nations to grant observer status 
to the Tibetan spiritual leader's government-in-exile, based in 
northern India but not recognised by any country. 
  "We thoroughly condemn the anti-China clamours made at the 
meeting," which was organised by "a small number of Indian 
parliamentarians in collusion with the international 
anti-Chinese force," said the foreign ministry spokesman. 
  The Indian government has also come under fire from 
conference delegates, who accuse it of succumbing to Chinese 
pressure by trying to scuttle the event by denying a venue in 
the heart of New Delhi and by allegedly declining visas to some 
MPs. "The (Indian) government put obstacles at the behest of 
China. China twisted India's arm," said Indian MP George 
Fernandes Sunday, calling on the Indian government to support 
the Tibetan cause. Fernandes said the Dalai Lama, who has 
lived in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959 after a failed 
anti-Chinese revolt, did not make an appearance at the 
convention because of Indian pressures. 
  India, which is home to some 100,000 Tibetan exiles, treats 
Tibet as an autonomous region of China and has cracked down 
hard on Tibetan protestors during visits by Chinese leaders in 
recent years.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The just-concluded 
session of China's Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) is a 
success, Premier Li Peng said here today. 
  Speaking on achievements of the NPC session at a reception 
for Chinese and overseas reporters this afternoon, Premier Li 
said that the NPC session has adopted his government work 
report, affirmed the work of the government last year, approved 
principles and tasks for this year's work, and passed a budget 
law. 
  What is more important, the premier said, is that NPC 
deputies unanimously stand for the principle of "seizing 
development opportunities, deepening reform, expanding opening 
to the outside world, promoting development and maintaining 
stability." The principle is a guideline for all work this 
year, he said. 
  NPC deputies have reached "unprecedented consensus" on the 
need to correctly handle relations among reform, development and 
stability, he said. 
  The second session of the Eighth NPC and the Second Session 
of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference have provided "a reliable 
guarantee for the fulfillment of various tasks this year," he 
said. 
  The NPC session also demonstrated a democratic style of 
work. 
Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the 
State Council joined many provincial-level delegations in 
discussions, exchanged views on state affairs with deputies, and 
heard criticisms and suggestions from them, he said. 
  "Both the number of meetings and contacts have set a 
record," 
he said. "In short, this is a session marked by democracy, 
pragmatism, unity and progress."

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said here today that China attaches importance to Sino-U.S. 
relations and hopes to resume and expand normal relations with 
the United States. 
  At a reception in the Great Hall of the People here, Li told

  In response to a question about the recent visit to China by 
Warren Christopher, the U.S. secretary of state, he said that 
the visit was fruitful, although perhaps "we had expected to 
achieve more results." 
  "Besides understandings reached on some specific issues, I 
think there is at least another achievement (of Christopher's 
visit), that is, the two sides have enhanced understanding of 
each other's views, and that is very important," he said. 
  He said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin, he himself and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen respectively held frank, in-depth 
talks with Christopher on Sino-U.S. relations and international 
issues, including human rights, the renewal of China's most 
favored nation (MFN) trade status with the U.S., the missile 
technology control regime (MTCR) and other issues. 
  He said Christopher must have obtained first-hand 
information, having heard directly from the Chinese leaders 
Chinese stand and views on the issues he is concerned about. 
  "This may perhaps help the United States, through careful 
considerations, to make decisions in the next few months that 
will be in keeping with the interests of both the United States 
and China," he said. 
  "We have noticed what president Bill Clinton said on March 
16. We regard it as a positive sign," he said. 
  "I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that 
China is willing to improve Sino-U.S. relations. We have made 
great efforts to improve relations and will continue to do so," 
he said. 
  But he maintained that China is a sovereign country and will 
never make a deal by sacrificing principles. 
  "Generally speaking, I do not feel pessimistic about the 
prospects of Sino-U.S. relations," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said here today that Chinese Government will not adopt any 
discriminative policy against British businesses as a result of 
the breakdown of Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue. 
  Li said that China welcomes British businesses to 
participate 
in fair competition on the Chinese market and cooperate with 
their Chinese partners on an equal and mutually-beneficial 
footing. 
  Li Peng made the remarks at a reception here this afternoon 
sponsored by Zhou Jue, spokesman for the just-ended Second 
Session of the National People's Congress. 
  He said that there has been traditional cooperation between 
Chinese and British businesses and that such cooperation has not 
been interrupted because of the current state of bilateral 
relations. 
  Yet, the premier said, sound political and diplomatic 
relations between the two countries will surely help promote 
bilateral trade and economic cooperation and, if the two 
countries do not have good political and diplomatic relations, 
it is impossible for bilateral economic and trade ties not to 
suffer at all. 
  Li said that the Chinese side is willing to make efforts to 
minimize any negative impact on British businesses when they 
compete on the Chinese market and make investment in the country.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA)-- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here this afternoon that it has been China's consistent 
position to stand for negotiations and dialogues rather than 
pressure on the issue of nuclear inspection in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  Answering a question by a CNN reporter on China's stand if 
the issue is submitted to the Security Council of the United 
Nations, the premier said that if the method of pressure is 
used, it will only make things more complicated, and make the 
situation on the Korean penninsula tense, and that will not be 
good for the peace and stability of the region. 
  "The issue of nuclear inspection in DPRK has lasted for a 
long time, from disagreeing with inspection to agreeing, which 
well domonstrates that anything can be resolved through 
negotiations and dialogues," the premier said. 
  Li said that China is a signatory to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, and it will never encourage nulcear 
proliferation. 
  The premier told Chinese and foreign reporters attending a 
reception sponsored by the just-concluded National People's 
Congress that if the issue of nuclear inspection in DPRK should 
be submitted to the Security Council of the United Nations, 
Chinese representative to the UN will put forward a 
comprehensive explanation on China's position. 
  "I hope other member countries of the U.N. Security Council 
will accept China's position," the premier concluded.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Li Lanqing said here today that China's re-entry into the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will make 
significant contributions to a healthy development of global 
trade. 
  Li made the remark at a reception for Chinese and foreign 
reporters covering the National People's Congress. 
  Li said that major progress was made during the sixteenth 
round of negotiations on China's resumption of its contracting 
party status in GATT. 
  Li said that the overwhelming majority of GATT contracting 
parties have supported an early resumption of China's GATT 
membership except one contracting member. 
  Li said China has become the 11th biggest trader in the 
world. "China's re-entry into GATT will make significant 
contributions to a healthy development of global trade," he said. 
  The vice-premier said that China will, as always, have 
further negotiations with other contracting parties with a 
positive approach and in accordance with the principle of 
balance between rights and obligations. 
  The European Community and other contracting parties have 
already put forward a draft protocol on China's re-entry into 
GATT, Li pointed out, and other contracting parties have also 
had discussions with China. 
  Regretably, he said, there is one contracting party 
obstructing China's re-entry into GATT, in disagreement with its 
earlier promise of support in bilateral negotiations. Li 
expressed the hope that the contracting party would implement 
its earlier commitment.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- The National People's 
Congress (NPC), China's highest legislative body, will 
strengthen external exchanges to promote mutual understanding 
and friendship between the NPC and its foreign counterparts. 
  Tian Jiyun, a vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, 
made the remark at a reception given by the General Office of 
the NPC Standing Committee here today. 
  Attending the reception were ambassadors and diplomatic 
envoys of relevant foreign countries in Beijing and members of 
the NPC's 35 groups for the promotion of friendly relations with 
foreign countries. 
  In his toast, Tian reviewed the NPC's external activities 
since its first session a year ago. In the past year, the NPC 
Standing Committee and its specialized committees sent 21 
delegations on visits to 49 countries, participated in 26 
international and regional conferences and hosted visits to 
China by 96 foreign parliamentary delegations including 24 
speakers and four deputy speakers. 
  "The NPC's external exchanges in the past year were 
unprecedented in terms of rank, extensiveness and frequency," he 
said. 
  Activities of the friendship groups are part of the NPC's 
external contacts, Tian said. So far, the NPC has reorganized 
and established 35 such groups, and more will be established in 
the future in response to the wishes of foreign parliaments. 
  The purpose of these groups is to promote understanding and 
cooperation with the parliaments and peoples of foreign 
countries, thereby cultivating better state-to-state relations, 
Tian said. 
  Tian described the current second session of the Eighth NPC 
as "having been very successful."

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814), and Wu Yilong </F>
(1566 1150 7893): "Random Notes About the Two Sessions: 
Popularization of Science and Technology Is Essential for 
Revitalizing Agricultural Production"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (XINHUA) -- Agricultural development 
counts on three factors: Policy, investment, and science and 
technology. Although everybody knows the might of science and 
technology in boosting agricultural output, the role played by 
agricultural science and technology is far from having been 
demonstrated. 
  Accordng to deputies attending the current National People's 
Congress [NPC] session, China has achieved results in more than 
25,000 agricultural research projects since the adoption of the 
reform and opening up policy, but many of these achievements 
have been shelved; and while developed countries can attribute 
their higher agricultural output to the application of 70-80 
percent of their research achievements, China can attribute its 
higher agricultural output to the application of only 30-40 
percent of research achievements. 
  Why is it so hard to revitalize agricultural production 
through science and technology? The deputies maintained: The 
problem lies in popularization of agricultural science and 
technology. First of all, the number of technicians is 
inadequate. On the average, there is only one full-time 
technican for 7,000 mu of acreage, and only one animal husbandry 
technician for 2.3 million mu of grassland. Second, low morale 
owing to budget shortage. A deputy from Qinghai compared the 
current state of popularization of agricultural science and 
technology to "a severed thread, a broken net, and the departure 
of personnel." Deputy Liu Zhongzhu, president of the Fujian 
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, maintained that irrational 
structure is also an important cause of ineffective 
popularization of agricultural technology. He said: 
Agricultural colleges are placed under the control of the 
education department; institutes of agricultural sciences are 
placed under the control of the science and technology 
commission; departments in charge of popularization of 
agricultural sciences are placed under the control of the 
agricultural departments; and the agricultural fund is placed 
under the control of departments in charge of planning, 
financial, and banking affairs. Because such controls are very 
unlikely to be merged organically, their strengths as an 
integral whole cannot be manifested. 
  "The situation of popularizing agricultural technology has 
become even worse today." Shandong's NPC Deputy Yu Songlie said 
anxiously: "Under the new situation of developing the market 
economy, some local authorities have arbitrarily 'weaned' the 
organizations in charge of popularizing agricultural technology. 
Consequently these organizations have to find their own way out 
and many technicians have left the agricultural sector to do 
something else. When these people are gone, who is going to 
popularize agricultural technology and train farmers? This 
situation certainly will hinder China's agricultural development 
from reaching a higher stage." Fujian deputy Zeng Jinfeng said: 
Pushing the popularization organs to the market is likely to 
give rise to two problems, even if the technicians of these 
organs choose to stay: First, for the sake of incomes and 
profits, these departments will withhold the technology that 
ought to be popularized; and second, out of consideration for 
economic interests, the technicians will likely popularize only 
the profit-making technology which has nothing to do with grain 
and cotton production. 
  Higher agricultural output depends on two factors: Larger 
acreage and higher per-unit yield. China's situation shows that 
it is hard to depend on the first factor, namely larger acreage, 
which is decreasing; and that increasing per-unit yield 
substantially through counting on scientific and technological 
progress has become increasingly important. For this reason, 
NPC deputies have urged the government that it should take 
measures as quickly as possible to stabilize and strengthen the 
ranks of agricultural technicians to make sure that agricultural 
science and technology can be successfully transformed into 
productive forces.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Special economic 
zones (SEZ) in China will continue to play exemplary roles in 
reform and opening to the outside world, but they have to have 
new strategies to achieve continued high growth, according to 
deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]. 
  The NPC deputies from the SEZs said that development of the 
SEZs will depend on their existing advantages and functions 
rather than on continued state preferential policies. 
  China has established five SEZs of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, 
Shantou, 
Xiamen and Hainan since the late 1970s. Thanks to tax breaks 
and other preferential policies, the SEZs have attracted 
one-fifth of the total foreign investment in China and achieved 
eye-catching progress. 
  Shenzhen has developed from a sleepy border town into a 
modern city with a gross domestic product (GDP) of over 30 
billion yuan in 1993. 
  The SEZs have served as China's window for foreign 
investment, technology and management expertise. 
  However, with the opening of coastal cities and areas 
flanking the Chang Jiang River and border regions, the SEZs have 
lost much of their uniqueness. The SEZs must develop their own 
advantages to continue to lead the nation in economic 
development. 
  Shenzhen Mayor Li Youwei said that the SEZs should set up an 
efficient system, upgrade management, establish a market 
economy, converge with the international market, and attract 
foreign funds and import technology by giving up a share of the 
domestic market to foreign goods and services. 
  The SEZs must replace its present labor-intensive industries 
with technology- and capital-intensive industries, Li said. 
  Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda said that the SEZs should upgrade 
the technology of their existing enterprises, develop upper-end 
products and manufacture goods competitive on both domestic and 
international markets. 
  Some deputies said the SEZs should adopt a new strategy of 
balancing imports and exports, encouraging both inward and 
outbound investment instead of the previous strategy of 
encouraging exports and fund influx only. 
  Shantou Mayor Wu Bo said the SEZs should build more free 
trade zones with a concentration of bonded markets, warehouses 
and factories to promote international trade. 
  Yuan Chongwu, governor of Hainan Province, said "small 
government" is a natural choice for the SEZs so that they can 
cut red-tapes, improve work efficiency, upgrade governmental 
services and convenience investors.

<F P=106> ["NPC-CPPCC Session Commentary" by XINHUA reporters Wang </F>
Haizheng (3769 3189 1767) and Li Pei (2621 3805)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (XINHUA) -- "The gap between the 
eastern and western regions" -- an old and yet new conversation 
topic -- is one of the hot points of discussions among deputies 
from the western region. While the gap between the two regions 
is historical, however, it's widening is real. 
  During the current National People's Congress session, 
although western deputies still called for state support and 
preferential treatment in terms of policies, funds, and 
projects, more and more people started laying more emphasis on 
facing the reality that called for a quick catch up. The 
phenomenon has unveiled an important fact: the western region is 
awakening. 
  First of all, it is necessary to point out that there are 
many difficulties in developing the western region: geographical 
restraints, relatively poor infrastructure, late start, exodus 
of qualified personnel and funds to the east, and others. It is 
completely reasonable for them to request for state help. What 
is commendable is that more westerners are now focusing their 
sights on the inner layers of the problems. 
  In what ways has the western region been inferior to the 
eastern region? 
  -- Lagging behind in thinking and concept. Several deputies 
from the minority nationalities in Ningxia and Xinjiang have 
pointed out: While others have been using air travel in pursuing 
the four modernizations, we have to stop riding a donkey in 
search of a meal. To accelerate development in the minority 
nationalities regions along the frontiers, it is essential to 
continue emancipating minds, renew concepts, overcome the 
mentality of "a little fortune will be enough to bring a sudden 
change and not getting rich does not mean no comfort," and 
really take "conducive to three causes" [conducive to developing 
the productive forces of our socialist society, increasing the 
overall strength of our socialist country, and improving the 
people's living standard] as the sole yardstick in gauging our 
work. The change in concept heralds the awakening of the 
western region. 
  -- Under development of village and town enterprises. 
Deputies from Sichuan Province stated that, although the 
production value of Sichuan's village and town enterprises 
increased 95 percent last year, its absolute quantity is still 
far less than the developed coastal region. In comparison, the 
difference of per capita value of total social production among 
agricultural population between the western and eastern regions 
is 5,897 yuan, of which segment of village and town enterprises 
accounted for 84.5 percent. The western region's backwardness 
lies in village and town enterprises; it is also in these very 
village and town enterprises where we find potential and hopes. 
  -- Small steps in opening up to the outside world. Western 
deputies have discovered that, although the doors of the 
provinces, counties, and mountain villages are wide open, people 
may still not be coming; yet, despite mountain after mountain 
and river after river, nothing can block the flow of qualified 
personnel and funds toward the east. This is mainly due to the 
role of market mechanisms. According to them, as far as opening 
up is concerned, there is no such thing as being situated at the 
rear; what is intolerable is sitting idly at the doorstep and 
waiting for guests to appear and blaming everyone and 
everything but oneself. To channel in funds, technologies, and 
qualified personnel from other provinces and countries, the 
western region must rely on their own superiority and take the 
initiative in launching the offensive. 
  What are the western region's advantages? It's resources. 
Unlike the past, when westerners refer to the definition of 
resources today, they do not merely mean "the rich natural 
resources on and under the ground." They have further 
discovered that its untapped big markets, ample labor supply, 
existing state-owned large and medium enterprises, "third-line" 
enterprises, universities and colleges, and scientific research 
academies and institutes are all valuable resources of the 
western region. 
  Western deputies said: With help from the state, support 
from the eastern region, opportunities brought about by a market 
economy, and joint efforts of the westerners, the western 
region's resources superiority will certainly be translated into 
comprehensive economic superiority that will gradually narrow 
the gap between the eastern and western regions before a sure 
economic takeoff.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- China's reform to 
turn state-owned enterprises into joint-stock companies has been 
a hot topic among deputies to the National People's Congress 
(NPC) now in session in the Chinese capital. 
  Conversion of state enterprises into joint-stock companies 
is 
one of the prominent reform measures that have been taken in 
China to establish a modern enterprise system. 
  Deputies point out that experiment in this regard has 
achieved marked progress in the past decade, which has proved 
that the share-holding system has injected vigor into state 
enterprises. 
  According to He Guanghui, vice minister in charge of the 
State Commission for Economic Restructuring, economic 
restructuring in China has always been concentrated on the 
central task of reforming enterprises. 
  "Establishment of a share-holding system has been at the 
core 
of the task of changing the operational mechanism of state 
enterprises. China has accumulated experience and achieved good 
results in this regard," he said. 
  Reform of state enterprises has gone through a series of 
phases in the past 15 years, evolving from operational autonomy 
for enterprises, to contractual responsibility, and to 
transformation of their operational mechanism. 
  But on the whole, state enterprises are yet to be 
invigorated. 
  Deputies say that, since the government has decided to 
establish a modern enterprise system, the share-holding system, 
as a prominent form of organization that clearly defines 
ownership relations and operational mechanism, has become an 
important way of choice for invigorating state enterprises in a 
market economy. 
  As state enterprises have different conditions, there should 
be many ways to invigorate them, deputies say. Their consensus 
is that a single formula will not do when it comes to enterprise 
reform. 
  Zhang Shouye, an NPC deputy from Linyi, Shandong Province, 
says that different enterprises should adopt different ways of 
reform. They can choose from a share-holding system, a 
share-holding cooperative system, management by collectives or 
individuals, leasing, and auction. 
  He said: "If an enterprise adopts a share-holding system, 
its workers will have a strengthened sense of being the owners 
of the enterprise involved, and that will enable them to do a 
better job and the enterprise to prosper." 
  Economist Wang Jue says that the more share holders an 
enterprise has, the more there are people who care about its 
performance. 
  Xiao Guojin, professor of Wuhan University, says that an 
important content of building a modern enterprise system is to 
organize an enterprise in the form of a company and raise funds 
by issuing shares. 
  Large state enterprises should be transformed into limited 
liability companies, he says. 
  According to Wang Jue, in a typical joint-stock company, 
one-third of its shares are sold to its employees, another 
one-third are sold to outside investors, and still another 
one-third are owned by the government, which can thus control 
the company. 
  Today, according to official figures, there are over 11,500 
enterprises in China that have adopted a corporate system. 
Among them, more than 3,000 are limited liability join-stock 
companies, with a total stock value of around 300 billion yuan. 
These companies are distributed in 30 provinces, autonomous 
regions and centrally-administered municipalities. And the 
number of their share holders has reached 25 million. 
  Deputies stress that transformation of state enterprises 
into 
joint-stock companies must be carried out prudently. 
  According to Wang Genyuan, director of the Dezhou Textile 
Mill in Shandong Province and an NPC deputy, before such 
transformation, a number of problems must be sorted out. These 
include: asset evaluation, ways to preserve and increase the 
value of state-owned assets, and relations between the share 
holders conference and the workers' congress. 
  He Jiezhi, an NPC deputy and chairman of the Jincheng Paper 
Co. in Liaoning Province, says establishment of a corporate 
system requires certain conditions, among which are existence of 
a social security system, and freedom from debts and government 
interference. 
  "If these problems are not solved, a corporate system cannot 
be established," he said. 
  That is why, according to He Guanghui, the share-holding 
system is still at an experimental stage. 
  "Most enterprises embracing the share-holding system will be 
limited liability companies," he said. "Only a few will be 
listed on stock exchanges." 
  At present, the government still exercises controls over the 
number of listed companies and the amount of shares issued. To 
date, a total of 183 companies in China have their shares 
listed. And last year the government allowed five billion yuan 
worth of shares to be issued, and this year only a marginal 
increase is expected. 
  According to government policy, share issues will be limited 
largely to companies in energy, transport and raw materials 
sectors. 
  Inside sources say this year China will continue to 
encourage 
a number of enterprises to issue shares in Hong Kong and the 
United States.

<F P=106> ["Analysis of the Two Sessions" by staff reporter Xiao Rui </F>
(5135 3843): "Efforts Must Be Made To Eliminate 
Inflation--`China's Agony'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Price raises 
and inflation are parts of present-day China's social agony. 
They are also hot topics at the ongoing National People's 
Congress [NPC] session and the session of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. 
  In the last few days, NPC deputies and CPPCC members have 
expressed their views on commodity prices in almost every 
speech. Sun Shangqing, NPC deputy and director of the State 
Council's Development Research Center, said worriedly: Price 
increases were a little too high last year and became higher at 
the beginning of this year. If this is not strictly controlled, 
the plan to keep price increases under 10 percent this year will 
fall through. 
  CPPCC members Wang Rongbing and Qu Qinyue made the following 
appeal: Excessive price increase in commodities closely related 
to the people's lives have affected the people's standard of 
living and feelings; mandatory limits must be set for price 
increase indices and these limits must not be overstepped. 
  Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi spoke about the pressure he 
endured 
and his feelings: The increase in the purchase prices of grain, 
cotton, and oil; the lifting of control over the prices of coal, 
electricity, and crude oil; the introduction of the civil 
service system; the implementation of wage system reform in 
institutions; and the rapid growth of investments in fixed 
assets in the entire society will all cause commodity price 
raises. It will be hard to keep price increases under 10 
percent this year. 
  NPC deputies and CPPCC members discussed state affairs and 
expressed the people's opinions. Their worries are not without 
foundation. 
  Since November last year, commodity prices have kept rising. 
  At first, panic buying of grain and oil swept from the south 
to the north, causing anxiety among civilians; subsequently, the 
standardization of foreign exchange rates caused some turbulence 
in the use of foreign exchange certificates; some people with 
foreign exchange certificates in hand began to buy gold 
ornaments and imported electrical appliances, also causing some 
unrest; afterward, taxation system reform was introduced amid 
price raises, during which some people could not understand the 
17 percent increment value-added tax and the consumer tax on 
some commodities. Some people availed themselves of the 
opportunity to increase commodity prices, even the prices of 
some overstocked products. 
  Statistics revealed by an authoritative department indicate 
the civilian pressure: In January this year, the civilian cost 
of living throughout the country increased by 21.1 percent over 
the same period last year; in February it rose to 23.3 percent; 
the cost of living in 35 big cities increased by 25.9 percent. 
  In particular, the prices of daily necessities and service 
charges increased very sharply. 
  There are all kinds of indications that the civilian 
capacity 
to endure inflation has reached a critical point. If commodity 
price raises are not strictly controlled, economic relations 
will be distorted, the macroeconomic environment will become 
intense, and the overall situation of reform and opening up will 
be endangered. 
  Chinese statesmen are absolutely sober-minded about this 
point. They do not deny inflation and have made up their minds 
to introduce control and regulation. At these ongoing NPC and 
CPPCC sessions, government leaders have, of course, focused on 
controlling excessive price increases. 
  Li Peng said: Lifting control over prices does not mean 
giving up macrocontrol and regulation; prices must be controlled 
within the framework of the forbearance of civilians; in 
particular the "vegetable basket" issue regarding the urban and 
rural people must be properly resolved. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Controlling prices and stabilizing markets 
are important tasks for governments at all levels. From now on, 
achievements in agricultural and vegetable basket issues should 
be taken as the main criteria for appraising governors, 
provincial party secretaries, and mayors. 
  Li Lanqing said: If prices cannot be controlled, popular 
feelings and stability will be affected and reform cannot be 
carried on. Economic, legal, and administrative methods should 
be adopted to stabilize prices. 
  Recently, the Chinese Government has repeatedly given orders 
demanding the clear pricing of commodities, the implementation 
of price checks, and strict supervision of the prices of daily 
necessities and service charges. These moves have initially 
stabilized popular feelings but whether or not they will help 
halt excessive price increases remains to be seen. The policy 
is good but needs to be put into effect. 
  In Chinese society, which is experiencing the transformation 
from a planned economy into a market economy, from lower to 
higher income, and from closed to open operation, the 
large-scale introduction of reform and rapid economic growth 
will inevitably cause certain inflation. In this situation, the 
government must severely curb the practice of raising prices at 
will and strictly control the investment scale and consumption 
fund to fundamentally stop price hikes. On the civilians' part, 
they should spend their money reasonably, promptly report 
malpractices, and avoid panic buying -- this is a sensible 
choice. 
  We should not turn pale at the mention of price raises 
because, if we do, we will not be able to control them. 
However, neither should we take the problem of price hikes 
lightly, otherwise it could affect and ruin reform and 
discourage the reformers. 
  "China's agony" really exists but a new life will emerge 
after this agony.

<F P=106> [By reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 7160): "Some </F>
Deputies to `Two Sessions' Appeal to Authorities To Pay Great 
Attention to Sharpening Contradictions Among People"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Some 
deputies to the "two sessions" this year held that, at present, 
there are strained relations between the party and the masses 
and between cadres and the masses as well as the outstanding 
problems of intensifying contradictions among the people. They 
said that it is necessary to pay great attention to these 
problems and deal with them properly, otherwise social unrest 
and political instability will ensue. 
  Xing Bensi, deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC] 
and vice-principal of the CPC Central Party School, said in an 
interview with this reporter: If in the 1950's and 1960's, the 
contradictions among the people markedly manifested themselves 
in the ideological arena, they are now evident in economic 
benefits. Unfair distribution and a wide gap between the rich 
and poor has become an outstanding problem toward which the 
masses bear deep resentment. 
  He said: An important factor leading to strained relations 
between the party and the masses and intensifying contradictions 
among the people is the problem of party style. Once a minority 
of party members and cadres have grasped power, they are 
concerned only with their own interests and no longer work for 
the masses. In the end, they will meet with the opposition of 
the masses. 
  Guo Ningfu, member of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, said: At 
present, the public order situation is not good, prices have 
been rising too fast, and the phenomenon of corruption is 
serious. If these problems are settled properly, the people's 
unity can be strengthened and our undertakings can further 
flourish; but if these problems are not settled well, 
contradictions will be intensified and this will unnecessarily 
infringe upon social stability and the development of our 
undertakings. 
  Hou Zhenting and other NPC deputies from Hunan said: On the 
one hand, teachers' pay is in arrears and IOUs are issued for 
grain purchases; on the other hand, gorgeous offices are built 
and top-grade limousines are bought; and enterprises are in the 
red and workers' basic pay cannot be guaranteed while, on the 
other hand, factory directors and managers travel and give 
lavish banquets to others at public expense. How can the masses 
be satisfied with this? 
  Xing Bensi said: It is necessary to pay great attention to 
solving some outstanding problems regarding the relations 
between the party and the masses and between cadres and the 
masses to pacify the masses. For example, the phenomenon of 
issuing IOUs is, to be blunt, a kind of peasant exploitation. 
Viewed from historical experience, if something goes wrong in 
China in the future, this will be where the problem comes from. 
Therefore, we can never again allow any infringements on 
peasants' interests. 
  Li Zhen, NPC deputy from Shandong, said: Apart from 
conscientiously improving the people's living standards and 
doing a good job in the comprehensive management of social 
order, governments at all levels must maintain closer ties with 
the masses, always have their well-being at heart, do more 
practical and good things for the people, properly handle 
contradictions among the people under the new situation, and nip 
various unstable factors in the bud. 
  NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members also held 
that vigorous measures must be taken to wipe out special 
privileges and corrupt behavior, both of which are detested by 
the masses. They proposed strengthening mass supervision of 
government officials.

<F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter He Wei (0149 0251) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Ma Kuijun (7456 7608 0689): "A Formula From 
Deputies: The Sum of Pragmatism and Practical Action Is 
Implementation -- on the Eve of the Conclusion of the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the eve of the 
conclusion of the National People's Congress [NPC] session, 
deputy Zhang Lichang, who is the mayor of Tianjin, made a remark 
that reflected the wishes of many deputies: "Now that the 
blueprint has been mapped out, the key lies in implementing it. 
Implementation is not an easy task; we should realistically 
think of a way to implement the blueprint." 
  It is true that the current NPC session has been lively and 
fruitful despite its short duration. Deputies are aware that 
the session is being held at a time when our country's reform 
and opening up are entering a new phase and when various reforms 
of the economic structure are entering a crucial moment. The 
central authorities have defined the overall task of "seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability" for the entire party and 
country. Not only does this task accord with the aspirations of 
hundreds of millions of people nationwide, but also conforms to 
our country's reality and objective laws. Deputies attending 
the session, therefore, signaled their intention of applying 
centrally determined goals, major policies and principles, and 
development ideas to their jobs in good time; of relaying them 
to the masses; and of turning the intentions of central 
authorities into society-wide and nationwide actions at the 
earliest possible date. 
  "We are thinking of a way to implement the blueprint." 
Deputy Ye Liansong, who is Hebei governor, was still busy at 
this desk in the dead of night. He said: "The government of 
the current term has proposed turning Hebei into an economically 
strong province? How shall we achieve this? By thoroughly and 
actually implementing specific aspects of the major policies and 
principles of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council at 
the earliest possible date." 
  His remarks hit the nail on the head. The deputies are 
generally aware that "thorough implementation" carries 
exceptional significance this year, particularly with respect to 
the CPC Central Committee's call for "conceiving new ideas for 
economic development." This year is crucial to reform and 
opening up. Many major reform measures have been introduced. 
We shall encounter considerable problems and difficulties. 
This requires people to think more often, more closely, and 
more thoroughly. We should go to the front lines to find 
effective solutions to problems. 
  Ye Liansong noted: The key to implementing the blueprint is 
to change leading cadres' work style. We must proceed in a 
down-to-earth manner. "Dishonest and substandard" work carried 
out by leading cadres are even more harmful than "counterfeit 
and inferior" products produced by enterprises. He cited an 
example, saying: Toward the end of last year, the provincial 
party committee and government experimentally implemented a new 
set of measures and regimes of incentives and restraints 
regarding the appointment of cadres. The purpose of these 
measures and regimes is to appoint cadres who work in a 
down-to-earth manner to important positions so as to create a 
situation in which "capable people will be promoted, people of 
average ability will make way for others, and mediocre people 
will be demoted," as well as to promote the habits of 
determining the true state of affairs, telling the truth, doing 
practical turns, and seeking tangible results. 
  To implement the blueprint is to be practical. To be 
practical is to assess local advantages and disadvantages in an 
extremely objective and calm manner, and to pinpoint problems 
and their root causes in a down-to-earth manner before making 
great efforts to surmount them. In short, it means seeking 
truth from facts. 
  Deputy Wang Guiming, who is secretary of Tianjin's Nankai 
district party committee, said: We still have a long way to go 
before we can turn the intentions of central authorities into 
actions at the grass-roots level and achieve tangible results. 
He maintained: Fund shortages aside, the greatest difficulty 
in seizing the opportunity to develop the economy stems from 
structural problems. We have yet to streamline the government 
apparatus and completely change the government's functions. 
Policies now come from different sources, and there are just 
too many departments in charge. In handling an affair, one has 
to consult 36 departments. By the time one has accomplished an 
affair, the market opportunity has long passed. It seems that 
establishing a leadership system consistent with the socialist 
market economy is a pressing task. 
  What shall we do at the moment? Practical action is needed 
to implement the blueprint amid considerable difficulties and 
problems. Hebei deputies Li Ruichang and Bai Runzhang found 
themselves in agreement with Tianjin deputies Wang Guiming, Hi 
Zhikuan, and Kou Shiqing on this matter. They all said: "We 
still need to solve reform-related problems through reform 
means." They maintained: At present, we should draw on 
advanced management expertise at home and abroad in order to 
break free from the old management mode. We should carry out 
reform in our work and perform our work in the course of reform. 
Moreover, we should limit the time and simplify the procedures 
for handling matters by leaders at all levels and by general 
affairs departments. They also proposed: The government should 
change its functions in the course of reform, letting the market 
deal with things that should be handled by market forces and 
allowing enterprises to manage matters that fall within the 
scope of their authority. The government should only concern 
itself with exercising macroeconomic regulation and control, 
with coordinating actions, and with providing service. 
  Savvy entrepreneurs are the most practical men of action. 
When the reporters asked deputies Ji Xuecheng and Liu Jianzhang 
-- respectively general manager of Tianjin Automotive Industrial 
Corporation and board chairman of Tianjin Hualian Trading House 
-- on how to "implement" the blueprint, they pronounced these 
two characters: "Practical deeds." They explained: "Stalling" 
is the dreaded character when it comes to implementing the 
blueprint. Postponing a matter from today until tomorrow and 
from tomorrow until the day after tomorrow is something to be 
worried about. 
  Li Huisheng, a peasant deputy from Baoding District, said: 
"The NPC session stresses the importance of agriculture 
everyday. Nevertheless, relevant policies have not been 
implemented among peasants. At the end of each year, for 
example, peasants are left with just over 100 yuan for each mu 
of land tilled, although they had all along been anticipating 
additional incomes. When shall we ever become comparatively 
well-to-do? He said: We, peasants, have composed a doggerel: 
The prices of production means are soaring, the prices of 
agricultural and sideline products are crawling, and the 
benefits from agricultural and cotton production are sliding. 
The eight measures for strengthening agriculture outlined in 
Premier Li Peng's report struck a chord with us. We hope these 
measures will come to fruition. We, peasants, are waiting for 
results." 
  It is true that people across the country are waiting for, 
looking forward to, and assessing actions to implement the 
guidelines of the current session.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- During this year's 
National People's Congress [NPC], as in last year's session, the 
market economy is a topic discussed most frequently among 
deputies. What differs between this year and last is the new 
perception acquired by the deputies on building a socialist 
market economic structure. They stress the need to "have new 
ideas" when speaking about development and to pay attention to 
"the overall situation and balance." 
  We can also cite many other similar "changes." 
  A feeling common to all deputies is that the socialist 
market 
economy is a great school where you can learn things that could 
never be learned in the past several decades. 
<H3>  A Practice-Rooted Great Theory Triggers Profound Social and 
Economic Changes; the Great Stage of the Times Is Full of 
Vitality, and the Spring Tide of Reform and Development Surges 
in Our Vast Divine Land </H3>
  Nine years after the birth of New China, people through 
practice began to understand the role of the law of value. 
Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: The law of value is a 
great school. 
  After several decades of arduous exploration and under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, we have finally established a 
model that makes the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure the goal of China's economic structural 
reform. We have codified this model in the 14th national party 
congress report and the PRC Constitution, thereby transforming 
it into the will of the party, the state, and the people. 
  Its rippling effect is like a rock thrown into the water. 
  Last year, from the coastal region to the interior, reform 
deepened, opening up widened, and the economy developed 
healthily. News brought by deputies from different localities, 
departments, and industries is heartening. Figures released by 
authoritative departments are likewise encouraging. 
  Capital, labor, technologies, and other production factors 
are flowing and optimizing in the market, breaking geographic 
and space restrictions and creating many new industries and new 
economic benefits. 
  New development ideas and strategies and new reform measures 
are being transformed into action. 
  Amid this great tide of market economy, the central and 
western regions, not to mention the eastern and southern coastal 
regions, are trying to find the optimum development strategy. 
  Shanxi, a province rich in energy resources, has formulated 
an energy construction and development strategy under which it 
tries to vigorously tap the market, break the transportation 
bottleneck, undertake large projects to benefit from economies 
of scale, broaden processing, and march toward the world market. 
Deputy Hu Fuguo said: Thanks to the implementation of this 
strategy, Shanxi's construction of energy and heavy chemical 
bases last year began to enter the "fast track." 
  Yue Qifeng, a deputy from China's heavy industrial base of 
Liaoning, said: Liaoning has found itself in the transition to 
a market economy from a planned economy and has begun its 
arduous market-oriented "second pioneering." 
  The once enclosed and backward Yunnan has changed. Governor 
He Zhiqiang, also a deputy, said: "Last year, we seized the 
opportunity to open our southern gate to move toward the 
Asia-Pacific region. This has increasingly narrowed the 
distance between once enclosed Yunnan and the outside world." 
  Qinghai has rich natural resources. However, it has suffered 
from poverty despite its "gold mountain." At the NPC session, 
Deputy Tian Chengping said: We felt "suddenly enlightened" when 
we took another look at our strong points from the new 
perspective of market economy. Qinghai must not fear taking 
risks if it wants to open its door. We must let other people 
make a profit after entering the province. 
  The deputies also brought with them news on the public 
security and judicial, educational, cultural, ideological, and 
theoretical fronts. All fronts across the country have stepped 
up self-construction, focusing on accomplishing the goal of 
building a new structure. This has created a favorable 
environment for the establishment of the new structure. 
  Studying in the great school of socialist market economy, 
our 
cadres and people have learned and grasped many philosophic 
theories on reform, development, and stability. 
  The party Central Committee assessed the situation and, 
after summing up practical experience, forwarded the emphasis of 
work: "to seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, 
promote development, and maintain statability." Recalling what 
was done over the past year, the deputies believe from the 
bottom of their hearts that the emphasis of work is a 
concentrated summation of the practical experience of the whole 
party and the people across the country, as well as a 
concentrated summation of the knowledge acquired by the hundreds 
of millions of people in the great school of socialist market 
economy. 
<H3>  Practice Produces Genuine Knowledge, Understanding Is 
Enhanced During the Course of Practice, Practice Leads to Ways 
and Means, the Solution of Tough Problems Begins During the 
Course of Practice, and People Gradually Become Wise in the 
Great School of Socialist Market Economy </H3>
  Shuai Liguo, mayor of Beihai, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region, and a NPC deputy, said emotionally after summing up last 
year's experience that market economy has taught us something 
new, something the people in Beihai could not learn for many 
years. What he said is significant and worth pondering, and it 
is not just the experience of him alone. As shown by their 
speeches, the deputies have become more comprehensive in their 
observation of things and their methods of analyzing problems 
have become more conformable with materialist dialectics. 
  A craze for undertaking real estate business, development 
projects, and fund-raising occurred in some regions last summer. 
To deal with it, the central authorities proceeded from 
rectifying the banking order and resolutely took a series of 
macroeconomic regulation and control measures. Guangdong deputy 
Huang Diyan said at the current NPC session: The macroeconomic 
regulation and control has solved the overheated economy problem 
in some regions while maintaining high growth rate. This shows 
that we have begun to free ourselves from the vicious circle of 
"relaxation of control leading to disorder, disorder leading to 
resumed control, and control leading to stagnation." 
  Market grain prices rose sharply at the end of last year, 
and 
the governments at all levels had to adopt measures to stabilize 
the prices. At the current NPC session, some deputies from 
grass-roots units pointed out that it is the government's duty 
to take care of the price business. Some deputies holding 
leading posts said that it is the commodity price department's 
functional responsibility to stabilize the prices and the 
government should fulfill its duty. 
  The law of socialist market economy has provided clear and 
definite answers to questions about which people had endless 
arguments in the past. It has unified those understandings that 
were not unified for a long time in the past. 
  Market economy is the best way for distributing resources 
and 
guiding production, but it is not omnipotent. Hainan deputy 
Ruan Chongwu said that although market regulation can solve many 
problems, there are sill some problems that cannot be solved by 
market regulation alone and must be solved with government 
intervention. The government should adapt itself to the law of 
market economy and change its functions. It is not that market 
economy needs no government intervention at all. Market economy 
requires the government to provide more effective and 
standardized economic management. Shanghai deputy Gao Wenkui 
said: It is a misinterpretation that socialist market economy 
needs relaxed or no macroeconomic regulation and control. Other 
deputies said that the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure does not mean the dispensability of the 
central government's authority, and that macroeconomic 
regulation and control by a highly authoritative and powerful 
central government are always indispensable to the development 
of socialist market economy. On questions concerning growth 
rate and the local economic situation, the deputies now seldom 
follow the old practice of arguing over whether or not the rate 
is warranted, and whether an overheated economy is good or bad. 
They are using productive forces and the market as criteria in 
appraising these questions. They hold that high growth rate is 
OK so long as we are capable of it and the products are of good 
quality, yield high economic returns, and have a market; and 
that it is total blindness to seek high growth rate in disregard 
of objective conditions and market factors. 
  The deputies have an unprecedentedly unified understanding 
of 
the emphasis of work for the whole party and country this year. 
They wholeheartedly support the emphasis. Guangxi deputy Zhao 
Fulin said: As we are a team rowing the big boat of the 
country, we should follow the drum and work together. The 
deputies' rational views show that both our people and our 
country are becoming mature in the great school of socialist 
market economy. 
<H3>  Things Always Advance Wave Upon Wave and Develop in Spirals; 
the Edifice of the New Structure Cannot Be Built Overnight; We 
Must Practice Again and Again and Study Again and Again in This 
Great School </H3>
  A market economy consists of a comprehensive economic 
operational system, and establishing a socialist market economic 
structure is a gigantic system engineering work. Deputy Lu 
Xueyi, a sociologist, said: The change from a planned economy 
to a market economy involves a fairly long process that cannot 
be completed at one stroke. The edifice of the new structure 
cannot be built overnight. Our tasks are still extremely 
arduous, and there are still many things we do not know. We are 
trying to build a socialist market economic structure, an 
original creation that has no established patterns for us to 
follow. To avoid detours, we have no other alternatives but to 
study and study and explore and explore. Zhao Pengfei, a deputy 
from Beijing, said: Deepening reform is an arduous task, and 
new developments and problems will appear in the process of 
building a socialist market economy. This requires us to study 
harder and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. Some deputies 
who were in leading positions felt deeply about their lack of 
knowledge, ability, and skills and the need to learn and grasp 
many new things in the great tide of the market economy. 
Shandong deputy Jiang Chunyun said: We must learn from the 
masses and the market, and we must further emancipate our minds 
and change our concepts. Fujian deputy Jia Qinglin said: We 
must learn more about dialectics to improve our leadership art 
and skills. 
  Establishing a socialist market economy is a pioneering work 
without precedent. To move from "disorder" to "order," new 
problems and contradictions will appear all the time. Deputies 
not only brought new experiences to the session from the 
localities but they also brought new problems requiring urgent 
solutions. 
  In essence, a market economy is a kind of economy with a 
highly developed culture. It requires idealism and the pursuit 
of ideals. Indulgence in irrational over-expansion is bound to 
lead to chaos. Many deputies stress the need to pay attention to 
noneconomic aspects of socialist market economy, pointing out 
that a legal system and spiritual civilization serve as 
infrastructures for the new socialist market. Tianjin deputy 
Gao Dezhan said: Spiritual civilization must enter a new stage 
of development along with economic construction to create a good 
environment for reform and development. Qiao Weixiong, another 
Tianjin deputy, pointed out that dedication to one's work is an 
important element of China's character and moral education. He 
called for publicizing it and using it to educate people. 
  Deputies touched a broad range of issues related to the 
topic 
of establishing a socialist market economy. Some deputies 
commented on ways to make government more effective and to 
operate the economy more according to established standards. 
Some suggested ways to handle well relations between developing 
the economy and controlling inflation. Still others suggested 
ways and means to maintain balanced development between regions, 
between industries, and between urban and rural areas; to help 
peasants enter the market as soon as possible; and to guide 
state-owned large and medium enterprises change operating 
mechanisms. It is safe to say that in the great school of 
socialist market economy, deputies have filled in many blanks in 
the test. 
  Lenin once said: During the revolutionary period, millions 
of people learned more things in a week than they did in a year 
of their befuddled lives. Now, our reform goal has been set, 
and the blueprint of construction has been drawn. If we study 
with an open mind, courageously explore the great school of 
socialist market economy, and transform every measure into 
effective and concrete action, the edifice of the new structure 
will certainly be able to stand rock-solid in China's vast land.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese experts 
attending the ongoing session of the National People's Congress 
(NPC) and their colleagues who are not at the session forecast a 
"moderate" economic growth rate and a "moderate" inflation for 
China in 1994. 
  They maintained that the national economic growth rate in 
China this year will be slightly lower than last year's, but 
will not go stagnant, if no serious natural calamities occur and 
no major changes take place in state macro-economic control 
policies. But, they predicted, the task to keep inflation under 
control and solve difficulties for enterprises will be more 
arduous. 
  This year the central government sets the national economic 
growth rate at nine percent and will control inflation below 10 
percent. 
  Though experts differ on China's economic growth rate this 
year, a near-unanimous understanding is that, to seek a fast 
growth rate, it is essential to shift priority from expanding 
scale to improving efficiency. Future economic development 
should be governed by macro-economic controls, especially by 
financial policies. 
  Experts predicted that this year China's economic efficiency 
is likely to improve, but not by a big margin. It takes time to 
improve efficiency as a whole, industrial efficiency in 
particular. 
  Wu Jie, an NPC deputy and vice minister in charge of the 
State Commission for Economic Restructuring, said the economic 
growth rate this year projected by the government conforms to 
China's potential for actual growth. It is designed with the 
overall environment of economic performance and tolerance taken 
into full consideration. 
  "If we simply expand demands to seek a fast economic growth, 
inflation will go up too," Wu added. 
  When China's economy entered a speedy growth period in 1992, 
the growth rate of its gross domestic product was 13.2 percent 
that year. In 1993, the growth rate was 13.4 percent. Fast 
economic growth has significantly strengthened the national 
strength, but, at the same time, has brought about some 
conspicuous contradictions and problems, putting strains on the 
overall economic environment. 
  Liu Guoguang, an NPC deputy and an economist, saw the 
economy 
as characterized by four "highs" and four "strains:" high 
inflation, high industrial growth, high growth in money and 
credit supply, and high price rise; and strains on transport, 
energy supply, major raw materials supply, and funds. 
  Liu maintained that this year China's economic growth may 
come down to about 10 percent and inflation may be kept below 10 
percent. 
  Li Yining, an NPC deputy and an economist, maintained that 
there should be a "relatively fast and rational" development 
speed. Using a metaphor, he said economic development is like 
bicycle-riding -- "a too fast ride may lead to a fall while a 
too slow ride will lead to a stop." 
  Qiu Xiaohua, a senior economist with the State Statistics 
Bureau, predicted that China's economy will maintain a 
relatively fast growth rate. He listed five factors to back his 
views. 
  First, high consumer spending in a populous country provides 
necessary impetus for economic growth; second, the urgent need 
to expand construction scale resulting from uneven industrial 
development will inject vitality into the economy; third, in the 
course of changing the old system, once restrained productive 
forces will be released steadily; fourth, breakthroughs will be 
made in absorbing foreign investment; and fifth, along with a 
slow recovery of the world economy, markets will expand. 
  Qiu maintained that, while keeping a relatively high growth 
rate, it is necessary to highlight a "healthy" economic growth 
and give equal emphasis to speed and efficiency. Economic 
growth rate should slow down in a proper manner to "land softly" 
to avoid too heavy economic losses. 
  On strengthening macro-economic controls, experts said it is 
necessary to bring under control investment in fixed assets, 
which may fuel inflation. Economist Ma Hong suggested that 
total control be strengthened and investment structure be 
readjusted to use limited financial and material resources on 
key projects badly needed by the country. 
  Economist Dai Yuanchen said China's economic growth is 
supported by its massive investment in fixed assets instead of 
being propelled by consumption. Of the 13.4 percent economic 
growth rate last year, less than five percentage points were 
propelled by consumption, Dai added. In his view, without being 
backed by consumption, high growth will not last long. 
  As for this year's inflation, Qiu Xiaohua regarded the 
situation as "grim," because last year's inflation of 13 percent 
has left "upward" factors for this year. The unification of 
exchange rates and taxation reforms will also have an impact on 
prices, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (CNS) -- Smuggling activities 
have been carried out in recent years in groups and seen wider 
coverage of areas with the use of modern vehicles, while the 
equipment employed by the law enforcement personnel appeared 
outdated when compared with that used by the smugglers, a member 
of the National People's Congress, chief of the armed police in 
Fujian and deputy director of the bureau of public security in 
the province, Mr. Hong Hu, said in an interview with this agency. 
  Mr. Hong said that the 3,000-kilometre-long coastline in 
Fujian was ridden with smuggling activities, with the smuggled 
items switched from the traditional ones of cigarettes, alcohol 
and native products to drugs, pornographic articles, electric 
appliances and cars. All such smuggling was conducted in a much 
more concealed way and with greater cunning. Worse was the 
involvement of some Sino-foreign joint-ventured enterprises in 
the smuggling in the name of imports of raw and processed 
material. They smuggled car parts and electric appliances 
hidden with normal import items making it difficult for customs 
to discover. 
  Mr. Hong saw smuggling following several ways. First, the 
smuggling groups tended to be well organized and covering wider 
areas, including Hong Kong, Thailand, the Philippines and South 
Korea. 
  Second, the areas at home included in smuggling activities 
extended from the coastal areas along Fujian, Zhejiang and 
Guangdong in the past to wider areas. 
  Third, the equipment involved in smuggling tended to be 
modernized, with speedboats capable of sailing at up to 40 sea 
miles per hour as well as advanced communications devices. 
  Since there was a shortage of input of resources into the 
fight against smuggling, the equipment used by marine 
anti-smuggling teams in the Mainland was old-fashioned when 
compared with that employed by the smugglers. Mr. Hong said he 
was convinced that the state should earmark part of money put at 
hundreds of millions of renminbi resulting from the seizure of 
smuggled items every year to strengthen the marine force to 
counter smuggling at sea.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xiao Rui (5618 3843): "NPC Delegates Hu Yamei, </F>
Yan Renying Propose Conditional Implementation of Euthanasia 
Under Legal Supervision"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- At a time 
when euthanasia still arouses much debate in society, some 
medical experts attending the National People's Congress [NPC] 
strongly recommend early conditional implementation of 
euthanasia under legal supervision. 
  At the NPC convened here, noted medical experts Hu Yamei and 
Yan Renying headed the list of proponents putting forward this 
motion. They held that: At present, some old people have lost 
the ability to take care of themselves. They are confined to 
their beds, are incontinent, and unable to control their bowels. 
Their minds are no longer clear, and they must be looked after 
by their children. The aged are very painful. Not only do 
their children find this difficult to bear -- both spiritually 
and financially -- but they also are a burden on the state. 
Under this situation, the implementation of euthanasia is very 
essential. At present, Denmark and some states in the United 
States already have passed euthanasia legislation, and with 
international precedents, China can implement euthanasia under 
prescribed conditions on an experimental basis and under 
legislation. 
  The motion suggests that euthanasia should be allowed under 
the following conditions: 
  Old people who have lost the ability to take care of 
themselves, who have been unable to walk or move their limbs at 
will, who have been incontinent and unable to control their 
bowels for more than one year, and who have not been able to 
recuperate, as proved by medical examination. 
  Cancer patients who have reached an advanced stage of the 
disease owing to widespread metastasis; who cannot recuperate, 
even with long-term treatment; who suffer intolerable pain and 
must use anesthetics and analgesics, such as demerol 
hydrochloride, for a long period of time in order to sustain 
their lives and who are worn out from their use. 
  Under these two conditions, patients who have been proved by 
medical examination to be incurable may ask for euthanasia with 
the consent of their spouses and children. Their cases then 
will be handled by local notaries, and euthanasia will be 
implemented in hospitals in accordance with the notarization. 
  People who have completely lost consciousness and are in a 
vegetative state, who have not recuperated after more than a 
year's treatment, who need special nursing care, and who are a 
burden on their family members and to the state. Under this 
situation, with the consent of their family members, their cases 
can be taken by their family members to notaries for 
notarization, and then euthanasia will be implemented in 
hospitals. 
  It has been learned that some dozens of NPC delegates -- 
including experts, scholars, leading cadres, and ordinary 
laborers from all walks of life -- have seconded this motion 
advocating conditional euthanasia.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng's 
government work report has been revised according to opinions 
and suggestions raised by deputies to the Eighth National 
People's Congress (NPC). 
  The additions deal with reducing peasants' burden, the 
modern 
enterprise system, the promotion of socialist ethics and 
culture, and the Hong Kong issue. 
  The revised government work report was adopted at the 
closing 
meeting of the NPC second session here today. 
  Reducing peasants' burden and increasing their income was a 
daily topic during the 13-day NPC session. The report adds 
"special handling of outstanding issues" after stressing 
continuous implementation of measures to reduce peasants' income. 
  Establishment of a modern enterprise system is the direction 
for reform of state-owned enterprises. The report adds 
"actively summing up experience and gradually forming standard 
implementation methods to facilitate their dissemination" after 
the content of launching pilot programs adopting the modern 
enterprise system in accordance with the company law. 
  On socialist cultural undertakings, the report adds 
"opposing 
and resisting bad works that hurt people's unity, social 
progress and physical and mental health of juveniles." 
  As extravagance and waste remain widespread at present, the 
report adds "being diligent, thrifty, practicing economy and 
working hard." 
  On the Hong Kong issue, the report, according to opinions of 
some Hong Kong and Macao deputies, adds a sentence: "Hong Kong 
compatriots are expected to work together with the whole nation, 
make concerted efforts and contribute to Hong Kong's stability 
and prosperity." 
  At its conclusion, the report replaces "hard struggle" with 
"blazing new trails, self-reliance and hard struggle." 
  Compared with similar reports in the past, this year's 
report 
has fewer revisions because opinions and suggestions were 
solicited from various circles during the drafting process. 
  Since mid-December of last year, the political bureau of the 
Chinese Communist Party central committee and the State Council 
held many meetings to discuss the draft report. Premier Li Peng 
invited leaders of the democratic parties, persons without party 
affiliation, representatives of science, technology, education 
and culture fields, officials of grassroots administrative and 
judicial departments and leaders of enterprises and institutions 
for five meetings and heard their opinions and suggestions.

<F P=106> [Report by WEN WEI PO News Team: "Li Peng's Government Work </F>
Report Amended in 13 Places"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- In light of the 
views expressed by the deputies to the National People's 
Congress [NPC] and members of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] in discussions, Li Peng's 
Government Work Report has been amended as follows: 
  1. While talking about the continued efforts made to boost 
agriculture with science and technology, the passage "maintain 
the ranks of scientific researchers in agriculture" has been 
added. 
  2. On the question of continuously alleviating the peasants' 
burden, the passage "the outstanding problems should be tackled 
in a special way" has been added. 
  3. "Improving the quality of population" has been appended 
to the question of family planning. 
  4. "Improving the distribution methods and developing and 
perfecting the treasury bond market" has been appended to the 
issue of treasury bonds. 
  5. While introducing the experiment of establishing a modern 
enterprise system in light of the "Company Law," there is the 
additional sentence "to spread the system, we should vigorously 
sum up experience and gradually develop standard measures for 
implementation." 
  6. On the part of running a clean administration and 
fighting corruption, the passages: "They also constitute a 
damage to reform, opening up, and the modernization program"; 
"are absolutely impermissible"; and "we oppose a proneness to 
boast and exaggerate" have been added after: "The introduction 
of the principle of commodity exchange to political activities 
by state organs and the exchange of power for money seriously 
distort the principle of a socialist market economy." 
  7. The passage: "Oppose and resist bad activities which 
disrupt unity among the people, hinder social progress, and harm 
the healthy growth of young people" has been added after: 
"Strengthen management over the cultural market according to

the compatriots of Hong Kong will join the people of the whole 
country, make concerted efforts, and contribute to this cause." 
  12. Discussing diplomatic work, the following has been 
temporarily added in light of the new circumstances: "I would 
like to tell our deputies a piece of news just received. In the 
vote by the UN Human Rights Committee yesterday, the motion on 
using human rights to oppose China submitted by some countries 
encountered another setback. This fully shows that the 
anti-China trend finds little support. On behalf of the Chinese 
Government and the people, I would like to express my heartfelt 
thanks to all countries which uphold justice." In the 
amendment, this passage has been included in the report. 
  13. There is an additional passage: "Vigorously blaze new 
trails, rely on our own strength, and build our country through 
arduous efforts" at the end of the report. 
  In addition, some amendments have been made in wording. 
  After the finalized "Government Work Report" has been 
adopted 
tomorrow afternoon (22 March), the full text will be issued on 
23 March.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Hongtao (0491 3163 3447): "Henan Deputies </F>
to NPC Suggest Enacting Law on Collecting People's Opinions"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Zhang 
Wensheng, a peasant deputy from Henan Province, recently became 
a focus of attention for reporters covering the "two sessions." 
This is because he took the lead, together with 33 other 
people's deputies, in submitting to the congress a motion for 
the enactment of a "law on collecting people's opinions." 
  The peasant entrepreneur, born when the republic was 
founded, 
gave an exclusive interview to this reporter today. He said: 
An important reason for corruption and policy blunders has been 
the lack of a mechanism for the people to exercise supervision 
and of a normal channel for conveying grass-roots opinions to 
the higher authorities. The motion submitted to the NPC 
Standing Committee, on the initiative of 34 people's deputies 
from Henan, is for the establishment of a "national development 
center for the collection and study of the people's opinions" 
and for the drafting and promulgation of a "law on collecting 
the people's opinions." They are aimed at fundamentally 
changing -- through the institution of the law -- the present 
condition in which "no one pays attention, or even listens to 
the opinions and suggestions of the people; worse still, critics 
are retaliated against." Through this motion, the people will 
not feel they have no opportunity or right to speak out. If 
their proposals and opinions are heeded and adopted, they will 
have a stronger sense of responsibility for the country and the 
nation, so no one need worry about the country being unable to 
become prosperous and flourishing. 
  According to the jointly signed motion: "Under the 
planned-economy structure, various elements in society basically 
existed in a system bonded by administrative ties. The market 
economy gradually will break parts of the original system. For 
instance, some enterprises, institutions, individuals, and 
others `without competent administrative departments above them' 
now are emerging everywhere. How will the voices of the central 
authorities continue to be heard unimpeded in grass-roots units? 
How will the voices of grass-roots units be channeled back to 
the central authorities? These are matters pending urgent 
solution now." Therefore, "it is imperative to institute a `law 
on collecting people's opinions.'" 
  These people's deputies proposed in their motion that during 
the term of the current people's congress, an organ specially 
responsible for the formulation of a "law on collecting people's 
opinions" be set up so as to draft and promulgate such a law as 
quickly as possible; that a "national development center for the 
collection and study of people's opinions" be established; that 
a "national fund to award people for their suggestions" be 
founded; and that a new academic discipline called "theory on 
the collection of people's opinions" be initiated by the state.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the National People's Congress (NPC) today adopted a decision to 
grant legislative power to Xiamen, Fujian Province. Xiamen has 
thus become the third special economic zone (SEZ) with 
legislative power after Hainan Shenzhen [as received]. 
  The move marks another significant step China has taken in 
speeding up reforms and establishing a legal system for the SEZs. 
  Legislation is playing an increasingly important role in the 
development of SEZs. With a legal framework basically built for 
a market economy and for their economic convergence with the 
international market, the SEZs serve as experimental sites for 
not only economic restructuring, but also for local legislation. 
  Establishment of a legal system has been included in plans 
for the development of the SEZs. In 1981, the NPC Standing 
Committee authorized Guangdong and Fujian Provinces to formulate 
regulations and statutes regarding SEZs under their jurisdiction. 
  In 1988, Hainan island became a province and a special 
economic zone, and was also authorized to formulate local laws 
and regulations. 
  In 1992, the NPC Standing Committee gave Shenzhen the same 
right. 
  Granting Xiamen legislative power is a need posed by the 
Xiamen SEZ to speed up reforms and open wider to the rest of the 
world. 
  Separated from Taiwan by the sea, Xiamen plays an 
irreplaceable role in increasing personnel and economic 
exchanges across the Taiwan Straits and in promoting China's 
reunification. 
  Since its establishment, Xiamen has developed rapidly. 
Overseas- funded enterprises now account for more than 60 
percent of Xiamen's industrial output value. 
  However, legislation in Xiamen proceeded at a slow pace, 
making it impossible to set code of conduct for economic 
activities. And the situation has already adversely affected 
improvement in Xiamen's investment environment. 
  With the legislative power just granted, Xiamen will be able 
to solve many problems that have cropped up. 
  Over the next few years, Xiamen plans to enact at least 50 
local laws and regulations.

<F P=106> [By reporter Guo Liqun (6753 0500 5028)] </F>
  [Excerpt] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- Agriculture, rural 
areas, and peasants have remained a hot topic of discussion 
among deputies from Jilin, a major agricultural province, to the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]. 
Over the last few days, how to develop Jilin's rural economy to 
enable peasants to become better off at an earlier date has 
remained one of the central issues discussed by deputies from 
Jilin. Deputy Gao Yan, who is governor of Jilin, said: Enabling 
peasants to become better off is another leap in the vast rural 
areas following our success in eliminating poverty and providing 
enough food and clothing to them. Once we succeed in this work, 
we will be able to solve new and old problems and make further 
progress. 
  To enable peasants to become better off, the first thing we 
need to do is to develop agriculture. Deputies from the 
province said Jilin should establish agricultural bases, develop 
famous brand name agricultural products, and promote 
agriculture-related high technologies, in order to ensure the 
province's agricultural development. 
  A few deputies said the low efficiency in grain growing had 
dampened peasants' production enthusiasm and hampered their 
efforts to live a better life. They said the situation must be 
changed. Peasant deputy Hao Fuxia from the Dongxia Village in 
Meihekou City's Zhonghe Town said: "However the rural areas may 
develop, farming is the job of peasants. But now we really need 
to study some way to develop the agriculture." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [News conference by Cheng Kejie, chairman of Guangxi Zhuang </F>
Autonomous Region; Lei Ning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region 
vice chairman; Hong Puzhou, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional 
Planning Commission chairman; and Shuai Liguo, mayor of 
Guangxi's Beihai City, with foreign and domestic correspondents 
at the Information Center of the Second Session of the Eight NPC 
and the Eighth CPPCC National Committee in Beijing on 19 March; 
from the "Special News Program on the Second Session of the 
Eighth NPC"] 
  [Excerpts] [Unidentified moderator] We have invited a few 
leaders of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to answer your 
questions in connection with issues concerning Guangxi's reform, 
opening to the outside world, and economic development. They 
are Mr. Cheng Kejie, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region; Mr. Lei Ning, vice chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region; Mr. Hong Puzhou, chairman of the Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Regional Planning Commission; and Mr. Shui 
Liguo, mayor of Beihai City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the China 
Chinese Language Broadcasting Company. My question is: Guangxi 
is the most convenient passageway linking China's southwest 
region with Southeast Asia. The CPC Central Committee proposed 
in 1992 that efforts should be made to give full play to 
Guangxi's role as a passageway for linking China with the 
outside world. Focusing on construction with this aim in mind, 
Guangxi has strengthened the construction of infrastructural 
facilities and basic industries in the past two years. How is 
this work progressing and what difficulties are being 
encountered? 
  [Cheng] In its Document No. Four issued in 1992, the CPC 
Central Committee explicitly stipulated that efforts will be 
made to build Guangxi's coastal areas into a most convenient 
passageway for China's southwest region. [passage omitted] We 
have been concentrating on construction in these areas -- 
transport, energy, and communications. In the transportation 
area, we are now building or expanding five airports; building 
five new railroads; and two superhighways. The first one is a 
139-km four-lane superhighway from Liuzhou to Guilin; the second 
one is a six-lane superhighway from Nanning to Qinzhou, 
Fangcheng, and Beihai. We realize that there is insufficient 
electric power in Guangxi to better serve China's southwest 
region and also to serve Guangxi's economic development. 
Therefore, we are now stepping up the construction of 
hydroelectric and thermal power stations, the combined capacity 
of which will come to around 8.2 million kilowatts. When these 
facilities are completed, we believe they will create better 
conditions for opening up the southwest region and Guangxi to 
the outside world and for their economic development. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the Asian 
Television of Hong Kong. Many criminal cases in Hong Kong 
involved firearms which were smuggled from Mainland China to 
Hong Kong, and Guangxi is one of sources from which firearms are 
smuggled into Hong Kong. May I ask what has the regional 
government done to check the outflow of firearms? 
  [Lei] Guangxi shares a 1,020-km land border with neighboring 
countries and has a 1,595-km coastline. Some criminals have 
taken advantage of the long border and coastline to engage in 
firearms smuggling and drug trafficking. The autonomous 
regional government and its law-enforcing departments have 
always adopted strict measures to crack down on these illegal 
activities. To strengthen the fight against these activities so 
as to give the criminal elements no opening to exploit, last 
year we increased our police force by more 700 people, who were 
especially assigned to crack down on firearms smuggling and drug 
trafficking. Through our struggle last year, we seized more 
than a 100 kilograms of heroin, over 800 kg of opium, and about 
300 firearms. The arrested criminals have been handled 
according to law. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the 
Central Television Stations. According to statistics, the 
amount of investment, the number of foreign-funded enterprises, 
and the amount of foreign exchange earned through exports have 
increased considerably in Guangxi in the past two years. Where 
did most of the foreign investment come from? What industries 
have these investments have channeled into? What are the 
prospects of these investment projects for earning foreign 
exchange? 
  [Lei] [passage omitted] In 1992 Guangxi's foreign trade 
came to $1.108 billion, up 33 percent over 1991. In 1993 its 
foreign trade volume was $1.325 billion, up 19.6 percent over 
1992. At the end of 1991, there were only 559 "san zi" 
enterprises [joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly 
owned enterprises] in Guangxi. In that year, only $63 million 
worth of foreign capital was used, but by the end of 1992 there 
were 1,870 "san zi" enterprises, and $246 million worth of 
foreign capital was used. By the end of 1993, there were 4,368 
"san zi" enterprises in Guangxi, and $1 billion worth of foreign 
capital was used that year. Guangxi has moved from 12th place 
to eighth among the 12 provinces and cities in the coastal areas 
in using foreign capital. First, investment has been expanding 
to different fields. Originally, most investments were used in 
real estate and the service industries. In the past two years, 
investments have expanded to infrastructural facilities, basic 
industries, agricultural development, and the transformation of 
old enterprises. 
  Second, investments have expanded to other areas. In the 
past, investments were mainly concentrated in coastal cities. 
Now, investments have spread to the hinterland and some hilly 
areas. For example, in Bose Prefecture 25 "san zi" enterprises 
were approved 1993, with a combined investment of $5 million. 
[passage omitted] 
  Third, the number of countries and regions making 
investments 
has increased. By the end of 1993, there were 44 countries and 
regions investing in Guangxi. The main investors were from Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The ratio of investments from Hong 
Kong and Macao in Guangxi is roughly 25 percent; the ratio of 
Taiwan's investments in Guangxi was 11 percent in 1993. 
  Fourth, there are many investment projects by big consortia. 
Last year, there were over 70 investment projects, each with an 
investment of over $10 million. In 1992, there were only four 
such projects. In exports, "san zi" enterprises are a force 
that should not be underestimated. Their exports now account for 
about one-eight of Guangxi's total exports. 
  [Unidentified Vietnamese correspondent in Mandarin] I am a 
reporter with VNA. First, in the past few years, especially 
since the normalization of relations between the two countries, 
what progress has been made in Guangxi's ties with Vietnam? 
Second, what are the prospects for development between Guangxi 
and Vietnam? 
  [Cheng] Since China and Vietnam normalized their relations 
in November 1991, significant progress has been made in economic 
and friendly contacts between the two countries. The 
development in this area has been healthy, and it has brought 
benefits to the people of the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  Take trade as an example. According to the situation in 
border trade in the past few years, such trade is mutually 
complementary. We have built several economic projects in 
Vietnam. These projects require that both sides continue 
cooperation on a mutually beneficial basis. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the XINHUA 
NEWS AGENCY. Recently, many experts from international economic 
circles have predicted that an international metropolis will 
emerge in Southeast Asia and the Beibu Wan [gulf] area. It has 
been learned that Guangxi's Beihai city has drawn up some plans 
in this connection. Would Mayor Shuai please brief us about the 
plans? 
  [Shuai] Beihai city has eight major resources. Its fresh 
water, land, port construction, and tourism resources are 
especially good. In short, with these resources a large port 
for commerce with foreign countries can be built. In addition, 
it has a huge potential of becoming a large metropolis. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Chinese-American correspondent in Mandarin] I am Zhou 
Youkang, a reporter with the Voice of America. I have a 
question concerning investment: Mr. Chairman, you have just 
mentioned that investments in Guangxi were mainly from Taiwan 
and Hong Kong. What about the United States? In your opinion, 
what can the United States do to contribute to Guangxi's 
economic development? How do you promote trade between Guangxi 
and the United States? 
  [Lei] In fact, apart from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, the 
next biggest investor is the United States. The biggest wholly 
owned enterprise, the [Tule] Company I have just mentioned, has 
invested $40 million in leasing 60,000 mu of land in [Hepu] for 
agricultural development. The company will import fine seed 
strains from the United States and will assume responsibilities 
for seeds, processing, and marketing. In fact, our economic 
cooperative relations with the United States are also 
significant. Due to the lack of time, we cannot go into detail 
one by one. 
  [Shuai] The doors of Beihai city are open. We welcome the 
United States to quickly enter its markets. Don't be late. 
  [Moderator] That's the end of the news conference. Thank 
you.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Shen Hongbin (3088 5725 0393) and Xu </F>
Zhaorong (1776 0340 2837): "Make Good Wine To Eliminate Poverty 
and Become Rich -- on an Interview With Chen Shineng, Guizhou 
Governor and National People's Congress Deputy"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- Chen Shineng became the 
governor of Guizhou Province not long ago. However, he is very 
familiar with the situation in Guizhou and is clear about ways 
to eliminate poverty and improve the economic condition of 
people in the province. 
  Guizhou is located in China's southwest and is a remote 
landlocked province. It is not situated in coastal areas, is 
not along the Chang Jiang, and has no border areas. About half 
of all counties in the province are poor, and the number of poor 
people in the province accounts for one-eighth of all poor 
people in the country or 30 percent of the province's total 
population. Therefore, eliminating poverty has become the most 
important work in the province. 
  However, is Guizhou really in utter destitution? Chen 
Shineng does not think so. When reporters interviewed him, he 
counted on his fingers and listed six advantages that Guizhou 
can utilize as follows: Guizhou has the advantage of energy 
sources, with more than 18 million tonnes of theoretical 
hydraulic power [shui li zi yuan di li lun yun zang liang 3055 
0500 6327 3293 4104 3810 6158 5686 5661 6852] and 50 billion 
tonnes of coal deposit. Guizhou has the advantage of both 
mineral resources and a metallurgical industry, with deposits of 
phosphorous, manganese, antimony, aluminum, alumina, and 24 
other mineral resources all ranking front in the country and 
relatively advanced metallurgical technology and facilities. 
Guizhou has the advantage of joint military and civilian 
mechano-electrical industry. A large contingent of some 480,000 
military industrial workers formed in the past and assets and 
facilities of military industries provide good conditions for 
transforming military industries into nonmilitary enterprises 
producing commodities that can compete well on the market. 
Guizhou has the advantage of light and textile industries, 
represented by famous tobacco and wine. Guizhou has the 
advantage of chemical industry by utilizing local coal and 
phosphorous. Guizhou has the advantage of beautiful natural 
scenery and customs of minority people in developing tourism. 
Touching on Guizhou's tourism advantage, Chen Shineng spread 
his arms and humorously told reporters: "I formally invite all 
of you to visit Guizhou. There are not only the Huanggushu 
Falls but also national forest parks and many natural sites and 
cultural relics. Guizhou can be described as a place with 
beautiful mountains and lakes and wonderful customs of people of 
minority nationalities." 
  Chen Shineng pointed out: In the face of such a situation 
and conditions, Guizhou will utilize the above-mentioned 
advantages to develop related industries. At present, it is 
necessary to grasp the opportune time to accelerate reform; 
speed up the construction of infrastructure projects; develop 
aviation, transportation, and communications; and laid down a 
good foundation for enabling the people to live a relatively 
comfortable life. In the vast and poor rural areas, it is 
necessary to strive to achieve "two increases, one decrease, and 
one control." 
  He explained: The two increases are: 1) to increase the 
peasants' income from the present annual per capital income of 
579 yuan by 90 yuan each year and reach 1,200 yuan by the end of 
this century; and 2) to increase grain output by improving rural 
facilities and raising the level of farming technologies. One 
decrease means to take resolute measures to decrease the number 
of people in poverty. Guizhou will strive to eliminate poverty 
for all people by the end of this century and must not lay a 
burden on the country. One control means to strictly control 
the people's birth rate. 
  Chen Shineng said: It seems the above-mentioned goals are 
not very high, but it is also not easy for Guizhou to achieve 
those goals. However, since the industrious and wise ancestors 
in Guizhou could make the world renowned and tasty Maotai 
liquor, which requires a complicated technological process, the 
people in Guizhou can certainly make good wine in the new era to 
eliminate poverty and become rich under the excellent situation 
of reform and opening up and to celebrate the arrival of the 
21st Century.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 19 March, Li Jie, Qiao Jiaqin, 
Xia Chuan, and Zhang Jun, former senior leaders of the Tibetan 
autonomous regional people's government and the Tibetan Military 
District, made a special trip to the Beijing Jinxi Guest House 
to visit Tibetan deputies attending the second session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress. They held extensive 
discussions with deputies on how to quicken the pace of reform, 
opening up, and economic construction in Tibet. 
  These four senior leaders are veteran fighters who entered 
Tibet with the 18th Army. They worked in Tibet for several 
decades, dedicating their youth to Tibet's socialist revolution 
and construction. They said: Tibet is our second home and we 
cherish a deep affection for Tibet. Although we have returned 
to the interior, our hearts still stay in Tibet. We never 
forget Tibet and always pay attention to Tibet's construction 
and development. To help Tibet develop the economy, we set up 
an association of veteran fighters entering Tibet in an effort 
to establish contact with people of all circles, including those 
of commercial and industrial sectors at home and abroad and to 
bring in specially trained personnel and technology into Tibet. 
  It is reported that veteran fighters who have worked in 
Tibet 
and now live in Chengdu, Tianjin, and Jinan also proposed 
establishing associations of veteran fighters who had been in 
Tibet to offer suggestions and plans for Tibet's economic 
construction. 
  Chen Kuiyuan and Raidi, secretary and deputy secretary of 
the 
Tibetan autonomous regional party committee respectively; 
Gyaincain Norbu and Yang Chuantang, chairman and vice chairman 
of the Tibetan autonomous regional people's government 
respectively; Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain, vice chairman of the 
Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Congress Standing 
Committee; and Luosang Toinzhub, vice chairman of the Tibetan 
autonomous regional people's government, thanked these veteran 
comrades for their concern and support for Tibet's various 
undertakings. They also presented hada to them.

<F P=106> ["Jottings on the Two Sessions" by reporters Pu Liye (5543 </F>
4539 2814) and Xu Xingtang (1776 5281 1016): "There Are 
Thousands of Ways To Get Rich; Why Does Everyone Have To Go to 
the Cities?"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- Tens of millions of 
peasants have streamed, like the tide, to cities. Is this good 
or bad? This has been a controversial, hot topic for a long 
time. During the current sessions of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC] and the Eighth National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], this 
topic has not only remained hot but has also become a more 
serious one. NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members 
have linked the proper handling of the rural labor force to the 
work to improve peasants' lives and to stabilize the overall 
situation. 
  The NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members 
believe 
that the "tide of workers" is a sign of the historical progress 
of China's traditional agricultural society being transformed 
into a modern one. They said: In a sense, the trend is 
reasonable as well as inevitable. However, while the flow of 
workers has created huge material wealth, it has brought with it 
or given rise to some social problems. To properly solve the 
employment problem of the more than 100 million surplus workers 
currently in rural areas, we cannot simply set our eyes on 
moving them to cities -- we should simultaneously organize 
peasants' migration and provide them with jobs in their 
hometowns, and we should come up with new ideas and develop 
various industries and trades. 
  "The homeland is as good as the outside world," said Deputy 
Shen Zhifeng, who is mayor of Shijiazhuang city. Over the last 
few years, Shijiazhuang has encouraged peasants to develop 
high-yield, good-quality, and highly efficient agriculture. 
Currently, the city has 1 million mu of high-efficiency cash 
crops and more than 12 million chickens, rabbits, cattle, and 
pigs. Last year, the per capita income of the city's peasants 
increased 100 yuan over the previous year. Shen Zhifeng said, 
"Once there are more opportunities in rural areas and people's 
incomes are higher, who will be willing to leave their dear ones 
at home and go to cities to take their chances?" 
  Hebei Province is only one example. Deputy Shao Qihui, who 
is governor of Heilongjiang Province, said: In the northeast, 
thousands or tens of thousand of peasants now have become better 
off by breeding fish, raising hunting dogs or deer, or growing 
flowers, and some of them have made tens of thousands of yuan or 
even hundreds of thousands of yuan a year. To properly solve 
the problem of the surplus work force in rural areas, we must 
take into consideration the entire rural economic development 
situation and broaden the scope and increase the depth of 
agriculture. 
  Deputy Tian Chengping, who is governor of Qinghai Province, 
considered the development of village and town enterprises as a 
"huge water reservoir" for absorbing the rural labor force. He 
said: The economic gap between the eastern and western parts of 
the country is the cause of the outflow of peasants from the 
central and western parts of the country, and it is also a 
potential solution to the problem of the surplus rural work 
force. If the source areas of the "tide of workers" can quicken 
the pace of village and town enterprise development, taking the 
local reality into consideration, and starting from developing 
relatively simple industries that require little investment and 
yield quick results, then they not only can boost local economic 
development but also can create millions of jobs. 
  By dealing with rural problems through another approach, we 
will be able to see that even now there are many opportunities 
for success in rural areas. It is clear that as long as one can 
meet the demands of the market, can come up with new ideas, and 
is willing to work hard, peasants also can find a way to become 
better off in their own home areas.

concerned about spending public funds like letting water flow" 
is very common. As some deputies attending the Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] put it, "Public 
funds are cheap." 
  The major cases involving economic crimes recently reported 
in the press had something in common -- it is too easy to 
embezzle public funds. A bank accountant a little more than 30 
years old was able to embezzle more than 30 million yuan in the 
light of day; Shen Taifu of the Great Wall Machinery and 
Electrical Engineering Company was able to embezzle 3 million 
yuan from funds raised from the public. The NPC deputies said 
these incidents show that China's legal system is still not well 
established and the established laws, regulations, and systems 
still have loopholes. They said in the process of building a 
socialist market economic system, we must place great importance 
on this problem. They also said: People committing corruption 
or accepting bribes may be punished by law; but we can do 
nothing about many things taking place everyday even we know 
they are wrong -- such as using public funds to wine and dine, 
to do sightseeing, for home decorations, and to buy expensive 
sedans. The public money spent on such purposes usually amounts 
to tens of thousands of yuan, hundreds of thousands of yuan, or 
even millions of yuan. But, all these malpractices do not 
constitute a crime, and so we can only complain about them. 
But, if there are no effective measures to deal with this kind 
of problem, simply complaining about them does not yield any 
results. 
  The deputies hoped for enactment of more laws and 
regulations 
and for the refining of established laws and regulations; they 
hoped that, in appointing and promoting leaders, greater 
attention will be paid to their personal integrity, and 
education in honestly performing one's official duty will be 
regularly conducted among cadres. They also hoped that reform 
will more closely link personal interests to those of the state 
so that people will feel that spending public funds is like 
spending one's own money. They said, if such comprehensive 
measures can be taken to deal with the problem, there will be 
hope that "public funds may appreciate."

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, China's top 
legislator, said today all kinds of work in China must serve 
people's interests. 
  Addressing the closing session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress (NPC) this afternoon, Qiao, chairman of the 
NPC Standing Committee, said that all kinds of work must also 
help free and develop productive forces, increase China's 
comprehensive strength and improve people's living standards. 
  He asked government departments and workers at all levels to 
change their style of work, make investigations, solicit 
people's views and be concerned about their well-being. 
  The leader also stressed the need to handle well all matters 
relating to people's immediate interests. 
  He said that it is imperative to oppose bureaucracy and 
boasting, and do away with formalism. 
  He called for a stop to holding meetings or issuing 
documents 
that will not solve any problems, to indulging in empty talks, 
to reporting only the good news, and to telling lies. 
  Speaking of the NPC session, he said that various 
resolutions 
and decisions adopted by the deputies reflect the will and 
aspiration of the entire Chinese nation. 
  The session also demonstrates great unity among people of 
various nationalities and their confidence in the success of 
China's reform program and economic development, he said. 
  Qiao Shi expressed the belief that the session will play a 
significant role in speeding up the establishment of a socialist 
market economy, and promoting progress in socialist democracy, 
as well as ideological and cultural progress. 
  He said that it is imperative to seize current favorable 
international and domestic opportunities, accelerate the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure and 
achieve a sustained, rapid and healthy growth of China's economy. 
  "We must also maintain social stability and promote 
all-round 
social progress," he said. 
  All kinds of work in China must comply with and serve the 
country's central task for 1994, he said, noting: "We must 
correctly handle relations between reform, development and 
stability." 
  "We must strive to push ahead with reform and development 
amid stability, and achieve social stability and the country's 
long-term stability through reform and development," he said. 
  He said that 1994 is an important year for China's economic 
restructuring, with the implementation of so many new reform 
measures. 
  He stressed the need to further emancipate the mind, do 
everything in line with specific conditions, properly resolve 
contradictions and problems arising in the course of 
implementing reform measures so as to perfect various reform 
measures. 
  Qiao Shi also called for efforts to quicken the pace of 
economic legislation and use laws to guide, promote and ensure 
the establishment of a socialist market economic structure and 
the progress of various undertakings.

0689): "The Overall Situation That Pulls People's Hearts 
Together -- Commentary Written Before the Closing of the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 March (XINHUA) -- This is a grand 
meeting of significant importance since China entered this year, 
a crucial year for reform, as well as a grand meeting that 
gathers talents from all quarters to set a general policy for 
revitalizing the nation. It shows Chinese and foreigners, who 
are concerned about the future and destiny of China's reform and 
development, that the 56 nationalities around China have 
unprecedentedly gathered under the banner of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics in one mind. The overall situation 
of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability" in the 
[party's] work has become the will of the state and the people. 
<H5>  A Common Ground Formed at the `Two Sessions' </H5>
  This year's "two sessions" were convened at the crucial 
moment when we were implementing the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure. During this unusual half month, over 5,000 deputies 
and members have formed a common ground on the 20-character 
overall situation for the work of the party and the state. 
  The common ground was first of all demonstrated in their 
understanding of the magnificent cause of reform. Reviewing the 
unprecedented achievements in China's history, which were 
accomplished in the course of great practice, deputies and 
members further realized: It was the great fortune yielded by 
the productive forces liberated through reform that made China's 
national economy grow at an average annual rate of 9 percent in 
the 15 years of reform and opening up, far higher than the 
average growth rate during the 26 years from 1953 to 1978, thus 
people's lives were remarkably improved with visible and 
tangible benefits. Reform should also be regarded as the 
tremendous driving force for future development, and reform 
measures should be used to promote transfer of the old system to 
the new one. Henan Deputy Li Changchun said: The new idea for 
development is to seek development through reform. Development 
will become empty talk, if we fail to promote the establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure by developing the five 
links as a whole through reform and if we did not resolve the 
difficulties in the microeconomic foundation and macroeconomic 
system for the market economy with reform. 
  The common ground is distinctively illustrated in the 
essential criterion of development. Without development, there 
would be no better life for the people, political stability, and 
China's position in the world. Liaoning Deputy Quan Shuren 
maintained: We are really facing a highly favorable opportunity 
for development. If we take a giant step in development, our 
overall economic and social levels will be greatly promoted. 
Deputies and members agreed with such a view of development: 
We can by no means merely pursue output value and speed in 
economic development and develop a "bubble economy." A 
high-efficiency development should be the important thing. Our 
development should not only be rapid, but also stable; it should 
not only be healthy, but also sustained. Development should 
proceed in a down-to-earth and step-by-step manner. 
  The common ground is also expressed in stability. Without 
political stability and unity, without the state's long-term 
peace and stability, we could achieve nothing. This point was 
hotly discussed at the "two sessions." Guangxi Deputy Zhao 
Fulin's remarks have struck a sympathetic chord: Many important 
reform measures launched this year have touched on the 
transformation in some ideas and concepts, renovation of 
systems, and interest readjustment. We should simultaneously 
adopt economic and administrative means and conduct ideological 
and political work to properly handle new contradictions and 
problems arising from the interest readjustment in the course of 
reform and eliminate unstable factors. We should take the 
overall situation of stability into consideration and 
consciously subject local, partial, current, and microinterests 
to central, overall, long-term, and macrointerests. 
  Only when we have this common ground can we unify our action 
and have a foundation for forging ahead in unity. 
<H5>  It Takes Team Spirit To Overcome Difficulties </H5>
  Today, reform has begun to increase in depth; we have 
shifted 
from advancing in particular areas to taking well-organized and 
comprehensive reform measures, and have shifted from setting our 
eyes on gaining benefits brought by conflicting reform measures 
to setting our eyes on forming new economic relationships in all 
sectors. Various contradictions are interwoven in the process 
of these changes, and all kinds of advantages and disadvantages 
have begun to surface. Therefore, to carry out reform in depth, 
we must fight an arduous battle to overcome major difficulties. 
Deputies attending the current NPC session and members of the 
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] attending the current CPPCC 
National Committee session have been deeply concerned about the 
difficulties and critical issues affecting reform. 
  We should face up to difficulties, gain a good understanding 
of the situation, and fully make ourselves ideologically 
prepared. As Shandong deputy Zhao Zhihao said: The depth, 
scope, and intensity of reform are unprecedented, all kinds of 
interrelated reform measures have been initiated one after 
another, and we will deepen reforms and make breakthroughs in 
various areas. We should be ideologically prepared for the 
difficulties that may come up in carrying out this complicated 
and arduous systems project. We must insist on taking a 
scientific approach, doing work cautiously, and preventing major 
missteps. 
  It takes team spirit to overcome difficulties. The NPC 
deputies are 100 percent in favor of what Comrade Jiang Zemin 
pointed out: "Whether it is the revolutionary war in the past or 
the current reform, opening up, and modernization drive, we can 
succeed only if we closely rely on the vast numbers of cadres 
and the masses, fully rally the enthusiasm of people in all 
sectors, and pool our wisdom and efforts." 
  The NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members 
offered 
from various perspectives their ideas on uniting efforts of the 
whole country to overcome difficulties: 
  -- We should work with one heart and one mind, help each 
other, give primary consideration to the overall situation, and 
abide by discipline. Since we are on the country's big boat of 
reform, we should obey the commanding voice and follow the 
drumbeats, as rowers of a boat do, and go forward braving the 
wind and waves. 
  -- We should respect the masses' creative spirit in making 
reforms; sum up in a timely manner the experience of practice 
accumulated by the masses; and properly guide, protect, and make 
use of the masses' enthusiasm. We should show concern for the 
masses' hardships, listen to the masses, and help them solve 
their problems to enable the work to overcome difficult reform 
problems to be established on a broad and solid base of the 
masses. 
  -- We should resolvedly eradicate the practice of taking 
countermeasures to deal with the policies adopted by authorities 
at a higher level. Even Tai Mountain can be moved if we work 
with one heart and one mind. No matter how good the principle 
and policies are, they cannot be effective if we do not have a 
unified will and action. 
  -- We should iron out all kinds of contradictions in a 
timely manner, give play to all positive factors, concentrate 
the efforts of all sectors on the great cause of reform, and do 
our best to reduce frictions and shocks resulting from 
readjusting the interests of various sectors. In fighting the 
war of overcoming difficult reform problems, we should not be 
too hasty nor should we miss the opportunity to win. 
  -- We should not be conceited when we achieve something 
and we should not complain when we suffer setbacks. We should 
be of one mind and be prudent in beginning the war; we should be 
determined to win a total victory ... 
  These voices from the NPC deputies and CPPCC National 
Committee members are loud and eloquent and concern the nation's 
overall situation. Our reform is hopeful! Our country is 
hopeful! 
<H5>  Being Realistic Is the Key to Making Reform Successful </H5>
  The NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are of 
the opinion that the two current sessions are democratic 
meetings, meetings of seeking truth, meetings of solidarity, and 
meetings with a motivational atmosphere. After the two sessions 
end, the NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members, who 
are shouldering sacred missions, will join people working on all 
fronts across the country in carrying out the guidelines of the 
two sessions. The most realistic problem lying ahead of us is 
how to faithfully carry out these guidelines. 
  At a time when the NPC session is about to close, deputies 
to 
the session have stressed that we no longer should engage in 
empty talk and hesitate and lack resolve, and must take action. 
Guangxi deputy Cheng Kejie said: Currently the party Central 
Committee and the State Council are devising the strategies, are 
in command of the overall situation, and are guiding the ship. 
The policy of reform is clearly defined and is in line with the 
reality, and the established policies and guidelines have 
enjoyed popular support; so, the only thing we need to do is to 
work in a down-to-earth manner. If every unit and locality 
takes action in all areas of endeavor, our reform will be 
substantiated and full of vigor. 
  By reviewing the stormy process of reform and opening up 
over 
the last 15 years, people can see that our reform has yielded 
solid results. So long as we sweat and toil, we will reap a 
good harvest. Some deputies cited these examples: During the 
early years of reform, the contract responsibility system with 
output linked to remuneration brought great prosperity to the 
rural areas; enterprise reform in the 1980's increased 
enterprises' vitality to varying degrees; since the beginning of 
1990's, we have quickened the pace of reforming the system of 
budgeting resources, enabling the market to become 
unprecedentedly brisk, and setting a good beginning to 
establishing a socialist market economic system. We should do 
things step by step; the difficulties of reform and development 
should be overcome one by one. We should stick to it, firm up 
our will, keep going, knowing that there are difficulties ahead, 
and be determined to win. 
  After analyzing the general situation of reform in the new 
year, the NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members 
pointed out that, among the various reform programs, we should 
concentrate our efforts on dealing with two difficult tasks: 
First, while working to transform the operating mechanisms of 
state-owned enterprises, we should make positive efforts to 
establish new enterprise systems and seek effective ways to 
develop a modern enterprise system. Second, we should quicken 
the pace of reforming the financial, taxation, planning, and 
investment systems, and take an important step forward in 
establishing a macroeconomic regulation and control system that 
meets market economic requirements. These are both difficult 
tasks and an opportunity. If we can overcome the various 
difficulties, we will see a new horizon. 
  The current situation reflects people's wishes and pulls 
people's hearts together. This is a year of great hope for 
China's construction and development, and definitely will be one 
in which we reap a bumper harvest of reform. This is a message 
of spring brought to people across the country by the Second 
Session of the Eighth NPC and the Second Session of the Eighth 
CPPCC National Committee.

Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] closed at 
the Great Hall of the People this afternoon following voting to 
approve various resolutions and decisions deliberated by the 
session. The session called on the Chinese people of all 
nationalities, led by the CPC and guided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, to work with one heart and one mind; to 
resolutely carry out reform; to rely on themselves; to 
assiduously blaze a new path; and to strive to win new victories 
in reform, opening up, and modernization construction. 
  Qiao Shi, executive chairman of the session and permanent 
chairman of the Presidium, presided over the closing. Permanent 
chairmen of the Presidium who also served as executive chairmen 
were Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Fei 
Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, Qin Jiwei, Li Ximing, Wang 
Bingqian, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Wang Guangying, Cheng Siyuan,

Zhi. 
  Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, 
Hu 
Jintao, and Rong Yiren were seated on the rostrum along with 
members of the Presidium. 
  After the voting, the 2,721 deputies present adopted a 
resolution approving the government work report. The resolution 
notes that the report offers a factual summation of work over 
the past year as well as puts forth positive and prudent tasks 
for the coming year. The resolution also holds that in order to 
smoothly fulfill the various tasks set forth by the current 
session, people all over the country must carry out their work 
in all fields under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line; must comprehensively implement the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; and must 
subordinate themselves to and serve the overall interests of 
seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability, thereby seeing 
to it that reform, development, and stability coordinate with 
and promote each other. 
  After the voting, the deputies adopted a resolution on 
implementing the 1993 national economic and social development 
plan and the 1994 national economic and social development plan, 
as well as a resolution on the implementation of the 1993 state 
budget and 1994 state budget. 
  The "PRC Budget Law" proposed by the State Council, which 
was 
deliberated and amended during the current session, was approved 
during the voting. The law consists of 11 chapters comprising 
79 articles, including general principles, powers of budget 
management, scope of budgetary revenues and expenditures, 
drafting of budgets, examination and approval of budgets, 
implementation of budgets, budgetary adjustments, final 
accounts, supervision, legal responsibilities, and an appendix. 
The law will enter into effect on 1 January 1995, and the 
"Regulations Governing State Budget Management" promulgated by 
the State Council on 21 October 1991 will be annulled at that 
time. 
  The session also voted to empower the Xiamen People's 
Congress, its Standing Committee, and the Xiamen People's 
Government to formulate laws and regulations for implementing 
the Xiamen Special Economic Zone. 
  The session further approved the NPC Standing Committee's

resolution urges the NPC Standing Committee to continue 
following the guidance of the theory of building socialism with

fundamental task; and to improve its role as a permanent body of 
the organ of supreme state power. 
  The session also voted on resolutions on the work reports of 
the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate, 
and decided to rename the NPC's Environmental Protection

  Qiao Shi delivered a speech following the voting. 
  In his speech, Qiao Shi pointed out: During the session, the 
deputies took account of the overall national interests as well 
as the people's fundamental interests; conscientiously performed 
their constitutionally vested functions; emancipated their 
minds; sought truth from facts; spoke out freely; and discussed 
state affairs, thus ensuring all resolutions and decisions 
adopted by the session would fully reflect and convey the will 
and wishes of people of all nationalities across the country. 
The session fully demonstrated the great unity of the people of 
all nationalities across the country, as well as their 
confidence in certain victory in advancing reform and 
development. The session was democratic, united, realistic, 
pioneering, and progressive. It is bound to have a significant 
impact on comprehensively advancing the socialist market 
economy, socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual 
civilization, all the while taking economic construction as the 
central task. 
  Qiao Shi stated emphatically: We must carry out all fields 
of work, while bearing the people's interests in mind, making 
sure they will help liberate and develop the productive forces, 
increase the country's overall strength, and improve the 
standard of living. State organs and functionaries at all levels 
should earnestly change their work styles, go into the thick of 
life, conduct investigations and studies, listen to people's 
views, and show concern for people's well-being. They should 
never treat lightly matters of immediate concern to the people, 
and should solve each and every one of those matters. We should 
firmly oppose bureacraticism and boastfulness; guard against 
formalism; avoid holding meetings and issuing documents that do 
not solve problems; refuse to confine ourselves to issuing 
general appeals; refrain from engaging in empty talk and 
platitude; and avoid reporting only good news and not the bad. 
More importantly, we should permit no lies. We should perform 
our official duties honestly and diligently in order to serve 
the people. We should work in a down-to-earth manner, immerse 
ourselves in hard work, rely on the masses, and carry out our 
work creatively. 
  Qiao Shi hoped the deputies would actively publicize and 
implement the guidelines of the session, as well as the various 
resolutions and decisions adopted by the session. He expressed 
hope they would conscientiously perform their functions as NPC 
deputies, set an example in abiding by the Constitution and the 
law, and actively throw themselves into the great practice of 
reform and construction.

<F P=106> [22 March RENMIN RIBAO editorial: "Repaint the </F>
Ten-Thousand-Li of the Spring Landscape of the Motherland -- On 
Greeting the Closing of the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress and the Second Session of the Eighth 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] closes in victory 
today. The Second Session of the National Committee of the 
Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC] ended in victory on 19 March. 
  The "two meetings," which were convened in the early spring 
of this year, have distinctly reflected the basic policy of the 
entire party and of the national work for this year, the overall 
situation of the entire party and the national work, and the 
will and wishes of the people of all nationalities in the 
country. There were meetings on democracy, reality-seeking, 
unity, and encouraging all to forge ahead. The meetings will 
surely produce a major impact on propelling reform and opening 
up, on economic construction and on comprehensive social 
progress, and on promoting the great cause of the peaceful 
reunification of the motherland. NPC deputies and CPPCC members 
highly evaluated Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report." 
They said this "Report" takes China's overall situation into 
consideration, seeks truth from facts, urges all to forge ahead, 
and will encourage the people of all nationalities to seize the 
opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, 
maintain stability, and comprehensively fulfill this year's 
various tasks. 
  The outstanding achievements of this year's "two meetings" 
lie in the NPC deputies' and CPPCC members' further unifying 
understanding of the overall situation of the entire party and 
of national work through their examination and discussion of the 
"Government Work Report" and through other reports, and in their 
unanimous support for the belief that all work must be 
subordinate to and serve the overall situation's strategic 
requirements. Following the closing of the "two meetings," some 
3,000 NPC deputies and 2,000 CPPCC members will return to their 
own regions and respective posts to spread and implement the 
guidelines set forth at the meetings, which will surely help the 
entire nation become united and work with one heart and one mind 
to fulfill new tasks. 
  Correct understanding and handling of the relationship among 
reform, development, and stability is the key to victoriously 
realizing the tasks set forth at the meetings. Development is 
the goal; reform is the impetus: and stability is the guarantee; 
the three complement one another; the three are inseparable; 
neglect of and inattention to any of them will result in harmful 
effects. Only by paying equal attention to them and by 
skillfully handling the dialectical relationship among them will 
we be on the road to success and victory. This has been an 
in-depth summing up of the historical experience since our 
country adopted the policy of reform and opening up. This year 
marks a crucial year for a planned economic system in transition 
toward a socialist market economic system, and a year for 
tackling difficult reform measures. A number of major reform 
measures have been introduced since the beginning of this year 
and they are being implemented in a steady manner. The depth, 
breadth, and force of the reform are unprecedented. Seen from 
the general trend of this year's reform, development, and 
stability, reform occupies a pivotal status. Fresh changes, new 
trends, and new characteristics arising from the relationship of 
reform, development, and stability will bring forth a series of 
new problems; thus arises the need for us to pay extra attention 
to handling well the relationship among reform, development, and 
stability; to promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy in the course of steadfastly 
promoting reform; and to reinforce the foundation of political 
and social stability. At the same time, promoting development to 
support reform and promoting stability to ensure reform are of 
utmost importance in consolidating and developing an excellent 
situation. 
  Adhering to the policy of "carrying out the policy of 
promoting the reform and opening drive with one hand, cracking 
down on severe crimes with the other, and putting an equal 
emphasis on both," and enhancing socialist spiritual 
civilization building and democratic legal system building are 
the important aspects of triumphantly realizing the tasks set 
forth at the meetings. During the "two meetings," Comrade Jiang 
Zemin said the more we promote reform and construction, the more 
we need to stress ideals, discipline, unity, and the overall 
situation and to further develop this kind of spirit within the 
party and among the people in the nation. The "four stresses" 
are very important and are needed for promoting reform and 
construction. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
and building our country into a socialist nation which is rich, 
strong, democratic, modern, and civilized are the common ideals 
of the people of all nationalities at the present stage. We 
must uphold this ideal and help forge an even closer unity among 
the people of all nationalities to realize that grand goal. We 
should advocate taking the overall situation into consideration. 
Our remarks and actions should be conducive to the overall 
situation. Leading cadres in particular should correctly handle 
the relationship between the central and local governments and 
between overall and partial interests. We should strictly abide 
by discipline, implement the principles and policies worked out 
by the CPC Central Committee to the letter, and help maintain 
the centralism and unity of the CPC Central Committee. In 
carrying out a great cause of unprecedented socialist 
modernization drive in such a large country as ours, only by 
persisting in stressing ideals, discipline, unity, and the 
overall situation will we be able to provide a powerful 
ideological, political, and organizational guarantee for the 
smooth development of various undertakings. 
  A rapidly developing situation and great and arduous tasks 
require leading cadres at various levels of party and government 
departments to further raise their understanding, change their 
work styles, and work in a down-to-earth manner. It is 
necessary to understand both domestic and foreign situations in 
a comprehensive and correct manner. We need to understand not 
only that we indeed face great and excellent opportunities for 
reform and development, but also that difficulties and potential 
risks may lie ahead; we should neither be overly optimistic 
because of a good situation, nor should we waver in our 
confidence because of existing problems and difficulties. All 
in all, we should remain sober-minded; guard against arrogance; 
be patient; be prepared for danger in times of peace; work hard; 
and perform well in our work. We must firmly keep in mind that 
wholeheartedly serving the people is our fundamental purpose. 
It is necessary to forge close ties with the masses, listen to 
the calls of the masses, and help them solve their difficulties. 
We need to increase our efforts to build a clean 
administration; combat corruption; advocate the honest 
performance of official duties; wage a resolute struggle against 
corrupt elements and corrupt phenomena. As new situations and 
new problems constantly appear in the course of deepening 
reform, leading cadres should try to overcome bureaucratism and 
formalism; go deep into reality to conduct investigations and 
study; call on advanced experience and advanced models; pay 
attention to hidden and emerging problems; adopt appropriate and 
forceful measures to solve problems in a timely manner; and 
gather all positive factors to help realize the goals of reform, 
opening up, and modernization construction. 
  The people's congress system is our country's fundamental 
political system. The multiparty cooperation and political 
consultative system under the leadership of the Communist Party 
is our country's basic political system. Doing an even better 
job in NPC and CPPCC work and giving full play to the roles of 
the NPC and the CPPCC in the state's political life are 
extremely important to maintaining the country's unity and 
long-lasting peace and stability and to fulfilling the 
historical mission of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Building a socialist democratic legal system 
has been progressing steadily and in earnest since the convening 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. 
The CPC Central Committee works out principles and policies and 
the State Council formulates implementation plans for major 
issues which surface in the course of socialist modernization; 
those plans are sent to the NPC and the CPPCC for examination, 
discussion, revision, and improvements; following the adoption 
of the plans, people in the nation are mobilized to implement 
them. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, a 
pattern of the NPC, the Government, and the CPPCC working in 
close coordination and with efficiency has taken shape. Such a 
pattern is conducive to unifying the will of the entire party 
and the people in the nation and to concentrating efforts to 
handle major affairs; this is the characteristic and advantage 
of our country's political system. 
  The "two meetings" which were held during spring two years 
ago implemented the essence of the remarks made by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping during his southern China tour and the guidelines laid 
down at the Plenary Session of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central Committee and made a positive contribution to the entry 
of a new stage in our country's reform and opening up. The "two 
meetings" held in last spring implemented the guidelines set 
forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and made a positive 
contribution to the deepening of reform and the acceleration of 
development. This spring's "two meetings" comprehensively 
implemented the guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National 
Congress and at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and made the "20-character principle" [seize 
the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote 
development, and maintain stability] a guide for reform and 
construction; this year's "two meetings" will repaint the 
ten-thousand-li of the spring landscape of the motherland! 
  This year marks the 45th founding anniversary of the 
People's 
Republic of China. People of all nationalities in the nation 
will rally even closer around the CPC Central Committee with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core; they will unwaveringly make 
great strides along the direction shown by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and by the party's basic line; and they will 
greet this great festival with even more brilliant achievements 
in reform, opening up, and modernization construction!

<F P=106> [Work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National </F>
Committee, delivered by Ye Xuanping at the Second Session of the 
Eighth CPPCC National Committee on 8 March] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- Members of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], entrusted by 
the Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, I 
now submit the report on the work of the Standing Committee of 
the CPPCC National Committee for your examination and approval. 
<H5>  I. </H5>
  In the past year, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, the people of all 
nationalities in China have further emancipated their minds, 
seized opportunities, deepened reform, and opened wider to the 
outside world. As a result, China has enjoyed sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic growth, and political and social stability. 
Unity among the nationalities has been further strengthened, 
and all fields of endeavor have continued to advance. In 
particular, the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the 
Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," made by 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
shows that China's economy has entered a stage in which package 
reforms and breakthroughs in key areas are integrated. Although 
there are still contradictions and problems in our way of 
advance, as a whole China is in a period of massive development 
unprecedented in its history. 
  The new situation of reform and construction in China has 
set 
new tasks and requirements for the CPPCC, and has also created 
better opportunities and conditions for improving the work of 
the CPPCC. Since the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee, the Standing Committee, guided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and basing itself on the experiences of the 
past CPPCC national committees, has worked hard to explore new 
ways of fulfilling the CPPCC's functions of political 
consultation and democratic supervision in the new situation. 
The Standing Committee has stressed that the CPPCC should 
thoroughly understand its important position and role in the new 
period; should strive to fulfill its functions without 
overstepping its authority; should correctly understand its 
characteristics and select the proper angle in exploiting its 
advantages; should focus on the central task of economic 
construction, and refrain from formalism in participating in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs; should give full 
play to its specialized committees and organize its members to 
take part in various forms of activities regularly; should 
strengthen information work in order to promptly and correctly 
reflect people's sentiments and opinions; should vigorously 
widen its foreign contacts in coordination with the state's 
overall plan in foreign affairs; and so on and so forth. All 
these have been designed to enable the CPPCC, a unique form of 
democracy of the Chinese people, to better adapt itself to the 
requirements of the new period for socialist modernization; to 
fully play its role in the political, economic, and cultural 
life of the state; and to solidly and effectively advance the 
construction of socialist democracy, thereby guaranteeing in a 
better way the thriving of our undertakings, long- term 
stability in the country, and the realization of the great cause 
of the reunification of the motherland. 
  In the past year, the CPPCC Standing Committee has 
conscientiously organized the implementation of the tasks set by 
the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee. The 
Standing Committee has participated in the administration and 
discussion of state affairs while focusing on the central tasks 
of the country and has made new advances in various fields of 
work, thus bring about a more vivid and lively situation. The 
major achievements are: 
  -- Conscientiously convene meetings, and strengthen 
discussions and consultations of important state affairs. 
Every year the CPPCC holds its plenary session to fulfill its 
functions, discuss policies of the state, attend the NPC session 
as observers, and participate in the discussion of the 
government work report, the work reports of the Supreme Court 
and the Supreme Procuratorate, the national economic and social 
development plan, the state budget, and other important matters. 
Meetings of the Standing Committee represent the major form of 
carrying out the function of political consultation and 
democratic supervision during the recess of the CPPCC plenary 
session. In the past year, the Standing Committee has held five 
plenary meetings to discuss the economic situation in the 
country and countermeasures to deal with the situation, the 
international situation, and other issues regarding the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure, 
promotion of honesty in government institutions, and the fight 
against corruption. During these meetings, leaders of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council, including Zhu Rongji, 
Qian Qichen, Wen Jiabao, and Wei Jianxing were invited to make 
reports on different occasions. While focusing on the central 
issue, the members of the Standing Committee exchanged views 
freely and put forward many valuable opinions and proposals, 
bringing about a new atmosphere in the participation in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs. Last June, the 
chairmanship meeting discussed and adopted the "Proposal on 
Strengthening Macroeconomic Regulation and Control To Check 
Inflation" submitted by the Economic Committee. The analysis on 
the country's economic situation and the countermeasures for 
checking inflation, contained in the proposal, were adopted by 
the party Central Committee and the State Council and thus 
played a positive role in helping the state to enforce 
macroeconomic regulation and control to ensure a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. 
  -- Strengthen the work of special committees and 
organize the members to constantly take part in various 
activities. The special committees of the CPPCC are 
working groups which organize the members to constantly take 
part in various activities as well as important setups for 
developing the members' role of providing political consultation 
and democratic supervision, and of participating in and 
discussing state affairs. Over the past year, the special 
committees were very busy in organizing the members to take part 
in various activities. This has further whipped up the 
initiative of the members to participate in and discuss state 
affairs. Various special committees also carried out 
investigations and studied the building of the two civilizations 
and some important issues of the united front work, and put 
forward 24 investigation reports. Among those reports, "Some 
Suggestions on Developing and Stabilizing Grain and Cotton 
Production," "Suggestions on Saving and Protecting Cultural 
Relics in the Three-Gorges Construction Area," "Investigation 
Report on the Building of China's New and High Technology 
Development Zones," and "Investigation Report on the Issue of 
Helping Minority Areas Eliminate Poverty and Develop the 
Economy" were taken seriously by the party Central Committee, 
the State Council, and other concerned departments. Many 
suggestions have been accepted. Various special committees also 
held discussion meetings on formulating laws governing religion 
and donations by overseas Chinese, and on implementing laws to 
protect the rights and benefits of women and children, and laws 
governing teachers and taxation. They put forward a number of 
opinions and suggestions. 
  -- Expand the fields of foreign contacts to enhance 
friendship and cooperation with other countries. From the 
end of November to early December last year, Chairman Li Ruihuan 
made formal visits to three South Asian countries at the 
invitation of the speaker of Nepal's Upper House, the speaker of 
the Indian Union Parliament and the chairman of the Pakistani 
Senate, and achieved complete success. This was a major foreign 
affairs activity last year by a principal leader of our country. 
It was also the first visit to foreign countries by the 
chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and was significant in 
the history of foreign contacts by the CPPCC. Chairman Li 
Ruihuan introduced China's reform, opening up and economic 
construction to leaders, concerned departments, and people of 
various circles of the three countries; explained China's 
peaceful and friendly foreign policy, the characteristics and 
functions of the CPPCC, and China's multiparty cooperation and 
political consultation system under the leadership of the CPC; 
enhanced the three countries' understanding of the basic 
situation of China's socialist construction, especially the 
political system of socialist democracy; promoted exchanges and 
cooperation between the CPPCC and parliaments of the three 
countries; and deepened friendship between the people of China 
and the three countries. Vice chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, 
Seypidin Aze, Hong Xuezhi, Hu Sheng, Qian Weichang, and Sun 
Fuling also led delegations to a number of foreign countries, 
and made many friends. Over the past year, the CPPCC National 
Committee organized 15 delegations to visit 20 countries, 
received visits by delegations from various countries, and 
established new contacts with related organizations in 14 
countries. As of now, the CPPCC National Committee has 
established friendly relations with 46 organizations, and the 
parliaments of 36 countries. 
  -- Expand friendly contacts at home and abroad, promote 
the peace reunification of the motherland. With the goal 
of promoting two-way exchanges and "postal, transport and trade 
relations" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the 
Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee has 
strengthened relations and contacts with compatriots in Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas Chinese abroad. In the past 
year, the Standing Committee received 20 visiting delegations, 
and some 500 people. Through extensive contacts with 
influential and noted personages, and people of various circles 
in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao regions, we have publicized our 
policies, and increased mutual understanding. Members of the 
CPPCC are from various sectors of society. They have maintained 
extensive contacts with compatriots at home and abroad. They 
have done a lot of useful work in developing exchanges and 
cooperation in the economic, trade, science and technology, and 
cultural fields between the mainland and the outside world, and 
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. In particular, the 
members elected from Hong Kong and Macao have played a positive 
role in maintaining the stability and long-term prosperity in 
Hong Kong and Macao, and promoting the peaceful reunification of 
the motherland. 
  -- Actively participate in the anti-corruption struggle 
and assist state organizations to effectively promote clean 
administration. In August last year, the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council made plans for the 
anti-corruption struggle which won the wholehearted support of 
personages representing various democratic parties and sectors. 
In the course of this struggle, the Standing Committee 
earnestly carried out its democratic supervision functions as 
well as actively participated in general inspection of the 
anti-corruption struggle, organized by the party Central 
Committee. Six central inspection groups either headed or 
deputized by Standing Committee members or members of the CPPCC 
National Committee successively investigated the implementation 
of central anti-corruption plans in four State Council 
ministries and eight provinces. At its fifth meeting, the 
Standing Committee included the subject of anti-corruption and 
promotion of clean administration as an important agenda. The 
meeting held earnest discussions and forwarded many fitting 
opinions and suggestions. In addition, through various meetings 
and proposals, members held activities to promote the 
anti-corruption struggle and clean administration, promptly 
handled calls and opinions of people from various sectors, and 
actively forwarded various constructive suggestions. 
  -- Improve members' inspection as well as offer 
suggestions and advice for reform and development. To make 
members understand more about China's reform and construction 
for better participation in political consultations, the general 
office conducted on-the-spot or trans-provincial and 
trans-regional inspection for members from Beijing and other 
localities. In the entire year, a total of 466 CPPCC National 
Committee members from 12 provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities participated in inspection. The members went 
deep into the grass-roots level to understand the situation, and 
forwarded many good opinions and suggestions to which relevant 
central departments and local governments attached importance. 
The general office also sent members from Hong Kong and Macao 
to separately inspect Xinjiang, Jiangxi, and Hainan to enable 
them to understand more about national conditions in order to 
forward ideas and suggestions for local economic construction 
and social development. 
  -- Strengthen work in handling and answering 
proposals. Proposals are an important way for various 
participating CPPCC units and individuals to carry out their 
consultative and supervisory functions as well as exercise their 
democratic rights. In recent years, the CPPCC's proposal work 
has been gradually moved onto a regular and systematic orbit. 
The Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee 
has emphasized the need to upgrade the quality of its work by 
attaching great importance to handling proposals. It followed 
up on investigation, worked jointly with others, and held 
consultations and discussion meetings to enhance the work of 
handling proposals. In the past year, a total of 1,900 
proposals were handled and registered, of which 13 were 
submitted by parties and organizations. A total of 1,506 
members, or 72 percent of the total number of CPPCC members, 
submitted proposals. By 15 February 1994, 1,881 proposals had 
been handled and answered. Even though some proposals handled 
did not result in satisfactory outcomes, many important opinions 
and suggestions were indeed adopted by relevant departments 
which produced good effects in implementing them. 
  -- Earnestly receive opinions from all sides and make 
preparations for the CPPCC's constitutional amendment. The 
current CPPCC's constitution, revised in 1982, has played a very 
important role in initiating a new prospect for CPPCC work. In 
the past 12 years, China has made tremendous achievements in 
socialist modernization, resulting in profound changes in her 
outlook. In particular, since Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches 
during his inspection in the south, and the 14th CPC National 
Congress, China's reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization has entered a new development stage. Essential 
amendments to China's Constitution, as well as the constitutions 
of the CPC and democratic parties, have been correspondingly 
made. By virtue of this, the CPPCC Constitution also needs to 
undergo necessary revisions. The second meeting of this 
Standing Committee adopted the "Decision on Proposing a Partial 
Amendment to the CPPCC Constitution" and set up a constitutional 
amendment working group headed by Li Ruihuan, and comprising Ye 
Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, and Hu Sheng as deputy heads. After half a 
year of efforts, an amendment to the CPPCC Constitution took 
shape on the basis of opinions solicited from responsible 
persons of various democratic parties and the All-China 
Federation of Industry and Commerce, local CPPCC committees, and 
relevant units of the central authorities. This amendment 
contains mainly convergencies with the Constitutional Amendment 
with regard to some major wordings, such as the stress on the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
basic line in the primary phase of socialism, the system of 
multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the 
leadership of the CPC, and the socialist market economic system; 
as well as replenishes -- after incorporating fresh experience 
and achievements in developing China's socialist democratic 
politics and in the CPPCC's work since the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th CPC Central Committee -- relevant provisions on the 
CPPCC's performing the functions of political consultation and 
democratic supervision. The proposed amendment puts forward 
clearly: "The main functions of the National Committee and 
local committees of the CPPCC are to carry out political 
consultation and democratic supervision, and to organize for the 
CPPCC's various participating parties and organizations as well 
as people of all nationalities and all circles to take part in 
the administration and discussion of state affairs," and that 
"political consultation means consultations carried out before 
decisions are made on the cardinal policy and principle of the 
state and localities as well as important issues in the 
political, economic, cultural, and social life; and those 
carried out on major problems arising during the process of 
implementing such policy decisions." These two stipulations and 
the revision of other relevant clauses represent an 
incorporation of the "Opinions of the CPC Central Committee on 
Upholding and Improving the System of Multiparty Cooperation and 
Political Consultation Under the Leadership of the CPC," 
relevant contents of the "Temporary Provisions of the CPPCC 
National Committee on Political Consultation and Democratic 
Supervision" transmitted by the CPC Central Committee, as well 
as relevant guidelines of the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC 
National Committee to specifically stipulate the major duties of 
the CPPCC. It is believed that such stipulations will have a 
major effect in standardizing and giving impetus to the CPPCC's 
work. In line with the principle of making only essential and 
partial revisions, this amendment does not alter any content in 
the existing constitution to which a revision is optional. We 
will propose resolving through state legislation, and other 
ways, any issues that need to be solved in the CPPCC's work but 
fall outside the capacity of the CPPCC Constitution itself. 
Having been adopted by the Fifth Standing Committee meeting of 
the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the amendment to the CPPCC 
Constitution is now submitted for deliberation by this session. 
  -- Forge closer ties and cooperation with local CPPCC 
committees and strengthen guidance for their work. As most 
local CPPCC committees were reelected at almost the same time 
last year as the CPPCC National Committee, vertical 
communication was thus especially needed in the course of 
opening up a new prospect in the work of local CPPCC committees. 
This Standing Committee, therefore, further strengthened its 
guidance for the work of local CPPCC committees in accordance 
with its constitution. For instance, principal responsible 
comrades from the CPPCC committees of various provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities were invited to our 
Standing Committee meetings as observers to join in discussions 
on state affairs and the study of the CPPCC's work; our chairman 
and vice chairmen met with and heard work reports by comrades 
from local CPPCC committees when inspecting local work; the 
special committees concerned carried out cooperation and held 
joint work meetings with their counterparts in local CPPCC 
committees or conducted joint investigation and study on issues 
of common concern; training was conducted for several batches of 
responsible comrades from a number of city- and county-level 
CPPCC committees. All these moves were welcomed by local CPPCC 
committees. 
  Committee members, since the First Plenary Session of the 
Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the Standing Committee has made 
progress in its work. Many shortcomings and deficiencies, 
however, remain in our work. For example, consultations on 
issues of major importance need to be bolstered in terms of 
fuller research and more thorough investigation; democratic 
supervision by the CPPCC should be carried out -- in a more 
down-to-earth manner -- in coordination with reform, opening up 
of the state, and the development of political, economic, and 
social undertakings; and greater improvement is needed in the 
processing of motions submitted by the political parties, public 
organizations, and committee members. We are convinced that so 
long as we work with one heart and one mind, build on our 
successes, and overcome our deficiencies, we can continue our 
march forward. 
<H5>  II. </H5>
  Committee members, 1994 will be a crucial year for China's 
reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. The basic 
policy for the party's and state's work -- that is, fully 
implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
seize the opportunity to accelerate the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure, maintain a sustained, fast, 
and healthy development of the national economy, maintain 
political stability, and bring about all-around social progress 
-- has been decided. This year is the second year of the Eighth 
CPPCC National Committee. The basic policy for the work of its 
Standing Committee is to, under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, hold high the banner of patriotism and 
socialism, revolve closely around the central task of the party 
and state in executing -- in a still better way -- its functions 
of political consultation and democratic supervision, improve 
efficiency in the participation in the administration and 
discussion of state affairs, and make due contributions in 
implementing the task of seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability. Accordingly, the Standing Committee has set the 
following as its main tasks for 1994: 
  1. Study the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in a deep-going manner to enhance our common 
understanding. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is a guide to action for 
a big country with a population of 1.1 billion to eliminate 
poverty to achieve prosperity, to eliminate backwardness, and to 
achieve modernization. In the past 15 years, people of all 
nationalities across the country have implemented this theory 
and scored world-renowned achievements. Building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics has become the supreme consensus among 
people of all nationalities across the country. The various 
democratic parties, public organizations, persons without party 
affiliations, and persons representing ethnic groups -- the 
components of the CPPCC -- must integrate theory with reality 
and study this theory on their own initiative so they will have 
a deeper understanding of the basic tenets of Marxism, a 
systematic understanding of the current national conditions of 
China, and a complete and accurate knowledge of the country's 
general principle and policy. Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping reflects in a concentrated way the 
theory on building socialism with Chinese Characteristics. We 
should make it the most important teaching material for us in 
conducting self-education, and in enhancing our understanding 
under the new situation. Deng Xiaoping's works contain a series 
of expositions on the nature, tasks, and functions of the united 
front and the CPPCC in the new period, carrying forward Comrade 
Mao Zedong's theory on the united front and people's democracy 
under the new historical conditions. We must study them in a 
systematic and deepgoing manner. Efforts should be made to 
study the new situation and new characteristics of CPPCC work in 
the course of establishing a socialist market economic system, 
dare to explore new ways, dare to act, uphold the principle of 
"democracy, realism, unity, motivational atmosphere," and 
implement, in a still better manner, the system of multi-party 
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of 
the CPC. 
  2. Select important issues in economic construction, 
reform and opening up to the outside world, the building of 
spiritual civilization, and the people's livelihood as subjects 
for organized investigation and study, and conscientiously and 
properly participate in the administration and discussion of 
state affairs. Proper participation in the administration 
and discussion of state affairs is the essential requirement of 
the CPPCC's duties of political consultation and democratic 
supervision as well as an important criterion for measuring the 
CPPCC's work. We should closely revolve around the party and 
the state's central task in participating in the administration 
and discussion of state affairs, improve actual work results, 
and give play to the CPPCC's advantage of being 
intellect-intensive, and having widespread information sources 
and a relatively smooth vertical communication system, to 
vigorously promote socialist modernization. From late last year 
through early this year, the State Council successively 
introduced a series a reform measures aimed at accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economic system. As 
continually deepening reform of the economic structure would 
guarantee a sound structure for promoting economic development, 
we should unswervingly unite the people in support of the 
government's move to implement measures to deepen reform, and 
should look squarely at a series of new contradictions and 
difficulties arising amid the reform, to promote the integration 
of reform, development, and stability. This is the overall 
situation of the state. In unfolding various activities in 
political consultation, democratic supervision, and 
participation in the administration and discussion of state 
affairs, the CPPCC should conscientiously submit to and serve 
this overall situation. This Standing Committee will prudently 
select several issues of overall importance in reform, opening 
up to the outside world, and the building of spiritual and 
material civilization as subjects for comparatively systematic 
and in-depth investigation and study organized under the 
initiative of the general office of the CPPCC National Committee 
or relevant special committees, so as to find out about the 
various situations and put forward countermeasures. Whenever 
necessary, local CPPCC committees or the democratic parties 
concerned will be invited to take part in these activities. 
This Standing Committee or the chairmanship meeting should 
carry out earnest deliberations and make proposals to be 
formally submitted to the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council. 
  3. Democratic parties and mass organizations should 
carry forward the fine traditions and play a more important role 
in participating in administration and discussion of state 
affairs. Democratic parties and mass organizations 
constitute an important foundation of people's political 
consultative organs, and they play a particularly important role 
in multiparty cooperation and political consultations. Promoted 
and nurtured by revolutionaries of the older generation like Mao 
Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping over the last several 
decades, the CPC and various democratic parties have developed 
the fine traditions characterized by "long-term coexistence, 
mutual supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and 
sharing weal and woe," as well as the fine traditions 
characterized by close cooperation, and discussion of state 
affairs among all parties of the people's political consultative 
organs. Today, not only should we inherit these traditions, but 
we must also carry them forward. Last winter and this spring, 
Chairman Li Ruihuan visited the central committees of all 
democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and 
Commerce, and exchanged views with them on various situations. 
From now on the CPPCC National Committee should forge stronger 
ties with democratic parties and mass organizations, and give 
full scope to their roles in participating in administration and 
discussion of state affairs. We should attach even greater 
importance to their suggestions and motions, and create more 
opportunities for them to take part in administration and 
discussion of state affairs. All special committees should make 
it a regular practice to exchange views with democratic parties 
and mass organizations, and strengthen operational coordination 
with them. 
  4. CPPCC organs should contribute to maintaining 
political and social stability by forging closer ties with 
people of all nationalities in all sectors, earnestly reflect 
their views to the government, and coordinate their 
relations. CPPCC organs should establish closer ties with 
member units and members, and all member units and members 
should forge closer ties with people in various sectors. As the 
intensity of economic reform increases and more reform measures 
are introduced, the interests of different social groups will 
certainly have to be readjusted, and the readjustment will 
inevitably give rise to new social problems. Thus CPPCC organs 
at all levels are duty bound to maintain political stability and 
unity, mobilize all positive factors, and turn negative factors 
into positive factors to make sure that the government can 
successfully carry out its reform plans. All member units, 
special committees, and members of CPPCC organs must set 
examples of taking the interests of the whole into account and 
maintaining stability, and they must not do anything unfavorable 
to unity and stability. Meanwhile, we must take the initiative 
in going deep among those with whom we have established ties to 
hear and reflect their views, requests, and complaints. For 
those hot issues with which the masses are concerned, and to 
which they have responded strongly, we should actively seek ways 
and means that can solve them, and through participating in 
administration and state affairs discussion, urge the government 
to deal with them. For those problems that cannot be 
immediately resolved, we must also assist the government to 
enlighten the people so that the contradictions will not be 
aggravated. We must strive to help people of different 
nationalities and with different religious beliefs to understand 
one another and trust one another, and promote their unity 
through coordinating their ties. Special committees should pay 
particular attention to helping remote and impoverished areas 
through giving them intellectual support, and help these areas 
as well as minority areas and the former revolutionary bases set 
up production projects, and help them shake off poverty, improve 
their livelihood, and develop educational, cultural, and 
scientific-technical projects. 
  5. We should earnestly carry out democratic supervision 
through conducting effective inspection and presenting more 
constructive proposals. CPPCC organs carry out their 
democratic supervision primarily through putting forth 
suggestions and making criticism. CPPCC organs must therefore 
attach great importance to, and promptly reflect, the views and 
suggestions -- especially those critical views -- which member 
units and members put forth at various meetings, and during 
inspections. Democratic parties, mass organizations, and 
members of CPPCC organs should strive to demonstrate their 
supervisory role, improve the quality of proposals, be more 
efficient in examining and establishing cases for investigation, 
and analyze each and every case to make sure it is valid and 
will be handled constructively. On this basis, we should make 
sure that all proposals are handled promptly and properly. 
Bureaucratic conduct -- such as shelving the motions, stalling 
their handling, or handling them perfunctorily -- should be 
criticized through the media. Members of CPPCC organs should be 
encouraged to report and expose all lawless conduct. CPPCC 
organs at all levels should safeguard by law the 
responsibilities and rights of CPPCC member units and 
individuals to perform their democratic supervision. 
  6. Expand channels of contact in developing friendship 
with people abroad, promote peaceful reunification of the 
motherland. As the days of recovering Hong Kong and Macao 
in 1997 and 1999 are getting closer, and with the development of 
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the CPPCC 
must intensify efforts to promote peaceful reunification of the 
motherland. It is necessary to expand the scope of contacts; 
widen channels of contact in developing friendship; strengthen 
efforts to publicize the principles of "peaceful reunification" 
and "one country, two systems"; enhance mutual understanding; 
strengthen the study of the situation in Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Macao; and improve coordination with all concerned departments. 
We will continue to promote the realization of direct postal, 
transport, and trade relations with the Taiwan region. We will 
continue to work for the stability and long-term prosperity of 
the Hong Kong region. We will firmly support our government 
resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong according to 
the schedule despite all kinds of winds and waves [feng lang 
7364 3186], and all kinds of artificial obstacles [ren wei di 
zhang ai 0086 3634 4104 7140 4293]. We will continue to work 
hard for the smooth transfer of political power and peaceful 
transition in the Macao region in accordance with the principles 
of the Macao Basic Law. 
  7. Give full play to the advantageous position of the 
CPPCC, continue to develop friendly contacts with parliaments 
and nongovernment organizations of various countries. The 
CPPCC's foreign contacts are an important component part of our 
country's overall foreign affairs. We must follow the principle 
of serving the interests of China's economic construction and 
overall diplomatic mission, give full play to the CPPCC's 
advantageous position of integration of the government and 
nongovernment sectors, and actively unfold activities in the 
field of external relations. In the new year we should, on the 
basis of consolidating our existing friendly relations, increase 
contacts with countries and regions which lack understanding of 
our country. In developing external relations, we can promote 
contacts with nongovernment friendly organizations as well as 
foreign parliaments. We should publicize the features of our 
country's system of socialist democracy in light of our 
country's special characteristics; we should turn the CPPCC's 
foreign contacts into links and bridges for promoting 
international cooperation and understanding in China; and we 
should strive to create a favorable international environment 
for china's socialist modernization drive. 
  8. Strengthen the organizational work of the CPPCC in 
an all-around way, raise the quality of cadres, and increase 
work efficiency. In order to create a new situation for 
the work of the CPPCC, we must effectively strengthen the 
ideological and organizational building of the CPPCC, and 
improve our workstyle and systems. We should carry out 
organizational reform, increase efficiency, raise the quality of 
service, and effectively improve all kinds of work of CPPCC 
organizations. We will ask cadres of various CPPCC 
organizations to seriously study job related knowledge, 
especially theory and policies of the united front work; attain 
modern economic, scientific and technological knowledge; 
heighten their sense of service; raise cultural and professional 
quality; and improve their ability to serve the united front 
work, to serve the meetings of the CPPCC, and to serve members 
of the CPPCC. We will vigorously advocate good practices for 
making constant progress, unity and cooperation, strictly 
observing discipline, paying attention to efficiency, and being 
honest in performing official duties. We will show concern for 
and train cadres, and create good conditions for the steady 
growth of middle-aged and young cadres. In short, we will 
strive to cultivate contingents of workers of the CPPCC who love 
work related to the CPPCC, and are good in ideology, 
professional skill, and workstyle. 
  Fellow members, the 45th founding anniversary of the CPPCC 
as 
well as the 45th founding anniversary of the People's Republic 
of China will fall in this year. Let us hold high the banner of 
patriotism and socialism, unite closely around the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and struggle 
hard for the accomplishment of various tasks set by the current 
session, and score a new victory in the work of the CPPCC!

  [Text] Fuzhou, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Southeast China's 
Fujian Province is mobilizing its people to expand the already 
considerable tree coverage in a bid to develop a forestry 
economy. 
  With 52.4 percent of the province's land covered by woods, 
Fujian ranks first in the country in term of forested areas. It 
has 73 percent of land reserved for forestry industry. 
  Over the past four years, the province has reclaimed all the 
barren mountains and hills. 
  Places such as roadsides, river banks and villages are also 
included in the annual greening program. 
  Newly-forested areas are usually sealed off to protect the 
seedlings. 
  Priority was given to construct a shelter-belt along the 
coast. 
  Governments in all localities also focused their work on 
state- owned forestry centers and collectively-owned forestry 
and fruit- growing centers. 
  By 1995, Fujian is expected to have 533,000 ha [hectare] of 
firs for timber and 660,000 ha of pine for timber. 
  Now the province has 6.14 million ha of woods, including 
680,000 ha of bamboo and large acreages of fruit trees, herbs 
and flowers. 
  In addition to developing its national and provincial 
forestry parks, Fujian aims to tap these resources to produce 
paper, plywood and chemicals.

  [Text] Xiamen, March 9 (XINHUA) -- This special economic 
zone in east China's Fujian Province is gearing its investment 
environment to international standards. 
  Mayor Hong Yongshi said in his recent government report that 
Xiamen is to create an investment environment in line with 
international practice. 
  Most of some 1,000 joint ventures in operation are located 
on 
Xiamen Island proper, which covers 131 sq km. 
  Hong said that last year the city delegated the power of 
approving the setting up of overseas-funded firms to lower 
departments while concentrating on the building of 
infrastructure. 
  That year Xiamen approved 655 foreign-funded projects, 
absorbing one billion U.S. dollars of foreign capital. 
  The city also allows greater freedom in the entrance to and 
departure from the zone of personnel, cargo and capital. 
  Domestic and overseas firms have already entered the Xiangyu 
Free Trade Zone, and Xiamen is determined to introduce more 
overseas financial institutions. 
  Encouragement is given to investment in industry, the 
service 
sector and infrastructure projects, according to the mayor.

  [Text] Xiamen, March 11 (XINHUA) -- The Xiamen Special 
Economic Zone in east China's Fujian Province is exploring new 
avenues to reform the current investment structure by issuing 
stocks to raise funds. 
  Real estate, manufacturing, commerce and tourism are the 
mainstay industries of this special economic zone. 
  The issuing of joint stocks has effected a change in the 
management mechanism of enterprises. The Minnan Trade Center, 
for instance, raised 75 million yuan for its construction in 
this way. Under the supervision of the shareholders, the project 
was constructed one year ahead of time. 
  A construction and development company in Haicang, one of 
the 
four government-approved special areas for Taiwan investors, 
joined with five financial institutions to raise 300 million 
yuan for the construction of highways, harbors, 
program-controlled telephones, water conduits and other items of 
infrastructure. 
  The 6.1-km highway bridge connecting Xiamen Island and 
Haicang area is also expected to be financed through the issuing 
of stock.

  [Text] Suzhou, March 18 (XINHUA) -- This economically 
booming city in east China's Jiangsu Province is attracting 
strong Taiwan investment in addition to foreign capital. 
  It has so far approved the establishment of 1,100 
Taiwan-funded enterprises, accounting for one third of the total 
in the city. Included are some 500 approved last year. 
  These projects are mainly involved in the fields of 
electronics, machinery and chemicals. 
  Located in the central part of the Chang Jiang River delta, 
Suzhou is only 100 km west of Shanghai, China's largest economic 
center, and has convenient transport and telecommunications 
facilities. Its gross product last year amounted to about 50 
billion yuan. 
  Also last year, this garden city received 140,000 visitors

  [Text] Nanjing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Bank savings in rural 
areas in east China's Jiangsu Province had reached 51.32 billion 
yuan by March 10, a record in history. 
  An agricultural bank official said that in the first 70 days 
of this year, bank savings in the rural areas increased by 6.2 
billion yuan. 
  The drastic increase in rural bank savings was attributed to 
the favorable development of rural industry, government measures 
to reduce the burden of farmers and improvement in bank services 
in rural Jiangsu. 
  Last year the funds which Jiangsu's rural enterprises 
distributed to their employees amounted to 9.5 billion yuan. 
  Meanwhile, the provincial government took measures to reduce 
the burden of the farmers, and the tendency of illegally 
collecting funds in rural areas was checked, so farmers are 
willing to deposit their surplus money in banks. 
  Last year the agricultural bank branch in Jiangsu Province 
set up 1,178 computer-controlled bank savings offices all over 
the rural areas.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 16 (XINHUA) -- A gathering was held 
here today to celebrate the 100th birthday of renowned Chinese 
painter Liu Haisu. 
  Liu was born in Jiangsu Province and is noted as a painter 
and arts educator. He has trained a large number of artists 
since 1912 when as a very young man he founded the Shanghai 
Institute of Traditional Chinese Painting, China's first arts 
college. 
  Liu is expert in Chinese and western painting, poetry and 
calligraphy. His paintings have been widely exhibited at home 
and abroad. 
  When the painter was already 90 years old, he climbed 
Huangshan Mountain in Anhui Province time and again to paint. 
  "I have a new beginning at 100 years old," Liu said, "and I 
will go to the mountain again, and go to the 'three gorges' to 
create new works." 
  Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, and Wu Bangguo, secretary of 
Shanghai Municipal Communist Party Committee, who are attending 
a conference of the National People's Congress in Beijing, 
entrusted Deputy Secretary Chen Zhili to present a wood 
sculpture of the god of longevity to the painter. 
  The Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, the Chinese 
Ministry of Culture, the China Artists' Association, Hong Kong 
universities and Japanese companies also offered their 
congratulations to the centenarian.

  [Text] Nanjing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- The introduction of 
market mechanisms has helped jiangsu, one of China's most 
economically advanced provinces, to put on a new spurt. 
  Last year saw the province cancel the mandatory production 
and marketing plan for most products, and lift the price 
ceilings from 92 percent of local products, including grain, 
oil-bearing seeds, cotton and silkworm cocoons. 
  "This has paved the way for more successful market 
operations 
and revitalized the province's economy," said Deputy Governor Ji 
Yunshi, who is in charge of economic matters. 
  "The province has adapted itself quickly to the 
macro-environment change in the economy," he noted. 
  The deputy governor explained that Jiangsu, which is short 
of 
raw materials and energy resources, has focused on the 
processing industry. 
  With thousands of small enterprises, the province used to be 
affected and limited by market changes. 
  One manifestation was fluctuation in provincial economic 
growth during the 1986-90 period. 
  Jiangsu's economy grew at a fast and abnormal speed in the 
first half of last year, and the speed slowed down in the later 
part of the year as a result of the central government's 
tightening of macro-control of the economy. 
  As the enterprises' adaptability was enhanced, they quickly 
adjusted the orientation of investment and their product mix in 
line with needs of markets at home and abroad. 
  The rural industrial enterprises, for example, raised more 
than 2.1 billion yuan by developing the partnership system last 
year. 
  A survey shows that Jiangsu's gross domestic product still 
increased at a rate of 18.5 percent last year. 
  Its industrial output value in the first two months of this 
year rose by at least 20 percent over the same period of last 
year. 
  Economists here agree that the market economy has helped 
push 
Jiangsu's economy ahead. 
  According to statistics, Jiangsu's gross retail sales volume 
reached 107.42 billion yuan last year, an increase of 33.9 
percent over the previous year, and its exports also registered 
a big increase. 
  The economists noted that Jiangsu's economic growth is based 
on market needs and is now developing in a healthy way. 
  In particular, the province has made rapid progress in 
infrastructural facilities and basic industry. 
  The province spent 6.773 billion yuan on improving 
transportation and telecommunications facilities last year, up 
59.3 percent over the previous year and 33.7 percentage points 
higher over the investment in industry. 
  In addition, the province invested more than four billion 
yuan in the development of the raw materials industry last year, 
up 23 percent. 
  The deputy governor attributed the economic progress partly 
to the service trades and the establishment of foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
  According to statistics, the added value of the service 
trades last year amounted to 62.3 billion yuan, an increase of 
20.3 percent over the previous year, and its output accounted 
for 24.4 percent of the province's total. 
  So far, the province has approved the establishment of more 
than 20,000 foreign-funded enterprises, of which over 7,000 have 
gone into operation. Many of their products are for export. 
  The ten state economic development zones in Jiangsu and a 
number of provincial development zones are in smooth operation, 
and some have already begun to make profits.

  [Text] Nanchang, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The first field 
school for farmers was recently opened in Xinjian County in East 
China's inland Jiangxi Province, starting an inter-state project 
of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO) in the province. 
  Xinjian, which was chosen as a site for the comprehensive 
project about the control of insect and other pests, is a key 
rice producing county. 
  With reference to the experience of field schools for 
farmers 
in Indonesia, recommended by FAO, local authorities will open 
similar schools in line with local conditions in an attempt to 
help farmers to deal with pests and treat diseases that endanger 
rice. 
  No classrooms and teaching facilities are needed for such 
schools: farmers mainly study through actual practice under the 
guidance of experts.

  [Text] During a group discussion held by a Shandong 
delegation to the second session of the eighth National People's 
Congress on 12 March, Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the 
Shandong Provincial CPC Committee and provincial governor, 
pointed out: It is necessary to grasp reform as a matter of 
prime importance and focus the work on raising efficiency in an 
effort to maintain a good economic trend in Shandong Province. 
  In his speech, Zhao Zhihao pointed out: This year's reform 
will involve some in-depth major issues, such as the adjustment 
of interests in various sectors, classification of powers, and 
system innovations. We must grasp reform as a matter of prime 
importance, persist in carrying out package reform with 
breakthroughs in key areas while doing our work, seize the 
opportunity and strengthen coordinated efforts to issue reform 
measures, and give consideration to the capacity of all sectors 
to withstand the strains of reform. In order to invigorate large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, our province will 
select 50 enterprises to experiment with the modern enterprise 
system and, at the same time, continue to experiment with the 
shareholding system in 100 enterprises so as to effect the 
change of enterprise operational mechanism. It is necessary to 
pay attention to conducting propaganda, explanation, and 
specific work on reform of the tax assignment system and 
implement them steadily in an effort to accelerate the change 
into the new system. We should strengthen the building of 
social security system and enhance our capacity to withstand the 
strains of reform. 
  Zhao Zhihao stressed: It is necessary to raise the quality 
of economic development and maintain a good trend in economic 
development. Regarding the rate of development, we must not set 
targets that are too high. He said: This year our province 
arranged to make its gross domestic products increase by 12 
percent, which will be lower than last year's annual increase of 
19.5 percent and the actual increase of 24.2 percent. We must 
avoid making the increase in various economic sectors too high 
and concentrate the main energy on readjusting the structure, 
conducting technological transformation, strengthening 
management, and raising efficiency. In rural work, we should 
regard raising the income of peasants and guaranteeing supply as 
the central tasks and ensure that the rural economy will 
comprehensively increase, the production of grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops will steadily increase, and the income of 
peasants will increase by a large margin. We should continue to 
give different guidance according to the merits of different 
cases, act in line with the ideas of attending to the 
development of 25 economically strong counties and a batch of 
enterprise groups, give play to their role as the dragon head, 
strengthen the development vitality, accelerate the economic 
development of less-developed areas, and gradually attend the 
goal of common prosperity.

  [Text] Jinan, March 14 (XINHUA) -- The Shengli oilfield, 
China's second largest after Daqing, has made major headway in 
its geological prospecting. 
  Shuai Defu, Shengli's chief geologist, said that the recent 
sinking of new wells in the Chengdao offshore oil and gas site, 
China's biggest of its kind, has found over 100 sq [square] km 
in oil formations, compared with the original area of 40 sq km. 
And further exploration is needed to establish the actual 
extent of reserves. 
  In the Linnan oil reservoir, an oil belt of nearly 1,000 sq 
km has been assured, with an annual capacity of more than 
500,000 tons. 
  On the north of the belt, a 2,000-m [meter]-deep deposit has 
been found. It is considered to be one of the best oil 
production centers in the region. 
  In the Feiyantan field, the newly-verified reserves last 
year 
doubled the initial figure. 
  In addition, the oilfield has also seen expansion after 
fresh 
strikes at other oil reservoirs such as Hekou, Bonan and 
Caoqiao, according to Shuai. 
  Located in the Yellow river delta in east China's Shandong 
Province, Shengli claims 65 verified fields with several billion 
tons of oil reserves and gas amounting to tens of billions of 
cubic meters. 
  Since its maiden year of 1964, Shengli has sunk 53 wells and 
produced 520 million tons of oil, accounting for one-fifth of 
the country's total. It has paid over 22 billion yuan in profit 
taxes to the state, five-fold the government's investment in the 
field. 
  So far, geologists have developed systems to probe for 
reservoirs in Shengli's complex geological conditions, 
impressing counterparts in the U.S. and Japan. 
  Now, armed with upgraded computers and other sophisticated 
technology for oil exploration, experts are confident about the 
great potential of the oilfield. 
  Last year, the growth in newly-verified deposits was 
maintained above the average pace of the past 30 years.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai swap 
market is brisk and the foreign exchange rate remains stable, 
thanks to the unified floating rate system. 
  The total trade volume in February amounted to 280 million 
yuan, a hefty 35.66 percent rise from the same period last year. 
  Despite the shift to an interbank forex market from the swap 
one, the market posted an average daily trade volume of 16.58 
million U.S. dollars within its 17 business days in February 
this year, compared with 12.22 million U.S. dollars last year. 
  The renminbi exchange rate against the U.S. dollar opened on 
February 1 at 8.696 yuan and dropped to 8.690 yuan at the close 
on February 28. 
  In the first two months this year, the total trade volume at 
the Shanghai market jumped to 750 million U.S. dollars from 440 
million U.S. dollars in the same period last year, a surge of 70 
percent. 
  The city is now speeding up the pace of establishing a 
unified, standard Chinese interbank forex market to replace the 
foreign exchange swap market.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 9 (XINHUA) -- The municipal 
government of this, China's largest economic center has 
designated 1994 as a "Year for Greening". 
  It is mobilizing all its residents to "develop Shanghai into 
a clean, beautiful and comfortable ecological city." 
  According to the plan, the government will build or expand 
four parks and complete a number of greening projects to expand 
the public green areas by 133 ha, and plant a 500-meter-wide 
tree belt around the city this year. 
  Shanghai has made progress in beautifying its urban area 
over 
the past few years. 
  Last year saw the city add 157.54 ha of green areas and four 
parks, and plant 10.23 million trees. The city now averages 
1.15 sq m of green area per capita. 
  The city's green coverage rate reached 13.5 percent of its 
urban area last year.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 14 (XINHUA) -- The `94 East China 
Export Fair closed here today, with more than 1.8 billion U.S. 
dollars-worth of deals sealed. 
  "This shows that overseas businessmen are bullish on China's 
market and we have reason to be optimistic about this year's 
exports," said Wang Zukang, an organizing official of the fair. 
  All the Chinese participants from 20 provinces and cities 
registered a big increase in exports in January and February, 
said Wang. The combined annual export value of these provinces 
and cities has accounted for more than half of the nation's 
total. 
  The ten-day fair drew 7,788 customers from 82 countries and 
regions, mostly from Japan, the United States, Hong Kong, Macao, 
Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Canada and Australia. 
  There were also some first-time participants from Africa and 
other countries, the organizer said. 
  Thousands of Chinese enterprises displayed over 10,000 
varieties of goods. The proportion of new and high technology 
products as well as machinery and electronics products increased 
noticeably, according to Wang. 
  Textiles, light industry products and machinery equipment 
were among those that clinched most orders. 
  Wang said that as more and more domestic exporters took part 
in the fair every year, it might become a national one before 
long.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Jun (0060 0193): "Mainland's New Policy of </F>
Attracting Taiwan Capital: Create a Favorable Environment for 
More Exchanges Between Shanghai and Taiwan"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 23 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Shortly 
after the Lunar New Year, Zhang Zhiqun, director of the Shanghai 
Municipal People's Government Taiwan Affairs Office, said during 
an exclusive interview with reporters from this news agency that 
Shanghai's Taiwan-related work this year will be summarized as 
"creating a favorable environment for more exchanges and visits 
of personnel between Shanghai and Taiwan." 
  Looking at the good trend in economic and trade exchanges 
between Shanghai and Taiwan, as well as visits by personnel from 
the two places, the director of the Taiwan Affairs Office was 
certainly very happy. According to statistics, in 1993 the 
development of economic and trade relations between Shanghai and 
Taiwan compared very well with the overall situation of economic 
development in Shanghai. A total of 805 Taiwan-funded 
enterprises gained approval for establishment over the whole 
year, and this means that two Taiwan-funded enterprises 
established themselves in the municipality every day. A total 
of $1.5 billion in Taiwanese funds was attracted to the 
municipality in 1993; there were 249 exchange programs, 54 more 
than in 1992; and in the area of personnel exchange, 1,304 
Shanghai personnel went to Taiwan. 
  Zhang Zhiqun said that in the new year, the first thing to 
do 
is to continue to strengthen work in attracting Taiwan-funded 
enterprises so that more Taiwan-funded enterprises will settle 
down in Shanghai. Particular attention must be paid to the 
investment intentions of large consortia on the island. He said 
that Taiwan investment in Shanghai exhibits four features: 
Investment projects develop in the capital-intensive and 
technology-intensive direction; the investment scale has 
expanded, and there are over 50 large projects each of which 
involves $5 million; Taiwan businessmen are eager to lease land, 
among the 200 parcels of leased land in Shanghai, Taiwan 
businessmen have won over 40; the investment domain has expanded 
to tertiary industry, and among the 1,000 or so Taiwan firms 
which have won approval for establishment, over one-fourth have 
invested in tertiary industry. 
  Zhang Zhiqun also said that full play must be given to 
Shanghai's overall advantage, to actively promoting various 
exchanges between the two places, to enabling Shanghai's 
departments in charge of science, technology, education, 
culture, sports, and medicine to have more extensive contacts 
and links with Taiwan's professional sectors; and that overall 
work in receiving personnel from the two sides of the strait 
must be done well in order to enable Taiwan compatriots in 
Shanghai to move and see more. 
  He also disclosed that, in light of the new situation in 
which the number of Taiwan-funded enterprises is increasing, 
Shanghai plans to establish an Association of Taiwan-Funded 
Enterprises this year. The association will organize experts, 
scholars, and public servants from economic and trade 
departments and government organs to brief Taiwan businessmen on 
the relevant policies and regulations on a regular basis to 
enable them to further understand Shanghai's investment 
direction and environment. The association will also organize 
many activities to enable Taiwan businessmen to have a more 
colorful and richer life in Shanghai; it will also foster ties 
between Taiwan businessmen and the government, and solve 
difficulties for Taiwan businessmen when they set up enterprises 
and make investments. 
  Zhang Zhiqun finally said that, judged from last year's 
situation, the exchanges between Shanghai and Taiwan played a 
role in promoting economic development in Shanghai. Among the 
foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai, Taiwan-funded 
enterprises now rank second in terms of number of projects, and 
based on last year's success, exchanges and interactions between 
the two places will develop faster and better.

  [Text] Hefei, March 10 (XINHUA) -- The economic corridor 
along the Chang Jiang River has come out of the doldrums and 
become one of China's new growth areas since the country 
launched a large-scale development campaign in the delta two 
years ago. 
  Experts regard the area's economic take-off as a key to 
achieving China's goal to rank among the world's moderately 
developed countries by the mid-21st century. 
  The Chang Jiang flows 6,300 km from the Qinghai-Tibet 
Plateau 
to Shanghai, where it joins the sea. It runs through the seven 
provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and 
Sichuan, which account for 40 percent of the nation's production 
capability and 30 percent of consumer purchasing power. 
  Inspired by the construction of the Pudong New Area in 
Shanghai, the central government set forth an ambitious plan to 
develop the Chang Jiang River Delta in June 1992. 
  Shanghai, the country's biggest city, which is located at 
the 
mouth of the Yangtze, has become the area's economic showcase, 
in the process of regaining its status as the largest trade and 
financial center in the Pacific-Asia region. 
  By 1993, the city's ten newly-established and biggest 
exchanges registered over 1,000 billion yuan in total 
transaction volume. Its indices and quotations have become 
instructive for both domestic and world trade. 
  Shanghai's development seems to display the Chinese 
leadership's firm determination to deepen the country's 15-year 
reform drive and open the country wider to the outside world. 
  If this city, which had fully implemented the central 
planning system since 1950, is successful in its shift to a 
market economy, there is no reason for other cities not to 
follow suit. 
  Another key national project, the ongoing Three Gorges 
water-conservancy project, which started on the upper reaches of 
the Chang Jiang in 1993, has attracted many investors from home 
and abroad to tap its water resources, which equal the total in 
the Commonwealth of Independent States and are 40 percent more 
than the total in the U.S. 
  Now, an industrial modernization campaign is sweeping 
through 
the delta, which has a strong industrial foundation and advanced 
scientific and technological level. 
  The steel corridor, embracing the Baoshan Steel Works Group 
and iron and steel companies in Chongqing, Maanshan and Wuhan, 
has expanded sharply. 
  Car production centers in Shanghai and Wuhan are now under 
construction. 
  The provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui have set a target to 
double their nonferrous metals output. 
  And the hi-tech industry, featuring bioengineering, 
microelectronics and new materials, will facilitate the area's 
development as a whole. 
  The major projects in the region, including those in 
construction and on the drawing board, are expected to pool a 
total of 1,000 billion yuan. 
  With China's policy-makers turning their focus to the area, 
it has also seen a huge influx of foreign investment. 
  In 1993, the area approved over 10,000 foreign-funded 
enterprises, with nearly 10 billion U.S. dollars in promised 
foreign investment. 
  So far, more than 100 big-name conglomerates among the 
world's top 500 have entered the region, especially streaming 
into cities like Shanghai, Wuhan and Chongqing. 
  Large companies from Belgium and Germany, which took the 
lead 
in exploring this market, have recouped their investments, 
prompting many others to follow suit. 
  Experts predicted a bright future for the area under the 
fine 
economic climate nationwide, especially for the forming market 
economy, which is on the fast-track of development.

  [Text] Wuhan, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The shipping capacity of 
the waters at the mouth of the Chang Jiang River could be 
sharply increased if the channels were properly cleared. 
  A group of scientists from Nanjing Shipping Institute and 
the 
Shanghai Navigation Channel Bureau has drawn this conclusion 
after a year's study. 
  Their study found out that if the channels were properly 
dredged, 50,000-ton ships, including fourth-generation container 
vessels, could sail into Shanghai port. 
  By riding the high tide, the scientists said, even 
100,000-ton vessels could reach the port. 
  At present, the water at the river mouth is only seven 
meters 
deep, which allows ships larger than 10,000 tonnage to enter the 
port only by riding the tide, while large container vessels are 
completely denied entrance to the port. 
  This situation is hindering the development of Shanghai, 
Nanjing, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Zhangjiagang and other major ports 
on the Chang Jiang River, said officials from the Chang Jiang 
Navigation Administration. 
  The officials believe that the result of the study will have 
a significant impact on the the development of the Shanghai 
Pudong New area, the Three Gorges power plant and even the whole 
basin of the Chang Jiang River. 
  Preparations to clear the channels will start soon by the 
Shanghai Navigation Channel Bureau, according to the Ministry of 
Communications.

  [Editorial report] A 15-car train arrived in Shanghai from 
the city of Fuyang, in Anhui Province, on 14 February. Onboard 
were 2,850 laborers from outside the municipality, signaling the 
beginning of the spring labor influx. Of this group, most were 
between 20 and 30 years of age, and more than half had never 
left their home villages before. Most will stay in Shanghai, 
while others will head to Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and 
Changshou to seek work. The Shanghai Public Security Department 
already has prepared a number of vehicles to transport laborers 
to other places outside the city, and the Shanghai police have 
strengthened their forces to keep public order.

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] A provincial banking conference opened in 
Hangzhou today. Wan Xueyuan, Chai Songyue, Liu Xirong, Long 
Anding, Zhang Qimei, Xu Zhichun, and other provincial leaders 
attended the conference. 
  Xie Qingjian, president of the provincial people's bank, 
delivered a work report, entitled: "Comprehensively Implement 
the Guidelines on Banking Work To Promote Sustained, Rapid, and 
Healthy Development of Zhejiang's Economy." 
  In his speech, Governor Wan Xueyuan stressed: The year 1994 
is crucial to our efforts to deepen reform and promote 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. 
Governments at all levels and banking departments should show 
concern for, support, and understand each other to create a more 
harmonious environment for economic construction. He urged 
banking departments to give more thought to Zhejiang's 
development and come up with more ideas to perform concrete 
deeds for the benefit of the people in Zhejiang. 
  Chai Songyue, executive vice governor, fully affirmed 
Zhejiang's accomplishments in banking last year. [passage 
omitted] 
  Speaking of this year's banking tasks, Chai Songyue said the 
general requirements of this year's banking work are: While 
strictly controlling the overall credit supply and strengthening 
macroeconomic control, we will press ahead with banking reform 
actively but prudently, do everything possible to raise funds 
for production and construction, continuously optimize credit 
structure, and vigorously increase fund reserves in an effort to 
deepen Zhejiang's reform, open the province wider to the outside 
world, promote a healthy development of its economy, and 
maintain social stability. 
  Chai Songyue emphatically pointed out: Banking departments 
should always uphold the guiding ideology of serving economic 
construction and carry forward the fine traditions of supporting 
local economic construction. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking of strictly controlling loans for fixed assets, 
Chai 
Songyue said: Exercising strict control on investment in fixed 
assets is not a negative policy. It is a positive policy to 
help prevent inflation and optimize economic structure. The 
goal is not control itself; the goal is to help us develop 
better. Specifically, we must do the following: 1) New loans to 
fund fixed asset investment this year are forbidden for starting 
low-standard, duplicate projects. Loans used to finance real 
estate development must be controlled within the mandatory 
targets set by the state. Loans for use as circulating funds 
must not be transferred to investment in fixed assets. 2) New 
loans for investment in fixed assets under the state plan must 
be used to complete key state and provincial projects and to 
meet the funding requirements of newly started projects approved 
by the state and province. Funding requirements for these 
projects must be guaranteed on a priority basis. 3) While 
controlling the size of key construction projects and meeting 
their funding requirements, special efforts must be made to 
support enterprises to carry out technological transformation. 
The proportion of technological transformation loans in the 
total amount of loans extended should be increased. Banks 
should use funds paid back from fixed asset loans to help key 
enterprises carry out technological transformation. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 8 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang 
Province has recently designated some 1.675 million ha -- nearly 
95 percent -- of its farmland as basic agricultural reserves as 
part of its measures to protect agricultural production. 
  Departments involved in agricultural development stipulated 
the reserved land is not allowed to be used for purposes other 
than farming, unless approved by the responsible department. 
  One of the economically developed provinces, Zhejiang 
reported a record 45.6 billion yuan in total agricultural output 
value last year. 
  However, for various reasons, the development of agriculture 
is still being threatened by intensified market competition, 
officials of the department in charge of agriculture said. 
  To bring into play the initiative of farmers in growing 
food, 
the provincial government will also lift the grain purchase 
price, establish a risk fund system, and improve the grain 
reserves and readjustment systems. 
  A host of granaries will be set up along the main roads 
running through the province, to relieve pressures on the 
grain-producing areas as well as make things convenient for 
grain transportation, government officials said. 
  In addition, local governments and financial organizations 
at 
all levels will expand investment in the agricultural sector in 
1994. 
  According to sources from the provincial government, it will 
increase input in agriculture by ten percent this year. 
  A total of more than three billion yuan was invested in the 
agricultural sector in 1993, the sources said. 
  Researchers from the provincial research institutes will 
work 
hard to popularize fine varieties of crops as well as advanced 
planting techniques among farmers throughout the province, to 
help them benefit more from farming activities. 
  Official sources said that the province's cultivated area of 
early rice this year is expected to reach some 871,000 ha.

Guorong (1626 0948 2837): "Zhejiang's Macroeconomic Regulations 
and Control Over Banking Yield Marked Results With an Increase 
in Both Saving Deposits and Currency Withdrawal" -- ZHEJIANG 
RIBAO headline] 
  [Text] Thanks to effective macroeconomic regulations and 
control, last year Zhejiang has turned around its once tight 
financial situation and returned the banking system to normal 
operations. Saving deposits in both urban and rural areas 
across the province increased by 15.014 billion yuan last year, 
an increase of 3.776 billion yuan over 1992, while net currency 
withdrawals of 5.755 billion last year represented a 1.068 
billion yuan increase over 1992. These improvements have lent a 
strong hand to Zhejiang's economic construction. 
  Over the past year, Zhejiang has taken a series of effective 
macroeconomic control measures over the banking sector, singling 
out "wanton fund-raising, borrowing, and investment" for 
rectification. Through such measures as intensifying propaganda 
and guidance, standardizing fund-raising from the public, 
tightening supervision and management, and taking action against 
illegal fund-raising, branches of the People's Bank of China 
throughout the province managed to stabilize credits and sources 
of funds. While conscientiously clearing all illegal loans, 
various financial organizations in the province succeeded in 
recalling 2.1 billion yuan in loans from non-financial 
organizations, or 49.8 percent, and 3.57 billion yuan from 
non-banking financial organizations, or 57.4 percent. In the 
meantime, branches of the People's Bank of China in Zhejiang 
conducted inspections and screenings on 149 economic entities 
run by the bank itself, resulting by the end of last year in the 
withdrawal of all loans extended to them as capital. Twenty- 
six of these economic entities were eventually removed, merged 
with, or transferred to other enterprises; the remainder have no 
more capital, personnel, asset, or financial connections with 
the People's Bank of China. 
  Another effective measure taken by Zhejiang in strengthening 
macroeconomic control over the banking system was the blocking 
of all illegal means and the opening up of proper channels. 
With concentrated efforts to attract savings, banks in Zhejiang 
led other provinces in turning around the declining savings 
situation in China. As of the end of April, savings deposits 
for both urban and rural areas in Zhejiang were still down by 
300 million yuan as compared to the beginning of the year, a 
decrease of 6 billion yuan as compared to the corresponding 
period in 1992. However, things turned around by the end of 
last year, registering an increase of 3.776 billion yuan in 
savings deposits over the previous year. While appropriately 
extending more loans, Zhejiang has adjusted its loan targets so 
that funds will be concentrated to meet the requirements of key 
projects. New bank loans extended to state-owned industries and 
foreign trade last year increased by 13.1 percent and 2.9 
percent respectively over the previous year. No "IOU's" were 
issued in purchasing farm and sideline products. 
  While strengthening macroeconomic control over the banking 
sector, Zhejiang also accelerated the pace of reform of the 
banking structure. Last year saw the incorporation of the 
Ningbo International Bank, the first joint venture between 
Zhejiang Commercial Bank and a wholly foreign-funded bank. With 
the approval of the head office of the People's Bank of China, 
two commercial banks--the Zhongxin Realty Bank's Hangzhou Branch 
and the Pudong Development Bank's Hangzhou Branch--began the 
process of incorporation last year. Simultaneously, a host of 
financial organizations were added throughout the 
province--including the People's Bank of China's county 
branches, Communications Bank office, city credit service, stock 
exchange trading division, and housing loan service--which 
served to enhance the operating capacity of specialized banks 
and functions of international finance. The financial market 
has been developing rapidly with the inauguration of the 
provincial Stock Registration Center and the provincial Stock 
Trading Center, initially forming a financial market system that 
brought the three markets--interbank loans market, stocks 
market, and foreign exchange regulatory market--into one. The 
provincial financing center reported an accumulated transaction 
of 17.09 billion yuan last year, a 67.7 increase over the 
preceding year, while that of foreign exchange regulation 
reached $1.94 billion, a 41.2 percent increase.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 9 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang 
Province will this year place great emphasis on the work of 
establishing a modern enterprise system as well as transforming 
the function of government to further the reform of the economic 
structure. 
  In addition, the province will make efforts to speed up the 
creation of a market system and improve the social insurance 
system as two necessary measures in support of the 
implementation of the major reform program. 
  The outline of reforms was announced recently at the second 
session of the eighth provincial people's congress. 
  Differentiating it from past years, the provincial 
government 
has formulated a series of laws and regulations -- instead just 
issuing political appeals -- to safeguard and boost the 
implementation of the new economic structure, said Lu Wenge, 
chairman of the provincial Commission for Restructuring the 
Economy. 
  As one of the economically developed provinces, Zhejiang is 
currently taking a lead in developing the market economy and 
improving the social insurance system in China. 
  The province has chosen the corporation system as well as 
group management as the breakthrough to be made this year in 
reforming the property rights system of most of its large and 
medium-sized enterprises, sources from the congress said. 
  More than 1,000 state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises will introduce the corporation system in 1994, the 
sources said. 
  The state and collectively-owned small enterprises will be 
at 
the same time revitalized by means of auctions, mergers and 
leasing. 
  According to officials from the provincial government, local 
governments at all levels will this year totally withdraw their 
control over management of enterprises and the allocation of 
resources and will even transfer part of the supervision 
function to some social intermediary organizations. 
  The province has also planned to introduce the market system 
in such fields as investment, finance and foreign currency. 
  It will change all of the existing specialized and 
cooperative banks into commercial banks in the near future. 
Meanwhile, national banks and foreign-funded banks are welcome 
to set up branches in the province, officials of the provincial 
government said. 
  While expanding the current commodity markets, the province 
will also develop the markets of labor, property rights, 
technology, finance and information, in a bid to create good 
conditions for the reform of the enterprise system. 
  The province now has more than 4,000 commodity markets, 
whose 
total transactions were worth some 65.1 billion yuan in 1993. 
  According to sources from the people's congress, the 
province 
will further develop its insurance services for pensions and 
unemployment. 
  As well as covering employees of the state and 
collectively-run enterprises and joint ventures, the sources 
said, the unemployment insurance system would be extended this 
year to employees of all the township enterprises all over the 
province. 
  An integrated pension insurance system will be introduced in 
more than half of the cities and regions in the province, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Ningbo port in East 
China's Zhejiang Province has become one of the country's 
largest with more than 50 million tons of cargo handled annually 
over the last three years. 
  Ningbo port, which consists of beilun port, Zhenhai port and 
old Ningbo port, has docks for crude oil, mineral ore, 
containers and chemicals. With 51 berths capable of handling 
vessels up to 150,000 dwt, its annual handling volume now 
exceeds 50 million tons. 
  In 1993, Ningbo opened routes to Qingdao and Yantai in 
Shandong Province, Northern China. 
  It serves as a transfer terminal for China's largest steel 
and iron complexes in Shanghai, Wuhan and Beijing. 
  Striving to build itself into "the Rotterdam of the East", 
Ningbo has also opened routes to 239 ports in 65 countries and 
regions.

  [Text] Ningbo, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Ningbo City in east 
China's Zhejiang Province has found a new basis for economic 
take-off following its increased contacts with the rest of the 
world. 
  Ningbo, once a renowned trading port from where pottery and 
porcelain ware were transported to other countries for over a 
thousand years, did not take off again until 1984, when it 
became one of the 14 open port cities in China. 
  Since then the port has been exploiting its advantage in 
marine transport and a nearby harbor called Beilun. 
  Dai Longyue, director of the local committee for foreign 
trade, said that an economic and technological development zone 
had been quickly set up, followed by a free trade zone. 
  Imports and exports soared to the present 1.6 billion U.S. 
dollars from 50 million in 1988. 
  Every year, Ningbo holds a number of trade talks and 
commodity fairs with businessmen from all over the world. This 
helped expand the city's overseas market. Its exports now cover 
119 countries and regions, including Arab and African countries. 
  Last year Ningbo imported goods worth 580 million U.S. 
dollars, a 170 percent increase over the year before. 
  Ningbo has a strong connection with families of overseas 
Chinese merchants who went abroad when the city became one of 
the country's five open commercial ports after China lost the 
Opium War in 1840. Now it is forging ahead to build itself into 
"the most important trading port in east China", as charted by 
the central government. 
  It is striving to establish itself as a center connecting 
China's interior and the Chang Jiang River regions with the 
international market, the official said. 
  Work is in full swing to enlarge the handling capacity of 
the 
port. 
  With the growth of trade, foreign capital also poured in. 
Ningbo has 2,088 overseas-funded firms now, with a total 
investment of 4.63 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The Concord Group, a U.S. transnational corporation run by 
overseas Chinese, launched a petrochemical project that includes 
wharfs, a power plant and other support units. 
  In using foreign capital, emphasis is given to renovate old 
enterprises. As many as 1,262 enterprises have been upgraded so 
far. More importantly, such financial aid has turned 
inefficient establishments around and thrust them forward to 
compete in the world market, said Dai. 
  The growing contacts with the rest of the world have 
rekindled Ningbo people's historic abilities to "venture into 
the world and prosper." To date, businessmen from Ningbo, 
including ones from rural and private establishments, have 
formed 61 firms in 25 countries and regions. 
  Dai said that a new Ningbo, with better qualified personnel 
and sharpened market consciousness, was aiming high to emerge as 
a strong competitor on the international market in the near 
future.

Domestic Service in Chinese at 1015 GMT on 16 March transmits a 
service message canceling the following item] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Spring has come early 
to south China where peasants are busily engaged in farming 
activities. A large number of peasants are conducting spring 
plowing in the vast areas of farmland in Guangdong and Guangxi 
Provinces. 
  Even though it rained often and has been cold since the 
beginning of spring, peasants in south Guangdong still adhered 
to their farming timetable; carried out spring plowing; turned 
the soil and harrowed the land; and transplanted rice and sugar 
cane seedlings. 
  According to the Agriculture Ministry's statistics, as of 
early March, Guangdong has completely sown 860,000 mu of paddy 
rice fields, or 57 percent of the total sowing area. Such 
progress was faster than in 1993. Guangdong has improved 6.3 
million mu of farmland, or a third of the total acreage of 
farmland to be improved. Guangdong has planted 8.31 million mu 
of land with spring crops including sugar cane, groundnuts, and 
vegetables, including 2.9 million mu of sugar cane, or 70 
percent of the planned target. 
  It has been learned that various localities in Guangdong 
will 
pay attention to checking wasteland and multiple plowing tasks 
in an effort to ensure the implementation of grain planting 
plans. Many cities and counties will also try in every possible 
way to increase investments in the agricultural sector.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province, 
south China, will place more emphasis on improving its forestry 
ecology in the coming years, government sources said. 
  During the past eight years, almost all the previously 
barren 
hills in the province have been covered with green, two years 
ahead of the provincial government's "ten-year greening 
schedule" initiated in 1985. 
  In the new effort the province plans to plant some 3.33 
million ha [hectare] of ecological woods, which will serve 
purposes such as water and soil conservation, coastal 
windbreaking, nature reserves and forest tourism. 
  The necessary funds will be mainly set aside in the budget 
plan of governments at various levels, but the project will also 
receive money from the state and the general public. 
  Meanwhile, the provincial government has called on local 
authorities to plant more fast-growing trees, exert more efforts 
in processing forestry products and tap forestry tourism 
resources.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Private industry is 
growing fast in south China's Guangdong Province. 
  In 1993, the taxes paid by self-employed households and 
private enterprises in the province reached 4.39 billion yuan, 
up by 12 percent over the previous year and accounting for more 
than 12 percent of the total in the province. 
  In 1979, when China adopted the policies of reforms and 
opening to the outside world, the taxes paid by the private 
sector in Guangdong totalled only about 2 million yuan. 
  Over the past 15 years, Guangdong Provincial Government 
attached great importance to the development of private economy. 
  The province adopted preferential policies in operation 
scope, finance and taxation and credit loans. 
  The bureaus of industry and commerce in all places in the 
province also made efforts to improve conditions for private 
businesses. Last year, the bureaus invested more than 1.1 
billion yuan into construction of 1.95 million square meters of 
market place. 
  In 1993, the number of self-employed households in Guangdong 
reached 1.2 million, with 2.19 million employees, respectively 
increasing by 22.9 and 67.9 percent. 
  The number of private enterprises in the province was 45,900 
with 550,000 employees, increasing by 84.6 and 54.6 percent over 
the previous year. 
  The sales value of the private businesses in Guangdong last 
year was about 42.4 billion yuan. 
  A tendency to form enterprise groups is also growing in the 
private sector. 
  In Huizhou City, there are 32 private enterprise groups. 
  Donghai Corporation, a private enterprise, and Huizhou 
Municipal Government jointly constructed a power plant project. 
  Now the first phase of the project has been completed and 
the 
power plant has gone into operation. 
  The two have now invested 1.3 billion yuan in the second 
phase of the project, which is now under construction. 
  According to Guangdong Provincial Administration of Industry 
and Commerce, the registered funds of self-employed households 
and private enterprises were respectively 10.5 billion and 18.3 
billion yuan in 1993, up by 31.4 and 174 percent over the 
previous year.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Mountainous Zijin 
county in the prosperous southern Chinese province of Guangdong 
is becoming ever more attractive to overseas investors, thanks 
to an improvement in infrastructure. 
  The county, once a revolutionary base noted for its remote 
location, signed more than 80 contracts for joint-venture or 
cooperative projects in 1993, involving more than 1.1 billion 
Hong Kong dollars. 
  The amount of overseas investment in the county last year 
was 
equivalent to the total for the previous 10 years. 
  County official Wang Jingji said that the harsh geographical 
conditions and backward communications used to hold back 
potential investors. 
  The influx of overseas funds in other parts of this booming 
province made the county officials aware that they must spare no 
effort to bolster local infrastructure. 
  Since 1991 the county has mobilized more than 200,000 people 
to upgrade 760 km of highways and build another 270 km of new 
roads to link it up with neighboring counties. 
  It opened automatic switch boards in 1990 and installed 
6,000 
program-controlled telephones in 1992. Eighteen of its 23 towns 
have been brought into the county's network of 
program-controlled telephones. 
  In addition, pagers and mobile cellular phones have also 
been 
introduced into the county. 
  A power plant has been built with an installed capacity of 
30,000 kw to ensure a stable supply of energy. 
  Meanwhile the county has promulgated a set of preferential 
policies to encourage overseas investment. It now holds an 
annual trade and investment fair. 
  The county is currently building an express highway to 
connect it up with the ongoing Beijing-Kowloon railway, five km 
away.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 15 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province is reforming its port services in line with 
international standards and local conditions. 
  This economically booming province has simplified port 
formalities. Instead of making repeated examinations of trucks 
coming in and out at different localities, customs officers only 
check the trucks once, at the Shenzhen crossing point bordering 
Hong Kong. 
  Generally, they will no longer make on-board examinations of 
foreign ships, and they will make only some spot checks on 
tourists. 
  A provincial official in charge of port management said that 
the province officially opened seven first-grade ports and built 
20 second-grade ports last year. 
  Guangdong had 44 first-grade entry and exit ports and 152 
second- grade ports by the end of last year. 
  These ports handled 71.384 million visitors last year, 
111.51 
million tons of cargo and 8.42 million motor vehicles, increases 
of 5.6 percent, 29.9 percent and 10.1 percent over the previous 
year, respectively.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 15 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province has increased investment in basic scientific 
and technological research projects. 
  In the past decade, the province's Scientific Research 
Foundation remained weak due to its position as a frontier 
region. 
  With recent economic development, more and more Guangdong 
residents have come to realize that only on a solid basis of 
scientific research will the economy keep its momentum. 
  In the past three years, the province invested 29.18 million 
yuan in the construction of 11 key laboratories. 
  The province also allocated special funds for the 
transformation of five scientific research institutes and the 
updating of equipment and instruments in another six institutes. 
  Last year, the Guangdong provincial government continued to 
increase investment in basic scientific research programs, and 
it set up Guangdong funds for natural sciences. 
  The increased investment in research institutes has improved 
research conditions. Statistics show that the annual income of 
12 research institutes has exceeded 1 million yuan.

  [Text] Shantou, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Shantou, a coastal 
city of southeast China's Guangdong Province and one of the 
country's five special economic zones, has made advantageous use 
of the growing investment from Taiwan. 
  So far, Shantou boasts a total of 265 Taiwan-invested 
enterprises with 300 million U.S. dollars in capital. Taiwan is 
the second largest among all non-state investors in the city, 
next only to Hong Kong. 
  Greater confidence among investors from Taiwan has enabled 
them to shift investment from the formerly labor-intensive 
shoemaking, leather and food industries to technology-intensive 
fields like electronics, petrochemicals, machinery and 
industrial crafts. 
  For example, equipment for receiving TV programs via 
satellite, individual computers and color video electronic 
keyboards produced by a solely Taiwan-funded technological 
company in Shantou are welcome in markets in Europe and the U.S. 
  Instead of first executing original trial action, many 
Taiwan 
investors have regarded their investment undertakings in Shantou 
as part of long-term development strategies as embodied by the 
expansion of fields involved in and the growth of funds to 
individual projects. 
  More than 10 projects backed by Taiwan investors have cost 
more than 10 million yuan each. 
  The city has also made remarkable progress in introducing 
Taiwan investment to its key infrastructural projects. 
  Four Taiwan-based financial groups have decided to contract 
for the construction of a bridge across the local bay at a cost 
of 1.5 billion yuan. 
  The foundation of a 16-story "Taiwan mansion" funded by 
several Taiwan investors was also laid recently in Shantou.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in south 
China's Guangdong Province are now busy with spring farming. 
  Statistics from local agricultural departments show that by 
early March local farmers had got 420,000 ha of farmland 
levelled for spring farming, one third of the area to be 
levelled. 
  They have transplanted rice seedlings on about 57,333 ha of 
farmland, accounting for more than a half of the planned 
transplanting area and at a faster rate than last year. 
  At the same time, they have also planted 554,000 ha of 
spring 
crops such as sugarcane, peanuts and vegetables, completing 70 
percent of the set plan. 
  To make a success of this year's spring farming, different 
localities had made good preparations and drawn up careful plans 
before the traditional spring festival in early February. 
  Leaders from Shantou city led a working group shortly after 
the spring festival to conduct investigations in rural areas, 
and organized assistance for agricultural production with the 
purpose of making a success of the spring farming and to achieve 
a better grain harvest. The city fulfilled its task of seed 
sowing before March 5. 
  Meanwhile, different localities have also attached great 
importance to the work of including idle farmland in spring 
farming. They have worked out a series of preferential policies 
to encourage farmers to transplant rice seedlings on more idle 
farmland in a bid to fulfill the grain-growing plan.

<F P=106> [By Wang Dongyun (3769 0392 0061) and Lei Weihua (7191 5588 </F>
5478)] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 16 mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chen 
Liuming, director of the Guangdong Provincial Taxation Bureau, 
said at the Provincial Taxation Bureau Directors Conference held 
here that in the past two months, the new taxation system has on 
the whole operated steadily and smoothly in Guangdong and 
initial achievements have been made. 
  Chen Liuming said that in the first two months of this year, 
Guangdong's national economy continued to maintain rapid 
development. Reform of the taxation system caused no big 
fluctuation in commodity prices on the market and revenue from 
taxation continued to grow quite rapidly. By 10 March, the 
accumulated total of industrial and commercial taxes collected 
in Guangdong reached 7.6 billion yuan, 38.5 percent up on the 
same period last year. 
  Talking about recent problems cropping up in the course of 
implementing the new taxation system, Chen Liuming said that the 
tax reduction exemption policies adopted by the central 
authorities and the provincial government before June last year 
and which are not yet due will continue to be implemented until 
1995, and taxes will be collected first and returned later. 
  With regard to returning the increased portion of taxes 
after 
the collection of a turnover tax paid by foreign-invested 
enterprises whose operations were approved before the end of 
last year, he stressed that we should clearly understand that, 
firstly, the increased portion of taxes paid for products or 
labor services at a unified industrial and commercial tax rate 
lower than the existing value-added tax rate and sales tax rate 
should be returned, and the value-added tax rate should be 
converted according to unified taxes included in the calculated 
prices. Secondly, regarding goods purchased by enterprises 
without legal proof of tax reduction, the calculation of a 
specific amount of tax payments for return should first be based 
on the actual prime cost and the tax rate suited to the 
value-added tax, and this portion should be deducted from the 
amount of tax to be returned.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Rows of modern 
two-story buildings are mushrooming in the rural areas of 
Guangdong, an economically booming province in south China. 
  A survey report shows that more than 60 percent of the 12 
million rural households in Guangdong, with a combined 
population of 50 million, have moved into such buildings over 
the past 15 years. 
  The living space of Guangdong's rural residents now averages 
12.71 sq m, one third more than that for urban residents. 
  Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, took the lead in China's 
national reform and opening further to the outside world. 
  Benefiting from the reform and open-up policy, farmers have 
invested more in production and consequently improved their 
living conditions. 
  By the end of 1993, villages and rural towns had built 
dwelling houses with a total floor space of 1.1 billion sq m.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The 
Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Line, which was disrupted late last 
night by a small landslide, resumed service in one direction 
tonight. 
  The other track will be restored early tomorrow morning, 
railway officials said. 
  The line was blocked by a huge pile of earth, whose movement 
was caused by heavy rain. 
  Sources said that by 21:00 hours (Beijing time) today 
traffic 
had resumed on the Shenzhen-Guangzhou track. The 
Guangzhou-Shenzhen track is expected to be back in operation 
tomorrow morning at 6:00. 
  The slide happened at 22:54 hours on Monday [14 March], when 
the driver of a goods train, going at 45 km per hour, spotted a 
moving fog-like object. He made an emergency stop and found a 
10- meter-high mass of earth was rolling down, covering the 
whole locomotive. The driver crawled out and found an even 
bigger pile of mud in front of the train. No-one was hurt. 
  More than 1,000 people equipped with earth-moving machinery 
were immediately dispatched to the site to remove the blockage, 
according to the sources. 
  Officials said that at least 30 passenger trains and 26 
goods 
trains in each direction were canceled.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 12 (XINHUA) -- A fast 
three-dimensional transport and telecom network has taken 
initial shape in south China's booming city of Shenzhen. 
  Over the past 14 years, Shenzhen's transport and telecom 
industry has kept up with the pace of its fast-increasing 
economy. 
  In 1993, the city planned 224 major projects for 
transportation and telecommunications, with a total investment 
of 2.43 billion yuan plus 72.8 million U.S. dollars. 
  The gross volume for freight transportation handled in 1993 
topped 7.4 billion tons/km, and over 4.7 billion persons/km for 
passenger transport, sturdy rises of 36.3 percent and 16.6 
percent from the previous year, respectively. The transit of 
passengers by air hit 2.55 million people, an increase of 53.5 
percent. 
  The total output value of the posts and telecommunications 
sector jumped by 47.5 percent to 1.74 billion yuan. 
  Shenzhen also gained ground in infrastructural construction, 
including the building of an airport, seaports, highways and 
railways. 
  Port construction such as that on Yantian Port also gained 
momentum last year. The first phase of the Yantian Port 
construction, an overseas-funded project with a total investment 
of nearly four billion yuan, is now in its final stage. And the 
contract for the second phase also has been signed. 
  So far, the roadbed for the Meilin-Guanlan Expressway has 
been completed, and the northern section of the district's fast 
ring road has been opened to traffic. The construction of 
another expressway from Shenzhen airport to Heao is expected to 
be started soon, while that of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Expressway 
is in its final stage. 
  The city also set up five new district telephone exchange 
branches and about 10 post offices in 1993. It also built and 
expanded 31 wireless telephone stations last year. 
  Now in Shenzhen, there are 38 bus-lines, over one thousand 
buses and some 20,000 taxi cabs. 
  The city airport has opened 47 air routes to 46 big cities. 
  According to a city transportation official, the city 
government is planning to build Shenzhen into an international 
passenger and freight transportation hub. 
  He says the focus will be on establishment of some trans- 
professional, trans-regional and transnational transport and 
telecommunications group companies to boost the booming industry. 
  The official predicts that the passenger and freight 
transportation this year will rise to 112.3 million people and 
23 million tons respectively. The port throughput in 1994 will 
double the figure of 25.4 million tons last year. 
  The total output value in the posts and telecommunications 
sector is expected to hit over two billion yuan this year, says 
the official.

<F P=106> [By China Editor Cary Huang in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] A senior central bank official has hinted that 
Beijing will allow the Hong Kong dollar to circulate in the 
special economic zones (SEZ) bordering Hong Kong and Macao. The 
decision--which seemingly contradicts China's basic policy of 
banning foreign currency from circulation in China--is to 
facilitate the increasing number of economic transactions 
between border-based businesses, said deputy governor of the 
People's Bank of China Zhou Zhengqing. Mr Zhou did not give 
details of the proposals. According to Chinese sources, the 
decision was made last year, but was not disclosed due to the 
sensitive nature of the plan. 
  The People's Bank of China will work out measures to ease 
problems faced by businesses in Shenzhen and Zhuhai SEZ, when 
following the policy of allowing no foreign currency to 
circulate in China, Mr Zhou said. He reiterated that Beijing 
could not allow circulation, pricing, settlement and transition 
of foreign currency in its territory. However, Shenzhen SEZ may 
be an exception, he said, pointing to the fact that circulation 
of the Hong Kong dollar existed, following rapid development of 
business exchanges between the neighbouring communities. 
  "As for the SEZ of Shenzhen it has carried out a lot of 
economic exchanges with Hong Kong and Macao. When implementing 
the policy it has come across some specific problems and for 
those specific problems, we will work out specific measures to 
find solutions to them," Mr Zhou told a press conference 
convened by the second session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress yesterday. He said the basic principle for such 
measures was to facilitate economic development in Hong Kong. 
  Another senior central bank official said Beijing was 
against 
China-funded companies in Hong Kong speculating on the property 
markets. "China is a country short of foreign exchanges and 
funds, so we are against the practice by some companies who are 
carrying out speculative activities in the real estate industry 
in Hong Kong," deputy governor Chen Yuan, the son of powerful 
party elder Chen Yun, said at the conference.

  [Text] In 1993, nonferrous metals industry in our region 
increased its production output, output value, and profits and 
tax by a large margin. Production output of ten kinds of 
nonferrous metal, including copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, tin, 
and beryllium, among others, was 49.46 percent higher than in 
1992 and was higher than the 40 percent average national growth 
level of the industry. The contents of six kinds of metal -- 
copper, lead, zinc, tin, beryllium, and mercury -- increased by 
25.21 percent. The total industrial production output value of 
the nonferrous metals industry registered a 32.41 percent, and 
its industrial sale output value increased by 47.5 percent. Its 
total profits and tax increased by 48.37 percent. 
  In 1993, the local nonferrous metals industry in our region 
developed very rapidly. First, this was mainly due to the 
efforts of workers and staff members in the industry to 
conscientiously implement the spirit of the 14th CPC National 
Congress, deepen reform, and grasp well the transformation of 
enterprises' operational mechanisms. Taking the market as a 
guide, they took active measures to adjust the product mix to 
invigorate their enterprises. Second, the nonferrous metals 
industry in our region relied on scientific and technological 
progress to increase enterprises' competitiveness. In 1993, 
seven nonferrous metals projects won scientific and 
technological progress awards, gold medals issued by scientific 
achievements exhibition, and new star awards. Third, the 
industry seized a fine opportunity to accelerate its 
development. It made great efforts to increase investment, 
accelerate the speed of construction, and increase efficiency. 
Last year, the entire industry's investment in capital 
construction projects and technical transformation totaled more 
than 400 million yuan.

  [Text] Haikou, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese veteran leader 
Yang Shangkun has called on Hainan Province to seek 
opportunities to develop itself by making full use of its 
advantages. 
  During his recent visit to the island, he urged local 
officials to build well the country's largest special economic 
zone. 
  Hainan is also China's second largest island after Taiwan. 
  From March 9 to 15, the 87-year-old Yang, accompanied by 
Hainan provincial leaders, inspected an international airport 
now still under construction in Sanya, a tourist attraction, and 
a farm for returned overseas Chinese at Xinglong. 
  At Haikou, the provincial capital, Yang visited two Taiwan 
funded companies and hoped Taiwan investment to increase on the 
island. 
  This was Yang's fourth inspection of Hainan. He said every 
time he was surprised by the island's great changes in urban 
outlook and economic and cultural development. 
  He encouraged Hainan's residents to concentrate on building 
up infrastructural facilities, for transportation in particular, 
and make proper arrangements of its urban development and 
industrial locations so as to develop the provincial economy and 
social undertakings in a coordinated way.

  [Text] Haikou, March 18 (XINHUA) -- An international 
airport is being built at Sanya, a tourism resort in south 
China's Hainan Province. The island airport is scheduled to go 
into operation on July 1 this year. 
  The airport is 15 km from Sanya City and 17 km from the sea. 
As the airport's radar system can cover the South China Sea 
area and even the high seas, the airport may become one of the 
aviation administration centers for the South-East Asian area. 
  Some of the airport equipment is imported and of the most 
advanced kind in the world. After its first stage is completed, 
the airport will be able to handle about one million passengers 
per year. 
  When the island in 1988 got State Council approval as a 
province and a special economic zone, it set tourism as its 
leading industry. But transport shortcomings have been holding 
back the development of its tourism industry.

for CPPCC work under the socialist market economy. 
  Chairman Lin Yinghai stated: The CPPCC work under the 
socialist market economy is a completely new topic. We should 
constantly carry out experiments, make painstaking efforts, and 
be fully enthusiastic and ready to work in a down-to-earth 
manner. As long as we work hard, seek truth from facts, remain 
pragmatic, strive to make Henan prosperous, and unceasingly 
press ahead with the work, we will certainly be able to push 
Henan's CPPCC work onto a new stage under the socialist market 
economy. 
  In conclusion, Vice Chairwoman Liu Yujie declared: The 
Second Session of the Seventh Henan Provincial CPPCC Committee 
has now come to a successful close!

  [Text] Yichang, March 12 (XINHUA) -- With preparations 
intensifying for the construction of the Three-Gorges water 
control project in the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang, a 
share-holding company will be set up to take charge of the 
planned Three-Gorges International Airport. 
  With a total investment of 400 million yuan, the limited 
company will be jointly funded by the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China, China Chang Jiang Three-Gorges Project 
Development Corporation, Hubei Provincial Government and Yichang 
city government. 
  Now Yichang city on the bank of the river is becoming more 
and more conspicuous with the Three-Gorges project going on, and 
the number of overseas businessmen and tourists is on the rise. 
  But since there is no airport in Yichang, transportation 
connections are not easy for Chinese and foreign visitors. 
  The Chinese Government has decided to construct an 
international airport to meet the demands of the construction of 
the Three-Gorges project. 
  The runway for the planned airport is 2,600 meters in length 
and 45 meters in width. The terminal building and waiting room, 
with a floor space of 12,000 square meters, is designed to 
handle 1.4 million passengers a year. 
  The airport will receive Boeing 737, 757, 767 and 747-SP 
airliners. 
  Early this year, Premier Li Peng called a meeting to study 
the issue for the construction of the airport at Yichang. 
  The airport project is expected to be completed at the end 
of 
1995.

  [Text] Yichang, March 14 (XINHUA) -- The mammoth three 
gorges reservoir project now being undertaken on the upper 
reaches of the Chang Jiang will help improve the water quality 
in the middle and lower reaches, according to environmentalists. 
  When the retained water is discharged from the reservoir in 
the dry seasons the extra flow will wash pollutants downstream. 
  Experts on water resources protection came to this 
conclusion 
after three years of on-the-spot investigation. 
  They said the effect is apparent in the section from the 
reservoir site near Yichang to Wuhan, the capital of central 
China's Hubei Province. 
  They started the research in 1990 in four selected sections

  [Text] Changsha, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hunan 
Province will continue efforts on its infrastructural projects 
this year. 
  The province will invest 14.5 billion yuan in 24 projects, 
including nine communications and transportation projects, four 
industrial energy projects and two telecommunications projects. 
  Last year, Hunan Province, a traditional agricultural 
province, decided to focus on investing in infrastructural 
projects so as to enhance its weak industrial basis. 
  In the middle of the year, a deficiency of funds became a 
big 
problem to the province. The provincial government adopted 
effective measures to ensure the construction of these capital 
projects. 
  By the end of 1993, the province had invested 5.76 billion 
yuan in infrastructural projects, 240 million yuan more than 
anticipated, and the province had completed six projects 
including Dayong Airport and a bridge in Xiangtan city. 
  This year, Hunan Province will adopt a series of 
fund-collection policies including issuing bonds and selling 
stocks, using foreign investment to provide funds for the 
construction of the capital projects.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Closing The Power Gap"] </F>
  [Text] Central China's Hunan Province, where the shortage 
of electricity restrains economic growth, is inviting overseas 
investment and cooperation in building power stations. 
  Several power plants, including three 1.2 million-kilowatt 
stations in Xiangtan, Wangcheng and Yiyang, have been approved 
by the province's Power Industry Bureau for overseas 
co-operation. 
  The bureau has also set up a special working group to raise 
foreign capital. 
  Officials with the bureau said investors from Germany, 
Sweden, Australia, France, Britain, Canada, the United States 
and Hong Kong show strong interest in investing in Hunan's power 
industry. 
  The New Xiangtan Power Station is expected to cooperate with 
investors from Sweden, and a German company is negotiating with 
the bureau for construction of the Wangcheng Power Plant. 
  Last year, TIME Engineering Berhad, a member of the 
Malaysian 
Renong Group, signed a contract with Lianyuan city to construct 
a 250-megawatt coal-fired power station in the city. 
  Total investment for that project was put at $230 million. 
  Wu Haichun, general manager of the province's Power Industry 
Corp, admitted that Hunan has one of the country's worst 
shortages of electricity, but he promised that the province will 
make big progress this year. By the end of 1993, the province 
had installed capacity of 6.58 million kilowatts, double the 
figure in 1980. 
  However, its per capita consumption of electricity is only 
60 
per cent of the national average. 
  Wu said that from l994 to 2000, the province plans to 
install 
another 9 million kilowatts of capacity, of which 7 million will 
be thermal and 2 million hydropower. 
  But to do that, Hunan needs 30 billion yuan ($3.45 billion). 
  Wu said the province will use various methods to raise the 
capital. 
  To expand the government's fund for electrical investment, 
the province is expected to raise electricity prices this year. 
  It also plans to raise money from the securities market by 
converting power enterprises into shareholding companies. 
  Hunan Huayin Power Co Ltd, the province's first shareholding 
power company, was established last year and is expected to go 
public. 
  The company has issued shares worth 288 million yuan ($33 
million), and most of the money raised will be used to renovate 
the Zhuzhou Power Plant. 
  The province also plans to invest 2.75 billion yuan ($315 
million) in electrical construction this year, compared with 
1.71 billion yuan ($191 million) last year.

  [Text] Yesterday morning [1 March], Sichuan Provincial CPC 
Secretary Xie Shijie delivered an important speech at a 
provincial propaganda and ideological work meeting. He pointed 
out: It is imperative for us to seize on the fine opportunity, 
take a realistic approach, blaze new trails, work in an honest 
and clean manner, and explore the way forward. We must make 
efforts to enhance the level of propaganda and ideological work 
to a new height to make a real contribution to our province's 
reform and opening up and to the building of the two 
civilizations. 
  Xie Shijie stressed: Since the publication of the remarks by 
Comrade Xiaoping during his southern tour, and the convening of 
the 14th CPC National Congress, reform, opening up, and 
modernization in our country have entered a new stage of 
development. The new situation has set new and higher demands 
and tasks on our propaganda and ideological work. We must 
attach importance to propaganda and ideological work and truly 
improve and strengthen it to meet the demands of the new 
situation. 
  Comrade Xie Shijie continued: At present, the main guiding 
principle of propaganda and ideological work has been defined. 
The key lies in implementing it. First, we must further carry 
out the task of arming the entire party with the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Second, we 
must stick to the guidance thinking of maintaining stability, 
rousing people's drive, and promoting reform and development to 
guide the trends of public opinion properly. Third, we must 
strengthen ideological and moral education to do well in 
building spiritual civilization in addition to persistently 
pursuing education on professionalism and social ethics. Taking 
the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristic as 
a guide, and proceeding from practical reality on the various 
fronts, we must explore a unique way of conducting propaganda 
and ideological work. Fourth, we must uphold the guiding 
principle of serving the people and socialism and the 
double-hundred policy to create prosperous socialist literature 
and art. Fifth, we must further strengthen foreign-related 
propaganda work to actively promote cultural exchanges with 
foreign countries exalting the image of opening up. 
  In his speech, Comrade Xie Shijie emphasized: Party 
organizations at all levels in our province must strengthen 
their leadership over propaganda and ideological work. They 
must devote their main efforts to doing a good job in the 
following aspects: 
  1. Increasing the ideological understanding of leaders at 
all levels to constantly enhance their consciousness of grasping 
things with two hands to truly strengthen the building on the 
various propaganda and ideological fronts and enhance the 
political and professional quality of our propaganda and 
ideological workers. 
  2. Actively promoting structural reform on the propaganda 
and ideological fronts to bring about prosperous development of 
the propaganda and cultural undertakings. 
  3. Conscientiously implementing a new policy for propaganda 
and cultural work and gradually increasing the investment in 
propaganda and cultural undertakings. 
  4. Truly properly grasping planning work to promote 
coordinated development of the two civilizations.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 11 (XINHUA) -- As the country's first 
province to implement trial reform in the transfer of property 
rights of enterprises, southwest China's Sichuan has greatly 
benefited from the step. 
  The provincial government reported that 1,000-plus local 
enterprises that used to operate at a loss have gained new 
vitality, and consequently 2.3-billion-yuan-worth of idle assets 
have been put to use again. 
  In 1993 alone 408 enterprises in Sichuan eliminated losses 
and began to create profits after their property rights were 
transfered. 
  To further expand the reform of property rights, governments 
at all levels have somewhat relaxed the relevant restrictions to 
permit the sale of a certain amount of state-owned assets. 
  Known as the "Sichuan model", the province's experience in 
transfer of property rights distinctly features careful planning 
and good organization. 
  Property rights exchange centers have been established to 
stimulate and supervise the annexing, sale, leasing and auction 
of the property of state-owned and collective enterprises. 
  Frequent property rights fairs are held and the latest 
information is released in time to boost the healthy and active 
activities of local property rights markets. 
  In June last year the Sichuan Provincial Government listed 
16 
small and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to be sold to 
foreign buyers during trade talks held in Hong Kong.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 11 (XINHUA) -- The Longquanyi 
Agricultural High-Tech Development Zone in Chengdu, capital of 
southwest China's Sichuan Province, has seen the first dawn of 
success since being launched a year ago. 
  Local sources said the average income of farmers in 14 
villages within the zone increased by 142 yuan to reach 1,092 
yuan in 1993. 
  In some villages, the income of each farmer exceeded 4,000 
yuan, the sources said. 
  A total 17.51 million yuan was put into the zone in 1993 to 
finance 12 agricultural high-tech projects. 
  Model farms of fruit, vegetables, aquatic products and 
edible 
fungus have been set up under these projects. They involve more 
than 100 new farm species and 18 new processing technologies. 
  A technological service network covering the whole zone and 
100 professional societies have been established. They provide 
farmers with technological services as well as market 
information, the sources said. 
  Based on detailed investigations, the zone has chosen to 
develop grass-eating cows, sheep and geese instead of 
grain-consuming pigs, and rare fruit with better market 
prospects.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 11 (XINHUA) -- A housing development 
project, funded by a loan from the World Bank, has been launched 
here in the capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province. 
  The project will use a 76 million U.S. dollar loan from the 
World Bank, part of the 500 million U.S. dollar loan supplied by 
the World Bank for the 1993-1995 fiscal year to help China 
reform its housing and social security systems. 
  Under the project, a stock company for housing development 
has been formed between the Chengdu Seamless Stainless Steel 
Tube Factory, the Jinjiang Motor Factory, altogether 13 large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and two government 
bodies, with a total of 50,000 employees. 
  According to the agreement, housing for these participants 
totalling 600,000 square meters in floor space will be owned and 
managed by the new company. 
  The new company will combine housing rentals with loans from 
the World Bank for housing development to relieve participants 
from housing problems and help them improve their operation 
mechanism, official sources said. 
  To raise more funds, the new company will raise the 
per-square-meter-floor-space rent to 7.5 yuan for existing 
housing and 10 yuan for new homes. The selling price for each 
square meter of floor space will be 1,050 yuan, only slightly 
higher than the costs, according to the sources. 
  Sharing the 500 million U.S. dollar loan from the World Bank 
are four other cities, including Beijing, Yantai, Ningbo and 
Guanghan.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Correctly Understand Relations Between Reform, </F>
Development, and Stability"] 
  [Text] At present, Sichuan, like various parts of the 
country, is experiencing economic development, political 
stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress. The 
situation is favorable as a whole. To fulfill this year's fixed 
target of the whole province establishing the socialist market 
economic system, and maintaining sustained, rapid and healthy 
development of the national economy, a very important issue 
facing us is that we must continue to handle relations between 
reform, development and stability well. 
  Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "We are carrying out 
the four modernizations program, reform, and opening up. 
Stability is a key factor." There is no doubt that continuing 
to maintain stability is a prerequisite for developing the 
present favorable situation and guaranteeing the successful 
completion of various tasks this year. However, after summing 
up our own experiences, and reviewing the situation in various 
provinces and cities throughout the country, we realize that to 
maintain stability, long-term stability in particular, and to 
speed up development is most fundamental and significant. The 
present reform has concerned the redistribution of power and 
benefits. It is also an issue which concerns vital interests of 
people in various circles. To solve these problems well, we 
need practical and good policies and methods. Necessary 
economic strength is also indispensable. For instance, it is 
absolutely necessary to establish a sound social security 
system. However, the task can only be eventually accomplished 
with the continuous increasing of the economic bearing capacity 
of enterprises and individuals. To completely solve the problem 
of enterprises running the society, so that fluctuation can be 
reduce or avoided in the work of establishing a modern 
enterprise system, it is, under most circumstances, necessary to 
inject a fairly large amount of funds into the society to enable 
reform in production relations to coincide with the development 
of productive forces. With regard to the issue of providing an 
outlet for the vast rural surplus labor force, furnishing 
employment in cities, speeding up economic development, 
improving the economy and people's livelihood in areas inhabited 
by minority nationalities and impoverished areas, lightening 
peasant burdens, and doing work to further lessen and eliminate 
factors which might affect stability and unity, necessary 
material guarantee is equally indispensable. It is obvious that, 
in a certain sense, without development it is impossible to 
maintain stability. In the meantime, it should be thoughtfully 
noted that the present reform and economic development need a 
stable social environment. If the society in not stable, reform 
and development can only be an empty talk. Therefore, we must 
not use a negative viewpoint of advocating stability for 
stability's sake to comprehend stability. We must understand 
that as far as Sichuan, a fairly backward big province, is 
concerned, its economy must develop faster. It is impossible to 
always go about things quietly and steadily. With regard to the 
issue of development, we must on no account be overcautious, or 
refrain from doing something necessary for fear of a slight 
risk. On the contrary, we must emancipate our minds and have 
our hands and feet unfettered. In places where conditions 
exist, we must do our utmost to promote faster development under 
the prerequisite of attaching importance to efficiency and 
quality. In the meantime, in the course of development, we must 
pay attention to discovering problems and solving them promptly 
and properly, so that our economy can advance to a new height as 
quickly as possible. To do so, it is beneficial not only to 
fulfilling our province's second-step strategic target three 
years ahead of time, but also to maintaining long-term stability 
of the whole society. Experiences of developed coastal areas 
have proved that as long as our economy has been developed, and 
that we have more goods on hand, we will have the initiative in 
handling various kinds of conflicts and problems. We can thus 
maintain stability with assurance. 
  To speed up development, what is most important is to seize 
on fine opportunities, and deepen reforms. The present 
international and domestic environment is favorable to us. The 
state has put the project of speeding up the development in the 
central and western regions and accelerating resource 
exploitation in western region on the important agenda. There 
are preferential policies for us. Some powerful foreign 
businessmen have treated the Sichuan market favorably. There is 
good momentum for the development of Sichuan's economy. We must 
seize on this favorable opportunity which is hard to come by in 
history, and proceed from Sichuan's practical reality to speed 
up the pace of reform in accordance with the requirements of 
making unified plans, giving an overall impetus, making a major 
breakthrough, and pursuing division of labor with individual 
responsibility. We must make a big step in establishing and 
improving the socialist market economic system to further 
emancipate productive forces fettered by the old system, and 
further arouse the enthusiasm of millions upon millions of the 
masses in socialist modernization and construction. This has 
demanded that party and government leaders at all levels 
throughout the province must further emancipate their minds, and 
inspire their enthusiasm to lead people of the whole province to 
unite as one, struggle hard, explore the way forward, and 
successfully accomplish tasks set by the central authorities, 
and the second session of our Eighth Provincial People's 
Congress as well, to make new contributions to Sichuan's 
development. If we fail to do so, if we separate stability from 
reform and development, or even set them against each other, if 
we hesitate, or take a wait-and-see attitude, we are liable to 
lose the favorable opportunity, and delay the great cause of 
reform and opening up. Social stability will eventually be 
affected. 
  In a word, our comrades must, at all times, never forget 
that 
"development is the last word." They must never forget that the 
aim of deepening reform, expanding opening up, and maintaining 
stability is to accelerate development. Only by understanding 
and handling dialectical relations between reform, development 
and stability in this way can there be a guarantee for our 
province's more prosperous economy and more thorough social 
stability.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Sichuan Province in 
southwest China has made marked progress in preventing and 
curing endemic diseases, using foreign loans, local officials 
said. 
  According to officials at the provincial office for endemic 
disease prevention and cure, the local incidence rate of snail 
fever has dropped from 4.41 percent three years ago to the 
present 1.07 percent, and its incidence rate among cattle has 
plummeted from 10.6 percent to 3.5 percent. 
  The officials said the work was boosted with the aid of 
World 
Bank loans, which the province began to use last year to bring 
snail fever under control. 
  During the past year, the province has been organizing 
specialists to spread knowledge in 41 counties on health care 
education, disease statistics, and supervision and treatment of 
endemic diseases. 
  The province is also promoting a comprehensive plan which 
involves boosting local economy and optimizing agricultural 
production. 
  On the other hand, scientific researchers have found more 
effective ways to check the spread of endemic diseases. 
  In addition, the officials revealed, people in 63 percent of 
the counties infested with endemic diseases are eating 
iodine-bearing salt. 
  The incidence rate of malaria has dropped by 54 percent 
compared with the previous year, and the spread of other 
diseases such as endemic fluorosis, keshan disease and 
osteoarthrosis deformans endemica has been checked, local 
officials said.

<F P=106> [By Liang Dangzeng (4731 8093 1073) and Zhang Tao (1728 </F>
3447): "Make Meticulous Efforts To Ensure Tax Revenue -- An 
Interview With Director Ci Nuo (2945 6179) of the Regional 
Taxation Bureau"] 
  [Text] When the regional taxation work conference was in 
session, the reporters requested an interview with Director Ci 
Nuo of the Regional Taxation Bureau. The director, a 
cool-headed and fast-talking official, readily consented. 
"Thanks to the kind attention and support of the regional party 
committee and regional government as well as relevant 
departments, and through the joint efforts of all tax officers, 
Tibet has carried out tax reform in an orderly way and achieved 
some initial success," said the director with a big smile. He 
pointed out: Last year Tibet collected a record 210 million 
yuan in tax revenue. Despite this gratifying achievement, we 
should not be optimistic. We have to work still harder in order 
to keep our tax reform in step with the reform of the economic 
structure nationwide. 
  The director said: The ongoing reform of the industrial and 
commercial tax system is an important measure aimed at meeting 
the requirements for establishing a socialist market economic 
structure and introducing separate central and local taxation 
systems. Tibet's existing industrial and commercial tax system 
was generally based on the structure and mode of industrial and 
commercial consolidated tax from the fifties. While the 
national tax system has already undergone major changes on 
several occasions, only minor changes were implemented in the 
regional system. As a result, the system in Tibet was confusing 
for laymen and experts alike. The system, which is neither 
rational nor standardized, was divorced from the national tax 
system and hindered Tibet's participation in the nationally 
unified market and international economic activities. In order 
to make tax reform a success, the Regional Taxation Bureau began 
preparations for drafting a regional tax reform program last 
July by organizing tax officers to go down to grass-roots units 
to investigate the results of experimentation with separate tax 
systems at selected enterprises as well as tax burdens of 
individual industrial and commercial units. After in-depth and 
systematic analyses of the investigation results and a dozen 
revisions of the draft with arduous efforts for several months, 
a regional tax reform program was produced. 
  When asked by the reporters about the features of the 
regional taxation reform, the director spoke with fervor and 
assurance: 1) While sticking to the basic framework of national 
tax reform, the regional program has made appropriate 
adaptations in light of Tibet's realities, specifically 
differing in terms of the scope of individual tax categories; 
postponing, retaining, and canceling tax categories; expenses 
and deductions; taxable amounts and tax rates; and tax 
reductions and exemptions. The number of tax categories has 
been cut back by 50 percent from 18 to nine to show special 
consideration for the ethnic region. 2) After reform, the tax 
categories are more in line with the requirements for 
establishing a socialist market economy. For example, the 
existing industrial and commercial tax is separated; state 
enterprises are required to pay taxes plus a percentage of 
profits; income tax rates for enterprises are lowered; the 
regulatory tax and collection of funds for construction of 
energy and transportation projects are cancelled; and the 
original individual income tax, individual income regulatory 
tax, and individual industrial and commercial household tax are 
merged as one individual income tax, which is levied on every 
member of society. Furthermore, the scope of resource tax is 
broadened; and the original wool and woolen fabric purchase tax 
is expanded to cover animal products and timber, medicinal 
herbs, and other farm, forestry, and animal husbandry products. 
These reform measures can promote fair competition and meet the 
requirements of market economy. 3) Under the new tax system, 
though the number of taxable items has increased, the original 
preferential policies are retained. As a result, the overall 
tax burden remains the same, thus ensuring the vested interests 
of peasants and herdsmen. By not adding even the slightest tax 
burden on peasants and herdsmen at large, the tax reform program 
reflects the feature of broad-range but low-rate taxation 
system. 4) The new tax system reflects the continuity of some 
previous preferential policies. The regional government's 
preferential treatments to foreign-funded enterprises remain 
unchanged; and except for a few items, tax exemptions for 
private enterprises and individual industrial and commercial 
units set up by peasants and herdsmen as well as village and 
town enterprises in farming and pastoral areas will continue 
until the end of this century. Tax reductions and exemptions 
will continue to be granted to urban collectively-owned 
productive and processing enterprises; to collective enterprises 
set up by surplus personnel, disabled people, and the aged; and 
to certain qualified enterprises of tertiary industry. 5) As a 
result of the tax reform, the regional people's government has 
granted some benefits to prefectures, cities, and counties, 
thereby readjusting their financial revenue structure and 
building up their capability to become financially 
self-sufficient. As the reporters wound up the interview, 
Director Ci Nuo declared with confidence: "So long as all tax 
officers heighten their spirits, the new tax system can be 
smoothly implemented in Tibet."

  [Text] Lhasa, March 13 (XINHUA) -- China's Tibet Autonomous 
Region has maintained steady economic growth thanks to its 
efforts in legislative work. 
  The region has issued a total of 52 laws and regulations in 
line with local conditions since 1978, safeguarding its economic 
development, according to an official from the Standing 
Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress. 
  Tibet, one of the five autonomous regions in China, has been 
given full minority nationality autonomy to make laws and carry 
out the country's laws and regulations in line with its own 
conditions. 
  The 52 new laws and regulations cover politics, economy, 
culture, education, science and technology, and nationality and 
religious affairs. 
  A law adopted in 1990 on mining has protected the region's 
mineral resources against being excessively mined by collective 
enterprises and private mining households. 
  Regulations formulated in 1992 on environmental protection 
have put one-quarter of the region's areas under the region's 
protection. 
  Meanwhile, the Tibetan Autonomous Region has also revised or 
terminated laws which no longer suit the region's opening-up and 
growing economy.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 18 (XINHUA) -- China's Tibet Autonomous 
Region expanded ties with the coastal regions and introduced 
more foreign investment in 1993, as it joined wholeheartedly in 
the nation's modernization drive. 
  According to statistics, Tibet approved 41 co-operation 
projects with other parts of China and overseas countries and 
regions last year, introducing more than 100 million yuan (about 
11.5 million U.S. dollars) in contractual investment. 
  Officials said that the projects are mainly in the sectors 
of 
communications, transportation, light industry, textiles, 
machinery, electronics, commerce and trade. 
  Last year, Tibet also received a total of 40 million U.S. 
dollars in loans from the United Nations, foreign governments 
and civilian organizations for some 30 of its development 
projects. 
  The autonomous region's foreign trade hit a record 100 
million U.S. dollars-worth in 1993. 
  The officials said that Tibet has in recent years set up a 
group of showcase enterprises in coastal areas, such as Hainan 
Province and Tianjin and Shenzhen cities, in a bid to get aboard 
the country's bandwagon of economic take-off. 
  The region has meanwhile launched a campaign to open up and 
expand economic and trade relations with neighboring countries. 
It has promulgated a set of policies to attract and regulate 
foreign investment. 
  Starting in 1992, investors from Hong Kong, the United 
States, Japan, Germany, Nepal and Malaysia have flocked to this 
once- neglected but promising region in southwest China. 
  The officials said that some of the projects have gone into 
production and begun showing profits, while others are still 
under construction. 
  They said that more than 20 of China's provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions have established economic 
ties with Tibet, pouring in more than 100 million yuan (about 
11.5 million U.S. dollars) every year. In addition, they have 
set up economic entities in Tibet. 
  Experts say that the ever-increasing ties between Tibet and 
the rest of the country as well as the outside world has in part 
eased a decades-long fund shortage and introduced technology, 
management and information, which, in turn, have pumped vigor 
into the Tibetan economy.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region is focusing on the development of livestock farming by 
accelerating the construction of infrastructural facilities. 
  Zhao Zhongling, director of the Bureau of Tibet Livestock 
Farming, said that last year, meat output in the sector reached 
100 million kilograms and dairy products, 185 million kilograms, 
respectively increasing by 6.77 and 5.38 percent over 1980. 
  He said that wool output reached a record 8.9 million 
kilograms. 
  As one of the five major livestock producing regions in 
China, Tibet has 22.8 million head of cattle including yaks and 
sheep. 
  There are about 82 million hectares of grassland in Tibet 
with about 52 million hectares of grassland available for cattle. 
  He said that since Tibet popularized scientific methods of 
breeding and raising among the herdsmen, its livestock farming 
has enhanced its anti-calamity capacity. 
  He noted that now, after big calamities, the survival rate 
of 
newborn cattle is kept at more than 80 percent. 
  Last year, the region set up 366,000 hectares of fenced 
grazing land and more than 20,000 hectares of man-made grassland. 
  The Bureau of Tibet Livestock Farming has trained about 
10,000 technicians at county, township and village levels each 
year in application of grassland transformation and protection 
and refined cattle breeding.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region will carry out 113 key scientific and technological 
programs this year to promote its social and economic 
development. 
  The programs include Lhasa highland botanical garden, 
improvement of breeding of cows and yaks, protection of 
black-neck crane and study of insect resources in the Himalayan 
area. 
  Some of the programs involve cooperation with domestic and 
foreign counterparts -- in research and application of solar 
energy, personnel exchanges, academic training and introducing 
experts and high-technology into Tibet. 
  Over the past four decades, Tibet has witnessed rapid 
development in scientific and technological services. 
  Now the region has set up 19 scientific and technological 
research institutes, with more than 26,000 staff, engaged in 
agriculture, livestock breeding, energy, meteorology, 
communications and transport, geology and mining industry, 
medicine and biology. 
  The institutes have completed more than 2,000 scientific and 
technological research projects in the past decades. 
  The regional science and technology commission has set the 
113 key scientific programs as the central tasks of the 
scientific community in Tibet for the 1994-2000 period. 
  Sources said that at present, the commission is formulating 
preferential policies to attract scientific and technological 
personnel from other parts of China to go to Tibet to 
participate in the programs.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Rural industrial 
enterprises are booming in the Tibet Autonomous Region and 
becoming a fresh force in its economic development. 
  A survey shows that the region has 9,180 such enterprises 
employing 51,000 people. 
  Their gross income last year amounted to 310 million yuan, 
an 
increase of 24 percent over the previous year. 
  This highland region began to develop rural enterprises 
later 
than the interior parts of the country. 
  A local official said that the expansion of rural 
enterprises 
is giving the local people a faint sense of commodity economy 
and helping to rationalize and boost the local economy. 
  The official acknowledged that Tibet's rural enterprises are 
concentrated in cities and towns and are developing unevenly.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 3 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region tops all provinces and regions in the stands of timber, a 
recent survey reveals. 
  According the results obtained from satellite and land 
inspection, Tibet has more than two billion sq m [square meters] 
of timber forests, the biggest in all of China. 
  About 9.8 percent of the region, or an area of 7.17 million 
ha [hectares], is covered by trees. 
  Across its 1.2 million sq km landspace, vast tracts of 
forests spread across the east and south of the region, while in 
the west and north is broad grassland. 
  In addition, the survey shows, most of the region's timber 
storage is virgin forest. 
  The survey was conducted jointly by 180 experts from the 
Ministry of Forestry and the Forestry Department of Tibet over a 
period of half a year. 
  Experts say the survey is significant for helping the region 
work out plans to utilize its rich resources and promote its 
economy. 
  They also stressed that forests are "the lungs of the 
Earth". 
It is urgent for the local government to take measures to 
preserve the region's forests, which are important to the 
world's ecological environment, the experts noted.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 2 (XINHUA) -- When farmer Puqung raised 
a sow three years ago, he also raised quite a few eyebrows among 
his startled neighbors in Targyai Village of Xigaze County, 
Tibet. 
  Other villagers considered the keeping of the animal 
"inauspicious". 
  Three years have passed and Puqung's sow has given birth to 
15 piglets. He sold the sucklings and earned 2,000 yuan. 
  Instantly, Puqung's success became the talk of the hamlet 
and 
spawned keen followers. 
  By raising and selling pigs, farmers in Targyai Village are 
able to buy chemical fertilizers and new furniture to decorate 
their homes. 
  In recent years, more and more farmers like Puqung have 
emerged in Xigaze County. Their interest is no longer confined 
to cattle and sheep. 
  Farmers living in the middle reaches of the Nyang Qu River 
of 
Bainang County used to regard miles of marshland there as 
wasteland. Now they have transformed the swamps into 
duck-raising farms. Many have earned more than 10,000 yuan. 
  Xigaze is one of the grain baskets in Tibet. More than half 
of the autonomous region's grain is harvested there. The 
potential, however, has not been fully tapped. One saying 
describes the local people as "sitting on top of a mountain of 
grain, starving." 
  As China's burgeoning market economy has reached this remote 
area, Tibetan farmers are eyeing a world that is more than 
highland barley, cattle and sheep. 
  Out in the wide, open fields of Xigaze stretch patch after 
patch of lovely vegetables. The plastic-film covered 
greenhouses in farmers' courtyards are also green with 
vegetables even in the dead of winter. 
  On highways are carts of fresh vegetables on the way to 
market. Barley for brewing beer and some exotic stock from South 
America have found their way into the fields on the roof of the 
world. 
  The growth of animal breeding and planting has broadened the 
farming structure and food varieties of Tibetan farmers, who are 
earning more with a diversified economy. 
  Last year, farmers in Gyangze and Bainang Counties earned 
more than half their income through breeding and planting.

  [Text] A provincial organization work conference concluded 
in Kunming yesterday afternoon. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu attended and 
delivered a speech in which he emphatically stated: Under the 
new circumstances, we should build the party in accordance with 
the party's basic line and political line as well. Party 
organization work should submit to and serve the party's basic 
line and political line. This year, China's deep-going reform 
is expected to enter a crucial stage marked with comprehensive 
progress and earthshaking breakthroughs. At the moment, the 
party is undergoing another major strategic transformation since 
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, 
namely, a shift from a planned economic structure to a socialist 
market economic structure, this being a significant change 
foretelling a new round of national rejuvenation and development. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: Under the current circumstances 
and at such an important historical juncture, we should make 
redoubled efforts to step up party building, this being the key 
to all our work. The party's work should closely focus on such 
key aspects as emancipating the mind, grasping each and every 
opportunity, furthering in-depth reform, pushing forward 
development, and maintaining stability. Party building work 
should first and foremost submit to and serve these key work 
aspects. Insofar as guiding ideology is concerned, we should 
shift the focus of party organization work from cadre management 
to overall party building. Insofar as work style and methods are 
concerned, we should shift the focus of the party organization 
work from such routine matters as selecting, promoting, 
appointing, and removing from office cadres to overall party 
building. To this end, we should concentrate on resolving all 
major contradictions and strive for tangible results in party 
organization work. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu maintained: We should strive to 
accomplish the following three major party building tasks over 
the next two years: 
  1. To attach primary importance to the party's ideological 
and theory building; 
  2. To arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 
  3. To step up leading organ building at all levels with an 
eye to making them capable of emancipating the mind, seeking 
truth from facts, persisting in reform and opening up, 
conducting fruitful work, opening up new vistas for overall 
party work, adhering to democratic centralism and the party 
spirit, broadening people's horizons, being broad-minded, 
uniting the broad masses of people, fighting battles, 
maintaining close ties with the broad masses of people, 
conducting in-depth investigations and study, adopting a strong 
sense of the masses, conducting work in a down-to-earth manner, 
showing concern for the overall interests, making selfless 
contributions, submitting to and serving the party's overall 
interests, as well as persistently and whole-heartedly serving 
the people. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu asserted: In building leading party 
organs at all levels across the province, we should closely 
follow the above mentioned criteria and requirements, make 
persistent efforts, and strive to achieve tangible results. In 
order to improve party style, Pu Chaozhu added, it is imperative 
to persistently further the on-going anti-corruption struggle 
while building socialism with Chinese characteristics at the 
same time. It is also imperative to reinforce and successfully 
build grass-roots party organizations with forceful measures.

  [Excerpts] The Second Session of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Seventh Yunnan 
Provincial Committee concluded at Kunming's Guofang Theater 
yesterday afternoon with all items on the agenda fulfilled. The 
meeting called on CPPCC members and organizations, all 
democratic parties, mass organizations, and people of all 
nationalities across the province to unite closely around the 
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, seize 
the opportunity, unite as one in all sincerity, share weal and 
woe, brace up, exert efforts to reinvigorate Yunnan and fulfill 
the historical tasks in the new historical period full of 
confidence under the leadership of the provincial party 
committee! [passage omitted] 
  Provincial CPPCC Chairman Liu Fusheng presided over the 
closing ceremonies. [passage omitted] 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu delivered an 
important speech at the meeting. He said: The current meeting 
has been most successful. CPPCC members have given play to 
democracy, pooled their wisdom, and offered many good opinions 
and proposals that have a bearing on the overall situation. 
This shows the province's CPPCC members have made progress in 
grasping and discussing state affairs and doing substantial 
work, and democratic parties, mass organizations, and CPPCC 
members have played an increasingly important role in the 
scientific and democratic decisionmaking of the provincial party 
committee and government. 
  Pu Chaozhu said: Facts show that Yunnan's CPPCC work has 
realized pleasing conversion in three aspects, namely: In 
participating in government and discussing state affairs, CPPCC 
members have changed from grasping directly perceived and 
partial issues to grasping major events and state affairs; they 
have changed from giving play to the individual's role in 
participating in government and discussing state affairs to 
giving play to the collective roles of democratic parties; and 
changed from their proposals being loosely connected with 
practical work to direct, good, proposals. 
  Pu Chaozhu dealt with understanding in the current 
situation, 
readjustment of the industrial setup, Yunnan's economic 
development, further giving play to the roles of the CPPCC and 
united front, and further augmenting and improving party 
leadership in CPPCC work. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Yunnan Keen To Open Wider to Outside World"] </F>
  [Text] Kunming, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Yunnan Province is accelerating its pace to increase contacts 
with neighboring countries in a bid to open wider to the outside 
world. 
  The land-locked province, whose economy has for long been 
hindered by inconvenient communications, neighbors Vietnam, Laos 
and Myanmar (Burma), having a border of 4,060 km. 
  Officials said that the past 15 years have turned Yunnan 
into 
one of the frontiers of China's reform and opening-up. It has 
so far opened two-thirds of its counties to foreigners and 
established eight state-level and eight province-level outlets 
on the border. 
  International cooperation in economy, science, technology, 
culture, education, sports and public health resulted in the 
approval of 509 foreign-invested enterprises in Yunnan last year. 
  Using self-collected funds and cooperating with Myanmar, the 
province's border areas last year built and upgraded highways to 
three important towns in north Myanmar, much improving 
communications between them. 
  In Ruili and Wanding business people from outside the two 
countries are arriving in surges. 
  By the end of last December the three towns of Hekou, 
Tianbao 
and Jinshuihe on the Sino-Vietnamese border reopened. 
  The provincial capital of Kunming is now linked by highways 
with the important northern Vietnamese port of Haiphong, via the 
border town of Hekou. 
  China's only state-level outlet on the border with Laos was 
also opened in Yunnan last year. 
  Two-way border trade between Yunnan and the three countries 
has been increasing by large margins to reach more than 2.87 
billion yuan-worth last year. 
  The Mekong River, which winds through China, Laos, Myanmar, 
Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, has turned out to be an economic 
bond among the countries. 
  Since 1990 China and Laos have repeatedly launched 
inspections, and experimental sailings, of the river. Last year 
China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand surveyed 360 km of the river 
during the dry season, obtaining abundant data on dredging and 
navigation. 
  In January this year experts from the four countries 
sponsored a conference here to study the prospects of official 
navigation of the river. 
  The two ports of Jinghong and Simao along the Lancang River, 
the name of the part of the Mekong in Chinese territory, have 
been approved as state-level outlets designed to promote the 
local economy. 
  The Yunnan provincial government has reached agreements with 
Laos, Thailand and Myanmar to build two highways connecting the 
two countries. The highways will then be extended to Malaysia 
and Singapore. 
  Meanwhile, a local railway line in Yunnan is being extended 
to Dali in the western part of the province and is expected to 
eventually link up with the railway network of Laos. 
  Yunnan's plans to connect itself with neighboring countries 
by water, road and rail have aroused interest of the Asian 
Development Bank, which has provided loans for these 
communication projects. 
  Kunming airport has become a major international airport in 
the region, as it has opened direct air routes to Rangoon, 
Bangkok, Chiangmai, Singapore, Vientiane, Kuala Lumpur and Hong 
Kong. The city also envisages developing routes to Phnom Penh 
and Ho Chi Minh City. 
  Currently the province is building and upgrading other 
airports, including those at Zhaotong, Lijiang and Dali. Seven 
of the airports will open to traffic by the end of this year. 
  Meanwhile, Yunnan is making efforts to improve the highways 
connecting Kunming and the outlets on the border, such as Hekou 
and Xishuangbanna. Officials said major highways within 200 km 
around Kunming will have been upgraded by the end of next year. 
  To date, Yunnan has established trade and economic ties with 
more than 100 countries and regions worldwide. Last year the 
province registered a two-way trade volume of over 1.21 billion 
U.S. dollars- worth and received more than 400,000 overseas 
visitors. 
  Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang said that Yunnan is keen to 
consolidate and expand cooperation with Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, 
Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, as well as to develop 
cooperative channels with the Republic of Korea, Australia and 
Indonesia. 
  He said his province also intends to initiate economic ties 
with Cambodia, the Philippines and Brunei, while engaging in 
promoting friendly relations with India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 
  During the first Kunming export commodities fair last 
August, 
Governor He vowed to turn the annual event into an influential 
international fair as a measure to promote Yunnan further in the 
global arena.

  [Text] Kunming, March 7 (XINHUA) -- People in southwest 
China's Yunnan Province, a historically backward and 
disease-ridden area, have a life expectancy of 65.2 years, 25.2 
years longer than the average in the year of 1950. 
  According to officials from the World Health Organization 
(WHO), the province, home to 26 nationalities, has reached the 
level of moderately developed countries in the field. 
  Since Yunnan is located at an average sea-level of above 
2,000 meters, the diversity in climate and natural environment 
resulted in spread of many epidemic disease like snail fever, 
malaria, leprosy and goiter. 
  In 1930s, a plague hit Simao region, killing tens of 
thousands of people at this important material port in Southeast 
Asia. 
  Thanks to undertakings to improve medical and health 
conditions after New China was founded, epidemic diseases have 
been so far brought under strict control. 
  The Ministry of Public Health reported that infectious 
incidence rate has seen a dramatic drop in the past 12 years. 
Only four out of 10,000 catch such diseases as goiter, malaria 
and leprosy in some prefectures. 
  Among the country's border provinces, Yunnan has become the 
first with 85 percent of the population meeting vaccination 
requirements set by WHO. 
  More than half of its rural population of 32 million, 
including a large proportion who are ethnic people, now have 
access to clean water. 
  So far, the province has 6,500 hospitals, over 130,000 
medical professionals and practitioners and 82,000 hospital 
beds, respectively 67-fold, 135-fold and 134-fold more than in 
1950. 
  And a medical network throughout its 127 counties helps the 
province keep an eye on epidemic diseases. 
  Despite the great progress, it is not easy for the province 
to achieve the goal of every resident enjoying health care at 
the end of this century, as medical education is difficult to 
reach its mountainous areas because of poor transportation.

  [Text] Kunming, March 4 (XINHUA) -- A group of biologists 
are helping monks plant trees and flowers in a temple in Yunnan 
Province's Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna. 
  From Chinese Academy of Sciences, the scientists are trying 
to preserve the rich plant varieties in this southwest China 
tropical region. 
  Professor Xu Zaifu, director of the prefecture's botanical 
garden, said that it is also a research conducted according to a 
United Nation's convention issued in 1992 to preserve the 
diversity of living beings and local culture and maintain the 
harmony between them. 
  Funded by the U.S. Ford Foundation, they aim to cultivate 
over 100 kinds of plants which are on the verge of extinction 
caused by the population growth. 
  The 19,000-sq-km prefecture, bordering on Myanmar [Burma] 
and 
Laos, is a home to a dozen minority nationalities, including the 
Hani, Lahu, Blang and Yi, with a combined population of over 
800,000. The Dai nationality accounts for the largest 
proportion. 
  Plants play an important role in local religion. 
  The Dai people believe in a kind of Buddhism, the sutras of 
which are written on palm leaves. 
  According to ancient records, trees always appeared in 
important events in the life of the father of Buddhism, 
Sakyamuni. He was born, enlightened and entered a state of 
nirvana under trees. 
  So trees have been honored as holy among local Buddhists. In 
the past, anyone who cut down a tree would be sentenced to death 
and their offspring made slaves. 
  In addition, temples and Buddha figures are made of valuable 
timber. Lamp-oil, perfumes and dyes are refined from flowers 
and leaves. 
  At present, there are more than 500 temples in the 
prefecture, which are called "gardens for buddhist plants", with 
at least over 50 varieties in each of them. 
  Xu and his colleagues hope to extend the research to other 
temples.

  [Text] Kunming, March 4 (CNS)--Participants attending the 
second session of the 7th Yunnan People's Political Consultative 
Confrence warned that a sharp drop in arable land resulting from 
serious soil erosion would have disastrous consequences. 
  Yunnan, a highland province with arable land making up a 
mere 
7.5 percent of its entire area, has few effective water 
conservancy works while the land under cultivation is so weak 
that its productivity is far lower than the average across the 
country. Soil erosion is growing more serious because of 
frequent natural disasters such as drought, water-logging, 
flooding, earthquakes and mudslides with the living conditions 
in some areas being in jeopardy. Land under cultivation is 
still in decline as incomplete statistics show that the area of 
paddy fields were reduced by 149,300 mu in 1993 compared with 
the area in 1985. 
  The use of land in the province is not yet under proper 
administration and some counties and cities have rushed to make 
use of arable land for the establishment of development zones 
without undertaking prior fasibility studies. The participants 
at the conference pointed out that damage to the ecological 
environment and land would result in waste and lead to a 
disastrous outcome. They called for greater awareness of the 
need for environmental protection in the province while at the 
same time asking for the drawing up of measures for the 
protection of land for proper use. 
  Director of the Yunnan Institute of Economics Mr. Hu 
Tongyuan 
suggested that a dramatic adjustment of the agricultural pattern 
should take place. Ecological-safe agriculture, 
commerce-oriented farming and agriculture for the earning of 
foreign exchange should be painstakingly undertaken. Modern 
agriculture should be developed with a wider scope covering 
farming, forestry, animal husbandy and breeding together with 
comprehensive exploitation of the processing industry. The area 
under cultivation needs to be maintained in order to ensure a 
certain amount of agricultural output while few breakthroughs 
could be seen as far as science and technology were concerned in 
the improvement of farming conditions while at the same time 
demands for grains for consumption continued to grow steadily.

  [Text] Kunming, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Yunnan Province, a leading producer of quality cigarettes in 
China, saw a sharp increase in its exports of machinery and 
electrical products last year. 
  According to local officials, Yunnan exported machinery and 
electrical products worth 102.75 million U.S. dollars in 1993, 
up 48.2 percent compared with the previous year. 
  Bordering Myanmar [Burma], Laos and Vietnam, the province 
has 
been making efforts to make full use of its geographical 
advantages over the past few years. 
  In opening up markets for its machinery and electrical 
products, it has adopted a policy of giving priority to the 
development of the Southeast Asian market while strengthening 
traditional markets in Hong Kong, Macao, Europe and the United 
States. 
  Besides building more special production bases for machinery 
and electrical products in the province and sending missions to 
hold fairs of machinery and electrical products in neighboring 
countries, the relevant local departments have also adopted 
flexible ways of trading to boost exports of such products, 
including spot exchange trade, barter trade, buyer's credit and 
seller's credit, and have achieved marked results. 
  For instance, the province has experienced a rise of 81 
percent in its exports of machinery and electrical products to 
the United States. 
  So far, Yunnan exports more than 70 kinds of machinery and 
electrical products, as against only a dozen kinds in 1984, 
since when the quality of its products for export has kept 
improving. The proportion of products for export with higher 
technical content and machinery, and instruments and meters with 
higher added value is increasing rapidly, the officials added.

  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA)-- China's capital city 
Beijing intends to attract more foreign investment to boost its 
booming infrastructure construction, according to Mayor Li Qiyan. 
  Li made this remark at a recent municipal foreign economic 
and trade meeting. 
  He said that the current international and domestic 
situation 
helps pave the way for further use of foreign funds, but a 
better environment for such investment is badly needed. 
  As world consortiums, financiers and transnational firms 
have 
kept pouring into Beijing to seek opportunities since the 
beginning of the year, the emphasis of the work should be placed 
on creating favorable conditions for foreign investment and 
cooperation, he said. 
  In the first month of this year, the number of the 
newly-built companies with over 10 million U.S. dollars 
investment each reached 20. The biggest of them were two real 
estate corporations, each having a total investment of 60 
million U.S. dollars. 
  And by the end of January the municipal government had 
approved 7,783 foreign-funded firms and directly used more than 
10.71 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds. 
  Explaining the reason for promoting the role of foreign 
investment, Deputy Mayor Lu Yucheng said that the drive will 
focus on encouraging the attraction of more foreign funds, the 
setting up of more businesses, more project construction and 
more profits earned this year. 
  Lu also said that the majority of the foreign funds will be 
guided into the construction of urban infrastructure facilities 
and development zones of various kinds, as well as into the 
mainstay industries such as automobiles, electronics and 
building materials. 
  In addition, he said, full use should be made of world trade 
information networks to provide more information services for 
both investors and those who need investment. 
  And the drawing up of laws and regulations concerning 
foreign 
economic trade and co-operation should be strengthened to 
protect the foreign businessmen's legal rights and interests in 
China. 
  Administrative formalities should be simplified and work 
efficiency should be improved in order to provide a coordinated 
servicing process. 
  In 1994 the city will pour more funds into the construction 
of major projects such as the capital's subways, expressways and 
power plants. 
  The construction of first-class economic and technology 
development zones will also be stepped up through Sino-foreign 
co-operation. 
  Lu also said that Beijing is now probing for ways to 
establish Sino-foreign shareholding companies. 
  For this reason, the companies that are already listed are 
encouraged to issue B and H shares, and the financial 
institutions to issue bonds abroad, while infrastructure 
projects will try the BOT (building, operation and transfer) 
channel.

  [Text] On 4 March, Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal 
party committee, invited chairman and vice chairmen of the 
Beijing Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang to a 
heart-to-heart talk. 
  At 1500 that afternoon, leading comrades of the municipal 
revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang walked to a meeting 
room of the organ of the municipal party committee, where 
Comrade Chen Xitong had already stayed. Chen Xitong happily 
said: Today, I invite comrades of the Kuomintang Committee, a 
friendly party of ours, here to have a talk. There are already 
the system of political consultation and the forms of special 
report meetings and forums. But, the small-scale heart-to-heart 
talks are very limited. Now that you are invited to a 
heart-to-heart talk today, you may make yourselves at home and 
chatter away about this and that, such as international and 
domestic situation, the modernization of the capital, the united 
front work, and the difficulties and problems requiring our help 
and solution. 
  Amid the cordial and warm atmosphere, comrades of the 
committee of Kuomintang, expressed their opinions on the 
multiparty cooperation led by the CPC, on participation in and 
discussion of political affairs, on democratic supervision, on 
overseas propaganda, and on self-construction. Some comrades 
said with deep feeling: Through heart-to-heart talks, our 
affection with municipal leading comrades has become closer and 
we are greatly inspired. Comrades participating in the talk 
maintained that this form of talk was good and convenient for 
them to speak their mind freely. 
  During the three-hour talk, Chen Xitong continuously 
exchanged opinions and ideas with Kuomintang comrades. He said: 
In upholding the principles of long-term coexistence and mutual 
supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and sharing 
honor or disgrace, the key lies in showing utter devotion to 
each other. Only by having a heart-to-heart talk can we 
establish a profound friendship and can we coexist for a long 
time and supervise each other in an even better way. Today's 
heart-to-heart talk is the first of its kind between us. From 
now on, we should strengthen contacts through diverse forms. 
The CPC and the revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang share 
the same goal, that is, to make China strong and prosperous at 
an earlier date and to build the socialism with Chinese 
characteristics that was advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. 
Therefore, the revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang has no 
reason to refuse to participate in the multiparty cooperation 
and has no reason to refuse to inherit and carry forward the 
fine tradition of showing utter devotion to each other, that had 
been manifested between Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and the old 
generation of leaders of democratic parties. 
  Chen Xitong sincerely hoped that the revolutionary committee 
of the Kuomintang would recommend its comrades to hold leading 
posts at pertinent government departments. He added: The CPC 
should strengthen the construction of itself, but I hope that 
democratic parties will also strengthen the construction of 
themselves. 
  Attending the heart-to-heart talks were He Luli, Zhang 
Lianyun, Wang Xijue, Li Peiyu, Gan Peigen, Jiang Jianguo, Han 
Ruqi, He Shengtao, and Geng Yuqi, leaders of the municipal 
revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang. 
  Also attending were Wang Daming, Li Zhijian, and Shen 
Rendao, 
leaders of the municipality. 
  It is learned that Comrade Chen Xitong will also hold talks 
with leading comrades of other democratic parties and industrial 
and commercial federations in the first half of this year.

  [Excerpt] The municipal intermediate people's court held a 
meeting on 4 March to pronounce strict punishments on a number 
of criminals who robbed taxis and cruelly killed the drivers. 
Six criminals guilty of the most heinous crimes were escorted 
to the execution ground and shot to death. 
  Among the serious criminal activities, cases on robbing taxi 
drivers and stealing taxis have increased notably. In 1993, 273 
such cases occurred, 340 percent more than in 1992. Of the 
total, 165 were cases on robbery of taxi drivers, an increase of 
217 percent over 1992; and 108 were cases on stealing of taxis, 
a substantial increase. Such criminal activities damaging taxi 
drivers have greatly threatened the public security of the 
capital and the lives and property of the people. Implementing 
the principle of dealing strict blows to criminal activities, 
Beijing's public security and judicial departments concentrated 
forces and devoted time to strictly crack down on robbery and 
stealing of taxis and other criminal activities. 
  The six criminals who were executed on 4 March were Zhang 
Yong and Liang Cuifa, peasants from Wuji County of Hebei 
Province, who ganged up and fled to Beijing to rob a taxi and 
cruelly killed the driver; Fu Qiang, a jobless person, and his 
partners Li Feng and Du Guijun, who robbed taxis and killed the 
drivers on many occasions; and Wang Shili, a jobless person, who 
anesthetized taxi drivers and robbed money from them on many 
occasions. Liang Zhaoming, Liu Xiaogang, Qi Shoufeng, Liu 
Quanlu, and Wang Guoli, who also joined the above-mentioned 
criminal activities, were sentenced to life imprisonment or 
fixed-term imprisonment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The savings deposits 
of local people in both urban and rural areas of Beijing showed 
a sharp increase in the first two months of this year. 
  Figures released by the municipal people's bank show that 
the 
city's total savings deposits by the end of February amounted to 
62.6 billion yuan. 
  In 1993 the city saw a record amount of savings deposits of 
17.27 billion yuan. This year saw a continuing growth, with a 
total of 2.65 billion yuan added in January, up 1.21 billion 
yuan from the average monthly increase in 1993. 
  In February the city had another 3.43-billion-yuan increase 
in savings deposits, a hefty 6.07-percent rise from the same 
period last year. 
  The figures also show that residents' income remained 
stable, 
and about 92 percent of the depositors were optimistic about 
future income trends. 
  More aware of risks, local people have reduced blind 
investment and have begun to put more money in the bank. Most 
of them prefer long-term deposits to short-term ones. 
  Of the total increase in savings deposits in the first two 
months of this year, fixed deposits accounted for 97 percent.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Beijingers are now 
enjoying a diversity of non-staple food, thanks to the 
government's efforts last year in lifting food prices. 
  According to a recent conference held here recently on 
suburban livestock farming, the total output of non-staple food 
remained high in 1993, and a range of non-staple food centers 
with high production in the city's suburban areas has taken 
initial shape. 
  These suburban counties provided more than 3.76 million pigs 
last year, a three-percent rise over a year ago. 
  The weight of eggs supplied to the capital's markets jumped 
by 6.2 percent over the figure in the previous year. 
  Over 2.2 million pigs and 171 million kilograms of eggs were 
produced by large and standard farms. 
  To bolster market sales, 62 integrated economic complexes 
and 
670 pig-breeding farms which combine the breeding, production 
and processing in one place, have been built in the suburban 
areas. 
  Hundreds of meat and egg sales centers have been set up 
across the district areas of the city to step up the delivery of 
the non- staple food, so that citizens are able to enjoy the 
food fresh the same day or even within several hours. 
  The city has also set up quarantine stations at the 
municipal 
and county levels and trained about 1,000 quarantine specialists 
to ensure the residents have healthy, clean food. 
  Some 40 quarantine stations have been built alongside the 
highways and roads that lead to the city center and 118 markets 
all have appointed hygiene staff.

  [Text] In an interview by this reporter, Governor Ye 
Liansong said: This year, Hebei Province plans to keep on the 
trend of rapid increase in the GNP. To this end, the province 
should give prominence to the following several points in making 
arrangements for economic work. We should persist in combining 
the package reform with breakthroughs in key areas and 
accelerate the pace of reform, with emphasis on accelerating the 
operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises and 
establishing a modern enterprise system. We should positively 
promote the reform of financial, taxing, banking, planning, 
investment, and money-lending systems. 
  Ye Liansong stressed: We should continue to pay attention to 
the province's agricultural and rural work. Under the 
prerequisite of ensuring the steady increase in major 
agricultural products, we should optimize agricultural structure 
under the guidance of market. We should go all out to build the 
rural socialized service system and promote the development of 
township and town enterprises. Continued efforts should be made 
to reduce peasants' burdens. Efforts should also be made to 
doing the rural family planning work well. In industrial 
production, we should further optimize the industrial structure 
and profoundly conduct the activities of effecting a 14-17 
percent increase in the total industrial added value, effecting 
a 10 percent increase in the profit and tax of the industry at 
or above the township level that exercises independent 
accounting, effecting a 10 percent increase in the profit and 
tax of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, effecting 
a 25-35 percent increase in the technological transformation 
investment made by the whole people, effecting a 15 percent 
decline in the losses of large and medium-sized industrial 
enterprises, and effecting a 1 percentage point increase in the 
general index of economic efficiency of the industry at or above 
the township level that exercises independent accounting. The 
readjustment of product mix should be emphasized. The pace of 
technological transformation of enterprises should be 
accelerated. Great efforts should be made to expand and occupy 
market in line with market demands. And attention should be 
paid to grasping competitive projects, creating competitive 
products, striving for first-class quality, and enhancing the 
competitiveness of enterprises. 
  Yue Qifeng stressed: With focus on accelerating the 
cultivation of market structure, we should vigorously develop 
the tertiary industry and gradually increase the proportion of 
the tertiary industry in the provincial GNP. Ye Liansong said: 
This year, Hebei province should continue to rationally 
increase the investment in fixed assets and accelerate the pace 
of building key projects. 
  On how to open the province even wider to the outside world 
and other domestic places through implementation of the strategy 
concerning foreign trade, foreign investment, and foreign 
economic relations, Ye Liansong said: This year, the province 
should accelerate the development of foreign trade, foreign 
investment, and foreign economic relations, continue to grasp 
the work concerning the areas around Bo Hai and the areas around 
Beijing and Tianjin, and improve the province's investment 
environment in an effort to make the province more attractive to

  [Excerpts] While financial revenues for Hebei Province 
increased by a large margin overall in 1994, many localities 
found themselves in tight financial straits, and some were 
unable to meet the people's demand for food. How on earth 
should we handle this situation that emerges from the process of 
advancement and development? The deputies of the people's 
congress and the members of the provincial committee of Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], who were 
attending the current sessions, frankly and sincerely aired 
their views and suggestions. 
  According to the information dispatched by reporters (Fan 
Shijun) and (Zhang Guoxing) from the sessions, Hebei Province 
effected a relatively big increase in financial revenues in 1993 
to make a new breakthrough of historical significance. 
According to statistics, the province's financial revenue 
totaled 14.39 billion yuan, an increase of 44.4 percent over the 
previous year, exceeding the average national increase level by 
4.5 percentage points. In 1993, governments and financial and 
tax departments at all levels in the province kept the idea of 
invigorating the economy firmly in mind, and tried all possible 
means to realize the program on invigorating Hebei's economy as 
well as various other objectives. Major indicators were that 
various fields raised and circulated funds to accelerate the 
construction of key projects, continued to increase input in 
agriculture, continued to support the technological renovation 
of large and medium-sized enterprises, and continued to launch 
the activities of creating high-revenue counties and eliminating 
subsidy receiving counties, yielding remarkable results. Fengnan 
and Huanghua counties's realization of 100 million yuan in 
financial revenue in 1992, was followed by Qian, Fengning, 
Zunhua, Wuan, Fengrun, Yutian, and Hengshui so that they joined 
1993's list of counties with 100 million yuan in financial 
revenue. [passage omitted] 
  In 1993, the province made a breakthrough of historical 
significance in financial revenues that was fully affirmed by 
the deputies of the provincial people's congress and the members 
of the provincial CPPCC committee who were attending the current 
sessions. However, the deputies and the members also worried 
about the tight financial circumstances in some localities. In 
particular, some localities were unable to issue wages on 
schedule, that caused great concern among deputies and members. 
Chen Hui, vice chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee and 
deputy director of the provincial committee of the China 
Democratic National Construction Association, revealed in her 
speech to the session that according to the statistics compiled 
early this year, the province as a whole owed teachers of 
primary and middle schools a large amount of wages, thus not 
only affecting teachers' enthusiasm but also forcing some key 
teachers to change jobs frequently. Director of the province's 
financial department, Zhang Xianpu, analyzes the reasons for the 
large increase of financial revenue in some parts of the 
province, and the tight financial situation in others, in his 
report on the implementation of the 1993 provincial budget and 
the 1994 draft budget: The first reason was that although the 
province as a whole effected a relatively big increase in 
financial revenues last year, the increase was mainly brought 
about by localities at or above the city and prefectural levels, 
and the increase in localities at or below the county level was 
not as great. Only 28 counties and county-level cities 
surpassed the national revenue average. Some counties and 
county-level cities did not effect an increase in their 
revenues, and some even experienced a decline. The second 
reason was that factors for revenue increases due to policy 
increased, and, in particular, appropriations used as wages 
increased. The third reason was the low quality of many 
products of the province, and the difficulties in production and 
management that was experienced by some enterprises. The fourth 
reason was the indulgence in serious extravagance and waste by 
some localities and units which incurred huge losses of state 
property. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, March 1 (XINHUA) -- A major green 
campaign aimed at transforming barren mountains into orchards 
has been launched in north Hebei Province. 
  The curtain was lifted on the campaign on last Friday [25 
February] when thousands of explosions echoed among the hills of 
the Taihang Mountains to the west of Shijiazhuang, the 
provincial capital. The blasting will make it possible to form 
fields on hill sides. 
  The vice-director of the city's forestry bureau, Liu 
Zhanzhong, said that from February 25 to March 12, nearly a 
million blastholes of dynamite would be exploded in the 
mountains. 
  The vice-director said these blasts would pave the way for 
the reclaiming of some 13,000 ha. of fields, on which 300,000 
apple trees could be planted. 
  Hebei's campaign is only part of the Chinese Government's 
plan to afforest the Taihang Mountains which run along the 
border between Shanxi and Hebei. 
  In the mountain area, poor vegetation has been causing 
serious erosion, resulting in a rugged terrain and poor water 
conservancy, which, in turn, poses a fundamental difficulty for 
the life of local people and their production efforts. 
  Listed in the "Agenda for the 21st Century" of the Chinese 
Government, the afforestation of the Taihang Mountains will be 
one of the largest environmental construction projects ever 
launched in China. 
  It is also a critical part of global efforts to improve the 
earth environment, and will be carried out as an obligation of 
the Chinese Government to the 1992 United Nations Environment 
and Development Conference. 
  In the first year of full-scale operations on this plan, the 
effort will be concentrated on the development of apple farms, 
and will feature improved management on the side of the 
government, the vice-director said. 
  Besides its effects on the environment, the vice-director 
said the green campaign would also bring about a remarkable 
economic return. 
  The government estimates that in three to five years, these 
hillside orchards will be making 600 million yuan a year for 
local farmers.

  [Text] Baoding Prefecture witnessed marked results in 
using loans provided by World Bank for agricultural projects. 
Over the past three years, the prefecture has utilized a total 
investment of 45 million yuan in World Bank loans. Part of the 
project area, Gaoyang and Boye counties have newly added and 
improved 330,000 mu of irrigated acreage. Through comprehensive 
development, output of grain, cotton, and beef has increased in 
an all-round way. Of this, output of grain increased from 
80,000 tonnes in 1991 to 165,000 tonnes in 1993 and the per 
capita income increased from 350 yuan to 710 yuan.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The unemployment 
rate in urban areas of northern China's Hebei Province was kept 
at 2.02 percent through the end of last year, lower than the 
national average of 2.6 percent. 
  Figures from the Hebei Provincial Statistics Bureau show 
that 
a total of 300,000 people were newly employed last year, pushing 
the total number of urban employed in Hebei to 6.99 million. 
  It is worth noting that the achievement was made under a 
market mechanism rather than government assignment, which had 
been long practiced before. 
  Officials said that labor markets have been established in 
every major city of the province. A contract worker employment 
system has been promoted in almost all state enterprises in the 
province. 
  More and more young people, especially college graduates, 
have begun to choose careers on their own. A recent survey by 
the Hebei provincial women's federation, for instance, shows 
that women changed jobs more often than men while in the past 
under a planned economy more men changed professions than women. 
  Economic effectiveness has become the major factor for job 
applicants in considering which enterprises they should apply 
to. Those offering higher incomes, including private 
enterprises, have become the favorite choices. Some urban 
residents have even chosen to work in rural enterprises. In the 
past the preference was to work for state enterprises and 
government organs. 
  Officials said that labor markets have also greatly helped 
those workers whose companies have gone bankrupt. For instance, 
over 200 workers left stranded by a wireless electronics factory 
which announced bankruptcy in Shijiazhuang, capital of the 
province, found reemployment very soon through introductions via 
a labor market. Only some 60 workers from the defunct factory 
remained unemployed. 
  A large number of rural laborers have entered cities looking 
for jobs. In Shijiazhuang alone, long-term rural laborers 
topped 200,000, working as drivers, chefs, boiler keepers and 
street cleaners.

  [Text] The police both under the Haigang Public Security 
Subbureau of Qinhuangdao city on Xinhua street recently cracked 
down on a serious case of buying commodities with fake Renminbi 
banknotes. Three criminals, including (Ge Shunmin), were 
placed in detention and investigated in line with the law. 
  In February 1993 (Ge Shunmin), a peasant of Funing County, 
made acquaintance with (Dai Zhenao), a peasant of Lixian County 
in Baoding Prefecture, and (Guo Airong), a woman from Boli 
County. He bought 45,000 yuan of fake renminbi with the cash of 
15,000 yuan and successively bought commodities worth 400 yuan 
with the fake renminbi at the evening market on Haiyang Road and 
at individual-run stores in Qinghuangdao city. On 8 March, he 
was arrested on the spot by the police when buying a golden ring 
at the Jiaohang Shopping Center. 
  After the exposure of the case, the Haigang Public Security 
Subbureau of Qinhuangdao city has rapidly dispatched its 
personnel respectively to Henan Province and Baoding Prefecture 
and arrested the two criminals, including (Dai Zhenao) and (Guo 
Airong), who sold the fake Renminbi. The dispatched personnel 
have seized 40,000 yuan of fake renminbi. The case is being 
further handled.

  [Text] The leaders at various levels must approach from 
the high plane of developing the socialist market economy to 
fully understand the importance and urgency of accelerating the 
setup of the rural and pastoral social service system, 
strengthen the dynamics of work, guide the grass-roots cadres 
and peasants to engage in practice, strive to make a success 
within this year, and promote a fast development of agriculture, 
animal husbandry, and rural and pastoral areas. This is what 
Comrade Wang Qun set forth at the regional forum on setting up 
the rural and pastoral social service system. 
  The regional forum on setting up the rural and pastoral 
social service system was held in Ulanqab League on 26-27 
February. Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee; 
and Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the regional party committee 
and chairman of the regional government, attended and addressed 
the forum. The forum was chaired by Bai Enpei, deputy secretary 
of the regional party committee and head of the regional leading 
group in charge of the rural and pastoral work; and Yun Bulong, 
vice chairman of the regional government. Present at the forum 
were over 60 persons, including responsible persons of leagues 
and cities in charge of agricultural and livestock work, 
regional departments concerned, and some banners and counties. 
  The comrades participating in the forum heard the 
introductions of the experiences in promoting organizational 
reform, developing "leading economy," and setting up the 
socialist service system, gained by Qahar Right Wing Rear 
Banner, Wuchuan County, Tongliao city, Ningcheng County, Linhe 
city, Xi Ujimqin Banner, and three townships and villages of 
Qahar Right Wing Rear Banner and Liangcheng County; and also 
proceeded from reality to deeply discuss the issues of deepening 
reform and accelerating the setup of the overall service system. 
  Comrade Wang Qun prominently stressed the important 
significance of setting up and perfecting the rural and pastoral 
social service system. He pointed out: Accelerating the setup 
of the rural and pastoral social service system is an important 
measure for implementing the guidelines of the third session of 
the 14th party Central Committee and the central policy on 
grasping favorable opportunities to deepen reform, expand the 
scale of opening up, promote development, and maintain 
stability; a priority to deepening the rural and pastoral 
reform; a reliable way for speeding up economic development and 
making the people, towns, townships, sumu, banners, and counties 
rich; an urgent demand for promoting organizational reform, the 
change of government functions, and the transfer of personnel, 
alleviating the financial difficulties of banners and counties, 
and maintaining social stability; and the necessary way for 
introducing agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and 
pastoral economy to markets, accelerating the setup of the 
socialist market economic system, promoting the combination of 
urban and rural areas, coordinating development, and making the 
peasants and herdsmen become fairly well-off as soon as 
possible. Setting up a perfect social service system is 
deepening the rural and pastoral reform and accelerating the 
pace of development. This will gigantically promote the 
region's reform, development, and stability. 
  Comrade Wang Qun stressed: Accelerating the setup of the 
rural and pastoral social service system is a hard job. Whether 
or not we win a victory in this battle is a grim test for the 
cadres at various levels. The leaders at various levels should 
be promoters of progress, foster a sense of high responsibility 
and a sense of high urgency, foster the idea that development 
can be accelerated and stability can be maintained only by 
accelerating reform, firmly grasp the current favorable 
opportunity which is conducive to agricultural and livestock 
development, conscientiously conduct study and make 
arrangements, organize forces to boldly engage in practice, and 
strive to make achievements as soon as possible. 
  Comrade Wang Qun urged: The party committees and governments 
at various levels should realistically strengthen the leadership 
over the setup of the rural and pastoral social service system. 
We should persistently streamline superstructure, strengthen 
the grass roots, change functions, intensify service, and 
mobilize a large number of young cadres and science 
professionals and technicians to bring into play their wisdom 
and intelligence at the service organizations. According to the 
"three-conducive" principles and in line with actual conditions, 
we should formulate appropriate policies, conscientiously 
provide service organizations with production bases, and create 
necessary conditions for setting up and developing the service 
system. Leagues, cities, banners, and counties should mobilize 
their leading bodies; organize and send, in a well-planned 
manner, cadres to towns, townships, and sumu; help conduct 
specific study and solve their working problems; and grasp the 
work of townships one after another. 
  Comrade Wu Liji said in his speech: At present, our region 
is entering a new key stage of rural and pastoral reform. The 
broad masses of peasants and herdsmen are advancing from having 
sufficient foods and clothing to being fairly well-off. 
Therefore, we should grasp the current favorable opportunities 
to accelerate the pace of conducting organizational reform and 
setting up an overall service system. It is urgent to 
vigorously develop the "dragon-shaped economy" characterized by 
having peasant households become shareholders of companies, 
linking enterprises with production bases, combining production 
and processing with marketing, and making trade, industry, 
agriculture, animal husbandry, and science a coordinate process. 
The governments at various levels should positively change 
functions and work style, intensify service, and bring into full 
play their functions for serving the rural and pastoral areas, 
the peasants, and the herdsmen. Comrade Wu Liji set forth 
specific opinions on working out necessarily relaxed policies to 
encourage office cadres, science professionals, and technicians 
to positively make contributions at overall service 
organizations.

  [Text] Huhhot, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia 
autonomous region, north China, has been promoting more women to 
leading positions in recent years. 
  Official sources here said the region now has 243,000 women 
cadres -- 34.2 percent of all the cadres in the autonomous 
region. Some 55,000 of the women are from ethnic minorities. 
  Women also make up 23 percent of the regional people's 
congress members and 17.5 percent of the regional committee 
members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, the sources said. 
  The region has set up a computer data bank to provide lists 
of possible women candidates for various positions. 
  The region also sees to it that women cadres are given 
proper 
opportunities to receive professional training and further 
education, so that they can be more qualified to lead.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Nine cities along the 
border areas in Hulun Buir League, north China's Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region, have emerged as world trading centers. 
  Bordering on Russia and Mongolia, the league was approved in 
1988 to be built into an experimental zone for China's economic 
structural reform. 
  It has since then built nine port cities with modern 
railway, 
highway and airport connections and opened more than 10 tourist 
routes leading to Russia and Mongolia. 
  In 1993, the trade volume handled by the nine cities added 
up 
to 804 million Swiss francs, a hefty 120 percent rise from 1992. 
  Overseas economic and technological cooperations in the 
region have also expanded to involve Japan, the Republic of 
Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, the United States, 
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. 
  Last year, the region implemented 151 such cooperation 
contracts, totalling 60.21 million Swiss francs. It also used 
72 million yuan in foreign funds to build 44 joint ventures. 
  In addition, the number of foreign tourists in the league 
topped 100,000 people, with a total turnover of 65 million yuan, 
including 400,000 U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The living standards 
of herdsmen in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 
have improved markedly in recent years. 
  Official sources here said that nearly 90 percent of the 
region's 420,000 herdsman families, who once lived as nomads, 
have settled down in permanent housing. 
  In 1993, the income for each of the region's 1.895 million 
pastoral population averaged 1,164 yuan. 
  An official survey shows that there were 58 television sets, 
36 motorcycles and 47 sets of windmill power generators per 100 
families. 
  Rising living standards are the result of much improved farm 
conditions, the sources said. 
  Since 1987, the region has upgraded nearly two million ha 
[hectare] of poor grassland into high-yielding pastures and 
built irrigation facilities on 80,000 ha of pastures. 
  The region has also built 32.87 million square m of barns, 
which now accommodate 80 percent of its farm stock. 
  On average, every 38 herdsman families now possess a feed 
warehouse and every 13 families a set of feed harvesting and 
processing machines, according to the sources. 
  The sources said all these have helped put herdsmen in a 
better position to combat snow, frost and other natural 
disasters. 
  With the improvement in efficiency in stock raising, the 
sources said, some 300,000 herdsmen in the region have given up 
herding for industrial or commercial positions.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 20 (XINHUA) -- In the next few years, 
northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region aims to 
improve its people's living standard to the front rank of all 
China's localities. 
  That is the aim of a blueprint called "Stepping Into the 
Front Rank," which will be implemented from this year, according 
to the autonomous regional government. 
  Officials say the aim was made in line with one of Deng 
Xiaoping's speeches in 1987 on the future development of the 
autonomous region. Officials quoted him as saying that Inner 
Mongolia might well "step into the front rank" in the future 
since it has a vast grassland and a relatively sparse population. 
  Agriculture, animal husbandry, coal, electricity, 
metallurgical industry, petrochemical industry, construction 
materials industry, wool spinning industry and forestry will be 
developed as leading sectors to boost the locality as one of 
China's major producing areas in basic industries. 
  Officials say Inner Mongolia is facing a rare development 
opportunity now as the central government, stressing the 
development of remote areas inhabited by ethnic minority 
nationalities, has brought in a series of preferential policies 
for them. 
  In addition, they say enterprises producing raw materials 
will become more competitive in national market as China has 
freed the price of most energy and raw materials. 
  Other favorable conditions for the region's growth include 
its closeness to Beijing and Tianjin cities and neighboring to 
northeast and northwest China. And the past 40 years of 
construction have laid a certain material basis, local officials 
said. 
  According to the plan, this year the autonomous region is to 
raise its total output value of agriculture and animal husbandry 
to 20.5 billion yuan, up 6 percent over 1993. Grain production 
will be maintained at more than 10 billion kg and heads of 
livestock are to reach 56.50 million. 
  A dozen model townships and villages will be set up as 
examples to become prosperous ahead of others. 
  By the end of this century, major bases for the production 
of 
corn, wheat, soybean and beef will be established. 
  A dozen major thermal power plants will be expanded to 
convert more coal into electricity. The electricity will then 
be transmitted to neighboring areas which now use most of the 
coal rather than electricity shipped in from Inner Mongolia. 
  Further reforms will be carried out in state enterprises as 
a 
way to revive them. And more local specialized markets will 
come into being, covering grain, fur and leather, meat, 
medicinal herbs, wood, coal, iron and steel, construction 
materials, oil and textile products.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 20 (XINHUA) -- The gross domestic 
production of 39 towns and seven villages each exceeded 100 
million yuan, and that of 159 villages exceeded 10 million yuan 
over the past year, according to a recent announcement by north 
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  One of the towns on the list is Qiaobao, in the suburbs of 
Hohhot, the regional capital. It made 670 million yuan from 
farming and manufacturing last year and was listed among the 
"top 100 towns in China" by the Ministry of Agriculture and the 
Ministry of Civil Affairs. 
  The village now supplies millions of tons of vegetables, 
meat, fish, eggs and milk to the regional capital each year and 
operates 1,491 enterprises in garment making, breeding, soft 
drinks, and foodstuffs as against only a brick kiln in the past. 
  In 1993, residents in the town earned 3,183 yuan on average 
and the housing space averaged 37 square meters per person. 
  Another name on the top of the list is Gongnong Village on 
the outskirts of Chifeng City. In fact, it has won the title of 
the richest village in Inner Mongolia for three consecutive 
years since 1990. 
  The small village now owns 17 large enterprises in 
machinery, 
cable, construction materials, drinks and building industries. 
Its almond drink won a gold medal at the first national fair of 
light industrial products. 
  In 1993, the village's agricultural and industrial output 
value exceeded 100 million yuan, and the villagers' average 
income reached 2,000 yuan. 
  Hedong town in the suburbs of Baotou, a major iron and steel 
center in north China, is also on the top of the list. Its 
agricultural and industrial output value hit 410 million yuan in 
1993. 
  Now there are 1,300 enterprises, including a fine hotel with 
an investment of 10 million yuan, a joint venture flour mill 
with an investment of 70 million yuan, a joint venture porcelain 
company with an investment of 100 million yuan and the second 
largest farm products marketplace in Baotou. 
  In 1993, the output value for each of eight of these 
enterprises exceeded 10 million yuan, and that for each of 14 
others exceeded five million yuan. 
  The town is now among the 300 towns with the biggest 
industrial base in China. The average annual income for its 
residents was 1,800 yuan in 1993.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 16 (XINHUA) -- More than 400,000 
herdsmen in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 
reported an average annual income of over 1,500 yuan last year, 
with the most at 4,000 yuan. 
  Statistics from the autonomous regional government show that 
this upper one-fourth of the total number of herdsmen in the 
region are living more comfortably than in the past. 
  Most of the herdsmen who have become well off have 
cultivated 
their own pastures and grasslands with good irrigation 
facilities, silages and permanent livestock shelters. These 
facilities have made them better able to resist natural 
disasters. 
  Statistics show that the number of new and hybrid livestock 
totalled 27.58 million, or 54.65 percent, of all livestock in 
the region. The improvement of new species of domestic animals 
has highly raised the returns of animal husbandry. 
  In the past, large animals were few and most livestock 
consisted of small animals of lower species, local officials 
said. 
  In addition, they said that the introduction of a contract 
system greatly improved herdsmen's enthusiasm in grooming fields 
and grassland. Science and technology service stations were 
also established in almost every township (sumu) to provide 
training in new techniques to local herdsmen. 
  As a result, the total number of livestock reached 55.78 
million head last year, up 197,800 over the previous year. The 
general output value of animal husbandry topped 6.48 billion 
yuan, an increase of 41,900 yuan over 1992. 
  Officials said the net income of all the herdsmen in the 
autonomous region increased by an average of over 100 yuan last 
year.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia 
section of the north China shelter belt project, known as the 
Green Great Wall, has yielded good biological and economic 
returns over 15 years of construction, according to local 
officials here today. 
  The official from the region's Forestry Department said 
that, 
since 1986, the region has planted a total of 3.2 million ha 
[hectare] of trees on farms, pastures, barren mountains and 
deserts. 
  These trees are now protecting 65 percent of the 1.53 
million 
ha of farmland in the region's major cereal-producing area from 
sandstorms. 
  The forest coverage of these areas has risen from 5.5 
percent 
to 20.8 percent. 
  More than 667,000 ha of pastures in the region are now also 
under the protection of windbreaks. 
  Even in Horqin and Mu Us, the region's two largest deserts, 
the forest coverage has gone up to 20 percent. 
  Since 1986, the regional government has invested 633.73 
million yuan and 136.72 labor days in the greening campaign, 
which forms part of a national program to build a shelterbelt in 
northern China. 
  The region will go on greening mountains and deserts that 
are 
farther from human inhabitation. 
  Meanwhile, the region will plant more orchards, which 
promise 
greater short-term benefits and can help local farmers prosper 
faster and in a more direct way.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, Gao Dezhan, secretary of the 
municipal party committee, discussed the government work report 
in the capacity of a deputy along with delegation from Heping 
District and jointly discussed with them the major plans for 
invigorating Tianjin. He stressed in his speech: Party and 
government leading cadres at all levels should firmly cultivate 
a mass viewpoint, conscientiously implement the mass line, exert 
utmost efforts to do practical things for the masses, try by all 
possible means to do practical things for enterprises, fully 
mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, further 
pool the efforts of all sectors, work with one heart and one 
mind, seek development with all-out efforts, and create 
brilliant achievements in Tianjin. 
  After listing to speeches given by several deputies, Gao 
Dezhan said: All of you have great confidence in Tianjin's 
development prospects and unanimously held that the development 
objectives defined by the municipal authorities are encouraging, 
in conformity with Tianjin's reality, and fully reflect the will 
of the people across the municipality. This has strengthened the 
confidence of the municipal party committee and the municipal 
government in doing their work well. Certainly, to realize the 
development objectives and comprehensively fulfill all tasks of 
this year, we will face many difficulties. This requires our 
painstaking efforts to successfully carry out all fields of 
work. The most important is that leading cadres at all levels 
should firmly bear in mind the fundamental purpose of 
wholeheartedly serving the people under the new situation. It 
is necessary to fully understand that strengthening the 
flesh-blood ties between the party and the masses of people is a 
fundamental political issue. Even all things change, the 
original aim will not change. We must not slightly slacken our 
efforts in this fundamental issue or forget it under any 
circumstances. The people's feelings and complaints are the 
most important because they directly affect the success or 
failure of our work. If we do a good job in resolving this 
issue, we will overcome all difficulties and make our 
undertakings more invigorating. 
  Gao Dezhan said: We must carry out all party and government 
tasks and all activities for the sake of the people and uphold 
Comrade Xiaoping's "three criteria," particularly the things 
that are conducive for raising the people's living standards. 
Therefore, party committees and governments at all levels should 
regard the immediate interests of the people as a matter of 
prime importance and as the fundamental starting and resting 
points for doing all work. All issues that affect the basic 
living standards of the people should be regarded as the major 
and urgent matters. No one is allowed to treat them 
indifferently or adopt an unconcerned attitude. Through our 
efforts, we should help the people eliminate misgivings, seek 
benefits, enable them to enjoy real benefits and see the hopes. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: The masses are the sources of strength 
and the foundation for achieving success. The working class and 
the masses of people across the municipality are the masters, 
the mainstay, and main forces for invigorating Tianjin and 
creating brilliant achievements. The past brilliant achievements 
were created by the people across the municipality and the new 
historical chapter must also be written by them. Leaders at all 
levels must truly and wholeheartedly rely on the broad masses 
of people, go to the grass roots and the masses while doing each 
and every work, organize the masses, boost their enthusiasm, 
respect their will, and give full play to their pioneering 
spirit. This is essential for implementing the party's basic 
line and doing all tasks well, and should be regarded as one of 
the important criteria for evaluating leading cadres at all 
levels. 
  Gao Dezhan said: The higher the enthusiasm of the masses is, 
the more concern the leading cadres at all levels should give to 
the masses, particularly those with difficulties in their living 
standards. Tianjin has good traditions for doing practical 
things for the masses. We should continue to display this good 
tradition , and unceasingly enhance the level of doing practical 
things. When doing practical things, the thing of prime 
importance is to do it with real efforts, turn all things we 
managed into a success, and enable the masses to enjoy real 
benefits. To do practical things, the most important is to 
unceasingly raise the income of urban and rural people under the 
premise of deepening reform, developing production, improving 
management, and raising efficiency, and let the people have 
money in their pockets. This is a major matter which the party 
committees and governments at all levels should do. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed in particular: Doing practical things 
for enterprises is also very important. Doing practical things 
for enterprises and the masses is an issue with two aspects. 
When enterprises are invigorating, the workers will become 
prosperous; when enterprises are not successfully managed, 
Tianjin will have no hope and the living standards of the broad 
masses of workers will be hard to improve. We should try by all 
possible means to invigorate enterprises. Well-managed 
enterprises should become more invigorating and difficult 
enterprises should have a turn for the better. Pertinent 
departments at all levels, departments dealing with 
comprehensive work, and administrative law-enforcing departments 
should further enhance the concept of serving enterprises, 
change functions, streamline organs, change work style, do 
practical things for enterprises on their own initiative, help 
them solve problems, provide timely help, change their 
operational mechanism, and create a good external environment 
for enterprises. Enterprises should also use reform as a 
motivation, strive to successfully readjust structure, develop 
products, strengthen management, conduct technological 
transformation, train workers, build leading bodies, deeply tap 
potential, and improve their own skills. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed in conclusion: The masses are the 
foundation of society and enterprises are the foundation of the 
economy. As long as we exert utmost efforts to do practical 
things for the masses, try by all possible means to do practical 
things for enterprises, and rely on the strength and wisdom of 
the masses of people, we will surely make the work of Tianjin a 
success.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Northern China's 
Tianjin city will develop its subterranean heat resources to 
meet the increasing demand for energy. 
  This was announced by an official from the Tianjin municipal 
government at a recent conference. 
  The city, rich in geothermal energy sources, has reserves of 
underground hot water estimated at 7.876 billion cubic meters. 
  Baodi County, north of Tianjin city, has the biggest 
reserves 
of the city's subterranean hot water, which cover a total area 
of 8,700 sq km. Ten of these heat fields, extending to 3,074 
square kilometers, are especially rich in underground heat 
resources. 
  The underground hot water, with temperatures between 25 and 
150 degrees centigrade, is widely used in the city's timber 
manufacturing, home heating, domestic hot water supplies, 
greenhouses, warm water swimming pools, and scientific 
experiments. 
  The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has so far 
invested tens of millions of yuan in exploration of the city's 
underground heat resources. The United Nations Development 
Program has also invested five million U.S. dollars in the 
exploration. 
  The city has by now tapped more than 250 underground hot 
water reservoirs. The deepest involved drilling to a depth of 
3,654 meters and the hottest is 98 degrees centigrade. 
  The city uses about 38 million cubic meters of underground 
hot water annually, with thermal energy equal to that produced 
by 2.5 million tons of coal. 
  Tianjin is one of the biggest underground heat energy 
centres 
in China. More than 140 overseas experts have visited the city 
to exchange views on the exploration of underground heat 
resources. 
  Business people from the United States, Iceland, France, 
Italy, New Zealand and Japan have expressed interest in 
investing in the development of the city's subterranean heat 
resources. 
  A Tianjin-Hong Kong venture was set up earlier this year to 
exploit this resource. 
  So far more than 80 countries and regions have explored and 
made use of their own underground heat energy resources.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, the biggest 
port city in north China, will pool more than 800 million yuan 
to boost its booming transport construction this year. 
  According to a local transport construction planning 
official, Tianjin will be built into a transport hub connected 
with most of the big cities across the country and around the 
world by the end of the century. 
  So far, a fast, efficient transport system by air, land and 
sea has taken initial shape in the city, he said. 
  In 1993, the city reported a total shipping cargo throughput 
of 37 million tons, with rail transport totalling over 90 
million tons. 
  The gross export value through the port city last year added 
up to 12.5 billion U.S. dollars, and more than 33 million people 
came into China or went abroad by way of Tianjin. 
  Tianjin, open to navigation for more than 2,000 years, 
boasts 
a favorable geographic position in the development of China's 
market economy. 
  Since the founding of New China, the city has invested more 
than four billion yuan to construct and expand the port. The 
Tianjin port now has more than 130 berths, including 47 
ten-thousand-ton berths. 
  It is also a container shipping port, with the largest 
annual 
handling capacity in China. It has business ties with more than 
160 countries and regions throughout the world and has at least 
30 scheduled shipping routes. 
  Transportation on land has also been brisk, and a network of 
railways and highways has been built to link Tianjin with both 
the coastal boom cities and the inland ones. 
  In addition to the country's main railway lines passing 
through the city, there is also a length of 136 kilometers of 
local railways which joins the port to the district areas. 
  Also, seven highways of national standard and one 142-km 
expressway link Tianjin to the country's capital of Beijing and 
the Tanggu Port Area. Roads in the city add up to 4088 
kilometers in total length. 
  Now, it is only a 1.5-hour drive to get from downtown 
Tianjin 
to Beijing, a 30-minute drive to the Tianjin port and a 
10-minute drive to the airport. 
  The city's air transport has also gained momentum over the 
past few years. The Tianjin airport has opened 198 scheduled 
flights to 28 domestic cities and to many countries and regions 
around the world, including the Republic of Korea, Russia, 
Japan, Ukraine and Hong Kong. 
  It has an annual passenger transport capacity of two million 
people and a capacity for 80,000 tons in cargo. The figures are 
expected to double by the year 2000. 
  Thanks to the efforts made in developing the rural traffic 
and transport system, highways are available to more than 3,800 
villages in its suburbs. Foreign-funded companies are also 
emerging in the remote villages. 
  In addition, the city also has an underground oil pipeline 
of 
203 kilometers that helps to ease the pressure of loading and 
unloading oil tankers in the Tianjin port.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The auto industry of 
north China's Tianjin Municipality, centering on the production 
of Xiali sedan cars introduced from Japan, has burgeoned rapidly. 
  Tianjin first imported production technology and equipment 
from the Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd., of Japan in 1986 to produce a 
type of midget car named Xiali. 
  During the past eight years, growing market demand and 
unceasing expansion of its production scale has made the auto 
industry Tianjin's number one profit-earner. 
  Some 50,000 Xiali sedans rolled off the production line in 
1993 alone, with output value and profits both holding first 
place among all of the city's industrial sectors. 
  The flourishing of the auto industry has also stimulated 
development of many related local economic sectors. 
  At present, Tianjin lays claim to the title of the country's 
second largest sedan producer after Shanghai, which produces 
Volkswagen Santanas in cooperation with Germany. 
  Since 1990, Xiali sedan cars have been in great demand on 
the 
domestic market due mainly to the rapid development of China's 
taxi service, according to the manager of the Tianjin auto 
marketing company. 
  With the advantage of low prices and low operating costs, 
Xiali sedans account for the majority of cars in taxi service. 
  Half of the 100,000 Xiali cars already sold have been put 
into taxi service all over the country, and many have been 
bought directly by individual taxi drivers, the manager said. 
  Tianjin Municipality has stressed further input to develop 
its Xiali auto industry. Innovation and extension projects are 
under way. 
  By the year 1995, annual output will be increased to 150,000 
and the usage rate of domestically-made spare parts will reach 
85 percent.

delegation to the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES) Standing Committee meeting has 
decided not to attend the proceedings. 
  "After careful consideration, we have decided not to attend 
the CITES meeting to avoid possible embarrassment that might 
arise from facing mainland Chinese delegates," said Li San-wei, 
head of the nine-member Taiwan delegation which arrived in 
Geneva Sunday [20 March] to dissuade the CITES from imposing 
trade sanctions on Taiwan over wildlife conservation issues. 
  "Nevertheless," Li said, "we'll grasp every informal 
opportunity to explain our conservation efforts to delegates 
from other countries." Li is also deputy director of the ROC 
Council of Agriculture's Forestry Department. 
  The CITES meeting, which opened Monday, will discuss 
rhinoceros and tiger conservation as well as review progress in 
wildlife conservation in Mainland China, South Korea, Yemen and 
Taiwan. 
  Although Taiwan is not a CITES member, CITES Standing 
Committee Chairman Murray Hosking had hoped Taiwan would attend 
the Geneva meeting as an observer. 
  As Mainland China, a CITES member, has consistently claimed 
sovereignty over Taiwan and sought to downgrade Taiwan in 
international arenas, Taiwan delegates decided not to attend any 
formal CITES Standing Committee sessions here. Even if Taiwan 
delegates were to attend such sessions, they would not be 
allowed to speak. 
  The Taiwan delegates, however, will take part in 
non-government organizations (NGO) sessions to be sponsored by 
the CITES Standing Committee in connection with its formal 
annual meeting. During the NGO sessions, Li Ling-ling, a 
zoology professor at National Taiwan University, will detail 
Taiwan's efforts to end illegal trade in protected wildlife 
products. 
  Representatives from three private Taiwan conservation 
organizations will also speak in the NGO sessions, stressing 
Taiwan's determination to eliminate illegal wildlife trade. 
  Before coming to Geneva, the Taiwan delegates attended a 
March 14-18 CITES Asian region conference in Jerusalem.
