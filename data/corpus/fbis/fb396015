  [Text] Geneva, March 21 (CNA) -- The Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) will decide 
whether to call for trade sanctions against Taiwan on March 25, 
CITES Standing Committee Chairman Murray Hosking said Monday [21 
March]. 
  Hosking pointed out that the committee, which opened its 
meeting in Geneva Monday, will discuss on Tuesday the alleged 
trade in rhino horn and tiger bone in Taiwan, Mainland China, 
Hong Kong, South Korea, and Yemen. 
  Hosking pledged that the committee would take into account 
Taiwan's progress in wildlife protection before making a final 
decision on trade sanctions. 
  Taiwan police reportedly visited 519 herbal medicine stores 
out of 8,000 on the island March 15-17 and found seven selling 
rhino horn powder and 27 selling tiger bone. 
  The findings run counter to allegations by Britain's 
Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), which claimed that 
rhino horn powder and tiger bone are still available at more 
than half of all Chinese medicine shops in Taiwan. 
  Meanwhile, during a meeting of non-government organizations 
(NGO) following the CITES Standing Committee meeting on Monday, 
EIA aired a 20-minute videotape which said more than 90 percent 
of the rhinoceros killed in South Africa were for the Taiwan 
market. 
  The Earth Island Institute (EII) and the World Wildlife Fund 
also said Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and 
Yemen conduct trade in illegal wildlife products. 
  Li San-wei, deputy director of the Forestry Department under 
Taiwan's Council of Agriculture and leader of the Taiwan 
delegation to the NGO meeting, noted that he was unable to rebut 
EIA's accusation as he spoke before the videotape was shown. 
  "How could they verify their claims," Li asked. 
  Another delegation member, Chairman Ted Ting of the 
Beautiful 
Taiwan Foundation, worried that the shocking videotape would 
increase the chances that Taiwan will be slapped with CITES 
sanctions. 
  Moreover, Ting noted, any CITES decision will strongly 
influence the United States, which will make a similar decision 
next month. 
  In order to avoid an economic boycott, Taiwan will ask 
delegates from other countries to help defend its wildlife 
conservation efforts at the CITES Standing Committee's Tuesday 
meeting, Li said. 
  As a non-CITES member, Taiwan could only attend the 
EIA-sponsored NGO meeting.

  [Text] Taipei, March 21 (CNA) -- The pen is mightier than 
the sword, Mikhail Gorbachev, former president of the now 
defunct Soviet Union said here Monday [21 March]. 
  "Any attempts to solve problems with weapons have failed," 
he 
said, noting that he expects to see the eventual unification of 
China conducted "in a peaceful manner." 
  Gorbachev, his wife and an eight member entourage arrived in 
Taipei Sunday for a six-day visit at the invitation of the 
UNITED DAILY NEWS newspaper. 
  Commenting on his visit to Taiwan, Gorbachev said "the world 
has changed, and my visit here is a proof of it." 
  "The route from Moscow to Taiwan was once an impossible 
journey," Wang Ti-wu, founder of the newspaper said at a welcome 
dinner Sunday. 
  "The journey has been realized as a result of the new way of 
thought created by president Gorbachev," Wang said. 
  This is Gorbachev's first trip to East Asia since he 
resigned 
as president in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  Gorbachev and wife met with Foreign Affairs Minister Chien 
Fu 
Monday morning over lunch at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Chien and Gorbachev exchanged views on world affairs and 
future prospects for Taiwan-Russian relations. 
  Chien praised Gorbachev as a man of vision and 
open-mindedness. The liberalization movement Gorbachev initiated 
made him a great reformer whose vision changed his country and 
the rest of the world, Chien said. 
  Gorbachev, who presided over the end of the Cold War, the 
breakaway of the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe, and the 
beginning of an end to the US-Russian arms race, will give his 
first speech in Taipei entitled "The World in My Eyes" Monday 
afternoon at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. 
  Later in the day, Gorbachev and party will meet with Premier 
Lien Chan at the Executive Yuan and will attend a dinner hosted 
by Lien in their honor. 
  The 65-year-old Gorbachev, who led the "perestroyka" and 
"glasnost" reforms in his country in the 80s, will speak on "the 
reforms and challenge of Russia" at the Grand Hyatt Taipei 
Tuesday. 
  The Russian statesman, who refers to himself as a columnist, 
said upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport that 
he hopes to meet as many politicians, merchants and students as 
possible during his stay in Taiwan, "so I can get to know the 
Chinese people better." 
  Gorbachev is scheduled to meet with President Li Teng-hui on 
Wednesday and visit the Legislative Yuan Thursday.

  [Text] Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development [CEPD] under the Executive 
Yuan, said at the Legislative Yuan yesterday: The United States 
and Japan, which are our country's largest and second largest 
economic and trading partners, are the countries that President 
Li Teng-hui wants to visit most following implementation of the 
policy of turning southward. Chairman Hsiao went on to say: It 
is possible to choose Central and South Africa as the 
destinations of President Li's second round of vacation trips. 
The CEPD can furnish information for use as reference to the 
Foreign Ministry at any time. 
  Speaking in the Legislative Yuan yesterday, Chairman Hsiao 
Wan-chang said: The countries that President Li wants to visit 
most on vacation are the United States and Japan, which he 
mentioned emphatically during the news conference upon returning 
from his southern tour. Hsiao Wan-chang said: The two nations 
are our country's largest and second largest economic and 
trading partners; their relations with our country are both the 
closest and the most complicated. Hsiao Wan-chang added: The 
CEPD and the Foreign Ministry also have been working hard to 
plan President Li's next round of overseas vacation trips for 
diplomatic purposes. However, it is inappropriate to announce 
the trips before the time is ripe. He also said emphatically: 
On top of its policy of turning southward, the government is 
actually moving in all directions to expand and strengthen 
relations with foreign countries. Any region could be a target 
of its diplomatic efforts.

  [Text] Taipei, March 22 KYODO -- A nonpartisan group of 
eight Japanese parliamentarians arrived in Taipei on Tuesday [22 
March] over an issue of some 452.4 million yen of unsettled 
government bonds bought by Taiwanese before and during World War 
II. 
  The Japanese Diet members said they will hold negotiations 
with 18 Taiwanese counterparts headed by Liu Sung-pan, head of 
the National Assembly, on the issue. 
  They said during their stay in Taiwan, they will also meet 
Taiwanese president Li Teng-hui. 
  The group of eight comprises two opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) parliamentarians and one each from five 
governing parties -- the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] 
(SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and new party Sakigake -- as well 
as one independent. 
  It is the first time for a Japanese Diet group including an 
SDPJ parliamentarian to visit Taiwan for the purpose of 
negotiations since Japan broke its diplomatic relations with the 
island country in 1972. The SDPJ has traditionally backed 
Mainland China since even before 1972. 
  Japan has voiced its intention to refund the unpaid money to 
the Taiwanese from the fiscal 1995 state budget beginning in 
April 1995. 
  Wartime Japanese rulers in Taiwan forced people to deposit 
part of their monthly salaries into postal savings accounts. 
  Many Taiwanese hope to link the unpaid money to indexing, 
saying the value has risen by about 4,500 times from 1943 on the 
basis of Japanese public servant salaries. 
  According to a Japanese Government estimate, the postal 
savings deposits and other unpaid money totaled 452.4 million 
yen owned by about 2,547,000 people. 
  Of the 452.4 million yen, postal savings account for 369 
million yen, postal annuities 1.4 million yen and unpaid 
salaries 82 million yen, according to the estimate. 
  The savings will be recognized as a fixed amount with high 
interest, the sources said. 
  The issue is to be handled the same way the government 
repaid 
the savings of Okinawa residents deposited before the war, the 
sources said. 
  From December 1969 to February 1972, just before the 
reversion of Okinawa to Japan from the United States, the 
government reimbursed 94 million yen in savings to residents, 
adding 339 million yen to the principal as indexing. 
  Japan occupied Taiwan from 1885 to 1945. Before and during 
the war, Japan encouraged the purchase of government bonds not 
only in Japan but also in its former colonies of Korea and 
Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, March 22 (CNA) -- Beijing could toughen its 
policy toward Taiwan if the People's Liberation Army (PLA) gains 
the upper hand in post-Deng Xiaoping power struggles, a Japanese 
scholar said here Tuesday [22 March]. 
  Akio Takahara, an assistant professor at Omilin University 
in 
Tokyo, said during a seminar on Mainland Chinese affairs that 
maintaining an international climate favorable for the 
mainland's economic development and pursuing national 
unification are the two pillars of Beijing's foreign policy. 
  Takahara noted that Deng Xiaoping's personal reputation has 
been a major force preventing the nationalist PLA from 
interfering in Beijing's foreign policy. 
  However, with Deng aging and his influence declining, the 
call for hardline foreign policy has been mounting within the 
PLA, he said. 
  Takahara added that some 100 active-duty and retired 
mainland 
military officers wrote to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) 
Secretary-General Jiang Zemin and paramount leader Deng last 
June, asking them not to yield to American pressure on 
diplomatic affairs. 
  Last August, Takahara said, a group of retired senior PLA 
officers and members of the CCP's Central Military Commission 
also issued a joint statement urging Beijing authorities to 
harden policy toward the United States. 
  In response to those calls, Beijing's Politburo, while 
reiterating a moderate line in dealing with the US, declared a 
"four no's" policy -- no confrontation, no provocation, no 
evasion and no fear -- in handling diplomatic affairs last 
September. 
  Takahara observed that Deng has supported a moderate stance 
toward the US partly because he feared that a rift between 
Beijing and Washington might push America closer to Taiwan. 
  Takahara said after Deng dies, the hardline faction in the 
PLA will very likely have a greater say in Beijing's 
decision-making. By then, he predicted that the 
"Taipei-Beijing-Washington" relations triangle may change 
greatly. 
  The mainland affairs seminar, which opened Monday, is being 
sponsored by National Chengchi University, with more than 100 
Taiwan and Japanese scholars participating.

  [Text] Taipei, March 22 (CNA) -- Taiwan businessmen can 
make a stronger impact on the Japanese market by collecting 
their strength under the same roof, according to President 
Samuel Chu of the Taiwan Trade Development Co. Ltd. 
  Chu made the remarks upon returning from a visit to Tokyo 
Monday [21 March] to finalize plans for the Taiwan trade center. 
  Chu said the trade center will be housed in a 3,600 square 
meter building located in downtown Tokyo and aims to gather the 
strength of Taiwan businessmen in Japan. 
  The building was purchased last October by the Kuomintang 
Business Management Committee for US$113 million. Space in the 
building will be rented to Taiwan enterprises at lower than 
market prices, Chu explained. 
  The center will replace the Far East Trade Center, which is 
the current meeting place for Taiwan businessmen in Japan but is 
too small, Chu added. 
  So far, a group of Taiwan enterprises have rented offices in 
the nine-floor Taiwan Trade Center, including Kokuei, UMC, China 
Airlines, and Eva Airways.

  [Text] Manila, March 20 (CNA) -- The Philippine Department 
of Trade and Investment (DTI) has reached an agreement with 
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs on a long-term loan 
assistance program for the development of small and medium sized 
enterprises. 
  DTI Undersecretary Tomas I. Alcantara said the Taiwan 
Government has agreed to extend loans worth US$10 million 
through the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund 
and the Industrial Cooperation Center. 
  The amount, however, could be increased to US$100 million 
after two years depending on the success of the initial program 
and on the needs of the users. 
  Under the plan, the amount will be lent to the Development 
Bank of the Philippines [DBP] for a 10-year period with an 
annual interest rate of 3 percent and a three year grace period. 
  The DBP will in turn re-lend the money to the private sector 
for a maximum of five years at lower than market rates, 
Alcantara said. 
  At least five sectors have been considered for the 
assistance 
package, including the metal, tool and die, garment, component 
manufacturing, and equipment and electric industries, he added.

  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA)-- China's capital city 
Beijing intends to attract more foreign investment to boost its 
booming infrastructure construction, according to Mayor Li Qiyan. 
  Li made this remark at a recent municipal foreign economic 
and trade meeting. 
  He said that the current international and domestic 
situation 
helps pave the way for further use of foreign funds, but a 
better environment for such investment is badly needed. 
  As world consortiums, financiers and transnational firms 
have 
kept pouring into Beijing to seek opportunities since the 
beginning of the year, the emphasis of the work should be placed 
on creating favorable conditions for foreign investment and 
cooperation, he said. 
  In the first month of this year, the number of the 
newly-built companies with over 10 million U.S. dollars 
investment each reached 20. The biggest of them were two real 
estate corporations, each having a total investment of 60 
million U.S. dollars. 
  And by the end of January the municipal government had 
approved 7,783 foreign-funded firms and directly used more than 
10.71 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds. 
  Explaining the reason for promoting the role of foreign 
investment, Deputy Mayor Lu Yucheng said that the drive will 
focus on encouraging the attraction of more foreign funds, the 
setting up of more businesses, more project construction and 
more profits earned this year. 
  Lu also said that the majority of the foreign funds will be 
guided into the construction of urban infrastructure facilities 
and development zones of various kinds, as well as into the 
mainstay industries such as automobiles, electronics and 
building materials. 
  In addition, he said, full use should be made of world trade 
information networks to provide more information services for 
both investors and those who need investment. 
  And the drawing up of laws and regulations concerning 
foreign 
economic trade and co-operation should be strengthened to 
protect the foreign businessmen's legal rights and interests in 
China. 
  Administrative formalities should be simplified and work 
efficiency should be improved in order to provide a coordinated 
servicing process. 
  In 1994 the city will pour more funds into the construction 
of major projects such as the capital's subways, expressways and 
power plants. 
  The construction of first-class economic and technology 
development zones will also be stepped up through Sino-foreign 
co-operation. 
  Lu also said that Beijing is now probing for ways to 
establish Sino-foreign shareholding companies. 
  For this reason, the companies that are already listed are 
encouraged to issue B and H shares, and the financial 
institutions to issue bonds abroad, while infrastructure 
projects will try the BOT (building, operation and transfer) 
channel.

  [Text] On 4 March, Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal 
party committee, invited chairman and vice chairmen of the 
Beijing Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang to a 
heart-to-heart talk. 
  At 1500 that afternoon, leading comrades of the municipal 
revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang walked to a meeting 
room of the organ of the municipal party committee, where 
Comrade Chen Xitong had already stayed. Chen Xitong happily 
said: Today, I invite comrades of the Kuomintang Committee, a 
friendly party of ours, here to have a talk. There are already 
the system of political consultation and the forms of special 
report meetings and forums. But, the small-scale heart-to-heart 
talks are very limited. Now that you are invited to a 
heart-to-heart talk today, you may make yourselves at home and 
chatter away about this and that, such as international and 
domestic situation, the modernization of the capital, the united 
front work, and the difficulties and problems requiring our help 
and solution. 
  Amid the cordial and warm atmosphere, comrades of the 
committee of Kuomintang, expressed their opinions on the 
multiparty cooperation led by the CPC, on participation in and 
discussion of political affairs, on democratic supervision, on 
overseas propaganda, and on self-construction. Some comrades 
said with deep feeling: Through heart-to-heart talks, our 
affection with municipal leading comrades has become closer and 
we are greatly inspired. Comrades participating in the talk 
maintained that this form of talk was good and convenient for 
them to speak their mind freely. 
  During the three-hour talk, Chen Xitong continuously 
exchanged opinions and ideas with Kuomintang comrades. He said: 
In upholding the principles of long-term coexistence and mutual 
supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and sharing 
honor or disgrace, the key lies in showing utter devotion to 
each other. Only by having a heart-to-heart talk can we 
establish a profound friendship and can we coexist for a long 
time and supervise each other in an even better way. Today's 
heart-to-heart talk is the first of its kind between us. From 
now on, we should strengthen contacts through diverse forms. 
The CPC and the revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang share 
the same goal, that is, to make China strong and prosperous at 
an earlier date and to build the socialism with Chinese 
characteristics that was advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. 
Therefore, the revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang has no 
reason to refuse to participate in the multiparty cooperation 
and has no reason to refuse to inherit and carry forward the 
fine tradition of showing utter devotion to each other, that had 
been manifested between Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and the old 
generation of leaders of democratic parties. 
  Chen Xitong sincerely hoped that the revolutionary committee 
of the Kuomintang would recommend its comrades to hold leading 
posts at pertinent government departments. He added: The CPC

  [Excerpt] The municipal intermediate people's court held a 
meeting on 4 March to pronounce strict punishments on a number 
of criminals who robbed taxis and cruelly killed the drivers. 
Six criminals guilty of the most heinous crimes were escorted 
to the execution ground and shot to death. 
  Among the serious criminal activities, cases on robbing taxi 
drivers and stealing taxis have increased notably. In 1993, 273 
such cases occurred, 340 percent more than in 1992. Of the 
total, 165 were cases on robbery of taxi drivers, an increase of 
217 percent over 1992; and 108 were cases on stealing of taxis, 
a substantial increase. Such criminal activities damaging taxi 
drivers have greatly threatened the public security of the 
capital and the lives and property of the people. Implementing 
the principle of dealing strict blows to criminal activities, 
Beijing's public security and judicial departments concentrated 
forces and devoted time to strictly crack down on robbery and 
stealing of taxis and other criminal activities. 
  The six criminals who were executed on 4 March were Zhang 
Yong and Liang Cuifa, peasants from Wuji County of Hebei 
Province, who ganged up and fled to Beijing to rob a taxi and 
cruelly killed the driver; Fu Qiang, a jobless person, and his 
partners Li Feng and Du Guijun, who robbed taxis and killed the 
drivers on many occasions; and Wang Shili, a jobless person, who 
anesthetized taxi drivers and robbed money from them on many 
occasions. Liang Zhaoming, Liu Xiaogang, Qi Shoufeng, Liu 
Quanlu, and Wang Guoli, who also joined the above-mentioned 
criminal activities, were sentenced to life imprisonment or 
fixed-term imprisonment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The savings deposits 
of local people in both urban and rural areas of Beijing showed 
a sharp increase in the first two months of this year. 
  Figures released by the municipal people's bank show that 
the 
city's total savings deposits by the end of February amounted to 
62.6 billion yuan. 
  In 1993 the city saw a record amount of savings deposits of 
17.27 billion yuan. This year saw a continuing growth, with a 
total of 2.65 billion yuan added in January, up 1.21 billion 
yuan from the average monthly increase in 1993. 
  In February the city had another 3.43-billion-yuan increase 
in savings deposits, a hefty 6.07-percent rise from the same 
period last year. 
  The figures also show that residents' income remained 
stable, 
and about 92 percent of the depositors were optimistic about 
future income trends. 
  More aware of risks, local people have reduced blind 
investment and have begun to put more money in the bank. Most 
of them prefer long-term deposits to short-term ones. 
  Of the total increase in savings deposits in the first two 
months of this year, fixed deposits accounted for 97 percent.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Beijingers are now 
enjoying a diversity of non-staple food, thanks to the 
government's efforts last year in lifting food prices. 
  According to a recent conference held here recently on 
suburban livestock farming, the total output of non-staple food 
remained high in 1993, and a range of non-staple food centers 
with high production in the city's suburban areas has taken 
initial shape. 
  These suburban counties provided more than 3.76 million pigs 
last year, a three-percent rise over a year ago. 
  The weight of eggs supplied to the capital's markets jumped 
by 6.2 percent over the figure in the previous year. 
  Over 2.2 million pigs and 171 million kilograms of eggs were 
produced by large and standard farms. 
  To bolster market sales, 62 integrated economic complexes 
and 
670 pig-breeding farms which combine the breeding, production 
and processing in one place, have been built in the suburban 
areas. 
  Hundreds of meat and egg sales centers have been set up 
across the district areas of the city to step up the delivery of 
the non- staple food, so that citizens are able to enjoy the 
food fresh the same day or even within several hours. 
  The city has also set up quarantine stations at the 
municipal 
and county levels and trained about 1,000 quarantine specialists 
to ensure the residents have healthy, clean food. 
  Some 40 quarantine stations have been built alongside the 
highways and roads that lead to the city center and 118 markets 
all have appointed hygiene staff.

enterprises, and effecting a 1 percentage point increase in the 
general index of economic efficiency of the industry at or above 
the township level that exercises independent accounting. The 
readjustment of product mix should be emphasized. The pace of 
technological transformation of enterprises should be 
accelerated. Great efforts should be made to expand and occupy 
market in line with market demands. And attention should be 
paid to grasping competitive projects, creating competitive 
products, striving for first-class quality, and enhancing the

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, March 1 (XINHUA) -- A major green 
campaign aimed at transforming barren mountains into orchards 
has been launched in north Hebei Province. 
  The curtain was lifted on the campaign on last Friday [25 
February] when thousands of explosions echoed among the hills of 
the Taihang Mountains to the west of Shijiazhuang, the 
provincial capital. The blasting will make it possible to form 
fields on hill sides. 
  The vice-director of the city's forestry bureau, Liu 
Zhanzhong, said that from February 25 to March 12, nearly a 
million blastholes of dynamite would be exploded in the 
mountains. 
  The vice-director said these blasts would pave the way for 
the reclaiming of some 13,000 ha. of fields, on which 300,000 
apple trees could be planted. 
  Hebei's campaign is only part of the Chinese Government's 
plan to afforest the Taihang Mountains which run along the 
border between Shanxi and Hebei. 
  In the mountain area, poor vegetation has been causing 
serious erosion, resulting in a rugged terrain and poor water 
conservancy, which, in turn, poses a fundamental difficulty for 
the life of local people and their production efforts. 
  Listed in the "Agenda for the 21st Century" of the Chinese 
Government, the afforestation of the Taihang Mountains will be 
one of the largest environmental construction projects ever 
launched in China. 
  It is also a critical part of global efforts to improve the 
earth environment, and will be carried out as an obligation of 
the Chinese Government to the 1992 United Nations Environment 
and Development Conference. 
  In the first year of full-scale operations on this plan, the 
effort will be concentrated on the development of apple farms, 
and will feature improved management on the side of the 
government, the vice-director said. 
  Besides its effects on the environment, the vice-director 
said the green campaign would also bring about a remarkable 
economic return. 
  The government estimates that in three to five years, these 
hillside orchards will be making 600 million yuan a year for 
local farmers.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The unemployment 
rate in urban areas of northern China's Hebei Province was kept 
at 2.02 percent through the end of last year, lower than the 
national average of 2.6 percent. 
  Figures from the Hebei Provincial Statistics Bureau show 
that 
a total of 300,000 people were newly employed last year, pushing 
the total number of urban employed in Hebei to 6.99 million. 
  It is worth noting that the achievement was made under a 
market mechanism rather than government assignment, which had 
been long practiced before. 
  Officials said that labor markets have been established in 
every major city of the province. A contract worker employment 
system has been promoted in almost all state enterprises in the 
province. 
  More and more young people, especially college graduates, 
have begun to choose careers on their own. A recent survey by 
the Hebei provincial women's federation, for instance, shows 
that women changed jobs more often than men while in the past 
under a planned economy more men changed professions than women. 
  Economic effectiveness has become the major factor for job 
applicants in considering which enterprises they should apply 
to. Those offering higher incomes, including private 
enterprises, have become the favorite choices. Some urban 
residents have even chosen to work in rural enterprises. In the 
past the preference was to work for state enterprises and 
government organs. 
  Officials said that labor markets have also greatly helped 
those workers whose companies have gone bankrupt. For instance, 
over 200 workers left stranded by a wireless electronics factory 
which announced bankruptcy in Shijiazhuang, capital of the 
province, found reemployment very soon through introductions via 
a labor market. Only some 60 workers from the defunct factory 
remained unemployed. 
  A large number of rural laborers have entered cities looking 
for jobs. In Shijiazhuang alone, long-term rural laborers 
topped 200,000, working as drivers, chefs, boiler keepers and 
street cleaners.

  In February 1993 (Ge Shunmin), a peasant of Funing County, 
made acquaintance with (Dai Zhenao), a peasant of Lixian County 
in Baoding Prefecture, and (Guo Airong), a woman from Boli 
County. He bought 45,000 yuan of fake renminbi with the cash of 
15,000 yuan and successively bought commodities worth 400 yuan 
with the fake renminbi at the evening market on Haiyang Road and 
at individual-run stores in Qinghuangdao city. On 8 March, he 
was arrested on the spot by the police when buying a golden ring 
at the Jiaohang Shopping Center.

  [Text] The leaders at various levels must approach from 
the high plane of developing the socialist market economy to 
fully understand the importance and urgency of accelerating the 
setup of the rural and pastoral social service system, 
strengthen the dynamics of work, guide the grass-roots cadres 
and peasants to engage in practice, strive to make a success 
within this year, and promote a fast development of agriculture, 
animal husbandry, and rural and pastoral areas. This is what 
Comrade Wang Qun set forth at the regional forum on setting up 
the rural and pastoral social service system. 
  The regional forum on setting up the rural and pastoral 
social service system was held in Ulanqab League on 26-27 
February. Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee; 
and Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the regional party committee 
and chairman of the regional government, attended and addressed 
the forum. The forum was chaired by Bai Enpei, deputy secretary 
of the regional party committee and head of the regional leading 
group in charge of the rural and pastoral work; and Yun Bulong, 
vice chairman of the regional government. Present at the forum 
were over 60 persons, including responsible persons of leagues 
and cities in charge of agricultural and livestock work, 
regional departments concerned, and some banners and counties. 
  The comrades participating in the forum heard the 
introductions of the experiences in promoting organizational 
reform, developing "leading economy," and setting up the 
socialist service system, gained by Qahar Right Wing Rear 
Banner, Wuchuan County, Tongliao city, Ningcheng County, Linhe 
city, Xi Ujimqin Banner, and three townships and villages of 
Qahar Right Wing Rear Banner and Liangcheng County; and also 
proceeded from reality to deeply discuss the issues of deepening 
reform and accelerating the setup of the overall service system. 
  Comrade Wang Qun prominently stressed the important 
significance of setting up and perfecting the rural and pastoral 
social service system. He pointed out: Accelerating the setup 
of the rural and pastoral social service system is an important 
measure for implementing the guidelines of the third session of 
the 14th party Central Committee and the central policy on 
grasping favorable opportunities to deepen reform, expand the 
scale of opening up, promote development, and maintain 
stability; a priority to deepening the rural and pastoral 
reform; a reliable way for speeding up economic development and 
making the people, towns, townships, sumu, banners, and counties 
rich; an urgent demand for promoting organizational reform, the 
change of government functions, and the transfer of personnel, 
alleviating the financial difficulties of banners and counties, 
and maintaining social stability; and the necessary way for 
introducing agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and 
pastoral economy to markets, accelerating the setup of the 
socialist market economic system, promoting the combination of 
urban and rural areas, coordinating development, and making the 
peasants and herdsmen become fairly well-off as soon as 
possible. Setting up a perfect social service system is 
deepening the rural and pastoral reform and accelerating the 
pace of development. This will gigantically promote the 
region's reform, development, and stability. 
  Comrade Wang Qun stressed: Accelerating the setup of the 
rural and pastoral social service system is a hard job. Whether 
or not we win a victory in this battle is a grim test for the 
cadres at various levels. The leaders at various levels should 
be promoters of progress, foster a sense of high responsibility 
and a sense of high urgency, foster the idea that development 
can be accelerated and stability can be maintained only by 
accelerating reform, firmly grasp the current favorable 
opportunity which is conducive to agricultural and livestock 
development, conscientiously conduct study and make 
arrangements, organize forces to boldly engage in practice, and 
strive to make achievements as soon as possible. 
  Comrade Wang Qun urged: The party committees and governments 
at various levels should realistically strengthen the leadership 
over the setup of the rural and pastoral social service system. 
We should persistently streamline superstructure, strengthen 
the grass roots, change functions, intensify service, and 
mobilize a large number of young cadres and science 
professionals and technicians to bring into play their wisdom 
and intelligence at the service organizations. According to the 
"three-conducive" principles and in line with actual conditions, 
we should formulate appropriate policies, conscientiously 
provide service organizations with production bases, and create 
necessary conditions for setting up and developing the service 
system. Leagues, cities, banners, and counties should mobilize 
their leading bodies; organize and send, in a well-planned 
manner, cadres to towns, townships, and sumu; help conduct 
specific study and solve their working problems; and grasp the 
work of townships one after another. 
  Comrade Wu Liji said in his speech: At present, our region 
is entering a new key stage of rural and pastoral reform. The 
broad masses of peasants and herdsmen are advancing from having 
sufficient foods and clothing to being fairly well-off. 
Therefore, we should grasp the current favorable opportunities 
to accelerate the pace of conducting organizational reform and 
setting up an overall service system. It is urgent to 
vigorously develop the "dragon-shaped economy" characterized by 
having peasant households become shareholders of companies, 
linking enterprises with production bases, combining production 
and processing with marketing, and making trade, industry, 
agriculture, animal husbandry, and science a coordinate process. 
The governments at various levels should positively change 
functions and work style, intensify service, and bring into full 
play their functions for serving the rural and pastoral areas, 
the peasants, and the herdsmen. Comrade Wu Liji set forth 
specific opinions on working out necessarily relaxed policies to 
encourage office cadres, science professionals, and technicians 
to positively make contributions at overall service 
organizations.

  [Text] Huhhot, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia 
autonomous region, north China, has been promoting more women to 
leading positions in recent years. 
  Official sources here said the region now has 243,000 women 
cadres -- 34.2 percent of all the cadres in the autonomous 
region. Some 55,000 of the women are from ethnic minorities. 
  Women also make up 23 percent of the regional people's 
congress members and 17.5 percent of the regional committee 
members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, the sources said. 
  The region has set up a computer data bank to provide lists 
of possible women candidates for various positions. 
  The region also sees to it that women cadres are given 
proper 
opportunities to receive professional training and further 
education, so that they can be more qualified to lead.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Nine cities along the 
border areas in Hulun Buir League, north China's Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region, have emerged as world trading centers. 
  Bordering on Russia and Mongolia, the league was approved in 
1988 to be built into an experimental zone for China's economic 
structural reform. 
  It has since then built nine port cities with modern 
railway, 
highway and airport connections and opened more than 10 tourist 
routes leading to Russia and Mongolia. 
  In 1993, the trade volume handled by the nine cities added 
up 
to 804 million Swiss francs, a hefty 120 percent rise from 1992. 
  Overseas economic and technological cooperations in the 
region have also expanded to involve Japan, the Republic of 
Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, the United States, 
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. 
  Last year, the region implemented 151 such cooperation 
contracts, totalling 60.21 million Swiss francs. It also used 
72 million yuan in foreign funds to build 44 joint ventures. 
  In addition, the number of foreign tourists in the league 
topped 100,000 people, with a total turnover of 65 million yuan, 
including 400,000 U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The living standards 
of herdsmen in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 
have improved markedly in recent years. 
  Official sources here said that nearly 90 percent of the 
region's 420,000 herdsman families, who once lived as nomads, 
have settled down in permanent housing. 
  In 1993, the income for each of the region's 1.895 million 
pastoral population averaged 1,164 yuan. 
  An official survey shows that there were 58 television sets, 
36 motorcycles and 47 sets of windmill power generators per 100 
families. 
  Rising living standards are the result of much improved farm 
conditions, the sources said. 
  Since 1987, the region has upgraded nearly two million ha 
[hectare] of poor grassland into high-yielding pastures and 
built irrigation facilities on 80,000 ha of pastures. 
  The region has also built 32.87 million square m of barns, 
which now accommodate 80 percent of its farm stock. 
  On average, every 38 herdsman families now possess a feed 
warehouse and every 13 families a set of feed harvesting and 
processing machines, according to the sources. 
  The sources said all these have helped put herdsmen in a 
better position to combat snow, frost and other natural 
disasters. 
  With the improvement in efficiency in stock raising, the 
sources said, some 300,000 herdsmen in the region have given up 
herding for industrial or commercial positions.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 20 (XINHUA) -- In the next few years, 
northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region aims to 
improve its people's living standard to the front rank of all 
China's localities. 
  That is the aim of a blueprint called "Stepping Into the 
Front Rank," which will be implemented from this year, according 
to the autonomous regional government. 
  Officials say the aim was made in line with one of Deng 
Xiaoping's speeches in 1987 on the future development of the 
autonomous region. Officials quoted him as saying that Inner 
Mongolia might well "step into the front rank" in the future 
since it has a vast grassland and a relatively sparse population. 
  Agriculture, animal husbandry, coal, electricity, 
metallurgical industry, petrochemical industry, construction 
materials industry, wool spinning industry and forestry will be 
developed as leading sectors to boost the locality as one of 
China's major producing areas in basic industries. 
  Officials say Inner Mongolia is facing a rare development 
opportunity now as the central government, stressing the 
development of remote areas inhabited by ethnic minority 
nationalities, has brought in a series of preferential policies 
for them. 
  In addition, they say enterprises producing raw materials 
will become more competitive in national market as China has 
freed the price of most energy and raw materials. 
  Other favorable conditions for the region's growth include 
its closeness to Beijing and Tianjin cities and neighboring to 
northeast and northwest China. And the past 40 years of 
construction have laid a certain material basis, local officials 
said. 
  According to the plan, this year the autonomous region is to 
raise its total output value of agriculture and animal husbandry 
to 20.5 billion yuan, up 6 percent over 1993. Grain production 
will be maintained at more than 10 billion kg and heads of 
livestock are to reach 56.50 million. 
  A dozen model townships and villages will be set up as 
examples to become prosperous ahead of others. 
  By the end of this century, major bases for the production 
of 
corn, wheat, soybean and beef will be established. 
  A dozen major thermal power plants will be expanded to 
convert more coal into electricity. The electricity will then 
be transmitted to neighboring areas which now use most of the 
coal rather than electricity shipped in from Inner Mongolia. 
  Further reforms will be carried out in state enterprises as 
a 
way to revive them. And more local specialized markets will 
come into being, covering grain, fur and leather, meat, 
medicinal herbs, wood, coal, iron and steel, construction 
materials, oil and textile products.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 20 (XINHUA) -- The gross domestic 
production of 39 towns and seven villages each exceeded 100 
million yuan, and that of 159 villages exceeded 10 million yuan 
over the past year, according to a recent announcement by north 
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  One of the towns on the list is Qiaobao, in the suburbs of 
Hohhot, the regional capital. It made 670 million yuan from 
farming and manufacturing last year and was listed among the 
"top 100 towns in China" by the Ministry of Agriculture and the 
Ministry of Civil Affairs. 
  The village now supplies millions of tons of vegetables, 
meat, fish, eggs and milk to the regional capital each year and 
operates 1,491 enterprises in garment making, breeding, soft 
drinks, and foodstuffs as against only a brick kiln in the past. 
  In 1993, residents in the town earned 3,183 yuan on average 
and the housing space averaged 37 square meters per person. 
  Another name on the top of the list is Gongnong Village on 
the outskirts of Chifeng City. In fact, it has won the title of 
the richest village in Inner Mongolia for three consecutive 
years since 1990. 
  The small village now owns 17 large enterprises in 
machinery, 
cable, construction materials, drinks and building industries. 
Its almond drink won a gold medal at the first national fair of 
light industrial products. 
  In 1993, the village's agricultural and industrial output 
value exceeded 100 million yuan, and the villagers' average 
income reached 2,000 yuan. 
  Hedong town in the suburbs of Baotou, a major iron and steel 
center in north China, is also on the top of the list. Its 
agricultural and industrial output value hit 410 million yuan in 
1993. 
  Now there are 1,300 enterprises, including a fine hotel with 
an investment of 10 million yuan, a joint venture flour mill 
with an investment of 70 million yuan, a joint venture porcelain 
company with an investment of 100 million yuan and the second 
largest farm products marketplace in Baotou. 
  In 1993, the output value for each of eight of these 
enterprises exceeded 10 million yuan, and that for each of 14 
others exceeded five million yuan. 
  The town is now among the 300 towns with the biggest 
industrial base in China. The average annual income for its 
residents was 1,800 yuan in 1993.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 16 (XINHUA) -- More than 400,000 
herdsmen in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 
reported an average annual income of over 1,500 yuan last year, 
with the most at 4,000 yuan. 
  Statistics from the autonomous regional government show that 
this upper one-fourth of the total number of herdsmen in the 
region are living more comfortably than in the past. 
  Most of the herdsmen who have become well off have 
cultivated 
their own pastures and grasslands with good irrigation 
facilities, silages and permanent livestock shelters. These 
facilities have made them better able to resist natural 
disasters. 
  Statistics show that the number of new and hybrid livestock 
totalled 27.58 million, or 54.65 percent, of all livestock in 
the region. The improvement of new species of domestic animals 
has highly raised the returns of animal husbandry. 
  In the past, large animals were few and most livestock 
consisted of small animals of lower species, local officials 
said. 
  In addition, they said that the introduction of a contract 
system greatly improved herdsmen's enthusiasm in grooming fields 
and grassland. Science and technology service stations were 
also established in almost every township (sumu) to provide 
training in new techniques to local herdsmen. 
  As a result, the total number of livestock reached 55.78 
million head last year, up 197,800 over the previous year. The 
general output value of animal husbandry topped 6.48 billion 
yuan, an increase of 41,900 yuan over 1992. 
  Officials said the net income of all the herdsmen in the 
autonomous region increased by an average of over 100 yuan last 
year.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia 
section of the north China shelter belt project, known as the 
Green Great Wall, has yielded good biological and economic 
returns over 15 years of construction, according to local 
officials here today. 
  The official from the region's Forestry Department said 
that, 
since 1986, the region has planted a total of 3.2 million ha 
[hectare] of trees on farms, pastures, barren mountains and 
deserts. 
  These trees are now protecting 65 percent of the 1.53 
million 
ha of farmland in the region's major cereal-producing area from 
sandstorms. 
  The forest coverage of these areas has risen from 5.5 
percent 
to 20.8 percent. 
  More than 667,000 ha of pastures in the region are now also 
under the protection of windbreaks. 
  Even in Horqin and Mu Us, the region's two largest deserts, 
the forest coverage has gone up to 20 percent. 
  Since 1986, the regional government has invested 633.73 
million yuan and 136.72 labor days in the greening campaign, 
which forms part of a national program to build a shelterbelt in 
northern China. 
  The region will go on greening mountains and deserts that 
are 
farther from human inhabitation. 
  Meanwhile, the region will plant more orchards, which 
promise 
greater short-term benefits and can help local farmers prosper 
faster and in a more direct way.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, Gao Dezhan, secretary of the 
municipal party committee, discussed the government work report 
in the capacity of a deputy along with delegation from Heping 
District and jointly discussed with them the major plans for 
invigorating Tianjin. He stressed in his speech: Party and 
government leading cadres at all levels should firmly cultivate 
a mass viewpoint, conscientiously implement the mass line, exert 
utmost efforts to do practical things for the masses, try by all 
possible means to do practical things for enterprises, fully 
mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, further 
pool the efforts of all sectors, work with one heart and one 
mind, seek development with all-out efforts, and create 
brilliant achievements in Tianjin. 
  After listing to speeches given by several deputies, Gao 
Dezhan said: All of you have great confidence in Tianjin's 
development prospects and unanimously held that the development 
objectives defined by the municipal authorities are encouraging, 
in conformity with Tianjin's reality, and fully reflect the will 
of the people across the municipality. This has strengthened the 
confidence of the municipal party committee and the municipal 
government in doing their work well. Certainly, to realize the 
development objectives and comprehensively fulfill all tasks of 
this year, we will face many difficulties. This requires our 
painstaking efforts to successfully carry out all fields of 
work. The most important is that leading cadres at all levels 
should firmly bear in mind the fundamental purpose of 
wholeheartedly serving the people under the new situation. It 
is necessary to fully understand that strengthening the 
flesh-blood ties between the party and the masses of people is a 
fundamental political issue. Even all things change, the 
original aim will not change. We must not slightly slacken our 
efforts in this fundamental issue or forget it under any 
circumstances. The people's feelings and complaints are the 
most important because they directly affect the success or 
failure of our work. If we do a good job in resolving this 
issue, we will overcome all difficulties and make our 
undertakings more invigorating. 
  Gao Dezhan said: We must carry out all party and government 
tasks and all activities for the sake of the people and uphold 
Comrade Xiaoping's "three criteria," particularly the things 
that are conducive for raising the people's living standards. 
Therefore, party committees and governments at all levels should 
regard the immediate interests of the people as a matter of 
prime importance and as the fundamental starting and resting 
points for doing all work. All issues that affect the basic 
living standards of the people should be regarded as the major 
and urgent matters. No one is allowed to treat them 
indifferently or adopt an unconcerned attitude. Through our 
efforts, we should help the people eliminate misgivings, seek 
benefits, enable them to enjoy real benefits and see the hopes. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: The masses are the sources of strength 
and the foundation for achieving success. The working class and 
the masses of people across the municipality are the masters, 
the mainstay, and main forces for invigorating Tianjin and 
creating brilliant achievements. The past brilliant achievements 
were created by the people across the municipality and the new 
historical chapter must also be written by them. Leaders at all 
levels must truly and wholeheartedly rely on the broad masses 
of people, go to the grass roots and the masses while doing each 
and every work, organize the masses, boost their enthusiasm, 
respect their will, and give full play to their pioneering 
spirit. This is essential for implementing the party's basic 
line and doing all tasks well, and should be regarded as one of 
the important criteria for evaluating leading cadres at all 
levels. 
  Gao Dezhan said: The higher the enthusiasm of the masses is, 
the more concern the leading cadres at all levels should give to 
the masses, particularly those with difficulties in their living 
standards. Tianjin has good traditions for doing practical 
things for the masses. We should continue to display this good 
tradition , and unceasingly enhance the level of doing practical 
things. When doing practical things, the thing of prime 
importance is to do it with real efforts, turn all things we 
managed into a success, and enable the masses to enjoy real 
benefits. To do practical things, the most important is to 
unceasingly raise the income of urban and rural people under the 
premise of deepening reform, developing production, improving 
management, and raising efficiency, and let the people have 
money in their pockets. This is a major matter which the party 
committees and governments at all levels should do. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed in particular: Doing practical things 
for enterprises is also very important. Doing practical things 
for enterprises and the masses is an issue with two aspects. 
When enterprises are invigorating, the workers will become 
prosperous; when enterprises are not successfully managed, 
Tianjin will have no hope and the living standards of the broad 
masses of workers will be hard to improve. We should try by all 
possible means to invigorate enterprises. Well-managed 
enterprises should become more invigorating and difficult 
enterprises should have a turn for the better. Pertinent 
departments at all levels, departments dealing with 
comprehensive work, and administrative law-enforcing departments 
should further enhance the concept of serving enterprises, 
change functions, streamline organs, change work style, do 
practical things for enterprises on their own initiative, help 
them solve problems, provide timely help, change their 
operational mechanism, and create a good external environment 
for enterprises. Enterprises should also use reform as a 
motivation, strive to successfully readjust structure, develop 
products, strengthen management, conduct technological 
transformation, train workers, build leading bodies, deeply tap 
potential, and improve their own skills. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed in conclusion: The masses are the 
foundation of society and enterprises are the foundation of the 
economy. As long as we exert utmost efforts to do practical 
things for the masses, try by all possible means to do practical 
things for enterprises, and rely on the strength and wisdom of 
the masses of people, we will surely make the work of Tianjin a 
success.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Northern China's 
Tianjin city will develop its subterranean heat resources to 
meet the increasing demand for energy. 
  This was announced by an official from the Tianjin municipal 
government at a recent conference. 
  The city, rich in geothermal energy sources, has reserves of 
underground hot water estimated at 7.876 billion cubic meters. 
  Baodi County, north of Tianjin city, has the biggest 
reserves 
of the city's subterranean hot water, which cover a total area 
of 8,700 sq km. Ten of these heat fields, extending to 3,074 
square kilometers, are especially rich in underground heat 
resources. 
  The underground hot water, with temperatures between 25 and 
150 degrees centigrade, is widely used in the city's timber 
manufacturing, home heating, domestic hot water supplies, 
greenhouses, warm water swimming pools, and scientific 
experiments. 
  The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has so far 
invested tens of millions of yuan in exploration of the city's 
underground heat resources. The United Nations Development 
Program has also invested five million U.S. dollars in the 
exploration. 
  The city has by now tapped more than 250 underground hot 
water reservoirs. The deepest involved drilling to a depth of 
3,654 meters and the hottest is 98 degrees centigrade. 
  The city uses about 38 million cubic meters of underground 
hot water annually, with thermal energy equal to that produced 
by 2.5 million tons of coal. 
  Tianjin is one of the biggest underground heat energy 
centres 
in China. More than 140 overseas experts have visited the city 
to exchange views on the exploration of underground heat 
resources. 
  Business people from the United States, Iceland, France, 
Italy, New Zealand and Japan have expressed interest in 
investing in the development of the city's subterranean heat 
resources. 
  A Tianjin-Hong Kong venture was set up earlier this year to 
exploit this resource. 
  So far more than 80 countries and regions have explored and 
made use of their own underground heat energy resources.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, the biggest 
port city in north China, will pool more than 800 million yuan 
to boost its booming transport construction this year. 
  According to a local transport construction planning 
official, Tianjin will be built into a transport hub connected 
with most of the big cities across the country and around the 
world by the end of the century. 
  So far, a fast, efficient transport system by air, land and 
sea has taken initial shape in the city, he said. 
  In 1993, the city reported a total shipping cargo throughput 
of 37 million tons, with rail transport totalling over 90 
million tons. 
  The gross export value through the port city last year added 
up to 12.5 billion U.S. dollars, and more than 33 million people 
came into China or went abroad by way of Tianjin. 
  Tianjin, open to navigation for more than 2,000 years, 
boasts 
a favorable geographic position in the development of China's 
market economy. 
  Since the founding of New China, the city has invested more 
than four billion yuan to construct and expand the port. The 
Tianjin port now has more than 130 berths, including 47 
ten-thousand-ton berths. 
  It is also a container shipping port, with the largest 
annual 
handling capacity in China. It has business ties with more than 
160 countries and regions throughout the world and has at least 
30 scheduled shipping routes. 
  Transportation on land has also been brisk, and a network of 
railways and highways has been built to link Tianjin with both 
the coastal boom cities and the inland ones. 
  In addition to the country's main railway lines passing 
through the city, there is also a length of 136 kilometers of 
local railways which joins the port to the district areas. 
  Also, seven highways of national standard and one 142-km 
expressway link Tianjin to the country's capital of Beijing and 
the Tanggu Port Area. Roads in the city add up to 4088 
kilometers in total length. 
  Now, it is only a 1.5-hour drive to get from downtown 
Tianjin 
to Beijing, a 30-minute drive to the Tianjin port and a 
10-minute drive to the airport. 
  The city's air transport has also gained momentum over the 
past few years. The Tianjin airport has opened 198 scheduled 
flights to 28 domestic cities and to many countries and regions 
around the world, including the Republic of Korea, Russia, 
Japan, Ukraine and Hong Kong. 
  It has an annual passenger transport capacity of two million 
people and a capacity for 80,000 tons in cargo. The figures are 
expected to double by the year 2000. 
  Thanks to the efforts made in developing the rural traffic 
and transport system, highways are available to more than 3,800 
villages in its suburbs. Foreign-funded companies are also 
emerging in the remote villages. 
  In addition, the city also has an underground oil pipeline 
of 
203 kilometers that helps to ease the pressure of loading and 
unloading oil tankers in the Tianjin port.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The auto industry of 
north China's Tianjin Municipality, centering on the production 
of Xiali sedan cars introduced from Japan, has burgeoned rapidly. 
  Tianjin first imported production technology and equipment 
from the Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd., of Japan in 1986 to produce a 
type of midget car named Xiali. 
  During the past eight years, growing market demand and 
unceasing expansion of its production scale has made the auto 
industry Tianjin's number one profit-earner. 
  Some 50,000 Xiali sedans rolled off the production line in 
1993 alone, with output value and profits both holding first 
place among all of the city's industrial sectors. 
  The flourishing of the auto industry has also stimulated 
development of many related local economic sectors. 
  At present, Tianjin lays claim to the title of the country's 
second largest sedan producer after Shanghai, which produces 
Volkswagen Santanas in cooperation with Germany. 
  Since 1990, Xiali sedan cars have been in great demand on 
the 
domestic market due mainly to the rapid development of China's 
taxi service, according to the manager of the Tianjin auto 
marketing company. 
  With the advantage of low prices and low operating costs, 
Xiali sedans account for the majority of cars in taxi service. 
  Half of the 100,000 Xiali cars already sold have been put 
into taxi service all over the country, and many have been 
bought directly by individual taxi drivers, the manager said. 
  Tianjin Municipality has stressed further input to develop 
its Xiali auto industry. Innovation and extension projects are 
under way. 
  By the year 1995, annual output will be increased to 150,000 
and the usage rate of domestically-made spare parts will reach 
85 percent.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- The ongoing session 
of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) has received 
12,352 letters from people throughout China since its opening on 
March 10. 
  Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, has paid 
attention to the letters and asked relevant leaders and 
departments to handle them properly. 
  Compared with letters in the past, this year's letters show 
greater concern on state affairs and people's livelihood, such 
as inflation, anti-corruption, social order, reducing peasants' 
burden, and the living standard of retired officials and workers. 
  The letters this year also express the hope that NPC and its 
Standing Committee will accelerate economic legislation and 
strengthen supervision over law enforcement. 
  The letters handling group of the current NPC session has 
classified the letters, sending those involving state affairs to 
top leaders, and asking relevant departments or localities to 
handle specific issues raised by the letters.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said today the Chinese Government pays close attention to 
maintaining basic price stability and will take measures to 
control price increases this year within the range set in his 
government work report. 
  The just-adopted government work report has spelled out this 
year's price control goal, he told a reception for Chinese and 
foreign reporters. 
  Therefore, to stabilize prices is a common task of 
enterprises and the entire society, as well as governments and 
relevant departments at all levels. 
  He attributed price increases to a variety of factors. One 
factor is that prices were raised to rationalize price relations 
and establish a rational pricing mechanism in an effort to shift 
to a market economy. 
  Other factors included an overextended scale of investment 
in 
fixed assets and an excessive increase in consumption funds. 
  It should be noted that since China initiated the policy of 
reforms and opening up, "we have taken a gradual approach in 
reforming the price system. In implementing every price reform 
measure, we have taken in full consideration the tolerance of 
the state, enterprises and the people, thus avoiding major 
repercussions," he said. 
  "Practice shows that the approach is successful," he said. 
  He listed the following measures to maintain basic price 
stability: 
  -- Maintaining a basic balance of commodities supply and 
demand by stabilizing the production of grain, cotton and other 
farm products; 
  -- Continuing to exercise macro-controls over the prices 
of important commodities vital to the national economy and 
people's livelihood; and 
  -- Taking a series of measures to resolutely control 
excessive increases in fixed assets investment and the overissue 
of currency.

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] Addressing a recent provincial auditing work 
conference, both Governor Fu Xishou and Vice Governor Wang Yang 
stressed the following: Developing a socialist market economy 
requires enhancing the supervision of auditing; auditing organs 
should devote attention to doing a good auditing job at 
financial, monetary, and government departments, at key 
enterprises, and in the areas of fixed assets investment and 
funds for agricultural investment, so as to ensure a sustained, 
fast, and healthy development of the national economy. 
  Wang Yang noted that last year various levels of auditing 
organs stepped up effective auditing of financial and taxation 
departments; key enterprises; grain enterprises; overall 
investment funds for agriculture; new basic construction 
projects; and grain procurement funds; they thus made a positive 
contribution to accelerating Anhui's economic development and 
won the praise of the provincial CPC committee and provincial 
government. 
  Wang Yang pointed out: This year marks the most intensive 
introduction of new reform measures in 14 years of implementing 
the policy of reform and opening up. Therefore, when arranging 
this year's auditing tasks, auditing organs must perform their 
auditing tasks from the perspective of helping to establish a 
socialist market economic system. The main auditing targets for 
this year include auditing financial and monetary departments; 
key enterprises; auditing of fixed assets investments; 
agricultural funds; foreign investment funds; and government 
departments. 
  Wang Yang pointed out that it is necessary to vigorously 
promote the establishment of auditor offices to meet the 
requirements for establishing a socialist market economy. 
Auditors offices can fulfill a useful function by helping to 
transform enterprises, checking enterprises' finances and 
inventories, determining property rights, sorting out debts, 
assessing property, and verifying corporate shares. Auditor 
offices can also fulfill a great function by helping to 
understand problems at Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative 
enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises, an can 
improve enterprises' management, raise efficiency, and protect 
their legitimate rights. Therefore, all levels of auditing 
organs are required to support auditor offices and step up 
supervising, providing guidance, and managing auditors offices. 
  To do an efficient job, Wang Yang said auditing departments 
must study well, do a good job in reforming their departments, 
explore new auditing methods, and understand the important 
points of the economic structural reform. 
  Lastly, Governor Fu Xishou raised three requirements. First, 
he said developing a socialist market economy requires 
strengthening supervision through auditing. Supervision 
through auditing is an indispensable part in our efforts to 
build a socialist legal system. The establishment and 
improvement of a socialist market economic system needs to be 
standardized and protected by a sound legal system and, 
therefore, requires us to enhance and improve the administration 
of justice and the enforcement of administrative and other laws. 
It is very important to exercise supervision over the 
enforcement of auditing laws. Second, the governments at all 
levels should further enhance their leadership over auditing 
work, support auditing organs to independently exercise the 
right of supervision over auditing work according to the law, 
support subordinate auditing organs in reporting their work to 
superior auditing organs, support auditing organs in solving 
problems, and proceeding from the requirements for ensuring the 
healthy development of the economy, provide guidance to auditing 
organs to carry out major auditing work. Third, it is necessary 
to step up the building of the contingent of auditing workers, 
to further raise the auditing quality; to maintain and encourage 
honesty, fairness, strictness, and the spirit of dedication, to 
firmly foster a consciousness of subordinating themselves to and 
serving the central task of economic construction, to further 
improve their work style, and to enhance their dedication and 
sense of responsibility so as to fulfill their tasks splendidly 
and ingeniously.

  [Text] Hefei, March 9 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province has been speeding up the construction of towns on its 
vast plain between the Chang Jiang and Huaihe river over the 
past few years as part of its efforts to advance economic 
development. 
  At the end of last year, the province had a total of 754 
towns under the county level and 2,498 rural market towns. 
  In 1993, the province spent more than 2.19 billion yuan on 
the construction of public facilities, industrial buildings and 
civil residences in towns. 
  Linking cities and the countryside, towns have become a 
reservoir of surplus labor forces in the countryside. 
  Four towns in Tongling county absorbed more than 16,300 
surplus laborers from the countryside, and 22 towns of Huaibei 
city received nearly 110,000 farmers. 
  Towns have also become a spring-board for farmers to break 
away from agriculture and engage in other occupations. 
  In a town of Huaibei city more than 13,200 farmers found 
jobs. 
  Township enterprises also take advantage of the location of 
towns to edge into urban markets. 
  In Feidong county, markets in 10 minor cities and towns 
registered a business volume of 330 million yuan. In Caohu 
city, township enterprises in 11 towns reported an output value 
of 1.09 billion yuan last year, a great increase in comparison 
with a few years ago. 
  Because of the accelerated urbanization of the countryside 
in 
the province, which used to be widely known as a poor 
agricultural area, the economic gap between its urban and rural 
areas is narrowing.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 14 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Zhejiang Province has set up a securities register and exchange 
center as one of the measures to expand the circulation of funds. 
  The establishment of this center, according to economists, 
marks the initiation of a multi-layered financial market system 
in this economically developed province. 
  To further the reform of the financial system, Zhejiang has 
over the past few years established a host of fund-circulation 
centers, foreign exchange circulation centers and securities 
exchanges. 
  Meanwhile, a multi-layered financial market system, covering 
inter-bank loan markets and foreign exchange swap markets as 
well as securities exchanges, has started to take shape. 
  The province has some 45 securities exchange business 
departments, where people can trade freely stock shares listed 
on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges as well as 
financial bonds, treasury bonds and time certificates. 
  Official sources said that the transaction value in those 
departments reached more than 30 billion yuan last year. 
  According to official statistics, the business done at the 
provincial funds circulation center and foreign exchange 
circulation center hit a record 17.9 billion yuan and 1.94 
billion U.S. dollars last year, up 67.7 percent and 41.2 percent 
from the previous year, respectively. 
  To regulate the expanded and invigorated financial market 
the 
provincial government has drawn up a series of management rules 
and regulations and has set up a competitive pricing system as 
well as automatic price quotation system, aiming at 
standardizing and systematizing the financial market. 
  In addition, the province has opened the financial sector 
wider to the outside world in the last few years. 
  According to official sources, last year the province 
approved its first Sino-foreign joint-stock bank (the Zhejiang 
Commercial Bank) and a solely foreign-funded bank (the Ningbo 
International Bank). 
  The Standard Chartered Bank of Britain has also set up an 
office in Hangzhou, capital of the province. 
  At present, the province is making efforts to boost the work 
of transforming its specialized banks into commercial banks, in 
order to speed up the reform of the financial sector and 
invigorate the financial market. 
  Approved by the People's Bank of China last year, the 
province has stepped up the preparatory work of establishing two 
commercial banks -- the Pudong Development Bank's Hangzhou 
Branch and the China International Trust and Investment 
Corporation (CITIC) Industrial Bank's Hangzhou Branch. 
  The flourishing financial sector has greatly accelerated the 
economic development of the province. Official statistics show 
that last year the provincial gross domestic product and fiscal 
revenue hit some 164.5 billion yuan and 16.66 billion yuan, up 
by 25 percent and 38.6 percent, respectively, over the previous 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Afforestation is in 
full swing across southern China. 
  According to the latest statistics, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, 
Anhui, 
Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou provinces and the 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had planted trees on 902,000 ha

plan by 43.8 percent. 
  The Anhui Provincial Government held a mobilization meeting 
attended by local leading officials and afforestation bureau 
chiefs as early as on January 1 to draw up a plan for 
afforesting all barren hills within this year. 
  Leading officials of Guangxi and Zhejiang took the lead in 
planting trees earlier this year. 
  The local governments of 23 counties in Hubei Province 
organized 1.978 million laborers to plant trees on hills and 
mountains soon after the spring festival, the traditional 
Chinese new year, which fell on February 10. 
  Meanwhile, Hunan Province has planted trees on 93,000 ha in

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 16 (CNS) -- The worrisome social 
order in Guangzhou will be improved with an expected injection 
of RMB [renminbi] 600 million into an improvement of police 
equipment and facilities, city Mayor Mr. Li Ziliu said today. 
  Mr. Li made these remarks at a team discussion for Guangdong 
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) during the NPC 
session in response to concern over the problem of social order 
which is an important issue arousing great concern from the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, both of 
which are currently being held here. Vice Chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the Guangdong People's Congress, Mr. Fang 
Bao, who was formerly in charge of the province's 
law-enforcement work, said he was mainly worried about the 
question of social order because it had become more critical in 
the province than in other cities in recent years. Guangzhou, a 
gateway to the province, first recived an impact from worsening 
social order with some 50,000 criminal cases registered in the 
municiality alone last year. 
  Mr. Fang said that the social order problem had been quite 
serious in recent years even though much work had been done in 
this sector. It was up to the public security police to deal 
with public order, he said, while security teams comprised of 
local residents had been set up as an auxiliary force to the 
police. Some entities and government departments, however, had 
not done their part in the maintenance of public order. 
  Mr. Li put the proper dealing with social order as the main 
task in Guangzhou for the coming years. An injection of RMB 600 
million will be used to improve salaries and police quality in a 
bid to arouse the enthusiasm and morale of the police force. 
The spending will also be used to improve police equipment and 
facilities, creating better conditions for the police force.

  [Text] Wuhan, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei 
Province will this year inject some 3.6 billion yuan into 
developing its postal and telecommunications sector, sources 
from the provincial government said. 
  According to a draft development plan, the province will in 
1994 increase the number of mobile telephones by ten times over 
the previous year's total. Meanwhile, investment in the fixed 
assets of the posts and telecommunications sector will rise by 
65 percent. 
  When a 400-million-yuan project to improve mobile telephone 
service is completed in August 1994, the capacity of the 
province's mobile phone exchanges will be increased to 4,866 
lines, ranking among the top four in China, official sources 
said. 
  According to the plan, the province will install some 
100,000 
telephones throughout most of the rural areas by the end of this 
year, with advanced telecommunications networks covering nearly 
60 percent of its counties and regions. 
  In addition, the province has also planned to expand the 
businesses of postal depositing, radio tracking, credit card 
phones and emergency mail delivery.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 6 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
provinces and autonomous regions have gathered in an economic 
bumper harvest in the past decade by cooperating with each other. 
  The region, including Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces, 
Guangxi Zhuang and Tibet Autonomous Regions, and the cities of 
Chengdu and Chongqing, established an economic coordination 
committee 10 years ago. 
  The seven partners aimed to build a mutual market in the 
area 
and open to the markets in Southeast and South Asia. They 
removed barriers from among the provinces and opened their 
markets to each other. 
  In the past decade, they held more than 100 commodity fairs 
and trade talks, which succeeded with a total business volume of 
40 billion yuan. 
  More than 30 banks in this area have also joined hands to 
support the economic development. In the past six years, they 
poured loans of more than 60 billion yuan into local enterprises. 
  With an 8,800-km border, the southwest China economic 
coordination zone has established more than ten border economic 
development areas and opened more than 40 border trade ports. 
Thus the export volume in this area has increased quickly in 
recent years. The total foreign trade volume last year reached 
five billion U.S. dollars and its border trade volume amounted 
to five billion yuan. 
  These provinces and regions also organized several 
investment 
promotion fairs in southeast and south Asia and introduced 
billions of dollars in overseas investment. 
  They organized economic activities in accordance with market 
needs. Since they established the economic coordination zone 10 
years ago, they have signed more than 11,000 economic 
cooperation projects among which more than 6,000 have been put 
into operation. 
  They jointly invested over 200 million yuan to build 49 
trans-provincial roads, which have now extended to a total of 
more than 20,000 km. Some railways, post and telecommunications 
projects and satellite communication stations are now under 
construction. 
  A fund of more than 1.3 billion yuan has been collected to 
build power plants and chemical fertilizer factories in the area. 
  At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the total industrial 
and agricultural production value per capita in this area was 
320 yuan lower than that in other areas although the region 
covers a total area of over 2.5 million sq km and is inhabited 
by 225 million people. 
  By 1993, the total industrial and agricultural production 
value tripled that of 10 years ago. 
  A few days ago, the seven partners held a liaison meeting in 
Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, and inaugurated a 
publicity organizing committee, which will focus on promoting 
the image of southwest China.

<F P=106> [Report by Li Qiao (2621 0829): "Conscientiously Implement </F>
the Guidelines of the National Propaganda and Ideological Work 
Conference and Provide Guarantees for Ideology and Press Work in 
the Capital's Modernization Drive"] 
  [Excerpts] The Beijing Municipal CPC Committee recently 
held a municipal propaganda work conference to study the 
guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work 
conference and to arrange Beijing's propaganda and ideological 
work for this year. It called on party committees at all levels 
to strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work, 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of Comrade Jiang 
Zemin's important speech given at the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference, and, with the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, arm the people with 
scientific theories, guide them with correct public opinion, 
mold them with noble spirit, encourage them with outstanding 
works, and provide a still more effective ideological guarantee 
and press environment for safeguarding the stability of the 
capital and for attaining the strategic objective of "achieving 
a fairly comfortable life three years ahead of schedule." 
  Leading comrades attending the conference were Chen Xitong, 
secretary of the municipal party committee; Li Qiyan, mayor; Li 
Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and 
concurrently director of its propaganda department; Ouyang 
Wenan, Yang Chaoshi, and Qiang Wei, standing committee members 
of the municipal party committee; and He Luli, vice mayor. 
[passage omitted] 
  Chen Xitong gave an important speech at the conference. He 
emphasized the great importance of the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference and urged: Leaders at all levels in 
the municipality should conscientiously relay, study, and 
implement the guidelines of the conference and, in particular, 
study well the important speeches of Comrade Jiang Zemin and 
other leading comrades. We should implement the basic 
principles for this year's work as defined by the central 
authorities and take the initiative in subordinating to and 
serving the endeavor of "seizing the opportunity to deepen 
reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, 
and maintain stability," which meets the basic interests of the 
work of the entire party. Propaganda and ideological work 
should advocate concerted efforts. We should implement the 
guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work 
conference, especially the speech of Comrade Jiang Zemin. 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: Beijing's propaganda and 
ideological work has produced great achievements in publicizing 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, raising 
ideological and theoretical levels, and adhering to the correct 
press guidance over the past few years. It has also made 
important contributions to ensuring the stability of the 
capital, promoting economic construction, reform, and opening 
up, and strengthening the socialist spiritual civilization. As 
has been proven in practice, Beijing's contingents of 
propaganda, ideological, and theoretical workers can withstand 
tests. 
  Chen Xitong emphasized: In the new situation where the 
establishment of the socialist market economy system is 
accelerated, it is very important to achieve success in 
propaganda and ideological work. The main melody of propaganda 
and ideological work is publicizing socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. A good command of this main melody will bring 
about success in carrying out propaganda work correctly and 
effectively. We should arm the people with scientific theories, 
guide them with correct public opinion, mold them with noble 
spirit, and encourage them with outstanding works. It is hoped 
that party organizations at all levels will strengthen 
leadership over propaganda and ideological work and that all 
trades and professions will support propaganda and ideological 
work. 
  Chen Xitong put forward clear requirements on improvement of 
the contingents of propaganda and ideological workers. He said: 
To make propaganda and ideological work successful, the 
contingents of propaganda cadres should first intensify the 
study of the basic theory and basic knowledge of Marxism and 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. They should learn to resolve issues with 
Marxist stand, viewpoints, and methods. We should step up 
efforts to improve the leading bodies of propaganda and 
ideological fronts, pay attention to promoting young cadres, and 
maintain the stability of the contingents of propaganda and 
ideological cadres. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] While financial revenues for Hebei Province 
increased by a large margin overall in 1994, many localities 
found themselves in tight financial straits, and some were 
unable to meet the people's demand for food. How on earth 
should we handle this situation that emerges from the process of 
advancement and development? The deputies of the people's 
congress and the members of the provincial committee of Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], who were 
attending the current sessions, frankly and sincerely aired 
their views and suggestions. 
  According to the information dispatched by reporters (Fan 
Shijun) and (Zhang Guoxing) from the sessions, Hebei Province 
effected a relatively big increase in financial revenues in 1993 
to make a new breakthrough of historical significance. 
According to statistics, the province's financial revenue 
totaled 14.39 billion yuan, an increase of 44.4 percent over the 
previous year, exceeding the average national increase level by 
4.5 percentage points. In 1993, governments and financial and 
tax departments at all levels in the province kept the idea of 
invigorating the economy firmly in mind, and tried all possible 
means to realize the program on invigorating Hebei's economy as 
well as various other objectives. Major indicators were that 
various fields raised and circulated funds to accelerate the 
construction of key projects, continued to increase input in 
agriculture, continued to support the technological renovation 
of large and medium-sized enterprises, and continued to launch 
the activities of creating high-revenue counties and eliminating 
subsidy receiving counties, yielding remarkable results. Fengnan 
and Huanghua counties's realization of 100 million yuan in 
financial revenue in 1992, was followed by Qian, Fengning, 
Zunhua, Wuan, Fengrun, Yutian, and Hengshui so that they joined 
1993's list of counties with 100 million yuan in financial 
revenue. [passage omitted] 
  In 1993, the province made a breakthrough of historical 
significance in financial revenues that was fully affirmed by 
the deputies of the provincial people's congress and the members 
of the provincial CPPCC committee who were attending the current 
sessions. However, the deputies and the members also worried 
about the tight financial circumstances in some localities. In 
particular, some localities were unable to issue wages on 
schedule, that caused great concern among deputies and members. 
Chen Hui, vice chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee and 
deputy director of the provincial committee of the China 
Democratic National Construction Association, revealed in her 
speech to the session that according to the statistics compiled 
early this year, the province as a whole owed teachers of 
primary and middle schools a large amount of wages, thus not 
only affecting teachers' enthusiasm but also forcing some key 
teachers to change jobs frequently. Director of the province's 
financial department, Zhang Xianpu, analyzes the reasons for the 
large increase of financial revenue in some parts of the 
province, and the tight financial situation in others, in his 
report on the implementation of the 1993 provincial budget and 
the 1994 draft budget: The first reason was that although the 
province as a whole effected a relatively big increase in 
financial revenues last year, the increase was mainly brought 
about by localities at or above the city and prefectural levels, 
and the increase in localities at or below the county level was 
not as great. Only 28 counties and county-level cities 
surpassed the national revenue average. Some counties and 
county-level cities did not effect an increase in their 
revenues, and some even experienced a decline. The second 
reason was that factors for revenue increases due to policy 
increased, and, in particular, appropriations used as wages 
increased. The third reason was the low quality of many 
products of the province, and the difficulties in production and 
management that was experienced by some enterprises. The fourth 
reason was the indulgence in serious extravagance and waste by 
some localities and units which incurred huge losses of state 
property. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Linda Choy in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] The People's Liberation Army (PLA) should come 
under the supervision of parliament to avoid abuses of power, an 
NPC meeting was told yesterday. Citing abuses by the Communist 
Party-controlled troops, vice-chairman of the Guangzhou 
Municipal People's Congress Yao Jiahua said lack of supervision 
over the PLA might lead to corruption and malpractice. 
  The role and function of the NPC and the development of a 
legal system in China dominated the congress yesterday. Some 
deputies were at a loss as to what contribution they could make 
in addition to joining the annual session in Beijng and making 
one inspection tour of the regions. 
  Mr Yao said: "The lack of supervision over the PLA has 
created some malpractices. In some cases, the PLA has competed 
with people for profits by joining businesses. The troops' 
respect for the law is also weak. There have been a lot of 
rumours about the PLA taking part in smuggling and official 
profiteering activities. The PLA is not living in a vacuum. It 
is vulnerable to corruption and should be put under the 
supervision of the NPC," Mr Yao said. 
  Chairman of the Guangdong People's Provincial People's 
Congress Lin Ruo said measures should be implemented to ensure 
the rule of law. "Although the NPC has passed many pieces of 
legislation during the past year, they were not executed at 
local levels, where officials simply rule according to their own 
will," he said. He was joined by another Guangdong delegate, Li 
Weixin, who added that the rule of law in China had been 
hindered by the lack of legal provision for lawyers. "Without 
legal protection, it is very difficult for lawyers to carry out 
investigations and argue for defendants in court," he said. 
Eleven drafts have been made of the Lawyers Act since work on 
it began in 1982. Mr Li called on the Government to speed up 
work on the Lawyers Act to ensure proper protection for 
defendants in court. 
  Complaining of the low efficiency of the NPC, a Liaoning 
provincial delegate said the 13-day session could be further 
shortened if sufficient preparations were made, such as sending 
government reports to delegates for study before the meeting. 
Li Jin, a vice-chairman of the Liaoyang Municipal People's 
Congress, said the work of the NPC Standing Committee should be 
improved. "We shouldn't merely attend the annual meeting and 
join an inspection tour just to be lectured on how good the 
national situation is," he said.

  [Text] Police have stepped up their intimidation of war 
reparation campaigners by detaining almost all activists in 
Beijing and Shanghai during Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's three-day visit to China. 
  Although Beijing yesterday released more than 100 elderly 
anti-Japan activists after two days of investigations, Shanghai 
police rounded up war reparation activist Bao Ge just before the 
Prime Minister's arrival in the east China city. 
  The release of the elderly dissidents coincided with a 
report 
which said 500 intellectuals had signed a petition to the 
National People's Congress (NPC) calling for their release and a 
public apology by the police. 
  According to Bao's friends, the 31-year-old medical 
researcher was picked up by police officers yesterday morning. 
  Yang Zhou, a friend of Bao, said the activist had no plans 
to 
demonstrate or embarrass the Government during Mr Hosokawa's 
visit and he believed Bao would be set free soon after Mr 
Hosokawa left Shanghai. 
  "He (Bao) has no plans to do anything... But the authorities 
obviously don't want to see even the slightest trouble. 
Although the issue (war reparation) is not related to the Most 
Favoured Nation (MFN) debate, anything ugly could affect MFN," 
Mr Yang said. 
  The 100 or so dissidents, whose average age is 65, were 
detained last Friday after they had petitioned Mr Hosokawa to 
issue a formal apology and to pay compensations. Bao last 
Thursday sent a similar petition to the Japanese Embassy in 
Beijing. 
  The Chinese Government agreed to drop claims to Japanese 
compensation 22 years ago when the two nations restored 
diplomatic relations. But many Chinese citizens regard the deal 
as a sellout and are seeking billions of dollars in compensation 
from Tokyo. 
  One source said police had released more than 100 
representatives of the group, the China Civilian Preparatory 
Committee for Japanese Reparations, but sent them all under 
escort back to their home provinces. Another 100 locked in a 
south Beijing depot were also sent home. 
  "They were released on Sunday night but police are taking 
them home under supervision," the activist said, adding a 
Beijing-based war reparation movement activist, Tong Zeng, 
remained in police custody. 
  Mr Yang said the strong reaction from the Government could 
backfire. 
  He said that despite the leadership's disapproval, 
intellectuals such as Beijing scholar Xu Liangying were still 
able to challenge the authorities by putting out an open letter 
calling for the release of all political prisoners.

  [Text] BEIJING, March 22 (AFP) -- Bao Ge, the Shanghai 
dissident who was picked up by police for questioning Monday, 
said Tuesday he had been released after 22 hours of 
interrogation. 
  "I was released Tuesday around 8:00 a.m. (2400 GMT), but I 
am 
still under constant surveillance by the police," he said by 
phone from Shanghai. 
  Bao had published a letter to Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, calling on him to apologize for Japan's 
wartime atrocities in China and pay reparations to survivors. 
Since last Friday -- the day Hosokawa arrived for a three-day 
visit to China -- Bao has been watched around the clock by the 
authorities and had his home telephone cut off. His detention 
coincided with Hosokawa's visit to Shanghai, which lasted 
several hours. 
  Bao, 31, has fought for years for reparations from Japan, 
and 
has already been to prison several times for his campaign. 
China officially abandoned its demands for war reparations in 
1972.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Chinese security forces are trying to defuse a 
serious challenge to the administration as different sectors of 
the dissident community take bold action to hasten the pace of 
liberalisation. Beijing has deployed extra police and state 
security agents to keep tabs on dissidents, a number of whom 
have been hauled in for day-long questioning during the past 
week. 
  Sources in Beijing said that groups of well-known dissidents 
had sent "private letters" to National People's Congress (NPC) 
Chairman Qiao Shi demanding parliament put an end to "archaic 
and undemocratic" laws and malpractices. 
  And yesterday, police in Tiananmen Square took away at least 
two people who tried to distribute leaflets that apparently 
called on the Communist Party and NPC members to speed up 
democratisation. Among the letters sent to Mr Qiao, one decried 
the series of statutes against "counter-revolutionary 
activities" used to incarcerate the bulk of the country's 
prisoners of conscience. 
  The dissident groups also urged the Eighth NPC, whose second 
plenary session ends today, to repeal administrative regulations 
empowering the police to detain suspects for months for "shelter 
and investigation" and to lock people up in "re-education 
through labour camps" for up to three years. 
  One petition said such practices violated the spirit of the 
law by allowing the police to deprive the human rights of 
citizens [as published] without going through the judicial 
process. 
  Last Thursday, three dissidents, Zhou Duo, Liu Xiaobo, and 
Min Qi, were subjected to six hours of questioning in relation 
to a letter they had sent to the Public Security Ministry. 
  The document, dubbed "Petition 306", criticised the 
authorities for detaining intellectuals before the arrival of 
American Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The trio were 
let off with a warning. 
  Sources in the dissident community said "scores" of friends 
of dissident leader Wei Jingsheng were planning to hold a party 
next Tuesday to mark the 15th anniversary of his imprisonment. 
  Police are understood to be determined to force the 
organisers to give up their plans before Mr Wei, who had been 
asked by police to leave town during Mr Christopher's visit, 
returns to the capital later this week. 
  Witnesses at Tiananmen Square said at least two protesters 
were arrested when they tried to distribute pamphlets as a group 
of NPC delegates were walking out of the Great Hall of the 
People. 
  One incident occurred on the north side of the square, near 
the gate where the late Chairman Mao proclaimed the founding of 
the communist state in 1949. 
  Another took place at the Monument to the People's Heroes in 
the centre of the square. 
  Police scrambled to gather up all the pieces of paper. There 
was no indication what the leaflets said. 
  One witness saw police throw a person into a car and drive 
off immediately after the incident. Police took film away from 
Manuel Ceneta, a photographer for Agence France Presse. 
  Later a government employee named Gao Hongmin visited the 
office of a Western television network to show them copies of a 
leaflet he said he wanted to distribute in Tiananmen Square 
yesterday afternoon. 
  The leaflet called for a fully free market economy, gradual 
steps towards democracy and a reversal of the official verdict 
on the 1989 pro-democracy protests. 
  Gao, 44, said he was working alone and had no connection 
with 
the morning leaflet attempts. 
  He was grabbed by security agents on leaving the guarded 
compound and thrust into a car. 
  Last night, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that 
two 
Chinese women "were stopped by other citizens for disturbing 
public order this morning". 
  The wording suggested the women were arrested. 
  The Foreign Ministry statement said "it was improper for 
foreign journalists to cover news in China without going through 
necessary formalities". 
  Meanwhile, 500 intellectuals yesterday reportedly petitioned 
Beijing to free more than 100 victims of Japanese war crimes who 
were detained last Friday while protesting outside the Japanese 
Embassy in Beijing on the eve of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's visit. 
  While Beijing police yesterday reportedly released most of 
the detainees, who were elderly people from the provinces, they 
held on to Tong Zeng, a veteran organiser of the war-reparations 
movement. 
  The petition, addressed to the NPC, called for the immediate 
release of Mr Tong and other detainees. 
  It said police last Friday had taken tough action against 
protesters who had acted in a "peaceful and obedient manner"

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 KYODO -- Chinese dissidents 
continued their campaign for greater political and social 
freedom Monday [21 March] as police took quick measures to stop 
leaflets being distributed in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. 
  "I started taking pictures when I saw leaflets flying and 
police running from all directions," said Manuel Ceneta, a 
photographer from a French news agency. 
  Ceneta said he was covering the ongoing National People's 
Congress at the Great Hall of the People which adjoins the 
square, and then had his camera taken from him and his film 
exposed. 
  A similar incident near the Tiananmen gate tower was also 
reported Monday, but police gathered the leaflets before the 
contents could be discerned, a witness said. 
  It was not immediately known if the perpetrators of the 
incidents were detained. Chinese courts normally issue lengthy 
prison sentences for such actions which are regarded as 
"inciting counterrevolutionary activities." 
  Also on Monday, KYODO NEWS SERVICE received a letter from an 
employee of China's diplomatic service company, Gao Hongmin, who 
stated that on March 21 he planned to distribute political 
leaflets in Tiananmen Square. 
  Police took Gao away as he left the offices of a Western 
television company, where he left copies of the leaflet in the 
early afternoon. 
  Gao's leaflet called for more democracy and for the 
government to rescind its description of the military crackdown 
on prodemocracy movement in Tiananmen square in 1989 as "a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion." 
  China's capital has been a hot bed of political unrest since 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Beijing 10 
days ago and demanded the government to improve its human rights 
record. 
  Nearly 20 of China's most well-known political dissidents 
were detained for questioning at that time. 
  Meanwhile, police have also cracked down on protests by 
elderly victims of Japanese aggression 50 years ago. The 
protesters began appearing in Beijing before Saturday's visit by 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, with over 100 
reported to have been detained. 
  Spring is the traditional season for political protests in 
China. This spring coincides with the 75th anniversary of the 
May 4 democracy movement and the fifth anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square crackdown.

  [Text] Chinese police yesterday arrested two women for 
distributing leaflets in Tiananmen Square and detained a 
dissident who planned to go there to distribute a pro-democracy 
statement. The authorities have also acknowledged a ban on the 
latest edition of the United States news magazine Newsweek. 
Witnesses said the demonstrators in the square scattered 
leaflets as a group of delegates to parliament passed by. The 
content of the leaflets was not known. 
  Police grabbed the camera of an AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
photographer who had taken pictures of the protest and opened it 
to expose the film. 
  The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that two Chinese 
women "were stopped by other citizens for disturbing public 
order this morning". 
  The statement quoted by the XINHUA News Agency said: "It was 
improper for foreign journalists to cover news in China without 
going through necessary formalities." 
  In a related incident, dissident Gao Hongmin, who had 
planned 
to distribute an open statement to the national legislature, was 
picked up by security officers at the Jianguomenwai foreigners' 
compound after visiting the offices of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation. 
  On the ban on the latest edition of NEWSWEEK, a spokesman 
for 
the government body that controls the import of periodicals 
would only say there was an unspecified "problem" with the 
issue. The cover of the current Asian edition is entitled 
"China's Angry Voices" and features prominent dissident Wei 
Jingsheng. The edition contains two highly critical stories. 
The more controversial one covers the crackdown on growing 
political dissent in China during last week's visit by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  The other article questions the ability of the central 
government to control the economy and highlights corruption and 
social problems. 
  Subscriber copies of NEWSWEEK continued to arrive through 
the 
mail.

<F P=106> [Report by Li Ren (4539 0086): "Book `My Father Deng </F>
Xiaoping' Pirated, Author Deng Rong Takes Legal Action"] 
  [Text] The pirating of one of the current best-sellers, 
"My Father Deng Xiaoping," by some lawless people has elicited a 
strong reaction from its readers. 
  The book "My Father Deng Xiaoping," written by Mao Mao, was 
published by the Central Party Literature Publishing House in 
September 1993. A mere one month after its publication, pirated 
copies appeared on the market as if they were legitimate. By 
February this year, over 100,000 copies of seven pirated 
versions had been discovered. These pirated books are of very 
poor quality and are riddled with errors, which has made the 
readers very unhappy and has caused the publisher and the author 
to suffer unjustified wrong. 
  The Central Party Literature Publishing House has now been 
fully authorized by the author to look into this matter and has 
officially engaged a prominent lawyer to act on its behalf.

  [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- "Deng Xiaoping and 
Contemporary China" [deng xiao ping yu dang dai zhong guo 6772 
1420 1627 5280 3981 0108 0022 0948], a book written by young 
scholar Wen Lequn, was recently published by the Fujian People's 
Publishing House. 
  Drawing on a wealth of accurate historical data and on the 
situation in the 15 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, the book offers a rather extensive 
and systematic exposition on the process of initiating and 
developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and on the theory's basic contents and 
innovative contributions. It also specifically analyzes the 
historical process of reform, opening up, and modernization in 
contemporary China, depicting the basic form of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics which is currently being practiced. 
  The book also discusses Deng Xiaoping's role as an architect 
and leader in various fields of work undertaken by China to 
promote reform, opening up, modernization, development, 
political stability, and reunification of the motherland. It 
analyzes Deng Xiaoping's realistic and innovative ways of 
thinking in philosophical terms, extensively describing the 
chief architect's historical status and tremendous 
contributions. The book is yet another compelling work by Wen 
Lequn, a professor at the People's University of China, 
following the publication of his book "The Early Life of Deng 
Xiaoping" last year.

<F P=106> [By Hsia Yu-ping (1115 7183 1627): "Deng Returns to Beijing </F>
in February and Continues To Play Bridge With Wang Daming"] 
  [Text] The "Basic Contingent" at Deng's Home 
  Bridge is a game that calls for testing the intelligence of 
four people. Hence, Deng Xiaoping must have partners for the 
game. He has two generations of partners. The older generation 
includes Zhang Zhixiang, Wan Li, and Wu Han, and the younger one 
includes Ding Guangen, Wang Hanbin, and Wang Daming. The latter 
group has played bridge with him since the early 1960's. 
Although quite a few people have played bridge with Deng 
Xiaoping, most have been "troops disappearing like running 
water." Only the setup of Deng Xiaoping, Ding Guangen, Wang 
Hanbin, and Wang Daming has lasted long and remained stable, so 
they are called by Deng's family as the "basic contingent." 
  As overseas readers are familiar with Ding Guangen (member 
of 
the CPC Political Bureau, secretary of the Secretariat and head 
of the Central Propaganda Department), and Wang Hanbin 
(alternate member of the Political Bureau and vice chairman of 
the National People's Congress Standing Committee), this article 
is intended to give an account of Wang Daming. 
<H5>  Wang Daming Made an Appearance in Hong Kong </H5>
  Wang Daming showed up in Hong Kong in mid-December 1993. 
Tall and thin, with gray hair, Wang carries a distinctive air 
of the academic in his speech and deportment. He led a 
delegation visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of chairman of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] 
Beijing Municipal Committee. His purposes in visiting Hong Kong 
were, among other things, to meet old friends, make new friends, 
and discuss with relevant parties the issue of electing 
additional members to the CPPCC committee in Beijing. 
  Originally, he wanted his visit to Hong Kong to be a low 
profile one, and to try to avoid causing a sensation as much as 
possible. Unexpectedly, however, he was followed with 
increasingly keen interest during his eight-day visit to the 
territory. Of course, it has something to do with his personal 
style, as he is free from bureaucracy, straight forward, 
sincere, resourceful, and easily wins people's confidence. 
Perhaps it may also have had something to do with the 
particular background of his intimacy with Deng's family, 
because the latest information about Deng Xiaoping's health that 
he brought with him was, no doubt, regarded as specially 
important by various sectors in Hong Kong, who pay close 
attention to the CPC's political situation. 
  Wang Daming was asked about Deng Xiaoping's health on many 
occasions and denied all the false reports concerning Deng's 
health by telling the questioners that "he had played bridge 
with Deng Xiaoping only recently." Besides, he disclosed some 
details known to few outsiders: Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, which contains 116 articles and was 
published a short time ago, was personally examined and approved 
by Deng Xiaoping article by article during the hot summer. Wang 
Daming said emphatically: "It is entirely impossible for an old 
man of nearly 90 to examine and approve in person every article 
he wrote if he is in poor health." 
<H5>  Playing Bridge Was a Must Required by Underground Work </H5>
  Wang Daming is from Beijing and is three to four years 
younger than Ding Guangen and Wang Hanbin. He came from a poor 
worker's family and graduated from the machinery department of 
the Beijing Advanced Industrial School in 1948. He joined the 
underground Communist Party when he was a student and learned to 
play bridge while doing underground work. The cards were used 
to conceal their activities when something happened during their 
gatherings. When the people's republic was founded in Beijing, 
Wang worked on the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist 
Youth League [CYL]. Later, he was transferred to work in the 
Policy Research Center of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee in 
1953, holding the position of deputy head of the industrial 
group of the committee. 
  His career during this period was connected with that of 
Wang 
Hanbin. In this same period, Wang Hanbin held the position of 
head of the university section of the Beijing Municipal CYL 
Committee. Afterward, he transferred to the post of deputy 
director of the Policy Research Center of the Beijing Municipal 
CPC Committee. During leisure time after work, the common hobby 
of playing bridge has made them well-coordinated partners for 
the game. 
  In 1961, Wang Hanbin worked with Deng Xiaoping in Shunyi 
County on the outskirts of Beijing to conduct investigations of 
agriculture. One day he said to Wang Daming: "Let me take you 
to play bridge." In this way, Wang Daming played bridge with 
Deng Xiaoping for the first time in a senior cadres' club on 
Yangfengjia Road, thus cementing his friendship with Deng 
Xiaoping over the bridge table for the past 33 years. 
<H5>  Arrangements for Deng Xiaoping's Life After His Retirement </H5>
  At first, playing cards with Deng Xiaoping was kept strictly 
confidential, and the card players used the password "on duty" 
to make appointments for playing the game. Wan Li's secretary 
would act as an organizer by advising Wang Daming on the phone: 
"You are on duty this evening." During that time, Wang Daming 
had to be on duty three times a week on average, and very often 
he spent his holidays at the card table with Deng Xiaoping. 
  They played cards in the senior cadres' club on Yangfengjia 
Road before the Great Cultural Revolution. After Deng Xiaoping 
was rehabilitated in 1974, some people suggested setting up a 
senior cadres' club again, but Deng Xiaoping did not agree. 
Therefore, the card table was moved into Deng's home, and Wang 
Daming and other friends have played cards there ever since. 
  According to an insider, the arrangements for Deng 
Xiaoping's life after he retired to the second line are: Seeing 
a film one night, and playing mahjong three nights and bridge 
three nights. He plays mahjong with family members, but he 
has to invite friends to play bridge. For this reason, Deng 
Xiaoping's wife Zhuo Lin particularly called them and said: 
"Comrade Xiaoping has some trouble -- he is always thinking 
about things and will never stop thinking. It is only when he 
is playing cards that his attention can be diverted a while. 
That is why playing cards is the best way for him to take a 
rest." She thanked them very much for the time they had 
sacrificed. 
  According to Wang Daming's observation, the reason Deng 
Xiaoping is able to keep fit lies in his persistence in swimming 
and playing bridge, as these activities have done a lot of good 
for him. Last year, the doctor advised him to give up swimming 
because of old age, but he goes on playing bridge, usually twice 
a week. 
<H5>  Discipline Is Enforced at Deng Xiaoping's Card Table </H5>
  At Deng Xiaoping's card table, this discipline is enforced 
-- 
no discussion about politics. Wang Daming recalled that there 
were exceptions on a few occasions. For example, it was some 
time in the 1960's when Deng Xiaoping returned from the 
controversy between the CPC and the CPSU. As everybody was 
anxious to know the result of the negotiations, they asked him 
about it while playing cards with him, and he just made some 
brief remarks regarding the matter. 
  Wang Daming said: "For many decades he has so trusted me 
that I can take liberty to go about his house at will. A very 
important point is -- I can observe discipline." Despite the 
ever-changing situation in Beijing and the personal ups and 
downs of his official career these years, he always kept silence 
before Deng Xiaoping and refrained from "saying this and that, 
and talking about right and wrong." In fact, had he ever spoken 
to Deng Xiaoping about his career future, he might have had a 
better official life than he has now. 
  In the early 1980's, Wang Daming took up the position of 
director of the Economic Commission in Beijing. His ideas on 
reform are clear. In a survey on changing tracks and finalizing 
the pattern in enterprises, which was conducted in 1983, Wang 
Daming pointed out that "enhancement of economic results should 
depend on people with clear minds." Hu Yaobang appreciated his 
views very much and gave written instructions to this effect: 
"I agree with the views of Wang Daming from Beijing. In the 
previous reorganization of enterprises, we failed to grasp this 
crucial part, but this time he has hit the vital point." 
Shortly afterward, Deng Xiaoping also said that the opinion of 
Wang Daming from Beijing was right because economic results in 
enterprises could not be enhanced if they did not have people 
with clear minds. 
<H3>  He Took Up the Post as Chairman of CPPCC Beijing Municipal 
Committee in 1993 </H3>
  In 1986, Hu Yaobang named Wang Daming as the person to be 
appointed as deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC 
Central Committee. Deng Liqun was in charge of ideology at that 
time. However, before Wang Daming was able to display his 
ability, he returned to Beijing [as published] because of 
illness in 1987. Since then, Wang Daming has been down on his 
luck. Li Ximing, former secretary of Beijing Municipal CPC 
Committee, assigned him the post of vice chairman of the CPPCC 
committee. During the ensuing five years, he was engaged in 
doing study and investigation work, making quite a few valuable 
proposals on major economic issues, and blazing a trail for the 
CPPCC to participate in the deliberation and administration of 
state affairs. In 1993, he took up the position of chairman of 
the CPPCC Beijing Municipal Committee and eventually reentered 
the power center in Beijing. But, five years had passed, after 
all, and he was already 62. 
<H5>  Deng Xiaoping Is Particularly Punctual </H5>
  Wang Daming is deeply impressed by some minor incidents at 
the card table. He said: "Deng Xiaoping shows great respects 
for others." It happened in those days when they played cards 
at the club on Yangfengjia Road. One day, it was approaching 
the appointed time when Deng Xiaoping suddenly called to say 
that he would be late as he had something to attend to. Wang 
Daming and other comrades thought that Deng would come very 
late, otherwise he, being a big shot, would not have to phone 
them to revise the appointment. Hence, they felt relieved and 
went to take a bath. To their great surprise, Deng Xiaoping 
arrived in a quarter of an hour, so everyone was in a hurry to 
put on clothes. "Later, we got to know that he was particularly 
punctual," said Wang Deming, "whenever we made an appointment to 
play cards, he would be waiting for us at the table a couple of 
minutes ahead of schedule." 
  Deng Xiaoping is very easy-going at the card table, so we 
never feel nervous playing cards with him. Someone always wins 
and loses in the contest, and Deng Xiaoping certainly tries his 
utmost to win. But, if he is in an inferior position, no one 
will give ground to him. Sometimes he discards a wrong card, 
and Ding Guangen and Wang Hanbin criticize him bluntly: "You 
are wrong to discard this one. Do you not know which card you 
should discard?" Deng Xiaoping listens with respectful 
attention. 
  In playing bridge, it is impossible to avoid making 
mistakes, but people making fewer mistakes will defeat those who 
make more. Wang Daming believes that Deng Xiaoping likes 
playing bridge because he thinks the game can train people's 
thinking and judgment. Moreover, the principle of seeking truth 
from facts is particularly stressed in playing bridge. If the 
cards in one's hand are poor, one must not blindly raise the 
stake. 
  "Comrade Xiaoping's skill in cards is quite good among the 
retired veteran comrades," said Wang Daming in assessment. This 
basic contingent of the four abovementioned people has won a 
number of championships in many amateur competitions. 
<H5>  There Are Two More Staff Officers in Deng's Family </H5>
  Over the past few years, there have been two more staff 
officers at the card table since the basic contingent started to 
play cards at Deng's home. Deng Pufang and Deng Nan used to sit 
behind their father to watch him play, and sometimes they made 
suggestions by giving him some pointers. During a bridge game, 
Deng Nan would yell to Ding Guangen, criticizing that he had 
discarded a wrong card, and Deng Pufang would add color and 
emphasis to fan the flames. With all the talking and laughing, 
the room was suddenly permeated with a lively atmosphere. 
  Wang Daming said he liked the harmonious affection in Deng's 
family. Sometimes Deng's grandson would run into the room to 
lean over his grandfather, and Deng would lovingly give him a 
kiss. If they played for a long time, Deng Xiaoping would 
invite them to dinner. The dishes for dinner are very simple, 
just like those of ordinary families, and the supper is simple 
as well. A small plate is laid before each person, in which 
there were a few slices of apple or orange. 
  When Deng Xiaoping is away from Beijing, Wang Daming 
sometimes accompanies him for a short period. During his south 
China tour in 1992, it happened that Wang Daming was leading a 
group of Beijing CPPCC committee members to emulate the 
experience in Guangdong, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. Upon arrival in 
Shenzhen, Wang Daming went to call on Deng Xiaoping who arrived 
a day earlier, and told Deng about his impression of the south. 
He said that the reform situation was favorable and the 
socialist factors had increased. At the end of last year, 
before going to Shanghai to spend the winter, Deng Xiaoping 
asked him whether he could go along. As Wang Daming was busy 
with official duties in his important position as chairman of 
the CPPCC Beijing Municipal Committee, he was unable to leave 
Beijing, but promised to pay a New Year call to the respected 
old man after the Spring Festival and have a happy gathering at 
the card table.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Labour Minister Li Borong has ruled out the 
possibility of the setting up of Solidarity-type free trade 
unions in the country. This is in spite of the imminent 
completion of the drafting of the long-awaited Labour Law which 
is aimed at giving greater protection to workers' rights. 
  Speaking yesterday at a National People's Congress meeting, 
Mr Li said they hoped the Labour Law would be ready by the 
middle of the year. 
  "This will have a major impact on (the development of labour 
matters in) China." 
  More than 30 drafts of the legislation have been compiled by 
the ministry and other relevant authorities. 
  Mr Li said they had also sought the views of some foreign 
investors over certain provisions in the draft law. 
  China has stepped up the drafting of laws on the protection 
of workers' rights in the wake of more complaints from workers 
against their employers last year. 
  The Beijing leadership was made aware of the urgent need to 
increase legal protection for the well-being of workers 
following a spate of serious industrial accidents, including a 
factory fire in Shenzhen last year. Under a new regulation 
promulgated this year, joint ventures will also have to limit 
the weekly labour time of workers to less than 44 hours. 
  Mr Li said some joint venture enterprises had used the 
excuse 
of heavy work orders to postpone the implementation of the new 
work-hour requirement. Although the new rules came into effect 
on March 1, he said there would be a grace period of two months. 
  "But if there are still cases of violations after that we 
will handle the matter in accordance with the law." 
  The minister, however, played down the seriousness of the 
growing unrest among workers during the past year, which was 
largely sparked off by the deferred payment of workers' wages. 
  "Some of them might have difficulty in paying the salaries 
of 
workers. The Government has already taken measures to solve the 
problem. I don't think there will be strikes. If workers have 
something to say they can have dialogue (with the leadership) to 
seek a solution," Mr Li said. "But I don't think it will be 
possible to have independent trade unions, such as the 
Solidarity, in China."

<F P=106> [By China Editor Cary Huang in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China is to set up a national network to help 
safeguard workers' rights amid increasing reports of their 
abuse. Under a four-level supervisory and report-back system, 
thousands of agencies will be created within all levels of 
administrations to enforce labour laws and regulations. The 
agencies will be set up within counties, cities with prefecture 
status, provinces and central government. 
  The move is the latest effort by the state to help build a 
healthy labour market while protecting the legal rights of 
workers, according to the Labour Ministry. 
  Lawmakers at the second session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC] have reported many cases of labour 
rights abuses. They have also expressed discontent over the 
labour ministry's apparent inability to act on these cases. 
  In a written report, the ministry said the authorities were 
to launch a nationwide campaign to check the widespread 
violation of labour regulations by employers at the township [as 
published] and at privately-run and foreign-funded firms. The 
ministry said it would mobilise workers to report abuses. 
  Labour sources said the Labour Ministry, anticipating the 
labour-related concerns of NPC delegates, only worked out these 
measures late last month. 
  The ministry has issued an urgent notice to labour 
departments across the country, directing the four levels of the 
government to set up labour agencies that would form a national 
network to oversee labour issues. 
  The ministry also urged local agencies to set up hotlines, 
letter boxes and information offices to receive complaints on 
labour rights abuses. 
  The notice said the labour departments should publicly 
campaign to inform the workers about their rights and the 
government services available to them. 
  The ministry has also assured workers they would have a 
freer 
hand in dealing with their employers, especially in negotiating 
for collective bargaining agreements. Such rights would be 
enshrined in the country's first labour law. 
  Under the proposed law, for the first time, trades unions 
would be allowed to deal with employers on behalf of their 
members on matters of salary, working conditions, welfare and 
other concerns. And, also for the first time in China, the law 
gives employers the right to get rid of staff to cut losses, 
subject to approval by trades unions or the majority of the 
employees. 
  The ministry's report said the labour law was aimed at 
maintaining harmony between employers and their workers in a 
socialist market economy while preventing abuses of labour 
rights.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- China managed to keep 
its birth rate at 19 per thousand last year despite the fact 
that it was a sub-peak year in terms of the number of 
child-bearing age women said an official at a national family 
planning conference here today. 
  According to Peng Peiyun, state councilor and minister in 
charge of the State Family Planning Commission, China has kept 
the birth rate at below 20 per thousand, the internationally 
acknowledged low birth rate, for several years running. 
  She said that in 1993, there were more than 121 million 
women 
in the 20-29 age group, a figure next only to the peak year of 
1992. In the whole of 1993, 21.26 million babies were born for a 
net increase of 13.46 million and the natural growth rate was 
11.45 per thousand. The total population of China was 1.1851 
billion at the end of the year. 
  Statistics show that the birth rate in the ten provinces and 
municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Liaoning, Jilin, 
Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong and Sichuan remained 
lower than 15 per thousand. And nine provinces and autonomous 
regions which are home to ethnic groups also saw a noticeable 
reduction in birth rates. 
  Peng attributed the achievement to the efforts made by the 
government and family planning organizations at all levels. The 
country's fast-growing economy is also changing people's concept 
of births and family.

  [Text] Beijing, March 23 (AFP)--The deployment of U.S. 
Patriot missiles in South Korea "will only accelerate the speed 
towards war" in the Korean peninsula, North Korean ambassador 
Chu Chang-chun said Wednesday. 
  He told a press conference here that the "United States 
should not try to stifle and frighten the Korean people. The 
American side should not forget the historical experience of the 
1950s Korean war." 
  He was reacting to Washington's announcement that it was 
sending 200 Patriot anti-missile missiles to South Korea as a 
defensive measure and resuming its Team Spirit military 
exercises with South Korea. 
  Those moves would "only accelerate the speed toward war. If 
they don't give up all these attempts, nothing can happen but 
war," said Chu. 
  He said the United States was still carrying on a hostile 
policy towards the North. "We cannot expect beautiful songs 
from the mouth of U.S. Defence Secretary (William Perry)." 
  Tension on the Korean peninsula rose dramatically last week 
after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) accused 
North Korea of refusing full cooperation with inspections of its 
nuclear programme, which has a suspected weapons element. 
  The IAEA has now referred the issue to the United Nations 
for 
possible Security Council action to obtain full compliance. 
  Chu said that if international sanctions were imposed on 
North Korea by the United Nations, Pyongyang would "make the 
necessary response." 
  China, a permanent member of the security council and 
Pyongyang's main ally, is on record as being opposed to any form 
of pressure on North Korea. 
  Prime Minister Li Peng said Beijing's UN ambassador would 
try 
to convince other council members not to vote for sanctions. 
But he did not say whether China would abstain or use its veto 
to prevent such a move. 
  Chu expressed confidence about Pyongyang's relations with 
China, saying Beijing had "conducted an anti-Japanese and 
anti-U.S. struggle together with us" and quoted Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin as saying that "though there can be many 
changes in the universe, there can be no change in the friendly 
relations between China and Korea." 
  Beijing is Pyongyang's main supplier of food and fuel and an 
international blockade would be ineffective without China's 
participation. 
  During Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to 
Beijing at the weekend China made it clear it would not be a 
mediator in the dispute and said that pressure on Pyongyang 
would only complicate the issue. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-Sam, who arrives in China on 
Saturday, will also try to persuade the Chinese leaders to 
become more involved in the nuclear stand-off. 
  A well-informed Asian source said that Kim would not 
hesitate 
to bargain economic aid to China in exchange for Beijing's 
playing the role of moderator in the dispute.

  [Text] Beijing, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Vice-President Rong 
Yiren said here today that China wants to continue its close 
cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO). 
  Rong was speaking to Arpad Bogsch, WIPO director-general, at 
the Great Hall of the People here today. 
  Calling Bogsch a friend of the Chinese people, Rong said he 
was delighted to meet the WIPO chief, who is here on his 15th 
visit to China since 1979. 
  Rong told Bogsch that China has in the past few years 
promulgated the major laws dealing with intellectual property, 
citing the Trade Mark Law, Patent Law, and Copyright Law. 
  In the drafting and revision of these laws, China received 
much advice from WIPO, Rong said, adding that the institution 
has been providing training courses for relevant Chinese 
personnel, for which he expressed appreciation. 
  Bogsch is leaving here this afternoon to attend a symposium 
on Asian copyright protection and its economic and cultural 
development, which is to be held in Kunming, capital of 
south-western Yunnan Province. 
  The symposium will help develop copyright systems in the 
region, Rong said, wishing it success. 
  Although the copyright system has been set up in China, 
there 
is still much room for the enhancement of the nation's awareness 
of its significance, Rong said. 
  A comprehensive copyright protection system falls in line 
with the country's efforts of advancing its science and culture, 
developing a market-oriented economy and opening up, Rong noted. 
  Bogsch said that China perfecting and implementing 
intellectual property legislation will bring benefits to its 
economic as well as cultural exchanges with other countries. 
  He noted that China has achieved a lot in implementing its 
Trade Mark Law and Patent Law and that WIPO intends to continue 
its help to China in the copyright system and other areas. 
  Yu Youxian, director of the National Copyright 
Administration 
of China, took part in today's meeting.

  [Text] Kiev, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary 
of Defence William Perry said tonight that the military in the 
United States and Ukraine are establishing new relations with 
strategic significance. 
  Perry made his remarks at a press conference here at the end 
of a two-day visit to the former Soviet republic. 
  The U.S. secretary of defence did not elaborate on this new 
strategic relationship, but it was reported that the two sides 
signed a series of agreements during Perry's stay. 
  These included an agreement on Ukrainian participation in 
the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and agreement on an additional 
100 million U.S. dollars of U.S. aid to help Kiev dismantle its 
nuclear arms and convert part of its military industry to civil 
use. 
  Both sides also reportedly touched on the possibility of 
holding joint military exercises and will set up a hot line 
between military authorities of the two countries. 
  The U.S. reinterated its support for safeguarding state 
sovereignty in Ukraine and maintaining territorial integrity. 
  They also expressed an understanding of Kiev's position on 
the issues of Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet. 
  As for the security umbrella demanded by Ukraine, Perry said 
that Washington will not provide the security guarantee for Kiev 
after Ukraine joins the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and 
would only offer a kind of pledge on the issue. 
  However, before Ukraine began dismantling its nuclear arms, 
Washington had repeatedly pledged to provide a security 
guarantee for the former Soviet republic. 
  Perry said that the dispute over Russia's delay in 
compensating Ukraine for nuclear disarmament is expected to be 
resolved in the near future. 
  Ukraine has threatened to reconsider the timetable for 
shipping nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantling because 
Russia has failed to compensate for the transfer. Moscow has 
argued that the delay was caused by Washington's failure to 
uphold its part of the disarmament pact.

headline] 
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The scholars who 
compiled the Pacific Economic Outlook 1994-1995 have called on 
the United States to provide most favored nation (MFN) status to 
China. 
  If the U.S. actually suspends MFN for China under the 
pretext 
of "human rights," "it would have a very disruptive effect for 
the Pacific region," they warned. 
  "As was already noted, trade with China is crucial for many 
economies. If economies were forced to choose, it could happen 
that it would be the United States that would find itself 
isolated and its actions widely condemned," the outlook said 
under the title "Risks in the Forecast -- the Greatest Anxiety." 
  The outlook was released here this evening in conjunction 
with the 10th International General Meeting of the Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Council which is being held here on March 
22-24, 1994. 
  "No one should want such a confrontation, so it is to be 
hoped that a satisfactory solution to the dispute can be found," 
the report further noted.

  [Text] Moscow, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin told visiting Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata here today that Moscow will not hurry to discuss 
the territorial dispute with Tokyo. 
  In an interview with reporters after his talks with Hata in 
the morning, Chernomyrdin said "Russia will act without haste." 
  The Russian prime minister said he also discussed with the 
Japanese foreign minister on the issue of bilateral trade and 
economy cooperation. 
  "One way or another way we will move towards the signing of 
a 
peace treaty between our countries," he pointed out. 
  Responding to a question about the possible transformation 
of 
the Group of Seven industrial countries into a group of eight, 
including Russia, Hata told reporters that Russia's membership 
must be considered within the frame of this group of countries. 
  He added that Japan should maintain "close contacts" with 
Russia, which is increasing its influence on the modern 
international politics. 
  Hata, also vice prime minister of the Japanese cabinet, 
arrived in Moscow on Saturday [19 March] for a three-day 
official visit.

  [Text] Washington, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
seeks a broad, positive relationship with a strong, secure and 
prosperous China, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
today. 
  "We pursue many important common goals on a bilateral, 
regional and global basis," Christopher said in his article 
published in THE WASHINGTON POST today. 
  "Our economic interests are also converging," he said, 
"China's explosive growth is increasingly attractive to American 
exporters and investors." 
  "We are determined to expand American participation in the 
Chinese market. China has an even more significant stake in 
open and profitable access to the American market," he added. 
  Christopher said that the U.S. Administration's foreign 
policy stands for open societies as well as open markets and 
"this balance shapes our approach toward China." 
  He said that one of the purposes of his recent trip to 
Beijing was to reaffirm U.S. intentions to engage China 
constructively on many issues where the interests of the two 
countries coincide.

<F P=106> ["International Outlook" column by Shi Quan (4258 3123): </F>
"Clinton Faces Two Oceans"] 
  [Text] Last year, shortly after President Clinton took 
office, he made nothing of the hardship of traveling across the 
ocean to attend the G-7 Economic Summit Meeting in Japan and 
also to visit South Korea. There, he put forward the new idea 
about the "New Pacific Community." In November, he played host 
to leaders of the organization for Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation [APEC] and held the first informal meeting with 
them. Such major diplomatic moves adopted by Clinton in Asia 
prompted people to analyze and comment on the U.S. foreign 
policy trend. The European allies on the other side of the 
Atlantic Ocean doubted and worried that the United States might 
shift the focus of its foreign policy "eastward." Thus, a U.S. 
State Department spokesman appeased the Europeans by quoting a 
children's song: "Making new friends but not forgetting old 
friendships; one is silver and the other is gold." In January 
this year, Clinton attended the NATO summit meeting in Brussels 
and then visited Prague and Moscow. According to the White 
House timetable, he will still make a second visit to Europe 
this year. The "old friends" reacted warmly. Britain's Thames 
Television said: "Europe remains the U.S. first lover." 
  What then are the specific positions Europe and Asia 
separately hold in the U.S. diplomatic pattern? To answer this 
question, we should first know what objective is being pursued 
by the United States in its foreign affairs. There are three 
major pillars in the U.S. foreign policy: Economic security, 
military strength, and the advancement of "democracy." All this 
is aimed at safeguarding U.S. global interests and its "leading 
position." If we put Europe and Asia to the two sides of such a 
scale by comparison, it may not be difficult for us to find the 
answer. 
  Let us first view the issue of economic security, to which 
the United States gives top priority. In Europe (mainly Western 
Europe) there exists 50 percent of U.S. corporations' overseas 
investment (about $120 billion), 60 percent of their overseas 
profits, and 65 percent of all foreign investment made by the 
United States. For example, up to the end of 1992, the 
investment made by American companies was only $78 billion. In 
addition, the European Community is also a major region where 
the United States can achieve a foreign trade surplus. Asia is 
the region which absorbs the largest part of U.S. exports ($127 
billion in 1992 against $117 billion to Europe) and is also the 
region where U.S. exports have increased at the fastest speed. 
Between 1978 and 1992, the U.S. exports to Asia have multiplied 
over four times but, in the same period, the U.S. exports to 
Europe multiplied 2.9 times. The exports to Asia provide 2.5 
million jobs in the United States (those to Europe creating some 
2 million jobs). More importantly, as the region recording the 
fastest economic growth in the contemporary world, Asia has 
development prospects which are strongly attractive to the 
United States. In the 1960's, Asia's total GNP accounted for 
only 4 percent of the world's total. The proportion has now 
increased to 25 percent and it is expected that it will reach 30 
percent in the early 21st century. The volume of trade in Asia 
now accounts for 25 percent of the world's total, the foreign 
exchange reserves kept by the central banks in Asia accounts for 
33 percent of the world's total, and Asia's population accounts 
for 59 percent of the world's total. As long as the U.S. share 
of this huge market increases by 1 percentage point, some 
300,000 jobs will be added to the U.S. job market. In such 
circumstances, it is not hard to understand why President 
Clinton, who took reinvigoration of the U.S. economy as his 
priority task, is trying to make a "new friend" out of Asia. 
  We can then review the issue of national security backed by 
its military strength, an objective pursued by the United 
States. In this regard, the United States is facing two vistas 
which are in striking contrast to each other. Europe: After 
the end of the Cold War, the Warsaw Pact was dissolved and the 
confrontation between two major military blocs came to an end. 
However, ethnic conflicts, territorial disputes, and religious 
contradictions previously covered up by the Cold War were all 
revealed. Europe cannot earn any "peace dividend"; on the 
contrary, it has become a new center of turbulence. The civil 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has not only shocked Europe but also 
threatened stability in other regions of the world and posed a 
challenge against the U.S. "leading position." Asia: Problems 
in such hot spots as Cambodia and Afghanistan were successively 
settled, mitigated, or turned into internal strife. Conflicts 
there have calmed down. The parties concerned are carrying out 
dialogue and negotiations on the nuclear issue on the Korean 
Peninsula. Although there are difficulties and twists and 
turns, the direct dialogue on an equal footing and negotiations 
are favorable to the proper settlement of the contradictions and 
problems. China is pursuing an independent and peace-oriented 
foreign policy and is making great contributions to the 
maintenance of peace and stability in Asia. As compared with 
other regions of the world, Asia enjoys a rather stable 
political situation. In such circumstances, it is not hard to 
understand why President Clinton, who announced that the United 
States "must lead the world," declared: "The core of our 
security remains in Europe." 
  The so-called "promotion of democracy" means to promote the 
political and economic systems of the West all over the world 
and this will guarantee the security of the United States. In 
this regard, there are different opinions inside the United 
States. Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger recently 
refuted the viewpoint that countries adopting Western-style 
"democracy" will not launch a war and that countries adopting 
the Western-style market economy will automatically become 
"democratic." Kissinger said that "this was not the inevitable 
result" but we will not discuss this here. In view of the 
strategic needs in "promoting democracy," the United States 
considers Europe as its cooperation partner. The United States 
and Europe share the same cultural traditions, the same social 
systems, and the same values. So, the "old friendship" will not 
be forgotten. 
  Such characteristics and changes in the situations in Europe 
and Asia, especially the increasing importance of economic 
factors in post-Cold War international relations, have prompted 
the United States to adjust its policies toward Europe and Asia. 
Clinton explicitly pointed out: "While the focus of our 
attention has shifted to the real global economic challenge, we 
must not only direct our eyes toward the other side of the 
Atlantic Ocean but also toward the other side of the Pacific 
Ocean." The U.S. strategy of facing both oceans serves its 
national interests. At the same time, such a strategy will also 
provide more room for its diplomatic maneuvers. People have 
noted that late last year, when the United States and Europe 
were involved in a fierce dispute over the issue of farm produce 
trade in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Clinton frankly said 
that if the talks failed, APEC would "provide us with the means 
of expanding our market in the Asia-Pacific region." His visits 
to Europe this year will give a similar hint to Japan, which 
said "no" to the United States in their trade talks. Therefore, 
President Clinton will continue to maneuver between his "old 
friend" and "new friend" according to changes in the 
international situation in order to safeguard the U.S. national 
interests and will further readjust his diplomatic tactics to 
deal with the two oceans.

<F P=106> [China Daily commentary: "Sino-Japanese Ties"] </F>
  [Text] Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
three-day visit to China has given further impetus to the 
all-round development of relations between the two countries. 
  China and Japan are next-door neighbours only separated, as 
people often note, by a narrow strip of water. And all sorts of 
ties have been forged between the two countries in the last 22 
years since diplomatic relations were restored in 1972. 
  Economic cooperation has been high on the agenda of 
Sino-Japanese relations. 
  Over the last decade, trade between the two countries 
registered an average per annum increase of 10 percent. And 
last year, total trade reached a record $39 billion, making 
Japan the country's number one trade partner. 
  However, as China's Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out 
during his recent trip to Japan, the present figure is far from 
impressive considering the vast potential for economic 
cooperation between the two nations. 
  And Chinese Premier Li Peng pointed out to his Japanese 
counterpart on Sunday that China's economic plans lay particular 
emphasis on energy supply, transport, and 
telecommunications--all sectors in which Japan is strong. 
  This means that the two countries complement each other 
economically and that increased cooperation could only benefit 
them both. 
  We were pleased to hear Hosokawa's sincere apologies for the 
intolerable suffering inflicted on Asian countries by Japan's 
invasion and colonial domination in history. 
  And we envisage fuller and broader cooperation between our 
two countries following Hosokawa's commitment to bear the past 
in mind when looking to the future. 
  We also share his view that increased bilateral cooperation 
holds out the hope of a brighter future. 
  Hosokawa delivered a strong message from the Japanese 
Government that his country will continue to support China's 
policies of reform, opening-up, and modernization. 
  He said that the rapid development of the Chinese economy 
has 
helped the Japanese economy. 
  Sino-Japanese relations have become particularly crucial 
since Asia's relative global position has grown in importance 
with the demise of the Cold War. 
  And the economies in east Asia are now the most vigorous 
ones 
in the world. 
  Despite their different political systems, China and Japan 
are the two most influential countries in the region. And 
bilateral relations between them, particularly in the economic 
sphere, will affect not only the west rim of the Pacific, but 
the whole world. 
  And both countries will make a great contribution to a 
peaceful and prosperous new world order, now that their leading 
statesmen have reached consensus on the importance of long-term, 
good bilateral relations.

  [Text] Beijing, March 23 KYODO -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said Wednesday [23 March] the results of 
recent nuclear inspections of seven North Korean nuclear 
facilities was a matter between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "China believes the specific problems concerning the 
inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities should be solved 
through discussions between North Korea and the IAEA," the 
spokesman said. 
  "In this light, China abstains from commenting on the 
determination made by the IAEA," he added. 
  The IAEA, which ended two weeks of inspections in North 
Korea 
on March 15, reported interference by the Korean side and has 
since referred the entire issue to the UN Security Council. 
  North Korean officials have denied such interference. 
  Tuesday evening, Chinese Premier Li Peng reiterated China's 
position that the issue should be solved peacefully through 
dialogue.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Young-sam said today that his upcoming visit to China will 
be a good chance for further development of relations between 
the two countries. 
  He expressed satisfaction with the development of relations 
between the two nations since their diplomatic ties were 
established last year. 
  Kim told Chinese reporters that China and South Korea have 
overcome the 40-year-old difference between them and greatly 
increased political, trade and economic contacts. 
  He said he believed that their cooperation in politics, 
economy and trade would be further expanded. 
  He expected the cooperation would make a contribution to 
peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the "Asian-Pacific 
Era" in the next century. 
  Kim said he would seek proposals to expand economic 
cooperation between China and his country during his visit. 
  So far, China is South Korea's third biggest trade partner 
and South Korea the sixth biggest trade partner of China. 
  Kim also said he hoped that the visit would help strengthen 
cooperation with China in improving inter-Korean relations to 
gain peace, stability and reunification of the Korean peninsula. 
  Meanwhile, he expected the reforms carried out in both 
countries to achieve success.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- A Sino-Saudi Arabian 
economic conference was held here today, attended by some 100 
Chinese and Saudi Arabian businessmen and government officials. 
  Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, 
and Sulayman al-Sulayyim, visiting minister of commerce of Saudi 
Arabia, addressed the meeting. Both expressed the hope that the 
bilateral economic and trade ties would be further expanded. 
  Wu noted that the Chinese Government attaches great 
importance to its relations with Saudi Arabia. 
  The two economies are highly complementary and the ties 
between them have seen marked development since the two 
countries set up diplomatic relations in 1990, Wu said. 
  According to Chinese customs statistics, the bilateral trade 
reached 690 million U.S. dollars-worth in 1993. 
  Wu expressed the conviction that the Saudi Arabian 
minister's 
visit and the conference would enhance the mutual understanding 
between the two governments and business people, and help 
promote bilateral economic and trade cooperation. 
  Saudi Arabian businessmen are welcome to invest in China in 
any form, she said. 
  Al-Sulayyim noted that the Saudi Arabian Government and 
businesses are highly interested in developing economic and 
trade ties with China. 
  Later, Wu and al-Sulayyim had a working meeting.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "China Offers To Buy Oil From Saudis"] </F>
  [Text] China yesterday proposed to buy more oil from Saudi 
Arabia to balance the two-way trade. 
  Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi 
made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Saudi Arabian 
Minister of Commerce Sulayman al-Sulayyim yesterday in Beijing. 
  Al-Sulayyim is leading a large business delegation to seek a 
greater share of the Chinese market, especially the 
petrochemical sector. His visit lasts until Saturday. 
  Saudi Arabia had a deficit of about $400 million in trade 
with China last year. 
  "We will seek to balance our bilateral trade in a positive 
fashion. We are in favour of increasing imports to achieve that 
effect," said Wu. 
  China has agreed in principle to buy 3.5 million tons of oil 
from Saudi Arabia each year beginning in 1995. 
  Wu said China attaches great importance to developing trade 
with the Gulf nation. 
  "We welcome Saudi Arabia to invest in China in any form," 
she 
said. 
  Worldwide investors have pledged $220 billion in 174,000 
projects in China so far. but Saudi Arabia has yet to gain a 
large share. 
  Wu said she hoped the Gulf nation will be part of the 
international investment boom in China. 
  Al-Sulayyim said good opportunities exist for bilateral 
cooperation in small- and medium-sized industrial projects.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The forthcoming visit 
to China by Ecuadorian President Sixto Duran Ballen will open a 
new page in the annals of Ecuador-China relations, said an 
Ecuadorian diplomat here today. 
  The Ecuadorian president is scheduled to pay a state visit 
to 
China from March 18 to 23 at the invitation of Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin. 
  President Duran Ballen attaches importance to the visit and 
is expected to exchange views on bilateral ties and issues of 
common interest with the Chinese leadership, said Cesar Roman 
Gonzalez, Ecuadorian ambassador to China, in an interview with 
XINHUA. 
  The visit is aimed at deepening mutual understanding, 
enhancing friendly co-operation and developing economic and 
trade ties between the two countries. 
  Ecuadorian businessmen will accompany the president on the 
trip and discuss co-operation with their Chinese partners, 
Gonzalez said. 
  Since the setting up of diplomatic ties between the two 
countries in 1980, the co-operative relations of friendship, 
based on mutual respect and understanding, have made steady 
headway, the ambassador noted. 
  As a developing country, Ecuador practises reform and 
opening 
policies, and is seeking more investment from the outside, he 
said. 
  Ecuador wishes to promote more extensive economic and trade 
ties with China, he stressed. 
  "Our bilateral co-operation is at the beginning of a new 
phase," Gonzalez said, expressing the belief that the bilateral 
ties have bright prospects for development.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- China attaches great 
importance to the development of its relations with Ecuador, 
said Chinese President Jiang Zemin during his talks with 
visiting Ecuadorian President Sixto Duran-Ballen here today. 
  The Chinese president said that the current visit by 
President Ballen will surely help promote the bilateral 
relations, which have been developing steadily and smoothly 
since the two established diplomatic ties 14 years ago, 
especially since President Ballen took office in 1992. 
  The Chinese Government attaches great importance to 
developing Sino-Ecuadorian ties, and it is willing to make 
concerted efforts together with the Ecuadorian Government to 
further promote the relations of friendship and cooperation, 
especially in trade and economic cooperation on the basis of 
equality and mutual benefit. 
  The Chinese president told the Ecuadorian guests that 
exchanges between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan have been 
developing steadily and the reunification should be realized 
under the guidance of the principle of "one country, two 
systems." 
  Jiang expressed his appreciation and thanks to the 
Ecuadorian 
Government for its long-term adherence to principles on the 
establishment of Sino-Ecuadorian diplomatic relations and its 
"one China" policy. 
  President Ballen said that Ecuador has, as always, supported 
the cause of China's reunification. 
  Ballen said that he has seen with his own eyes the great 
achievement that China has made in its economic construction and 
China's experience is very useful to Ecuador. 
  The Ecuadorian president said that he is confident that 
through his current visit, friendship and understanding between 
Ecuador and China, as well as bilateral trade and economic 
cooperation, will be further enhanced. 
  President Ballen expressed his thanks for China's effective 
economic assistance to Ecuador over the years. 
  President Jiang said it is very difficult for people of 
different countries to understand one another, because each 
nation has its specific geographic location, different cultural 
background and different levels of economic development and that 
makes it necessary for leaders of various nations to exchange 
views frequently with one another so as to promote understanding 
and eliminate differences. 
  President Ballen agreed with President Jiang's stand. He 
said that each nation has its specific conditions and that each 
nation, in dealing with its internal affairs, should adopt ways 
that fit its conditions instead of copying others. This is what 
China has done and so it is with Ecuador. 
  During the talks, the two leaders agreed that the two sides 
have common or similar views regarding many major international 
and regional issues and that the two share common interests in 
many areas. 
  The two sides also exchanged views on further strengthening 
bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and 
education. 
  President Ballen invited Jiang to visit Ecuador at his 
convenience, and Jiang accepted the invitation with pleasure. 
  After the talks, President Jiang and Ballen attended the 
signing ceremonies of a series of cooperation agreements between 
China and Ecuador. 
  These agreements included an agreement on economic and 
technological cooperation between the two governments, an 
agreement on encouraging and protecting mutual investments, 
exchange of notes on China's providing general merchandise to 
ecuador and a cooperation agreement between two petroleum 
companies of the two countries. 
  Prior to the talks, President Jiang presided over a ceremony 
to welcome President Ballen. 
  This evening, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of President 
Ballen and his party. 
  This afternoon, Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of China's 
National 
People's Congress Standing Committee, met with Josefina 
Villalobos de Duran Ballen, wife of President Ballen. 
  President Ballen arrived in Shanghai on March 18 and arrived 
here from Xian at noon today.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng, meeting with visiting Ecuadorian President Sixto Duran 
Ballen here today, said that China is willing to further promote 
its friendly cooperation with Ecuador. 
  In a friendly atmosphere Li and Ballen exchanged views on 
issues of common concern. 
  Li said that the talks between the presidents of the two 
countries yesterday afternoon were fruitful, with extensive 
common understanding reached and some important agreements 
signed. 
  He added that he believed that the current visit by 
President 
Ballen, who is also accompanied by some entrepreneurs, will 
surely help promote bilateral relations. 
  Li continued that, as a developing country, the economic aid 
that China can offer to the other developing countries is quite 
limited, adding the aid is a kind of manifestation of friendship. 
  But Li said that China is willing to further cooperative 
relations in economy, trade and other fields with Ecuador. 
  Ballen agreed that his talks with Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin were fruitful, saying that the Ecuadorian Government 
respects China's achievements in economic construction. 
  He also said he hoped that the economic and trade 
cooperation 
between the two countries would be further enhanced. 
  The Ecuadorian president noted that there exist unreasonable 
economic structure and unfair commodity prices in the world, 
which make the economies of many developing countries, including 
Ecuador, suffer big losses and many difficulties. 
  Li agreed with Ballen, adding that there are still in the 
current world hegemonism and power politics, as well as an 
unreasonable political and economic order. 
  He said that for the developing countries the most 
outstanding problems are the heavy debt burdens and unfair 
exchange rates. Such a situation should be changed and China 
will make efforts to this end, together with Ecuador and other 
developing countries, Li added. 
  Ballen invited Li to visit Ecuador and Li expressed his 
thanks for the invitation. 
  Those present at the meeting were Zhu Lin, wife of Li Peng, 
Josefina Villalobos de Duran Ballen, wife of President Ballen, 
and Vice Minister of Agriculture Wu Yixia, who is also chairman 
of the Chinese Government Reception Committee.

President Sixto Duran Ballen said here today that the Chinese

various fields without any political conditions attached.

relations has been the main topic. 
  Ecuador and China are different in ideology and have 
different modes of development, said the president, adding that 
both countries are developing nations, facing similar problems, 
and both should speed up their development, improve the people's 
lives and open up to the outside world according to their 
respective conditions.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Sichuan Province on Friday [18 March] signed a contract with New 
China Hong Kong Group Ltd on the building of a four-lane 90 km 
express highway linking this provincial capital with Mianyang 
city to the northeast. 
  The contract was signed by Sichuan provincial officials and 
Tsui Tsin-tong, chairman of the Hong Kong company. 
  The original Chengdu-Mianyang highway, in one of the most 
economically active areas of this southwest China province, has 
been a bottleneck in the region's economic growth. 
  The Hong Kong company will pay for 60 percent of the 1.35 
billion yuan (about 155 million U.S. dollars) total cost of the 
project and Sichuan the rest. 
  The express highway is due to be completed in three years 
from the day work starts, according to the contract. 
  Officials said that the Chengdu-Mianyang express highway 
will 
link up with two other main highways in the region and is 
expected to boost the local economy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mark What Tibet NPC Deputies Say on Human </F>
Rights"] 
  [Text] Fifteen deputies from Tibet attending the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] met 
Chinese and foreign reporters a few days ago and answered their 
questions on Tibet's human rights and other issues of common 
concern. 
  Some of these deputies come from top levels of the 
autonomous 
region while others are from the basic levels; some are of serf 
origin and some are living Buddhas from the monasteries. They 
used facts to explain that the Tibetans are living in peace and 
tranquility and genuinely enjoy human rights and to refute the 
lies spread by certain "guardians of human rights" on Tibet's 
human rights. 
  More than 40 years ago Tibet was like a state in the 
extremely backward Middle Ages and one of the regions in the 
world where human rights violation were very serious. Following 
the democratic reform and abolition of the extremely decadent 
and dark feudal serf system, the millions of serfs and slaves 
stood up. They were no longer the property of the serf owners 
who could be traded, transferred, exchanged, and used as payment 
of debt or who were subjected to the savage actions of eye 
gouging and cutting off of tongues, hands, and legs. Since 
then, they have enjoyed basic human rights and have become 
masters of their own affairs. Earthshaking changes have taken 
place in Tibet after more than 40 years of construction. The 
situation in Tibet is now characterized by political stability, 
economic development, social progress, national concord, and 
peace and tranquility. After giving an account of Tibet's rapid 
development in recent years, Re Di, who is responsible for the 
Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, said: "With a brand 
new outlook, Tibet now stands firm on the roof of the world." 
  Who says that human rights are being encroached upon in 
Tibet? These facts precisely prove that the Chinese Government 
most respects human rights in Tibet and that the Tibetan people 
have gained human rights to the greatest extent. This forms a 
sharp contrast to racial discrimination which still prevails in 
the United States today. 
  It is the principle of the UN Charter to enhance and 
encourage respect for human rights and basic freedom of the 
whole of mankind, irrespective of race, sex, language, or 
religion. The United States, which talks volubly about human 
rights, should have observed this principle. For a long time, 
however, the laws in some southern states in the United States 
still regard certain racial discrimination systems as legal, 
such as schools which separate whites from other races, laws 
which oppose marriages between white and black, and different 
public utilities for whites and blacks. This makes it easy to 
understand why the United States has still not ratified 
implementation of the "Convention on Preventing and Punishing 
Genocide," "International Convention on Banning and Punishing 
the Crime of Apartheid," "International Convention on Abolishing 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination," and other international 
human rights treaties. 
  There is no doubt that the people in Tibet have gained a 
wide 
range of unprecedented human rights. However, there are some 
people in the world who say that human rights are being violated 
in Tibet. These people apply the human rights concept of the 
West to view the reality in Tibet or they simply use concocted 
or seriously distorted facts to substitute Tibet's reality and 
befuddle world opinion. Last May, a Western organization spread 
the news that Tibet had arrested more than 100 Tibetans. The 
report was a pure fabrication. In fact, only three persons were 
tried at that time, of which one was immediately released and 
the other two had directly undermined state security. At the 
50th meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee held in February 
this year, a representative of a nongovernmental organization 
went so far as to present a piece of news, which he himself did 
not verify, to attack the human rights situation in Tibet. The 
so-called list presented by Christopher of 105 "peaceful 
dissidents" jailed in Tibet was also fabricated. Re Di told 
reporters: According to an investigation, many people on the 
list do not even exist. Some of them are living in their own 
homes. We do not know where the list came from. What would be 
the reaction of Christopher to such an explanation? 
  The Tibetans, who have personally experienced historic 
changes since Tibet's liberation over the past decades, rather 
than the people in the West, who are far away from the region 
and are ignorant of Tibet, are most qualified to speak on human 
rights in Tibet. Some of the 15 Tibetan deputies, who gave an 
account of Tibet's human rights to Chinese and foreign reporters 
a few days ago, were slaves in the past. They all had records 
of their human rights being trampled upon before the democratic 
reform and the wide range of human rights enjoyed after the 
democratic reform. Their appraisal of Tibet's human rights is 
genuine and fair. When a reporter asked about Tibet's human 
rights, Ruo Sang, director of a Lhasa neighborhood, said: I am 
most qualified to answer the question. We were slaves in the 
past without any human rights. Today, we have become masters and 
genuinely enjoy human rights. 
  Even figures from abroad have acknowledged the development 
and progress in the region after their trips to Tibet. Those 
who were prejudiced toward Tibet in the past have also stated 
that it is unfair to view Tibet based on one-sided statements. 
  Here, we would like to ask: Why are certain Western 
countries and organizations always trying to attack human rights 
in Tibet, regardless of the facts? Why have they thrown mud at 
the Tibetans, who have freed themselves from suffering and who 
have become masters of their own affairs, rather than condemning 
the darkness, brutality, and cruelty of the serf owners who 
deprived the Tibetans of their human rights? Why have they paid 
special attention to a handful of splittists while ignoring the 
efforts made by the Tibetans to boost construction and develop 
the economy? There is only one answer to these questions: They 
are making use of human rights in an attempt to support "Tibetan 
independence," stirred up by a tiny handful of splittists, and 
disrupt China's reunification. As stated by the Tibetan 
deputies, such a conspiracy will be resolutely opposed by the 
people of the whole country, including the Tibetans.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "Regional News </F>
Hookup" program] 
  [Text] Addressing the regional conference on 
organizational and personnel affairs which concluded on 4 March, 
Guo Jinlong, deputy secretary of the Tibet Regional Party 
Committee, forwarded these five requirements for improving 
Tibet's organizational and personnel affairs while building a 
socialist market economic system: First, we must intensify 
theoretical study to liberate our minds and become more aware of 
the need to press forward and bring forth new ideas; second, 
leading bodies must continue to heighten their political 
awareness and improve their work style; third, grass-roots party 
organizations must be built into stronger bodies; fourth, 
positive and steady efforts must be made to ensure the success 
of three reform programs; and fifth, organizational and 
personnel affairs departments must build themselves into 
stronger bodies. 
  Comrade Guo Jinlong said: In recent years, guided by the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
vast number of cadres in Tibet have further emancipated their 
minds and renewed their mindsets. However, timeworn concepts 
and outmoded ideas have not yet been uprooted. Under the new 
situation today, arming the minds of party member-cadres with 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
and continuing to emancipate our minds and renew our mindsets 
are important and urgent tasks as well as the basic aspects of 
the party's ideological construction. He stressed: Party 
member-cadres must set examples of study. They must be more 
conscientious about the study and be more assiduous in doing 
research. Leading cadres must use their own examples to guide 
the study of party member-cadres at all levels. 
  Comrade Guo Jinlong pointed out: To build stronger 
grass-roots party organizations in Tibet, we must start with 
building up the grass-roots party organizations in the sprawling 
agricultural and pastoral areas. We must firmly strengthen our 
leadership, throw in more manpower, and spend more time in 
improving various party branches and their supporting party 
organs in rural areas. Meanwhile, we must make great efforts to 
revitalize the weak and listless [ruan ruo huan san] leading 
bodies as quickly as possible so that grass-roots party 
organizations in agricultural and pastoral areas can be built 
into fighting fortresses for launching antiseparatist struggles 
and leading the masses to wipe out poverty and become affluent. 
  Speaking on the need for organizational and personnel 
departments to build up themselves, Guo Jinlong forwarded these 
three requirements: First, they must thoroughly study Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics so as to thoroughly emancipate their minds and 
renew their mindsets. Second they must carry forward the fine 
traditions and change their work style. Third, they must firmly 
carry out set policies. 
  Lu Huimin, member of the regional party committee standing 
committee and head of the regional party committee organization 
department, examined last year's work and elaborated on this 
year's projects.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ren Youming: "Adhering to the Reform and </F>
Opening Up Policy and Strengthening Macroeconomic Control -- 
Tibet's Economic Operation Is Entering the Orbit of Sound 
Circulation"; from the "News" program] 
  [Text] Last year, to adapt itself to the establishment of 
a socialist market economic structure, Tibet seized the 
opportunities to continue carrying out the reform and opening up 
policy and to strengthen macroeconomic control, thus enabling 
Tibet's economic operation to move into the orbit of sound 
circulation. The region's economy grew steadily. 
  1. Farm and animal husbandry production expanded steadily. 
In the field of agriculture in particular, a bumper harvest was 
reaped for the sixth consecutive year in 1993. Total output of 
grain and oil-bearing crops amounted to 620 million kg, up 3.3 
percent over 1992. Total agricultural output value is expected 
to top 2.22 billion yuan, up 5.3 percent over 1992. In 
livestock production, despite difficulties caused by natural 
disasters, the main production quotas were slightly higher than 
or were basically equal to those of the previous year. Town and 
village enterprises and diversified undertakings expanded fairly 
rapidly. The total output value of town and village enterprises 
reached 340 million yuan, breaking all previous records and 
presenting an increase of 14.9 percent over 1992. 
  2. There was a marked improvement in the economic returns of 
transport and industrial enterprises. The region's total 
industrial output value is expected to reach 470 million yuan, 
up 7.8 percent over the previous year. The output of major 
items rose by a big margin over that of 1992. Product quality 
improved, and production capacity and marketing ratio reached 
94.85 percent. Both production and marketing efficiency rose. 
The number of losing enterprises declined by a small margin. 
  3. New progress was made in foreign economic relations, 
trade, and tourism. The region's foreign trade is expected to 
reach $100 million, up 55.4 percent over 1992. In tourism, 
efforts were made to improve management and operational 
standards, to open up new roads and scenic spots, and to develop 
a special category of tourism to enhance attraction. In 1993, 
Tibet recorded 23,000 visits by foreign tourists, and the income 
from tourism topped 106 million yuan, an all-time-high record. 
  4. Investment in fixed assets expanded steadily, and fairly 
significant progress was made in the construction of key 
projects. The region's investment in fixed assets came to 1.59 
billion yuan, up 15 percent over the previous year. 
  5. Individual economy grew rapidly. At present, there are 
41,000 individually and privately run enterprises in the region, 
employing more than 70,000 people, with total capital topping 
200 million yuan. Annual taxes paid by these enterprises 
accounted for 40 percent of the region's industrial and business 
taxes. 
  6. The reform of the economic structure continued to develop 
in depth. The proportion of mandatory plans in the planned 
economy dropped, while the ratio of market regulation rose. 
Great strides were made in pricing reform. The prices of 
timber and other products were decontrolled. The market was 
growing. The pace of reform of the commodity circulation system 
was accelerated. Last year, the region's total retail sales 
reached 1.9 billion yuan, up 13.1 over 1992. 
  7. Macroeconomic control was strengthened, and financial 
order improved markedly. The region's financial institutions 
recovered 220 million yuan of inter-bank loans, accounting for 
more than 60 percent of the total loans, (?eliminated) over 80 
items involving arbitrary exaction of fees and fines from 
enterprises, and returned more than 2.5 million yuan to staff 
and workers who had asked to participate in a fund pooling 
effort. In addition, the balance of deposits in banks 
throughout the region topped 900 million yuan, up 29.46 percent 
over the previous year. The region's revenue exceeded 140 
million yuan, up 37 percent over 1992.

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Ren Youming: "Breaking Up the </F>
Closed-Door Mode and Establishing a New Pattern of Opening Up to 
the Outside World -- Tibet's Economy Is Leaving the Plateau To 
Establish Links With All Parts of the Country"; from the "News" 
program] 
  [Text] Last year, Tibet further opened itself up to other 
parts of China and to the outside world, thus enabling the 
region's economy, which had remained closed for a long time, to 
begin leaving the plateau to establish links with other parts of 
the country and with the world. In 1993 alone, Tibet approved 
40 cooperative investment projects with a contracted investment 
volume of over 67 million yuan and $9.6 million, thus setting a 
record in introducing outside capital to the region. Foreign 
trade volume reached $100 million, setting a record. This shows 
that the original rigid and closed form of economy in the region 
has been broken and that the region's economy is beginning to 
move in the direction of an open pattern. A new economic 
operating mechanism is taking shape. 
  Last year, the regional party committee and government lost 
no time in taking the initiative to open up Tibet to the outside 
world by strengthening ties with neighboring provinces and 
cities, especially strengthening lateral economic cooperation 
with the coastal areas. Serious efforts were made to cultivate 
markets outside the region and to support and encourage economic 
departments and enterprises to seek markets in the coastal areas 
and in other countries. According to incomplete statistics, 
economic and foreign trade departments in various prefectures 
and cities set up nearly 100 trade missions, export-oriented 
trade display centers, and wholly owned or joint venture 
enterprises in Guangdong, Shandong, Shanghai, Liaoning, Tianjin, 
Beijing, and Hainan Provinces and Cities. The regional 
department of economic relations and trade alone set up more 
than 20 foreign trade centers in the coastal areas. It also 
cooperated with foreign firms to establish more than 10 
export-oriented enterprises, including an eiderdown processing 
plant in Shenzhen, a goat down processing plant in Hebei, and a 
warehouse in the Tianjin Bonded Area. Through these centers, 
Tibet's farm and animal products and nationality handicraft 
products were able to enter the world market. 
  While transforming their operating mechanisms, state-owned 
enterprises in the region also took the initiative to enter into 
cooperation with large enterprises in the coastal areas. So 
far, they have established dozens of export-oriented wholly 
owned or cooperative enterprises in Chengdu, Guangzhou, 
Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. In Hainan Province alone, Tibet has set up 
more than 10 enterprises there. 
  To attract outside business firms and to promote prosperity 
by opening up to the outside world, the autonomous region 
stepped up the construction of infrastructure facilities in 1993 
despite financial difficulties in a bid to expand trading with 
other parts of China and foreign countries. It invested more 
than 1 billion yuan to finance the expansion of the Bangda 
Airport in Gonggar County, to improve the Sichuan-Tibet, 
Qinghai-Tibet, and China-Nepal highways, to import advance 
communications equipment, to install program-controlled, 
direct-dialing telephones in the urban areas of six prefectures 
and cities, and to build new power stations. At the same time, 
the right to handle foreign trade and the power to examine and 
approve foreign trade investment projects were delegated to 
lower levels, thus enhancing the capacity to attract foreign 
investments and investments from other parts of China. So far, 
Tibet has attracted nearly 1 billion yuan worth of investments 
from more than 20 provinces and cities in China and more than 
$100 million of foreign capital, and has accepted nearly 30 aid 
projects, worth more than $40 million, from United Nations 
organizations and the governments of foreign countries.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 19 (XINHUA) -- A massive geological 
survey since 1986 has resulted in the finding of 130 new mineral 
deposits, including copper, lead, zinc, silver, gold, mercury 
and other important minerals, in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, 
official sources here said. 
  The sources noted that geologists have worked out a 27-part 
mineral distribution map on a 1:200,000 scale, covering 193,200 
square km, about 16 percent of the total area of Tibet. 
  New discoveries include the finding of gold, silver, copper, 
lead, zinc and other metals from volcanoes near Samyai temple, 
in Chanang county. 
  Explorers also found a large andalusite deposit at Ramba 
town 
of Rinbung county, the sources said. 
  The explorers have also carried out a detailed survey of the 
chromium in Qusum county, the gold in Xaitongmoin county, the 
multi-metal sources in Maizhokunggar county and the geothermal 
potential at Yangbajain in Damxung county. 
  Moreover, the explorers found that the many salt lakes in 
Tibet contain not only boron, but also lithium, tin, cesium and 
other valuable minerals. 
  In a survey of the Yangbajain geothermal area 90 km from 
Lhasa last year, explorers found that there is a layer of water 
at 262 degrees celsius at a depth of 2,006 meters. This was 
cited as another important breakthrough following the discovery 
of a 202 degrees celsius water layer at 1,000 m deep in 1989. 
  According to the sources, Tibet has built in recent years 
120 
new mines, including 28 chromium-iron mines, 11 boron mines and 
seven gold mines. 
  The output value of mining now accounts for more than one 
third of the industrial output value of the Tibetan Autonomous 
Region, the sources added.

  [Text] At a provincial conference on management of planned 
urban and rural construction held recently, Comrade Xie Fei 
indicated that in pursuing modernization projects in urban and 
rural areas, it is primarily necessary to do a good job of 
planning. Work in planning determines the future modern 
features of both urban and rural areas in the province, and is a 
major issue that has a bearing on many future generations and 
their well being. We must be resolute in doing a good job of 
work in this domain. Planning for urban and rural construction 
must be formulated in accordance with Guangdong's goal in 
realizing modernization. There must be an overall, 
comprehensive layout, with conspicuous foci. When such plans 
are ready, earnest implementation is called for to fulfill the 
goal of the plans. This precisely requires all places to adhere 
to principles, act according to their abilities, implement plans 
step by step, while paying attention to protecting the authority 
of the plans. NANFANG RIBAO carries the full text of Xie Fei's 
speech in a prominent position in its front page today.

"Guangdong People's Deputies From Hong Kong Call For a Halt To 
Abuse of Military Vehicle License Plates"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 23 Feb (TA KUNG PAO) -- A total of 17 
Hong Kong deputies to the Guangdong People's Congress, including 
Ye Ruo-lin, Yu Tang-sheng, Yen Tung-chen, and Liu Pei-chiong 
submitted a motion to the Guangdong People's Congress urging the 
removal of military and police license plates from cars used by 
leading cadres not related to the Army or police. 
  Xu Weikai, the member of the Guangdong People's Congress 
responsible for handling the motions, spoke highly of the 
motion. The illegitimate use of military license plates is a 
problem of major concern for interior inhabitants. It shows 
that the people at home share the views with those outside the 
border. 
  The motion stated that, not long ago, Hong Kong newspapers 
reported an incident which took place in Shenzhen: When a 
military vehicle collided with a truck from Hong Kong, the 
driver of the military vehicle beat the driver from Hong Kong 
instead of giving an apology. Reportedly, the vehicle did not 
belong to the police, and it was only a company vehicle which 
used a military license plate to do businesses. The incident 
created an adverse influence in Hong Kong. The motion 
continued: It is said that, besides provincial and city 
leaders, the department- and bureau-level cadres also put 
military or police license plates on their cars. In order to 
make more money, some Army and police units openly sell license 
plates or lease military vehicles to businessmen. Such moves 
will affect relations between the people and the Army and police 
and will hinder the establishment of a modern urban management 
system, which will further deteriorate the already crowded 
traffic and damage the prestige of the Army and police. 
  The motion urged provincial-level leading cadres not related 
to the Army or police to take the military license plates off 
their cars. It also advised the provincial people's congress to 
submit a report to the Central Military Commission, Armed Police 
Headquarters, and Public Security Bureau calling for a halt to 
the practice of selling or contracting military license plates, 
which harms the reputation of the state, Army, and police.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 20 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province is taking effective measures to stress 
planning in urban and rural construction. 
  Urbanization in this fast-booming province has hit a rapid 
pace in the past decade. However, this is the first time for 
the local government to begin to stress planning for urban and 
rural construction. 
  Central townships in the Pearl River Delta will have to make 
blueprints on local construction before 1995. All cities will 
have to revise their original blueprints. Certain laws to 
ensure the implementation of the blueprints will be made, 
according to the provincial urban and rural construction 
administration. 
  Infrastructural construction, especially of the sewage and 
refuse treatment system in urban areas, is to take priority in 
urban construction planning. Underground facilities must be 
completed ahead of above-ground buildings. 
  Officials from the administration said in a recent meeting 
that land which is not yet planned in detail is not to be 
leased. Construction of buildings in a line along both sides of 
a highway is banned, and houses already built along highways but 
in contravention of the new regulations will be removed. 
  In addition, architectural styles will be diversified soon. 
Alongside major railway stations, ports, public squares, 
airports, trade and commercial buildings and administrative 
buildings and along major urban streets, groups of buildings and 
scenic spots bearing symbols of each local city will be 
constructed. 
  Guangdong now has 39 cities and 1,462 towns, with a total 
urban population topping 19.04 million. 
  In the past decade, many small towns and townships expanded 
to become medium cities. However, a lack of planning has 
resulted in air, water and noise pollution in the area. 
Transportation has also become difficult as many shops and 
other facilities have been built at random along highways.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 21 (XINHUA) -- China has placed the 
drafting of an anti-monopoly law on the agenda so as to promote 
healthy development of its socialist market economy. 
  This information was released at a symposium jointly 
sponsored by China's State Administration of Industry and 
Commerce and the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTD) in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, today. 
  The three-day international symposium is aimed at exchanging 
views on the roles of competition policy and competition laws, 
how to prevent monopolies which result from over-concentration 
of economic sectors on the market and how to prevent abusing 
favorable conditions on the market. 
  According to the symposium, since China enforced its 
Anti-Unfair Competition Law at the end of last year, China has 
scored progress in the development of a unified national market. 
  Various levels of the department of industry and commerce 
are 
taking measures to protect the legal rights and interests of 
producers and consumers. 
  A high-ranking official of the State Administration of 
Industry and Commerce said that his administration is willing to 
cooperate with UNCTD and its counterparts in international 
communities and jointly fulfill the international obligation 
stipulated by "fair principle and regulations". 
  Officials of the Administration of Industry and Commerce 
from 
all over the country and experts from Britain and Germany 
attended the symposium.

  [Excerpts] Regional Chairman Cheng Kejie delivered a 
speech at a regional propaganda and ideological work conference 
on 5 March. 
  In his speech, Chairman Cheng Kejie first and foremost 
briefed articipants on the region's economic situation in 1993 
and expressed views on propaganda and ideological work in the 
region's economic domain in the new situation. He stated: In 
1993, the whole region witnessed rapid economic growth, 
political stability, nationality solidarity, and social 
progress. The region's domestic gross national product reached 
77.3 billion yuan, up by 19.6 percent over the previous year. 
The region's national economy witnessed sustained and rapid 
growth. The region's social investment in fixed assets reached 
22.125 billion yuan, up by 56.9 percent over the previous year. 
The average per capita subsistence income of the region's urban 
residents reached 2,611 yuan, up by 12.3 percent over the 
previous year, while the average per capita income of the 
region's peasants reached 885 yuan, up by 4.3 percent over the 
previous year. [passage omitted] 
  Chairman Cheng Kejie stated: The year 1994 is a crucial year 
for us to push ahead with a series of reforms aimed at building 
and developing a socialist market economic structure. We should 
strive to push the region's economic growth onto a new stage and 
try to have the region's gross national product quadrupled three 
years ahead of schedule or even earlier. 
  Chairman Cheng Kejie expressed the hope that propaganda and 
ideological work in the region's economic domain will focus on 
the following aspects at present: 
  1. Correctly guiding public opinion and making it contribute 
more to reform, opening up, and modernization drive; 
  2. Publishing comprehensive, objective, and accurate reports 
to reflect facts and true situations; 
  3. Adhering to a fine style of seeking truth from facts and 
speaking the truths to boost morale and achieve tangible work 
results; 
  4. Conscientiously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as 
party and state policies and principles, actively carrying out 
explorations, and continually raising work standards. 
  On the afternoon of 5 March, comrades attending the regional 
propaganda and ideological work conference unfolded panel 
discussions at which persons in charge of Liuzhou City, Yulin 
Prefecture, Baise Prefecture, and various regional departments 
and bureaus exchanged views on the region's propaganda and 
ideological work. [passage omitted]

units, to work hard in unity, and implement the spirit of the 
national and regional conferences on propaganda and ideological 
work in a down-to-earth way as quickly as possible. [passage

  [Text] Nanning, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The Magran Investment 
Company Ltd. of Macao has recently signed a series of contracts 
with Fangcheng City, in south-west Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region, to develop a peninsula tourist resort near the port city. 
  The company will carry out a project to reclaim a 130-ha 
site 
from the sea, with work to start this year and to be completed 
in 24 months. 
  The parties agreed to set up Fangcheng-Zhuhai-Shenzhen-Macao 
and Macao-Fangcheng-Vietnam tourist routes. 
  Sources from Magran said the company has purchased 66 ha of 
land at the resort and plans to invest as much as one billion 
Hong Kong dollars to build hotel, villa, and public facilities 
and other development projects at the resort. 
  The Jiangshan Peninsula, 17 km from downtown Fangcheng, a 
major deep-water port in south-west China, was chosen as the 
site of a tourist resort for its unpolluted landscape, crystal 
blue water, wide beaches and many places of human interest. 
  Up to the end of 1993, the local government had invested 150 
million yuan on road, power and water supplies and other 
constructions at the resort. 
  The future resort has also attracted investment worth of 139 
million yuan by some 150 businesses from China and abroad, 
according to local sources.

  [Text] Beijing, Mar 18 (CNS)--Mr Yan Hongmo, member of the 
CPPCC and director of the National Bureau of Oceanography, said 
that Hainan Province would set up a department of oceanography 
to strengthen management over the Nansha, Xisha and Zhongsha 
archipelagoes and the surrounding waters. 
  Hainan Province is China's biggest ocean province with more 
than three million sq. kilometres of sea and the three 
archipelagoes of Nansha, Xisha and Zhongsha. 
  The province hopes to speed up its economic development and 
expand opening to the outside world by taking advantage of its 
environmental and ocean resources. Governor of the province Mr 
Ruan Chongwu said that the province would speed up the 
utilization and development of its ocean resources to strengthen 
its foreign exchange and cooperation with foreign countries and 
regions. 
  The department of oceanography in the province will plan the 
development, utilization and protection of ocean resources, 
giving priority to the development of ocean-related industries. 
  Mr Yan said that the output value of such industries had 
increased eightfold since 1979 but that value still did not 
match the size of China's population and the country's long 
coastline.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Central China's 
Henan Province has become the first choice of foreign investors 
beginning to eye the vast interior of the country for more 
economic opportunities. 
  At present, partly foreign-funded enterprises total 2970 in 
Henan and actual investment used has reached 600 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  Foreign capital has poured into the province from more than 
50 countries and regions of the world. Investment scale has 
been further enlarged. 
  Seventy percent of Henan's total joint ventures boast 
foreign 
capital investments from 5 to 30 million U.S. dollars. 
  Apart from funding the booming industrial and service 
sectors, more and more foreign investment has been directed 
toward infrastructure projects. 
  Zhengzhou Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., jointly funded by Japan, 
Thailand and China, has become one of the province's biggest 
profit-earners after introducing advanced technology and 
management experience. 
  A large agricultural province with very few foreign-funded 
enterprises only several years ago, Henan has rapidly expanded 
its economic opening-up in recent years. 
  Rich natural resources, abundant agricultural products, an 
ample labor force and preferential policies in utilizing foreign 
investment have effectively pushed Henan to the forefront of 
economic activities in inland China. 
  Henan's economic growth was six times the country's average 
in the year 1993, which was also faster than that of the 
developed coastal provinces. Its export trade volume also 
topped that of interior provinces last year.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday afternoon, Governor Jia Zhijie met 
with members of related departments under the provincial 
authorities to handle official business in Yichang; they studied 
and resolved six major issues relating to supporting the Three 
Gorges project in a matter of only half a day. 
  When Premier Li Peng inspected the Three Gorges project 
toward the end of last year, he explicitly set out requirements 
on a series of issues, including building of Yichang's 
Huanglongsi airport, the Yi-Huang highway, and telecommunication 
undertakings that have a direct bearing on the Three Gorges 
project. 
  At the very beginning when he started work, Governor Jia 
Zhijie put it bluntly that the Three Gorges project is located 
in Hubei, and the province is duty-bound to do a good job 
concerning the project. Regarding the several issues Premier Li 
Peng showed concern for, they must be implemented and launched 
immediately. [passage omitted] 
  It was decided at the meeting to handle official business 
that the provincial authorities would invest 23 million yuan in 
the Huanglongsi airport project, and have it completed by the 
end of 1995. New channels for investment should be 
enthusiastically opened so the Yi-Huang highway is completed by 
the end of 1995. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting made clear-cut decisions on improving Yichang's 
environmental quality, moving key enterprises that have 
pollution problems out of the city, and building the Yunci deep 
water harbor. Governor Jia Zhijie said, the six major issues 
related to the Three Gorges project were resolved in only half 
day. This showed that all departments have grasped the Three 
Gorges project as a top priority for the whole country and 
province, and embodied the spirit of breaking conventional rules 
and resolving specific problems in specific ways. In this 
spirit, the whole province from top to grass roots should make 
still greater direct contributions to the building of the Three 
Gorges project.

  [Text] A provincial propaganda and ideological work 
conference was solemnly inaugurated in Changsha yesterday. 
  The conference was held to relay and implement the spirit of 
a recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work 
conference; obtain instructions from the provincial party 
committee and government leaders with regard to propaganda and 
ideological work; review and sum up the province's propaganda 
and ideological work in 1993; and discuss and arrange for the 
province's propaganda and ideological work in 1994. 
  The conference was attended by over+ 300 people from the 
prefectural, autonomous prefectural, city, and provincial 
departments; large enterprises; large mines; some Changsha-based 
institutions of higher learning party committee secretaries; and 
the prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party 
committee propaganda departments directors. 
  Also attending yesterday's conference were provincial party, 
government, and military leaders, including Yang Zhengwu; 
[provincial military district commander] Pang Weiqiang; Yang 
Minzhi; Luo Haifan; Hu Biao; Wu Xiangdong; Yu Haichao; Pan 
Guiyu; Zhuo Kangning; Liu Tianying; and others. 
  Wen Xuande, provincial party committee standing committee 
member and propaganda department director, briefed the 
participants on the agenda and main spirit of the recently 
concluded national propaganda and ideological work conference. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin delivered a 
keynote speech, which was divided into the following three parts: 
  1. Further unify understanding of the extreme importance of 
propaganda and ideological work in light of the overall national 
interests during the crucial period. 
  2. Chart a clear-cut orientation for the province's 
propaganda and ideological work in accordance with the basic 
principles and major tasks spelt out by the central authorities. 
  3. Enable the party organizations at all levels to 
practically strengthen leadership over and constantly improve 
and refine propaganda and ideological work. 
  In his speech, Secretary Wang Maolin stated: The propaganda 
and ideological front has been one of the important fronts for 
building socialist modernization. The CPC has always attached 
great importance to propaganda and ideological work. Ever since 
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly called for attaching great 
importance to ideological and political work and carrying it out 
practically and conscientiously rather than slackening on it. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin said: At the recently concluded 
national propaganda and ideological work conference, Comrade 
Jiang Zemin expounded on the extreme importance of propaganda 
and ideological work in the new period in light of the overall 
national interests in the course of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics; laid stress on six work aspects; and 
urged the party committees at all levels to strengthen 
leadership over propaganda and ideological work. This year, 
China's economic structural reform is to make bigger strides 
toward building a socialist market economic structure on the 
basis of a host of successful experiences over the past 15 years 
and will, thereby, enter a crucial stage of comprehensive 
development. At present, the whole party must work hard, grasp 
each and every opportunity; deepen reform; expand opening up, 
promote development, and maintain stability, this being tasks 
facing Hunan's propaganda and ideological work also. Whether it 
is possible or not to raise propaganda and ideological work to a 
new level is bound to affect to a great extent the overall work 
of the central authorities and also the entire party cause. 
  Speaking of charting a clear-cut orientation for the 
province's propaganda and ideological work, Secretary Wang 
Maolin noted: At the recent national conference, the CPC 
Central Committee explicitly spelt out a series of principles 
and tasks for propaganda and ideological work and called on the 
whole party to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as the most basic 
principle; arm the masses with scientific theories; guide the 
masses with correct public opinion; indoctrinate the masses with 
a lofty spirit; and encourage the masses with outstanding 
literary and artistic works, these being the general and 
strategic tasks aimed at intensifying propaganda and ideological 
work in the course of building a socialist market economic 
structure. The CPC Central Committee also put forward a 
12-point principle, summing up both the historical and realistic 
experiences in the party's propaganda and ideological work 
during the socialist construction period and targeting a series 
of major propaganda and ideological issues that have a sizable 
impact on the country's overall interests. In order to 
implement this principle and attain the abovementioned goals, we 
should carry out work in a creative manner and in light of the 
province's actual conditions. Hunan's propaganda and 
ideological work should be primarily aimed at arming the broad 
masses of the party members, cadres, and people with the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; building a 
socialist market economic structure; and training, in the long 
run, a new generation of socialist people with lofty ideals, 
moral integrity, a sense of discipline, and cultural 
accomplishments. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin maintained: Comrade Jiang Zemin 
solemnly stated at the recent national conference: The local 
party organizations at all levels should assume greater 
responsibility for propaganda and ideological work as well as 
spiritual civilization building. To implement the spirit of 
Comrade Jiang Zemin's instruction to the letter we should, first 
and foremost, firmly adhere to a system under which party 
committee secretaries at all levels constantly take personal 
charge of and provide guidance to propaganda and ideological 
workers; second, the party committees at all levels should 
strive to establish a system under which propaganda and 
ideological work is to be reviewed and appraised at regular 
intervals; third, we should actively implement a system whereby 
all party leaders are required to accomplish a number of two 
civilizations building tasks during their tenure of office; 
fourth, we should build an effective leadership system and a 
sound management system for each and every propaganda and 
ideological department; fifth, we should gradually increase 
input in propaganda and cultural undertakings; and sixth, we 
should work hard to create a sound environment under which 
qualified personnel are able to develop their talents and skills 
with ease and comfort. 
  Yang Zhengwu, provincial party committee deputy secretary, 
also delivered a speech at the conference.

  [Text] At the provincial conference on propaganda and 
ideological work called yesterday, Chen Bangzhu, Hunan 
provincial party committee deputy secretary, concurrently 
governor, emphasized that the propaganda and ideological front 
is a very important one, propaganda and ideological work 
departments are very important departments, and propaganda and 
ideological workers are a very important force. At the crucial 
moment when tasks for reform, development, and maintaining 
stability are very heavy today, it is all the more necessary to 
pay great attention to doing a good job of doing propaganda and 
ideological work. 
  Comrade Chen Bangzhu said the current provincial conference 
on propaganda and ideological work is a very important one that 
has a bearing on the overall situation. At the national work 
conference on propaganda and ideological work, Comrade Jiang 
Zemin made profound discussion on the importance of propaganda 
and ideological work. Comrade Wang Maolin made exhaustive 
explanations in his theme report delivered on 4 March. This 
being the case, under the new situation we must pay greater 
attention to propaganda and ideological work and cannot afford 
any neglect or carelessness. Work in this domain must be greatly 
strengthened, and not the least weakened; it must be improved, 
and not come to a standstill. 
  Comrade Chen Bangzhu stressed that party committees, 
governments, and various departments at all levels should attach 
great importance to and support propaganda and ideological work. 
Primarily, it is imperative to implement the principle of doing 
two types of work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to 
both. Second, governments at all level should proceed to 
provide greater support and help for propaganda and ideological 
work in hardware and software. Hardware support means to 
ungrudgingly spending money to equip the propaganda and 
ideological front with necessary modern means step by step, to 
further improve conditions for developing propaganda and 
cultural undertakings, and resolve some practical difficulties 
of propaganda and ideological departments in a down-to-earth 
way. Software support means to constantly brief propaganda and 
ideological departments on the current situation and policies, 
and help them promptly see conditions and grasp the overall 
situation. At the same time, leadership at various levels 
should befriend more propaganda and ideological workers, 
constantly lend an ear to their opinions and suggestions, and 
learn to make use of this channel to improve their own work. 
  The task is heavy and the road ahead is a long one for 
propaganda and ideological work. We believe that a brand new 
situation will surface in Hunan's propaganda and ideological 
work in the wake of the current conference, and will play a 
still greater role in socialist modernization and make still 
greater contributions. 
  Wang Keying, provincial party committee standing committee 
member, concurrently governor in charge of routine affairs, 
presided over the conference yesterday. Attending the 
conference also were Wen Xuande and Liu Dingying.

  [Text] Beijing, March 6 (XINHUA) -- Beijing picked up 
speed in merging urban and suburban industries and services. 
  By 1993, urban-suburban joint economic entities of various 
types have reached 3,746 from a mere 520 manufacturing 
businesses a decade ago. 
  The set-up also expanded to other areas such as scientific 
and technological cooperation and business with overseas 
ventures. 
  In the industrial sector, there are 200 subsidiary member 
factories in the outskirts now. The suburban establishments are 
able to provide more space and labor as well as capital the 
urban factories need in order to expand. 
  A survey shows that close to 20,000 specialists from 
Beijing's institutions of higher learning and research 
institutes are working for the suburban enterprises. The 
technology input has helped invigorating the rural industries by 
diversifying the product mix and lifting the quality to a high 
level. 
  Last year, the value of industrial output in urban and 
suburban joint ventures amounted to the tune of 15.5 billion 
yuan, up 48.2 percent over 1992. They also turned over 1.32 
billion yuan in profits and taxes to the state.

  [Text] Beijing, March 6 (XINHUA) -- Residents in Beijing 
are finding that nowadays more and more daily necessities and 
services are provided by individual pedlars who have spread into 
every street in the capital. 
  Figures from the city's Individual Laborers' Association 
show 
that Beijing residents buy 80 percent of their foodstuffs, 
including meat, eggs, vegetables and fruits, from individual 
peddlers. 
  More than 80 percent of the city's 140,000 businesses 
engaged 
in commerce, catering, repairs and other services are managed by 
individual laborers. 
  Self-employed laborers are playing an indispensable role in 
Beijing people's daily life. 
  Officials from the association noted that Beijing used to 
have few individual laborers. 
  In 1978, there were only 259 self-employed workers in 
Beijing. Private businesses had little to do with residents here. 
  As the country adopts a more flexible and diversified 
economy, private business has been encouraged by the municipal 
government. The number of individual workers in Beijing has 
grown in leaps and bounds. 
  In 1992, the city's individual-business households increased 
by 35.5 percent, setting a national record. 
  By the end of last month, the city's individual-business 
households had risen to 336,000. That is, every ten households 
in Beijing are served by one individual-business household. 
  In addition, the association officials say, those private 
businesses are more than adding employment opportunities for 
surplus rural laborers -- they facilitate people's daily life, 
make the market prosper and help adjust the economic structure. 
  The annual retailing volume of the city's 
individual-business 
households registers at 3.4 billion yuan (400 million U.S. 
dollars), accounting for 6 percent of the city's total. 
  Each year, the city's individual workers hand over about 280 
million yuan (31 million U.S. dollars) in state taxes. 
  Meanwhile, more and more private workers have been involved 
in the management of small state-owned enterprises, giving a 
shot in the arm to firms in the red. 
  Officials said that some 6,000 small state commercial firms 
have taken on a good shape after introducing private management. 
  At present, there are 4,100 private ventures in the city, 
employing 56,000 workers, offering over 130 million yuan (15 
million U.S. dollars) in state taxes. 
  These private firms have extended their businesses from the 
previous handicraft, catering service and merchandise to wider 
areas, such as clothing, trade, transport, house construction 
and technology. 
  Many firms have created by now well-known brands which are 
welcomed by consumers.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, March 5 (XINHUA) -- The economy in 
north China's Hebei Province grew the fastest ever last year, 
Governor Ye Liansong said in a report to the local people's 
congress.

billion U.S. dollars), up by 16.5 percent over the previous year. 
  The province's total industrial output value reached 260 
billion yuan, increasing by 29.4 percent. 
  The governor said that many of the province's large and 
medium- sized state-owned enterprises have been revitalized 
after they had changed their operational mechanism. 
  The province also made new progress in pushing joint stock 
system. So far the province has approved the setting up of 306

  [Text] Hohhot, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The ever-improving 
investment conditions and climate in Baotou, a steel city in 
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has sparked an 
influx of foreign investment. 
  In 1993, the city government licensed 81 foreign-funded 
enterprises, which involved a combined investment topping 1.05 
billion U.S. dollars and actually utilized 54.089 million U.S. 
dollars. The enterprises earned a total of 22.8 million U.S. 
dollars in foreign exchange last year. 
  According to Mayor Wang Fengqi, Baotou is China's largest 
industrial city from among areas populated by ethnic minority 
nationalities. He claimed that his city is an ideal place for 
foreign investment, as it has a sound industrial foundation and 
an ample supply of energy. 
  But he admitted that Baotou had remained a virgin land for 
overseas investors until 1985, adding that there were only 23 
foreign-funded enterprises by July 1991. 
  Starting in 1992, Baotou has accelerated the pace of reform 
and opening-up in an attempt to improve its investment 
environment. The city has since attached particular importance 
to upgrading infrastructure such as telecommunications, 
transportation and urban utilities. 
  Meanwhile the city government has promulgated a set of 
preferential policies to attract overseas investment. 
  From January to September 1991, Baotou launched three trade 
and investment fairs in Beijing, Hong Kong and the city, signing 
17 joint and cooperative venture agreements, which involved a 
total of 41.16 million U.S. dollars. 
  Last year Baotou launched a campaign to invite both domestic 
and foreign investors to help exploit its rare-earth resources, 
one of the major natural resources of the city. 
  The city has meanwhile sent business inspection teams to 
Hong 
Kong, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Mongolia and 
countries in Southeast Asia. It has also set up liaison offices 
in Shenzhen, Manzhouli and Erenhot to deal with foreign affairs 
and nationals. 
  In the past three years the city government has trained more 
than 300 local officials at various levels in a bid to better 
arm them with advanced management and expertise. The move, 
officials said, has built up a talent reserve for the 
establishment of more foreign- funded enterprises in the city. 
  By the end of 1993 Baotou had registered a total of 157 
foreign- funded enterprises, with 2.09 billion U.S. dollars in 
foreign investment involved and 122 million U.S. dollars 
actually used. 
  City officials said that the introduction of foreign funds, 
management and technical know-how have saved many of the city's 
enterprises from bankruptcy.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 6 (XINHUA) -- A large area of virgin 
land three times the size of urban Tianjin City, northern 
China's leading industrial center, is soon to be developed 
around the city. 
  Sources from the Tianjin Municipal Land Administration said 
that more than 800 square kilometers of virgin land, mostly with 
saline- alkali soil, is scattered outside the urban areas of the 
city. Most of them, near the city proper and convenient for 
transportation, have a large development potential. 
  Experts say it is rare for such a large industrial city as 
Tianjin, about two hours drive from Beijing, to have so much 
waste land. However, some of the land is now being utilized. 
  In the Dagang District, a petrochemical zone, a chemical 
plant to manufacture 140,000 tons of ethylene annually is being 
built within an expanse of 120 square kilometers of waste land. 
Another project to produce 200,000 tons of polyester will also 
be built there. 
  Another 200-square-kilometer piece of land, along a major 
highway leading to northeast China, rich in water supply and 
near the urban area, will become another industrial zone for the 
city. 
  In addition, a third tract of about two ha. [hectares] of 
waste land will be used to grow vegetables and to raise 
livestock. Some other areas will be developed for tourism. 
  Mu Xueming, deputy chief engineer at the Tianjin Municipal 
Planning and Design Bureau, said that the waste land will 
provide an important site for the development of Tianjin and 
Beijing as well. 
  "While Beijing will become China's political and cultural 
center, Tianjin, which is only 137 kilometers away, will be 
turned into an economic center in northern China, and the large 
amount of virgin land makes it possible to do civil construction 
and to expand industries," he said. 
  XINHUA has learned that over the next ten years Tianjin 
plans 
to build, within some 350 square kilometers of land, a new city 
and an economic zone involving the metallurgical sector, the 
chemical industry and commerce, finance and tourism.

  [Text] Lanzhou, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's Gansu 
Province has been making active efforts to divert rural surplus 
labor into non-agricultural sectors over the past two years, in 
a bid to make more rural residents become well-to-do. 
  By the end of last year more than three million surplus 
farmers had found jobs in rural industrial businesses, creating 
6.3 billion yuan in profits and taxes. Some found new jobs 
outside the province with the help of local specially 
established labor markets, contributing 6.6 billion yuan to the 
local revenue. 
  Nevertheless, Gansu still has more than two million rural 
people with not enough to eat and wear, according to local 
officials. 
  To help more rural residents become well-off, the provincial 
government designated in 1992 Wuwei and six other counties and 
cities to experiment with finding new jobs for local farmers, 
with the purpose of promoting the transfer of surplus labor 
throughout the province to profitable sectors. 
  The experimental counties and cities have adopted various 
measures, including developing rural industries to increase job 
opportunities and organizing rural farmers from remote areas to 
find jobs in areas outside Gansu through local labor markets. 
  Meanwhile, some cities and counties have also built rural 
farmers' markets, adjusted the agricultural production structure 
and expanded eco-agriculture, which have proved to be effective 
in relocating surplus rural labor. 
  In addition, the provincial government has launched an 
experimental job-creation project at the provincial level with 
the aim of tapping rural surplus labor.

  [Text] Yinchuan, March 5 (XINHUA) -- Ningxia Hui Autonomous 
Region has made further progress in 1993 in attracting overseas 
investment and in other aspects of international economic co- 
operation. 
  Zhang Zhigang, the region's top foreign trade official, said 
that businesses from 21 countries and regions have set up nearly 
300 joint ventures in Ningxia, among which, four projects 
involve an investment of ten million U.S. dollars apiece. 
  Besides manufacturing industry, Zhang said, overseas 
investment were expanded to many other sectors, especially the 
service industry in this region in northwest China. 
  Zhang said four loans by foreign governments have also been 
signed or listed on the agenda in 1993. They involve a total of 
27.46 million U.S. dollars. 
  Over the past years, the region has received 17.5 million 
U.S. dollars of aid from international society. These funds 
have financed 11 projects and contributed to the development of 
local economy, the official said. 
  The region exported 111 million U.S. dollars worth of 
products last year, Zhang said. 
  While exporting more than 240 kinds of goods, the region has 
diversified the overseas market, Zhang said. 
  By giving enterprises more rights in international 
co-operation, Zhang said, the region has greatly improved its 
performances in the international economic competition. 
  According to the official, many enterprises in the region 
are 
now engaged in contracting of overseas construction projects, 
labor services and operation of overseas ventures.

5898 0441] 
  [Text] Yinchuan, 13 Feb (XINHUA) -- With the opening of 
ports in border areas, foreign businessmen were busy choosing 
sites for investment and establishment of plants; areas of 
cooperation in the cotton planting region, jointly invested in 
and managed by some ten provinces and municipalities, continued 
to expand; wagons and wagon- loads of industrial raw materials 
were transported from mine pits to East China in order to 
fulfill cooperation agreements; two-way exchanges of cadres was 
conducted; trade fairs attracted both domestic and foreign 
investors...... [ellipsis as published]. Five provinces and 
autonomous regions from China's northwest region flung their 
doors open to the outside world on an unprecedented scale. They 
gave full play to their advantage of abundant natural resources; 
comprehensively developed economic and technological cooperation 
with other provinces and autonomous regions; introduced 
investment from abroad and established economic relations with 
other regions; learned from the experience of other regions for 
their own development; made use of other regions' superiority to 
make up for its own deficiency; and promoted the development of 
the local economy. 
  The northwest regions of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, 
and Shaanxi are endowed with rich natural resources and have 
long supplied a large amount of the resources and raw material 
for the national economic construction. However, due to a weak 
economic foundation, they were not effective at 
self-development. With the deepening of reform of China's 
economic system, and with the gradual lifting of prices of 
resources and raw materials, these provinces and autonomous 
regions--which in the past have relied on state subsidies and 
mandatory production plans--have been forced one after another 
to enter market competition. As a result, people in those 
regions began to change their concepts and sought to open a new 
path for development through extensive economic and 
technological cooperation with other regions. 
  Advancing to the east and expanding to the west, reaching 
out 
to the north and descending to the south, introducing investment 
from abroad and establishing economic ties with other regions in 
China, and adopting an omni-directional opening up policy have 
all become the common understanding of these provinces and 
autonomous regions in developing the economy. So far they have 
joined some ten regional cooperation organizations including the 
Huanghe Economic and Technological Cooperation Zone, the 
Northwest Economic and Technological Cooperation Zone, and the 
Shaanxi-Gansu-Sichuan Economic Cooperation Zone. Last year 
alone they concluded agreements with other regions on some 
10,000 cooperation projects and on exchanges of goods worth over 
two billion yuan. What is gratifying is that economic and 
technological cooperation is not limited to project cooperation 
and to exchange of commodities alone; they now involve joint 
development. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region cooperated with 
other regions to develop a cotton growing base; Gansu Province 
jointly developed rare metal resources with other regions; and 
Ningxia prepared to cooperate with other provinces to build a 
power supply project. Funds from five provinces, autonomous 
regions, and other regions for China's Huanghe Economic 
Cooperation Zone Joint Stock Limited Company have initially been 
put in place as scheduled. The operation of this company will 
effectively help coordinate economic exchanges between various 
provinces and regions as well as promote their development 
through cooperation. 
  The five provinces and autonomous regions have changed their 
passive stance and have begun to aggressively look for business 
partners. Xinjiang concluded agreements of 2.1 billion and 1.7 
billion yuan respectively from its holding of the "Spark Trade 
Fair" and "Urumqi Trade Fair" in 1992. Last May, 2,044 
contracts, agreements, and letters of intent worth 1.7 billion 
yuan were signed at Shaanxi's Third Technological Results Fair. 
At the same time, the five provinces and autonomous regions 
have increased economic cooperation with coastal regions. 
Qinghai Province entered into an economic cooperative 
relationship with Shandong Province. They signed 51 projects on 
introduction of funds, technological cooperation, and personnel 
exchange, as well as 32 agreements on expanding friendly ties 
during exchanges of leadership last year. They also carried out 
1,700 personnel exchanges, with over 500 of these involving 
cadres at or above county level and at or above department head 
level. Qingdao Chemical Industry Institute has annually helped 
train 50 specialized chemical industry personnel for Qinghai's 
Haibei Prefecture during each of the last five years. Shaanxi, 
Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Gansu have also exchanged cadres and work 
experience with economically developed coastal regions. They 
have broadened their economic vision and increased economic 
cooperation projects through such kind of exchanges.

  [Text] Xining, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Members of the Qinghai 
Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have concentrated on helping 
local economic development and enabling farmers and herdsmen to 
escape poverty. 
  They have worked out a detailed report and proposals based 
on 
their grass-roots investigations for the provincial government. 
  Since last year the provincial CPPCC members have given 
their 
suggestions and opinions to the Qinghai government on developing 
socialist market forces, finding and exploiting natural 
resources, promoting agriculture and animal husbandry, and 
invigorating major state enterprises. 
  Based on a proposal by three provincial CPPCC members for 
gold panning by peasants in poverty-stricken areas, the 
provincial government announced a regulation on gold panning by 
collectives. 
  By the end of last year this northwest province's CPPCC 
committee had gathered 85 proposals from its members, 74 of 
which have already been transfered to related departments. 
  The provincial CPPCC heads have taken the lead in 
investigations of grass-roots units. 
  A provincial CPPCC group led by its committee chairman Han 
Yingxuan made a study tour of the Haixi Autonomous Prefecture of 
the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities. The tour concentrated 
on investigating the development of salt resources and ways to 
raise the added value of local-made products. 
  The CPPCC members also play a role in attracting overseas 
investment to the province, as some of them have relatives and 
friends abroad.

<F P=106> [Interview with Living Buddha Yexiong Zhanyanggendeng </F>
Jianchuo, deputy to the provincial people's congress and vice 
chairman of the Huangnan Zang Autonomous Prefectural People's 
Congress, by station reporters Kang Ying and Zhang Erlong, at 
the Xining Guest House on 1 March: "Patriotism and Religious 
Devotion Are My Magnificent Cause" -- recorded] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 1 March, the reporters lightly 
knocked at the door to a room on the second floor at the Xining 
Guest House. Living Buddha Yexiong Zhanyanggendeng Jianchuo, 
deputy to the provincial people's congress and vice chairman of 
the Huangnan Zang Autonomous Prefectural People's Congress, who 
had just returned from a panel discussion, enthusiastically 
showed us into the room, and accepted our interview with 
pleasure. 
  The Living Buddha, in his red patchwork outer vestment and 
with a string of beads in his hand, has a stout physique and a 
sedate countenance and manner. He is 47 years old this year, 
and a cousin of the late Great Master Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi 
Gyaincain. He was tonsured when he was four years old, and is 
now the abbot of several monasteries, including Xunhua's Wendu 
Monastery and Tongren's Yexiong Monastery, as well as a council 
member in charge of the Buddhist Association of China. 
  When we talked of the late Great Master Bainqen, Living 
Buddha Ye Xiong became very excited, saying that Great Master 
Bainqen Erdini often had taken care of him, and had showed great 
concern for him in many ways. In particular, he had accompanied 
Great Master Bainqen Erdini to visit Tibet on three occasions, 
and personally had heard Great Master Bainqen Erdini propagate 
party policy, and his several talks on safeguarding the 
motherland's unity. He said: The government work report has 
summarized the 1993 economic work in the province, and was 
inspiring. This year, the whole province, from top to bottom, 
should take longer strides so as to accelerate the pace of 
economic development. As one from the religious circles, he 
said that he too should exert efforts. In excitement, he raised 
his hands and said: The patriotism and religious devotion of 
the late Great Master Bainqen were genuine. Patriotism and 
religious devotion are likened to a man's two hands; one hand 
represents patriotism, and the other religious devotion. In 
completing any undertaking, neither hand is dispensable. 
Patriotism means to be in favor of socialism, and to support 
the party and government in developing the economy, whereas 
religious devotion means to observe state laws, decrees, rules 
and regulations conscientiously; explain Buddhist teachings; 
safeguard the unity of the motherland; and strengthen 
nationality solidarity. Here the Living Buddha indicated that 
it had been stressed in the government work report that normal 
religious activities must be protected, whereas there must be a 
stern crackdown on lawbreaking activities that take advantage of 
religion to engage in actions that endanger society, stability 
and unity. That passage is well put, and I approve of it with 
both hands. Should patriotism and religious devotion be absent 
in any religious person, this will violate the most basic 
religious teaching. He added: Those individuals who have 
failed to abide by basic religious teachings are like a burning 
cigarette butt: If it is allowed to burn, a fire may break out 
and endanger the monastery, as well as other people. Such 
people must be purged from the religious circles. Living 
Buddha Ye Xiong continued, only by strengthening unity and 
maintaining stability will it be possible to pursue 
construction, and achieve economic development. When the nation 
prospers, Buddhism will prosper, too. Patriotism and religious 
devotion are the common aspiration. 
  When the reporters concluded the interview and expressed 
their thanks to Living Buddha Yexiong, the latter wanted the 
reporters to relay one of his suggestions, which is that 
specific departments should be given specific help when they 
conduct experimental exploration in developing production to 
support the maintenance of monasteries. For example, some plots 
of land, or hill slopes, or woods should be allotted to them. 
Thus their abilities will be strengthened, and the financial 
burden of the government and the masses will be relieved. When 
the reporters nodded approval of relaying his opinion to related 
departments, Living Buddha Yexiong happily signed his name on 
the reporters' books in beautiful Tibetan calligraphy.

  [Text] Xian, March 6 (XINHUA) -- Poverty-stricken areas in 
northwest China's Shaanxi Province have made strides in economic 
development over the past few years. 
  According to local economic officials, last year the per 
capita net income of farmers from the province's 70 poverty-hit 
areas reached 448.9 yuan. Farmers from the province's 37 other 
major poor areas achieved a per capita net income of over 350 
yuan, basically solving the difficulty of having enough to eat 
and wear. 
  Poverty-stricken areas, which make up two-thirds of 
Shaanxi's 
total area and served as revolutionary bases in the past, are 
mainly located in the province's northern and southern parts, 
featuring poor natural conditions, inconvenient transportation 
and slow economic development. 
  Since the early 1980s, the central government, together with 
the provincial government, has decided to list the province's 
northern and southern areas as the main targets of the 
help-the-poor program, and given them great financial support 
and large quantities of manpower. With the focus on economic 
development, the program has helped poverty-hit farmers to 
overcome difficulties and solve the problem of making a living. 
  In carrying out economic development, local farmers pin 
their 
hopes on capital construction of agriculture to help them to 
prosper and have made painstaking efforts towards such 
development. 
  For instance, by the end of last year, farmers in the 
province's poverty-hit areas had cultivated about 1.1 million 
hectares of farmland and had been blessed with grain harvests 
for many years running. 
  Consequently, northern Shaanxi, which used to suffer serious 
soil erosion, has brought 30,000 sq [square] km of erosion-prone 
land and 90 percent of the shifting sands zones (566,667 
hectares) under tight control after having adopted a series of 
measures to carry out comprehensive harnessing work. 
  Moreover, forest and grass cover in the province has been 
raised from the former 11 percent to the present 36 percent, 
greatly improving the ecological environment for farming. 
  Local officials from poverty-stricken areas have also made 
active efforts and have built bases for carrying out diversified 
economic development in accordance with characteristics of 
mountainous areas and plateaus, in a bid to form highly 
efficient pillar industries for various poor localities. 
  In line with market demands, northern Shaanxi has stressed 
the development of businesses concerning cigarette-making, 
growing and processing of fruit and potatoes, and breeding of 
sheep, while southern Shaanxi has laid its focus on the 
development of products such as tea, fruit, medicine and edible 
fungus. The efforts have begun to pay off. 
  Statistics show that earnings from diversified economy of 
northern and southern Shaanxi now makes up 70 percent of their 
local total output value of agriculture. 
  In the meantime, local officials have made a success of 
technical popularization and training, greatly improving the 
general competence of farmers from poverty-hit areas, as well as 
the level of productive forces in those areas. 
  Over the past few years, governments at provincial, 
prefectural and county levels have worked closely and have 
sponsored more than 100,000 training courses of various kinds 
for poverty-stricken areas, and have established 4,900 exemplary 
scientific and technological households (centers). 
  At present, the main laborers in 56.7 percent of the rural 
households from the province's poverty-hit areas have mastered 
one or two special skills to become prosperous. 
  Poverty-hit areas of the province have also made active 
efforts to build more rural and township enterprises. The 
endeavor has generated positive results. 
  Meanwhile, governments at various levels have actively 
strengthened exchanges of cadres with economically developed 
provinces and municipalities, injecting great vitality into the 
economic development and social progress in poverty-hit areas of 
the province. 
  In addition, 60 departments at provincial level have sent 
260 
cadres to 53 poor areas of the province to help carry out 
help-the-poor work. These cadres have helped poor areas launch 
197 projects and introduce more than 200 million yuan of outside 
investment into poor areas.

Chief Procurators in Xinjiang Regards Safeguarding Social 
Stability and Enhancing Economic Progress as Their Central Tasks 
in 1994"] 
  [Text] Chief procurators at various levels in Xinjiang, 
who have been conducting an anticorruption drive at the front, 
recently gathered in Urumqi, exchanged their experiences, and 
jointly discussed their work objectives for 1994. 
  Mijiti Kurban, chief procurator of the Xinjiang Regional 
People's Procuratorate, summarized 1993's procuratorial work as 
"strictly enforcing the law and handling various cases." With 
joint efforts made by procuratorial organs at various levels in 
Xinjiang in 1993, Xinjiang has consented to the handling of 
2,161 economic crimes including corruption and bribery; 
registered to investigate 933 cases, including 434 major and 
important cases, completing the investigation of 621 cases; 
publicly prosecuted 424 people in 336 cases; and reverted 
economic losses amounting to over 30 million yuan to the state 
and collectives. Xinjiang has investigated and penalized 29 
criminals who were cadres at or above county and department 
levels. To safeguard Xinjiang's political and social stability, 
procuratorial organs have also promptly given instructions to 
arrest and prosecute a group of antirevolutionaries and major 
criminals. 
  The meeting specified that safeguarding Xinjiang's political 
and social stability and to enhancing its economic progress is 
the regional procurators' central tasks in 1994. Xinjiang's 
procurators should uphold the working policy of strictly 
enforcing the law and handling cases, intensify judicial 
supervision, concentrate energies to investigate and handle 
major and important cases involving corruption and bribery, 
rigorously crack down on antirevolutionaries and major 
criminals, and assiduously investigate and handle crimes 
involving "infringement of rights" and dereliction of duties.

"Regional Meeting of Presidents of Intermediate People's Courts 
Calls on Courts at all Levels to Provide Effective Legal 
Services and Protection for Society"] 
  [Text] A Xinjiang regional meeting of intermediate 
people's courts presidents, which ended recently, called on law 
courts at all levels in Xinjiang to enhance the level of law 
enforcement, to give full play to their judicial functions, and 
to provide effective legal services and protection for social 
stability and economic development. 
  In 1993, the rate of various cases tried by law courts at 
all 
levels in Xinjiang through the judicial and supervision 
procedures of first and second hearings rose by 21.74 percent 
from that of 1992; among them, the rate of criminal cases closed 
after the first hearing rose by 4.3 percent. Law courts closed 
1,341 economic crime cases after the first hearing and handed 
down fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and death 
sentence to 1,325 criminals in 1993, thereby effectively 
cracking down on serious economic crimes and promoting the 
anticorruption drive. While conducting their judicial work, law 
courts at all levels took active part in comprehensive 
management of public security. They held a total of 491 trials 
and handed down sentences to 2,372 criminals, thereby deterring 
criminals and encouraging the broad masses of the people. 
Meanwhile, they closed 14,924 cases of economic disputes, which 
involved a total amount of 900 million yuan plus, after the 
first hearing. The figure of economic dispute cases showed an 
increase of 66.82 percent from that of 1992. They paid close 
attention to trying new types of cases, particularly those 
closely related to the campaign launched by the state to 
strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and to develop a 
market economy; they handled these cases properly and achieved 
marked social effect [she hui xiao guo 4357 2585 2400 2654]. 
  Addressing the meeting, President Kurban Rozi of the 
Regional 
Higher People's Court said: In 1994, law courts at all levels 
in Xinjiang should continue to crack down on 
counterrevolutionary and serious criminal activities and on 
economic crimes as well; to try big and important cases in a 
down-to-earth manner; to vigorously regulate economic 
relationships; to protect the legitimate rights and interests of 
citizens, legal persons, and other organizations according to 
laws; to enhance their judicial level; and to strictly enforce 
laws so as to provide effective legal protection and services 
for maintaining social stability, for promoting the building of 
a clean and honest government, and for accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economy. 
  Li Fengzi [2621 6646 3320], Standing Committee member of the 
Xinjiang Regional Party Committee and secretary of the Xinjiang 
Regional Commission on Politics and Law, also delivered a speech 
at the meeting.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Dehua (2621 1795 5478): "Persist in Doing </F>
Two Types of Work Simultaneously, Ensure Prosperity and 
Stability--Notes on an Interview With Abulaidi, the Newly 
Appointed Chairman of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region] 
  [Text] Urumqi, 2 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--At the Second 
Plenary Session of the Eighth Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional 
People's Congress, which was held today, Abulaidi Amudurexiti, 
51, was elected chairman of the autonomous region with an 
absolute majority vote, thus becoming the fourth chairman of the 
autonomous region. 
  Chairman Abulaidi was interviewed by this reporter here. 
  Abulaidi was born to a Uygur nationality handicraft family 
in 
Yining, Xinjiang. After completing his secondary education, he 
was admitted first to the University of Xinjiang to undertake a 
professional course in industrial and civil architecture, and 
later to Xinjiang Industrial College to undertake a professional 
course in electrification and automation of industrial 
enterprises. He graduated in 1965 and was assigned to work at 
the Xinjiang Institute of Architectural and Surveying Design. 
  He was engaged in architectural and surveying design for 17 
years. During this period, he acted successively as technician, 
professional team leader, engineer, and vice president. In 1983 
he was transferred to the regional planning commission and acted 
successively as vice chairman and CPC committee secretary. He 
was in charge of the work of capital construction 
administration. In September 1991 he was elected vice chairman 
of the autonomous region while remaining in charge of capital 
construction work. Last November he succeeded Tomur Dawamat as 
acting chairman of the autonomous region. 
  During his long career in capital construction work, he 
began 
to take part in concrete project design, then he played a part 
in and was in charge of the work of supervising and coordinating 
many large and medium-sized capital construction projects. He 
left his footprints everywhere. 
  Abulaidi said: I feel a greater sense of responsibility 
after being elected chairman of the autonomous region today. He 
said frankly: Although Xinjiang is trying hard to catch up with 
the accelerating pace of development throughout the country, the 
overall level of development is still low. By the end of this 
century the whole country will have marched to a relatively 
comfortable standard of living, while Xinjiang can only match 
that pace if its GNP increases by 800 percent. At present, the 
gap between Xinjiang and the average national level is not 
narrowing, but widening. The CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council are very much concerned about it, and officials 
and the common people of Xinjiang are even more anxious about 
it. At this meeting, Xinjiang has set a "rapid and highly 
effective" development path. In 1994, Xinjiang's GNP must reach 
43.4 billion yuan, which is an increase of 11 percent over last 
year; and the total output value of our industry and agriculture 
must reach 56.5 billion yuan, which is an increase of 10.8 
percent over last year. Otherwise, the door of a relatively 
comfortable standard of living will be shut against Xinjiang. 
  Abulaidi is still confident of the large-scale development 
of 
Xinjiang. He said: Xinjiang has rich natural resources, and, 
in particular, its achievements in prospecting for and 
developing petroleum and nonferrous metals are spectacular. 
Xinjiang has gathered bumper harvests in agriculture and animal 
husbandry for 16 consecutive years and achieved social 
stability, unity among nationalities, and a considerable scale 
of economic construction. Now that the state is implementing the 
policy of "opening up border areas," Xinjiang is in the 
forefront. At present, Xinjiang is making more efforts to 
improve the investment environment. The bottleneck which has 
restricted the rapid development of Xinjiang-- the problem of 
communications--will be fundamentally ended during the Eighth 
and Ninth Five-Year Plans; post and telecommunications will 
become a part of the global network of communications in August 
1995; and a number of key power stations and hydropower stations 
are being extended and constructed. 
  When talking about how Xinjiang maintains a stable 
situation, 
Abulaidi said that the measure taken by Xinjiang is to "do two 
types of work simultaneously": The first is to develop the 
economy, particularly the rural economy, in a rapid and highly 
effective manner. Xinjiang is a minority-nationality region 
with agriculture and animal husbandry at the core, which account 
for a very high proportion. At present, 300,000 people in 
Xinjiang still have not solved the problem of food and clothing. 
Only when the rural economy develops can the people live and 
work in peace and contentment. Hence, the key to maintaining 
stability in Xinjiang is to promote massive economic 
development, particularly massive rural development. The second 
is to resolutely and thoroughly fight against divisive 
activities among nationalities, which should never be tolerated.

land of many nationalities, unity and equality among all 
nationalities in the field of cultural life are the basic 
guarantee for ensuring common prosperity and development among 
various nationalities. Therefore, the use of a minority 
nationality language in a cable TV broadcasting station, a new 
form of TV propaganda tool, will certainly enrich the contents 
of TV propaganda broadcasts in various nationality languages.

  [Text] Urumqi, March 7 (XINHUA) -- China's first cable 
television station in Kazak language was formally opened for 
service Sunday [6 March] in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region, another step in bringing modern culture to 
one of the world's last nomadic cultures. 
  The station will broadcast colorful locally-made or 
translated Chinese and foreign films, TV plays and other 
artistic programs in the Kazak language to about 500,000 viewers 
all over the Asia- Pacific region who have waved farewell to 
nomadic lives. 
  The 1.1-million Kazak population is mainly scattered in 
Xinjiang and Gansu Province. 
  Traditionally the Kazaks have lived on horseback, spending 
their whole lives moving about seeking pasture and water for 
their herds, totally cut off from basic education and health 
care facilities, not to mention advanced culture. 
  In recent years state and local governments have encouraged 
and helped more and more nomadic Kazaks to settle down and 
engage in the processing of livestock products instead of their 
single traditional pursuit of animal husbandry. 
  Along with efforts to stimulate local economy, governments 
at 
all levels have attached great importance to promoting 
traditional Kazak culture to satisfaction of the Kazak people's 
spiritual needs. 
  Broadcast and television have been cited to perform the 
task, 
having the advantages of being rapid, popular and vivid. 
  In 1989 the first Kazak-language TV news programs were 
beamed 
to the whole autonomous region, enabling Kazaks along both sides 
of the Tianshan Mountains to be well informed and entertain 
through a product of modern civilization for the first time in 
their lives. 
  Moreover, 24-hour Kazak-language TV broadcasting programs 
have been offered since the end of last year by the local 
regional TV station. 
  Traditional Khazak culture, including ancient poems, fairy 
tales, proverbs and mottoes, which used to be transmitted mainly 
by storytellers, has spread even wider among the Kazak people 
thanks to TV and radio broadcasts with distinct local flavors.

  Jiang Zemin, who is also the general secretary of the 
Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee, made the call here today when 
he visited Guangdong deputies to the National People's Congress, 
whose second session concluded this afternoon. 
  The general task of "seizing development opportunities, 
deepening reform, opening wider to the rest of the world, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability" is in 
conformity with the objective of "striving for a sustained, 
rapid and healthy" economic development, Jiang said. 
  "The key to its success lies in a correct handling of 
relations between reform, development and stability," he said, 
adding this is the "basic spirit" of the general task. 
  Jiang also stressed the importance of improving economic and 
social management. 
  "All party and government officials should learn managerial 
knowledge, improve management systems and raise management 
levels," he said. "This is an important condition for economic 
development and social stability." 
  Guangdong Province bordering on Hong Kong and Macao, Jiang 
said, is the earliest to open to the outside world and 
relatively more developed economically. It has created some 
important experience in developing a socialist market economy. 
He expressed the hope that Guangdong would take advantage of 
its good conditions to make greater contributions to the 
fulfillment of the general task set for the nation by the 
central authorities.

  [Text] Report from Beijing by staff reporters Ni Keer and 
Zhu Xijia: Yesterday [21 March] morning, Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, and state president, met 
in the Liaoning Room of the Great Hall of the People with all 
the deputies from our province who were attending the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress. He stressed: 
With regard to development in Gansu and the western region, you 
must keep a cool head in acknowledging existing gaps, must not 
be outdone, must seize favorable opportunities, must march 
courageously, and must speed up development. 
  While meeting with the deputies from our province, Jiang 
Zemin made an enthusiastic speech. He said: Due to the 
shortage of time, I was not able to take part in your group 
discussion, which is why I have come to call on you today. We 
all know that we are, in the final analysis, making concerted 
efforts for the prosperity, flourishing, and development of the 
entire Chinese nation and the People's Republic of China 
regardless of our different nationalities, religions, or 
convictions. I often stress that he who has wealth speaks 
louder than others. This must not be interpreted as everyone 
being incumbent to make a fortune. This is not what I mean. 
The people's standard of living must be increased, but this 
does not mean that everyone must make a fortune. We must make 
our country's economic power strong. In my view, becoming 
wealthy means the development of our national economy as a whole 
and the overall national power of our country. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out: I have visited Gansu twice. My 
general impression is that there is a certain gap between the 
western region and the coastal areas in economic development. 
Gaps have existed among various countries in the world. This 
is also the case with the developed capitalist countries. Even 
in the United States, there are differences between the east and 
west coasts and between the southern and northern regions. Gaps 
among them exist. There are definitely gaps among our 30 
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, and such gaps 
cannot be narrowed within a short period of time. 
  Jiang Zemin urged the Gansu people's deputies to keep a cool 
head in acknowledging such gaps and to never remain content with 
lagging behind because of a poor foundation and meager heritage. 
They must march forward courageously to attain the economic 
development target. In a word, they must reach this target. 
With regard to the speed of economic development throughout the 
country, the more proper the speed is, the better the results 
that can be achieved. If the speed of economic development is 
excessive, it will ultimately be slowed down. We will then 
suffer great losses. If we fail to develop our economy at a 
speed which is obviously achievable through hard work, this also 
means losing the favorable opportunity for development. 
Therefore, we must seize the favorable opportunity to promote 
our economic construction as soon as possible. 
  Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat, accompanied 
Jiang Zemin to meet with the Gansu people's deputies.

<F P=106> [Resolution of the Second Session of the Eighth National </F>
People's Congress (NPC) on the "Report on the Work of the 
Government"; adopted by the Second Session of the Eighth NPC on 
22 March 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth NPC has deliberated the "Report on the Work of the 
Government" delivered by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the State 
Council. The session holds that 1993 was a year of victorious 
advance along the road of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, in which China scored significant achievements 
in reform, opening up, and modernization construction and opened 
up a new situation in the work of all fields. The report gives 
a factual summation of the work in the past year and puts 
forward positive and prudent tasks for the coming year. The 
session has decided to approve the report. 
  The session points out: This year will be crucial for 
accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic 
system and maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 
6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. To 
successfully fulfill the various tasks established by the 
current session, we must carry out the work in all fields across 
the country under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
party's basic line; must comprehensively implement the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; and must 
subordinate to and serve the overall interests of seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability; seeing to it that 
reform, development, and stability coordinate with and promote 
each other. 
  The session emphasizes: We must steadfastly take economic 
construction as the central task and shift the focus of economic 
construction to improving economic efficiency. Agriculture is a 
major issue having a vital bearing on the overall national 
economic situation and social stability. Therefore, we must 
take practical and effective measures to strengthen the role of 
agriculture as the foundation of national economy -- giving 
particular attention to the production of grain, cotton, edible 
oil, meat, sugar, and vegetables; actively assisting the 
development of village and township enterprises; developing the 
rural economy in an all-round way; earnestly implementing 
programs to aid the poor; reducing peasants' burdens; and doing 
everything possible to increase peasants' incomes. We must go 
all out to improve the performance of large and medium 
state-owned enterprises, continuing to change the operating 
mechanisms of state enterprises, actively carrying out the pilot 
project for establishing a modern enterprise system, 
strengthening the internal management of enterprises, building 
up the vitality and stamina of enterprises for further 
development, striving to preserve and increase the value of 
state-owned assets, and bringing into play the role of state 
enterprises as the mainstay of the national economy. We must 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, 
energetically adjust economic structure, maintain a rational 
investment scale, strictly control commodity price rises, firmly 
curb inflation, and strive to strike a basic balance between 
total supply and demand of the national economy. We must open 
the country wider to the outside world and expand cooperation 
and exchanges with foreign countries. We must continue to 
improve the people's livelihood on the basis of economic growth. 
  The session points out: In view of the relatively large 
number of reform programs to be launched this year, we must make 
meticulous preparations to ensure the smooth implementation of 
reform programs. We must take the overall interests into 
account, correctly handle the relationship between the central 
and local governments and national and local interests, and 
harness the enthusiasm of all sectors. We must summarize 
experiences in good time and properly resolve problems and 
contradictions cropping up in reform. We must reinforce 
discipline to ensure strict enforcement of orders and 
prohibitions. 
  The session urged: We should further strengthen socialist 
democracy and legal institutions, conscientiously protect 
citizens' legitimate rights and interests, ensure smooth 
progress in reform and development, and promote overall social 
progress. We should redouble our efforts to promote diligent 
and clean administration, prevent corrupt practices 
institutionally, and wage a resolute struggle against all kinds 
of corrupt practices. We should promote the practice of 
building the country through thrift and hard work, and oppose 
extravagance and waste. We should continue to carry out 
in-depth education on the legal system among all citizens so as 
to heighten the legal sense in all segments of society. Leading 
cadres at all levels should take the initiative in studying and 
abiding by the law, strictly enforce the law, and safeguard the 
dignity of the law. Governments at all levels must learn to 
manage economic and social affairs through legal means and 
exercise the reins of governance according to law. Acting in 
accordance with the law, we should resolutely fight against 
various criminal activities that seriously jeopardize people's 
lives and property and hurt modernization, and earnestly 
exercise comprehensive management over public security. We 
should maintain and improve the system of autonomy for minority 
regions, safeguard unity among various nationalities and 
national unity, and promote common prosperity among various 
nationalities. We should heighten the national defense 
awareness of all people and intensify efforts to modernize 
national defense. 
  The session urged: We should unswervingly uphold the 
principle of carrying out two tasks simultaneously and paying 
equal attention to both, and strengthen socialist spiritual 
civilization. We should arm people across the country with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, and strive to nurture a new type of 
citizen with lofty ideals, moral integrity, better education, 
and a strong sense of discipline. We should devote great 
efforts to developing science and technology, education, 
cultural services, health care, and physical culture; promote 
the close integration of science and technology with the 
economy; and do a good job of educational reform and 
development. We should firmly implement basic national policies 
on family planning and environmental protection, and exploit and 
utilize natural resources in a rational way. 
  The session pointed out: We should continue to firmly 
implement the principles of "peaceful reunification and one 
country, two systems" while actively advancing the great cause 
of reunifying the motherland. To ensure the smooth change of 
governments and smooth transition in Hong Kong and Macao, we 
should lose no time in making all kinds of preparations for our 
country's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong and Macao on the basis of the "Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of 
China," the "Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative 
Region of the People's Republic of China," and relevant 
decisions by the NPC and its Standing Committee. Sino- 
Portuguese cooperation on the Macao issue has proceeded 
smoothly. The responsibility for the termination of talks 
between representatives of the Chinese and British Governments 
on Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements rests entirely 
with the British side. The Preliminary Working Committee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region [SAR] should extensively unify Hong Kong compatriots and 
make all kinds of preparations for establishing the Hong Kong 
SAR and the first government and legislative body there in 
accordance with the "Decision of the National People's Congress 
on the Method for Forming the First Government and Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region." The 
Chinese Government and people are determined and able to resume 
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule and to 
maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. We 
uphold the principle of one China in solving differences between 
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait through increased contacts 
and consultation. Realizing the peaceful reunification of the 
motherland is the common aspiration of all Chinese people, and 
any attempt at or action of splitting the motherland is useless. 
We pin our hopes on the Taiwan authorities, especially the 
Taiwanese people. We hope the Taiwan side will place national 
interests above everything else and work with us toward 
developing cross-strait relations and promoting the peaceful 
reunification of the motherland. 
  The session pointed out: We should steadfastly carry forward 
the independent foreign policy of peace, resolutely oppose all 
forms of hegemonism and power politics, and maintain and develop 
friendly relations and cooperation with other countries on the 
basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. China 
attaches importance to human rights and is willing to attend 
discussions on the human rights issue held by the international 
community on an equal footing. However, it will never allow any 
individual to interfere in its internal affairs under any 
pretext. Along with people in other parts of the world, the 
Chinese people will continue to contribute to establishing a new 
international political and economic order that is just and 
rational, to safeguarding world peace, and to promoting common 
development. 
  The session urged people of all nationalities across the 
country to work in concert, enthusiastically carry out reform, 
rely on themselves, carry out arduous pioneering work, and 
strive for new victory in reform, opening up, and modernization 
under the CPC's leadership and under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon [21 March], Wang Bingqian, vice 
chairman of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee, joined a group discussion by our province's NPC 
delegation. He pointed out: It is necessary to give full play 
to the role of people's congresses so that their work will 
become more active. 
  After listening to the speeches of Deputies Yan Haiwang, Lu 
Kejian, Xu Feiqing, (Ni Anmin), (Chen Xiuguo), and (Jin 
Guosheng), Wang Bingqian said: The people's congress is an 
organization of the people's power. Our power is granted by the 
people, and we shoulder an important historical mission. Party 
committees must lead and support the work of people's 
congresses. Within the jurisdiction conferred upon them by law, 
people's congresses must exercise their power boldly, and must 
carry out legislation and supervision work in an effective 
manner. The prestige of people's congresses must be established 
through their own work. 
  Wang Bingqian stressed: People's congresses must give full 
play to the role of people's deputies, conduct investigations 
and studies well, promptly reflect the opinions and aspirations 
of the masses, and solve popular and difficult problems to which 
the masses are paying close attention. In the meantime, it is 
necessary to strengthen education on the legal system, as well 
as the propaganda work of people's congresses themselves, so 
that people understand and support this work.

<F P=106> ["Resolution of the Second Session of the Eighth National </F>
People's Congress on the Work Report by the Standing Committee 
of the National People's Congress -- adopted on 22 March 1994"] 
  [Text] The Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] has deliberated the work report submitted by Vice 
Chairman Tian Jiyun on behalf of the NPC Standing Committee. 
The session holds: According to the requirements set by the 
First Session of the Eighth NPC, the NPC Standing Committee has 
conscientiously performed its duties; accelerated legislation, 
especially economic legislation; improved supervisory 
mechanisms; and made progress in other fields of endeavor. The 
report realistically summed up the work done in the past year 
and set forth major feasible tasks for the coming year. The 
session has decided to approve this report. 
  The session points out: Developing socialist democracy and 
improving the socialist legal system are important components of 
the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
To meet the needs of economic development and economic 
restructuring, it is necessary to actively push forward the 
development of socialist democracy, uphold and improve the 
people's congress system, and effectively protect the people's 
rights to be masters of the country and administer state affairs 
according to law; to strengthen the socialist legal system and 
advance and safeguard the development of the socialist market 
economy and promote all-around social progress with complete 
sets of laws; and to conduct extensive education in the legal 
system to enhance people's awareness of the law and to create a 
favorable environment for the legal system. 
  The session sets these requirements: The NPC Standing 
Committee should continue to guide itself with the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, develop socialist democracy and strengthen the 
socialist legal system as its basic task, and play its role 
better as the permanent body of the highest organ of state 
power. It should give first priority to economic legislation, 
conscientiously implement the "Eighth National People's Congress 
Plan for Legislation," and pay close attention to building the 
framework of laws for the socialist market economy. The NPC 
Standing Committee should strengthen its supervision in law and 
work, give priority to its supervision and inspection of law 
enforcement, and resolutely rectify the phenomena that laws are 
not fully observed or strictly enforced and that lawbreakers are 
not investigated and prosecuted. It should strengthen its ties 
with the masses of people, further improve its organizational 
and work systems, vigorously explore new ways, keep forging 
ahead, and do all its work well in order to make a due 
contribution to promoting reform and developing and maintaining 
stability.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Nie Li, newly elected NPC </F>
Standing Committee member and All-China Women's Federation vice 
president, by reporters Zhang Mingxin (1728 2494 2450) and Zhang 
Rongzhou (1728 2837 3166) in Beijing on 21 March] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 March (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Lieutenant 
General Nie Li was elected to the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress today. 
  Long wishing to interview this general who has the highest 
military rank among all women of the country, we were overjoyed 
when we had a chance encounter with her at the Jingxi Hotel, 
where the NPC deputies are residing. 
  Nie Li was sent to study in Leningrad in her early years and 
specialized in automatic control. Since her return to the 
country, she has long been engaged in the scientific and 
technological national defense industry. Beginning in 1982, she 
worked as the vice chairman of the Science and Technology 
Commission and the vice minister of the Commission of Science, 
Technology, and Industry for National Defense. Although she was 
relieved of her office last September, she is, as a Standing 
Committee member of the China Association for Science and 
Technology, still concerned with the country's scientific and 
technological development. 
  As General Nie is currently the vice chairman of the 
All-China Women's Federation, our interview naturally focused on 
"women." As soon as we took our seats, she started to talk 
enthusiastically about the Fourth International Women's 
Conference, which is scheduled to be held in Beijing next year. 
She said: 
  "Premier Li Peng said in his government work report: `The 
Fourth International Women's Conference is scheduled to open in 
Beijing in 1995, and the Chinese Government and people are now 
preparing for it.' This is the first time an Asian country and 
region has hosted the International Women's Conference. The 
previous three sessions were respectively held in Latin 
American, European, and African countries. We Chinese women can 
undoubtedly take pride in the United Nations' designation of 
Beijing to host this session of the Women's Conference." 
  General Nie had deeper thoughts. She continued: "This 
conference is the biggest international event ever hosted by 
China. It is estimated that over 30,000 guests will come to 
Beijing to attend this grand event. The theme of this 
conference is equality, development, and peace. Just as hosting 
the Olympics is not merely a matter of the sports circles, the 
significance of hosting the International Women's Conference 
goes well beyond the progressive women's movement. China's 
hosting of this century's last session of the International 
Women's Conference is a good opportunity for us to display to 
the world both the glamour of Chinese women and China's 
accomplishments in reform and opening up. We must firmly seize 
this favorable opportunity." 
  Nie Li briefed us: Apparent improvements have been 
registered over recent years in the employment, education, and 
social status of the Chinese women. The contingent of female 
cadres and female scientific research personnel is expanding. 
There are more and more female academicians, female professors, 
and female PhD holders (among whom 26 are female academicians, 
over 1,300 doctoral candidates, and over 174,000 senior 
professionals in various fields). Most provinces, prefectures, 
and counties have female leading cadres, while those provinces 
without provincial-level female cadres are being engaged in 
considering and selecting some. The number of female generals 
has also risen from five to 12. 
  We said: "You are the only female Lieutenant General in the 
Chinese Army." She replied with a smile: "With the enhancement 
of the qualities of the Chinese women, I believe there will be 
more female generals in the future." 
  Although she is primarily engaged in the work of the 
All-China Women's Federation, General Nie still follows the 
development of the scientific and technological cause with close 
interest. She attended and acted as vice chairman of the 
Appraisal Committee for the 1993 National Award-Conferring 
Ceremony on Scientific and Technological Progresses, which was 
held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing last weekend. 
  As we shook hands at parting, General Nie continued to chat 
about women's issues. She said excitedly that the year 1995 is 
the 50th founding anniversary of the United Nations and the 20th 
anniversary of the International Year of Women initiated by the 
United Nations. The International Women's Conference, which is 
to be held in the same year, will be China's contribution to the 
United Nations.

Starting Point for the `Tie King'--Interviewing Tsang Hin-chi, 
Newly Elected Member of the Standing Committee of the National 
People Congress and Chairman of the `Goldlion' Board of 
Directors"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 March (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Tsang 
Hin-chi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Hong Kong 
Goldlion Group Company Ltd, who was elected member of the 
National People Congress [NPC] Standing Committee today, would 
never forget the first conversation he had with his 
fellow-villager from Meixian County Ye Jianying, former Chairman 
of the NPC Standing Committee when the NPC adopted its first law 
after the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world 
was launched. At that time, he said that if China strengthened 
legislation work from then on, she would surely become a country 
with a sound legal system within 50 years. Ye Jianying nodded 
knowingly. 
  When he was elected member of the NPC Standing Committee, 
China's supreme legislative body, today, he deeply felt that he 
was shouldering heavy responsibilities. Unlike some other Hong 
Kong magnates, Tsang Hin-chi graduated from Zhongshan 
University's Biological Department in 1961 and went abroad to 
seek his fortune after working in the Biological Chemistry 
Laboratory of the Guangdong Academy of Sciences for two years. 
This enabled him to have a better understanding of mainland 
politics and economics and China's national condition. He said: 
In the past China was deeply influenced by the Soviet planned 
economic model. Since the drive of reform and opening up began, 
it has gradually freed itself from this influence. China, which 
is establishing a socialist market economic structure, is 
developing and forging ahead. This has been recognized by the 
world community. Of course, China has shortcomings. For 
example, the fact that there is corruption among some officials 
should not be denied. The problem is how we should approach 
these shortcomings. An individual or a family inevitably has 
one inadequacy or another. Ours is a big country. While making 
achievements, it still suffers some unsatisfactory phenomena. 
This is quite normal, and, moreover, the government is working 
to develop strong points and correct shortcomings. 
  To many people, the name of Tsang Hin-chi is synonymous with 
the title of "Tie King." In fact, the social activities in 
which he gets involved are so numerous that they far exceed all 
expectations. In addition to national deputy to the Seventh and 
Eighth NPC, he is vice chairman of the All-China Federation of 
Industry and Commerce, member of the Preliminary Work Committee 
of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, Hong Kong Affairs adviser, vice president 
of the Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, professor of 
Beijing University's Business Administration College, vice 
chairman of Jinan University's Board of Directors, and vice 
chairman of Jianying University's Board of Directors. His 
current election as a Standing Committee member of the NPC 
serves as a new starting point in the journey of his career and 
life. 
  Regarding the new role as a mission, Tsang Hin-chi told 
reporters that the Standing Committee has done a great deal of 
work on legislation. He noted that the legal system is being 
gradually instituted and improved, and instituting a legal 
system from scratch and proceeding from legal construction to 
legal improvement is a relatively long process. This has also 
been the case with some Western countries. 
  As the only NPC Standing Committee member from the Hong Kong 
region, Tsang Hin-chi is faced with the complex reality of Hong 
Kong being in the last three years of its transition and the 
historical trend of the Chinese recovery of sovereignty over 
Hong Kong. One may well say that the matter is complicated and 
the burden is heavy.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Jian (7115 1696): "Nie Li and Tsang </F>
Hin-chi Elected to NPC Standing Committee Through By-Election"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Lieutenant 
General Nie Li and Hong Kong businessman Tsang Hin-chi were 
elected to the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee in a by-election today. 
  Hence, the standing working body of the supreme organ of 
state power in China has co-opted the woman with the highest 
military rank in China and the only member from Hong Kong. 
  The fourth plenary session of the Second Session of the 
Eighth NPC was held here this morning. A total of 2,728 
deputies attended the plenum and made these two selections. 
  According to the stipulations of the Law on NPC 
Organization, 
when the NPC is not in session, the standing committee takes the 
place of the NPC in discharging the legislative and supervisory 
duties granted by the Constitution. The standing committee 
should be composed of 155 members, including a chairman, 19 vice 
chairmen, a secretary, and 134 standing committee members. 
  Over the past year, Vice Chairman Gan Ku, and Standing 
Committee Members Yang Lieyu and Pu Jie passed away; Yang Yanyin 
was appointed vice minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, 
and so resigned from standing committee membership. Therefore, 
there were four vacancies. 
  Nie Li is the daughter of Nie Rongzhen, one of the late 10 
marshals. She is vice president of the All-China Women's 
Federation. 
  When she was 25, she went to the Soviet Union to study 
automation control. She worked arduously for the development of 
China's military industry for 33 years. Last September, she 
retired from the important post of standing committee member of 
the CPC Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for 
National Defense. 
  Lieutenant General Nie Li, 63, has been a deputy to the 
Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC's. 
  Tsang Hin-chi, who comes from the Hong Kong business 
circles, 
is quite well-known among the people in China because whenever 
we go to any large shopping mall in China, we can always find a 
special counter exhibiting products of the "Gold Lion" series. 
In the previous decade, this tycoon, who is well-known for his 
"Gold Lion" business, donated hundreds of millions of Hong Kong 
dollars to educational, cultural, sports, and social welfare 
undertakings in China. 
  One after another, senior Chinese leaders and concurrent NPC 
deputies Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, 
Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, and Rong Yiren deposited pink-colored 
ballots in the ballot boxes in the Great Hall of the People 
today. 
  This reporter saw that there were a total of 22 ballot boxes 
and 32 balloting scrutineers in various places in the hall. 
  The votes, which are approximately twenty-four-mo in size, 
were printed in the characters of eight nationality languages: 
the Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uygur, Kazakstan, Korean, Yi, and 
Zhuang nationalities. 
  After winning the by-election, Tsang Hin-chi expressed his 
thanks for the NPC deputies' trust in him. He said that as a 
standing committee member, he would represent the interests of 
the people of Hong Kong to exercise various powers granted by 
the Constitution in accordance with the law. 
  Tian Jiyun, executive chairman of the plenum, presided over 
the election session today, which lasted about one hour and 40 
minutes.

<F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] The NPC wound up yesterday by passing a new budget 
law and a law giving Xiamen legislative power, but a surprising 
number of delegates voted against or abstained on both pieces of 
legislation. 
  More than a fifth of the 2,721 delegates voted against or 
abstained on the new budget law which outlaws deficits at all 
levels of government. Though no deputies spoke openly about the 
opposition, analysts said it appeared to represent provincial 
displeasure at having to reign in finances. 
  The final vote was 2,110 for, 337 against, and 225 
abstentions. Forty-nine deputies failed to press the buttons 
which tally results electronically. 
  The budget law will enable central and local governments to 
raise funds through domestic and foreign loans, but in doing so 
some economically more backward areas will be at a disadvantage. 
As a result of yesterday's voting, Xiamen, one of the country's 
five special economic zones, has been empowered to enact its own 
laws and regulations, giving the southeastern coastal city the 
same legislative powers enjoyed by provincial people's 
congresses. 
  The law is aimed at facilitating the economic opening up of 
Xiamen. While 2,307 delegates voted for it, 251 representing 
nearly 10 per cent of the total voted against, 144 abstained and 
19 did not vote. Premier Li Peng's government Work Report, 
which called for a growth rate of nine per cent this year and an 
inflation rate of no more than 10 per cent, was overwhelmingly 
approved with 2,655 for, 23 against, 25 abstentions and 18 
people failing to vote. 
  The Budget, which sees a record deficit of almost 67 billion 
yuan (HK$59.49 billion) [Hong Kong dollars], was passed with 
2,403 in favour, 178 against and 129 abstentions. "There's an 
imbalance of development, so the current Budget may be 
beneficial to the eastern area and the western area will be 
affected adversely," said Liu Ronghui, a deputy from Shaanxi 
province, explaining why there were some negative votes. 
  The Plan for Economic and Social Development which calls for 
a cooling down of investment, was approved by 2,584 deputies. 
  Opposition to the Supreme Court and Supreme Procuratorate 
reports was significant, with total votes against and 
abstentions being 335 and 464 respectively. "Some people may 
have some opinions about the state of social security," Mr Liu 
said.

<F P=106> [Report on interviews with NPC deputies and CPPCC members by </F>
correspondents Wen Baowei and Ma Lin in Beijing; date not given 
-- from the "Special Program on NPC-CPPCC Sessions"] 
  [Text] Listeners, New China has made brilliant 
achievements in education since its establishment more than 40 
years ago. Particularly in the last 15 years since China's 
reform and opening up, as educational reform unfolds gradually, 
all types of educational undertakings at different levels have 
developed rapidly. Primary education has become virtually 
universal in over 90 percent of the country's populated areas. 
Today, nine-year compulsory education is being implemented step 
by step in a well-planned way. 
  China's vocational education has also developed rapidly in 
the past few years. Total enrollment in vocational schools at 
the senior middle school level has exceeded that at regular 
senior middle schools. The unitary nature of China's secondary 
educational structure has also undergone major changes. 
  China's higher education has also developed at an 
accelerated 
pace. According to statistics, the number of post-graduate 
students reached 110,000 last year. The number of regular and 
special program students at regular colleges totaled more than 
2.5 million, while the number of regular and special program 
students at adult schools of higher learning reached 1.9 
million. Both numbers were the highest in history. A 
comprehensive higher education system incorporating essentially 
all kinds of disciplines at different levels has basically taken 
shape. 
  China's legislative work has also made heartening progress. 
It has promulgated, one after another, a law of compulsory 
education, a law on teaching, and many other laws. In addition, 
it has also promulgated regulations and decrees related to 
policy implementation. Thus, China has gradually entered the 
path of managing education according to the law. 
  China's education has truly brought forth noticeable 
achievements. However, it should also be recognized that China, 
a fairly poor and large country, faces numerous problems and 
difficulties on its way to making its education successful. The 
tasks are also enormous. 
  Despite the many problems facing China's education, there is 
still a way to make it successful. Exactly as Premier Li Peng 
said in his report on government work, we must acquire a 
long-term perspective and a sense of urgency toward education 
and give strategic consideration to developing education on a 
priority basis. We must recognize the importance of education 
from the perspective of modernizing our country. Particularly, 
we must promote education in a concrete way. 
  During the National People's Congress [NPC] and Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] sessions, 
deputies and CPPCC members gave their very useful views and made 
good suggestions on reforming and developing China's education. 
In an interview with station reporter Wen Baowei, Zhang 
Tianbao, CPPCC member and vice minister of the State Education 
Commission, talked about major problems in China's education 
today. 
  [Begin recording] [Zhang] I think one of the problems is 
that the pace of reform on China's education front cannot keep 
up with the general situation of China's reform to establish a 
socialist market economy. This is a fairly serious problem. 
The second problem concerns practical issues. There are three 
major issues here. One is the lack of investment in education. 
This is a fairly difficult problem to tackle. We hope to 
resolve it gradually. Teachers' pay and benefits will improve 
considerably in the wake of ongoing wage reform. However, their 
pay and benefits, especially the pay and benefits of primary and 
middle school teachers, cannot be expected to reach the 
standards set in the Teachers' Law before our economy develops. 
The third issue concerns teachers' housing, mainly urban 
teachers' housing. The situation of teachers' housing in rural 
areas is a little bit better. They do not need much investment 
from the state, as they have their own houses. In urban areas, 
although there has been great improvement in recent years, 
teachers' housing is still a major problem. 
  [Wen] Specifically, what important tasks does the State 
Education Commission plan to accomplish in 1994? 
  [Zhang] The State Education Commission's central task is to 
further implement China's Education Reform and Development 
Program and the Teachers' Law. It will focus on achieving two 
goals for all types of education at all levels: basically making 
nine-year compulsory education universal and basically 
eradicating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. 
These two goals will be at the heart of our work. As far as 
reform is concerned, the focus is on the structural reform of 
our higher education, including reform of the management 
structure, the enrollment system, the employment system for 
college graduates, the ideology for education, the contents of 
teaching, and the establishment of special fields of study. The 
main emphasis of our reform is to make education serve the needs 
of society under the conditions of a socialist market economy. 
[end recording] 
  [Wen] (Chen Yiliang), NPC deputy and assistant principal of 
the Fuzhou First Middle School, said: 
  [Begin recording] [(Chen)] The Teachers' Law was promulgated 
last year, and took effect on 1 January 1994. The broad masses 
of teachers place great hopes on the implementation of the law. 
The Fujian delegation was the first to bring forward a motion 
on a law for teaching. I was the one who made the motion at 
that time. Everyone hopes that the Teachers' Law can be truly 
implemented, that more discussions will be held on education 
during the current NPC session, and that the present government 
will be able to adopt some practical and effective measures, to 
speed up the pace of educational reform, to conscientiously 
increase input into education, to give full play to the role of 
teachers, to improve pay and work conditions for teachers, and 
to bring about a good social climate of showing respect for 
teachers and attaching importance to education. This is also a 
focal point of current problems existing in our education. [end 
recording] 
  [Wen] As a socialist market economy develops in depth, China 
badly needs a large number of laborers to be engaged in 
operation and services in the forefront of production, in 
addition to various professional technicians. All these 
personnel should undergo strict vocational training to meet the 
qualifications of different trades and professions. What is the 
present situation of vocational education in China? Station 
correspondent (Zhang Xiangyuan) interviewed Comrade Wang Mingda, 
member of the CPPCC National Committee and vice minister of the 
State Education Commission on the issue. He said: 
  [Begin recording] [Wang] After China implemented reform and 
opened its doors to the outside world, a very important aspect 
of China's educational reform was to reform secondary school 
education and to vigorously develop vocational and technical 
education. In 1980, the number of students enrolled by 
vocational senior middle schools accounted for only 11.49 
percent of the total number of students enrolled by all senior 
middle schools; the ratio reached 57.95 percent in 1993. Thus, 
we have fulfilled the ratio of 1:1 between the number of 
students enrolled by vocational senior middle schools and the 
number of students enrolled by ordinary senior middle schools 
proposed by the CPC Central Committee in its resolution on 
reform of the education system adopted in 1985. [end recording] 
  [Ma Lin] In fact, China conducted vocational education as 
early as 1917. Vocational education was conducted at the 
Zhonghua Jiaoyu She [China Vocational Education Society], 
initiated by such famous educators as Cai Yuanpei and Liang 
Qichao. In view of the fact that education was seriously 
divorced from social life at that time, they said one of the 
purposes of running the society was to provide job opportunities 
for the unemployed and to make the employed work in contentment. 
Today, the Zhonghua Jiaoyu She has expanded to a nationwide 
organization for vocational education. It has set up 50 schools 
offering vocational education. Among them are three vocational 
universities that boast more than 30,000 undergraduates in all. 
  [Wen] Member Wang Mingda said the objective of China's 
development of vocational education at secondary schools is to 
make the number of students attending vocational schools account 
for approximately 60 percent of the total number of secondary 
school undergraduates by the end of the century. 
  [Begin recording] [Wang] To achieve the objective, we must 
further increase the number of students and, above all, improve 
the quality of vocational education. [end recording] 
  [Ma Lin] At last, Member Wang Mingda said: The 
comparatively conspicuous problems existing in current 
vocational education include finding the means to enhance the 
level of teaching and management, a shortage of funds, and a 
need to build more vocational education centers. It is 
necessary to bring vocational and technical education into line 
with a legal system through legislation. A law on vocational 
and technical education has been incorporated into the NPC 
Standing Committee's plan for legislation in the next five years. 
  [Wen] Qu Qinyue, NPC deputy, president of the Nanjing 
University, and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
expressed his views on the guiding ideology for running a school 
at colleges and universities in the course of reform and opening 
up. He said: 
  [Begin recording] [Qu] I think it is necessary for 
universities to grasp two links at the same time. They must 
attach equal importance to enhancing academic levels and, at the 
same time, making concrete and important contributions to 
national economic construction and social development. These 
two links apply to the guiding ideology for running a school. 
Now, I think, it seems that two tendencies exist in 
universities in the course of reform. One tendency attaches 
more importance to the academic level of universities to the 
neglect of making very good contributions to the nation's 
economic and social development. In particular, the 
universities have run their schools in a way that closes their 
doors, instead of opening their doors, to the public amid the 
implementation of reform in the past few years. Therefore, they 
took into consideration their academic level only and did not 
take into consideration social needs. After the implementation 
of reform, due to difficulties related to policies, confusion 
over education policy recently encouraged universities to move 
to the other side of the two links of running a school, namely, 
divorcing themselves from society. They attached undue 
importance to maintaining [words indistinct] to the neglect of 
enhancing the level of a university, which is the most important 
task. [end recording] 
  [Ma Lin] Listeners and friends, accelerating the development 
of education in regions inhabited by minority nationalities has 
a direct bearing on the regions' economic development. 
Therefore, it is an even more urgent task. When (Qiang Erba 
Douji Ouzhou), member of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and 
vice chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Education 
Commission, spoke of the relationship between economic 
development and education, he said: 
  [Begin recording, (Qiang), in Tibetan fading into Ma Lin 
translation into Mandarin] Tibet is economically backward. 
Believing that development is sufficient as long as enough food 
is provided for the people, Tibet set the economy against 
education for a certain period of time in the past. The focus 
of our work shifted to the central task of economic construction 
after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee. We must promote the development of science and 
technology before we can promote economic development. 
Education is the foundation. While endeavoring to promote 
economic development, we incorporated education into our plan. 
Tibet has enjoyed a very rapid development of education in 
recent years. Last year, the autonomous regional party 
committee and the autonomous regional government specially held 
the fourth education work conference, and drew up a magnificent 
plan. It aims at increasing the percentage of children of 
school age attending schools from the current 63 percent to over 
80 percent by the year 2000. In addition, the work conference 
also mapped out two plans. They required that every county have 
a middle school and every township a primary school run by 
herdsmen. According to the plans, Tibet only has to base itself 
on areas inside its territory in its efforts to educate trained 
personnel; meanwhile, continued efforts will be made to 
successfully run classes in the hinterland for children of 
Tibetan nationality. At present, there are 11,000 plus Tibetan 
students studying in the hinterland. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Wang </F>
Haizheng (3769 3189 1767)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] ended in Beijing 
today. 
  During the 13-day session, deputies from various parts of 
the 
country spoke freely in discussing state affairs, they offered 
advice and made suggestions on reform, and they exercised their 
sacred rights. When the deputies left the Great Hall of the 
People, what were they thinking about? These reporters 
interviewed more than 10 deputies at the hall's eastern exit. 
<H3>  "Realism Is the Biggest Characteristic of This Session; We 
Will Take the Realistic Spirit to Our Work" </H3>
  Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju told these reporters: This NPC 
session was a success, and deputies fully expressed their views 
while discussing state affairs. Their abilities in 
participating in and discussing government affairs were greatly 
improved. I feel the biggest characteristic of this session was 
realism. When we return to our posts, we will take this 
realistic spirit to our work. Shanghai is small in area. We 
must take a conscientious and realistic approach and try in 
every possible way to improve our efficiency. Pudong should 
complete its basic development tasks two years ahead of schedule 
and then continue to accelerate its development in a 
down-to-earth manner. We should build more new- and 
high-technology projects in Pudong. 
  What will Guangdong, as the country's comprehensive 
experimental area in reform and opening up, do next? Deputy Zhu 
Senlin, governor of Guangdong Province, said: We are fully 
confident of the future. At the same time, we also clearly see 
contradictions and problems ahead, and we should keep a clear 
head and foster a sense of being prepared for hardships. Upon 
return to Guangdong, we will carefully organize people to 
implement reform measures on the one hand and vigorously arouse 
and encourage the masses to undertake construction with one 
heart and one mind on the other. We will work hard in a 
down-to-earth way and strive to basically build the framework of 
the socialist market economic structure in five years. 
<H3>  "Opportunity Shows No Favoritism to Anyone, and the Key Is 
To Seize It" </H3>
  Liaoning Governor Yue Qifeng said: Liaoning is the oldest 
industrial base built by the state during the planned economy 
period, and it is also the last to get off the orbit of planned 
economy. Reforms are being carried out across the country in an 
all-round way this year, and market forces are playing an 
increasingly important role. This has created a golden 
opportunity for Liaoning. Liaoning people should firmly seize 
this opportunity and vigorously start undertakings. We should 
adapt ourselves as soon as possible to the needs of the 
socialist market economy in concept, management, and operation. 
While reforming or transforming large and medium state-owned 
enterprises, we should accelerate the development of new- and 
high-technology industries; village and town enterprises; 
individual and private enterprises; neighborhood collective 
enterprises; tertiary industries; and high-yield, high- 
efficiency, and high-quality agriculture and strive to 
revitalize Liaoning as an industrial base. 
  Qinghai Governor Tian Chengping from the vast northwest of 
the country said: This NPC session paid close attention to 
economic development in the central west of the country. This 
year, the state will implement a plan for helping people free 
themselves from poverty. Society is concerned about and 
supports our less developed areas. More importantly, the market 
economy has provided us with favorable conditions for 
"exploiting our natural resources, freeing ourselves from 
poverty, and becoming prosperous." It can be said that we in 
the central west of the country have even a greater opportunity 
for development. The key to seizing this opportunity lies in 
our acting according to reality, deepening reform, and working 
hard to start enterprises, in addition to assistance from the 
state. 
<H3>  "Good Policies and Measures Should Be Implemented to the 
Letter" </H3>
  Deputy Li Yuxiang, of the Yi nationality from Sichuan, said: 
Before liberation, I begged for food when I was seven years old. 
I have been excited by attending the NPC session in Beijing as 
a deputy. Both the general secretary and premier stressed 
agriculture. This is very good for us farmers. I hope that the 
state will substantially increase investment in agriculture. 
After I return to Sichuan, I will mobilize people to carry out 
capital construction on farmland. Our village will build three 
ponds to store water this year. Meanwhile, we will plant trees 
in a big way for the purpose of water and soil conservation. As 
a NPC deputy, I must accomplish something. 
  Deputy Feng Jie, Zhangjiapu village committee director of 
Wangjiadian Township in Huangzhou city, Hubei Province, said: I 
felt warmed while attending the 13-day NPC session. The central 
authorities said every possible effort would be made to increase 
farmers' incomes this year, which really warmed our hearts. The 
price scissors between industrial and agricultural products have 
become bigger and bigger these years. If this goes on, who 
still wants to do farming. Then, how can rice sacks be filled? 
This time, the state decided to readjust the prices of grain, 
chemical fertilizers, diesel oil for agricultural use, and 
pesticides, which is good news to us. I just hope that the 
government will implement its agricultural policy to the letter.

  [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- The party and the 
government are always concerned about the economic and social 
development in the ethnic minority regions in our country. 
During the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC], the comrades in charge of various ministries and 
commissions under the State Council have successively held 
discussions with deputies from Tibet, Xinjiang, the Inner 
Mongolia, Guangxi and Ningxia Autonomous Regions; seriously 
listened to their comments and suggestions; and discussed with 
them how to accelerate development in the ethnic minority 
regions. 
  Several State Council officials have separately visited the 
Tibet delegation and sought the deputies' opinions. They 
included Chi Haotian, state councillor and minister of national 
defense; Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation; Liu Bin, vice minister of the State Education 
Commission; and Song Defu, minister of personnel. During the 
discussion, Chi Haotian briefed the deputies on the situation of 
unity among nationalities, the army- people unity, and efforts 
to strengthen border defense, and discussed other questions 
which are of interest to the deputies. Wu Yi pledged to support 
Tibet's foreign trade and economic cooperation and to help Tibet 
overcome difficulties in work. Liu Bin and Song Defu answered 
the deputies' questions regarding compulsory education, 
educational institutions, and teachers' wages, and put forward 
solutions to some problems. The deputies said: The visits to 
the Tibet delegation by the department heads of the State 
Council show the attention and support given by the Party 
Central Committee and the State Council to the work of Tibet. 
The departments concerned under the State Council have been 
very considerate of Tibet in many things. For instance, Tibet 
recently submitted to the State Education Commission an 
educational plan which overlooked vocational education 
expenditures, the State Education Commission on its own 
initiative added the vocational education funding in its 
educational appropriation. 
  Those who successively visited the Xinjiang delegation 
included Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister of the State 
Nationalities Affairs Commission; Han Zhubin, minister of 
railways; and Xiang Huaicheng, vice minister of finance. The 
deputies of various nationalities fully affirmed the 
achievements made by the railroads in recent years in transport 
and railroad construction and put forward suggestions on 
acceleration of railroad construction and the promotion of 
economic development in Xinjiang. Han Zhubin pledged to support 
Xinjiang's economic development by accelerating railroad 
construction there, and particularly by ensuring the transport 
of cotton, chemical fertilizer, and other capital goods. 
  Yang Changji, executive vice minister of the State Economic 
and Trade Commission, and others have visited the Inner Mongolia 
delegation to seek the deputies' opinions. They answered the 
deputies' questions regarding the change of operational 
mechanisms at large and medium state-owned enterprises, debt 
chains, and reform of the foreign trade system. Three deputies 
from the Inner Mongolia delegation who asked some questions in 
their letters to Minister of Personnel Song Defu will receive 
detailed answers from him soon. The comrades in charge of the 
Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
answered Inner Mongolian deputies' questions on public order, 
anticorruption measures, and the strengthening of the public 
security and judicial forces. 
  The comrades in charge of the State Planning Committee, the 
Ministry of Finance, the State Education Commission, the 
People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Public Security, the 
Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
attended the small group discussions of the Guangxi delegation. 
They listened to the deputies' views and suggestions on the 
education, finance, taxation, and comprehensive efforts to 
improve public order in ethnic minority regions. 
  When Ningxia deputies were examining and discussing the 
government work report and the reports on national plans and 
finance, they were joined successively by Minister of Justice 
Xiao Yang, Vice Minister of the State Nationalities Affairs 
Commission Tudao Doje, and Vice Minister of the State Planning 
Commission Luo Zhiling. The deputies pointed out that since 
1982 great achievements have been made in the special 
help-the-poor project in Gansu's Dingxi, Hexi corrider, and 
Ningxia's Xihaigu region. In Ningxia's Guyuan Prefecture, the 
basic needs of 80 percent of the population in food and clothing 
have been met. However, 240,000 people there remain in poverty 
and difficulty. The deputies suggested that the state improve 
infrastructure, such as transport and energy sources, and solve 
the people's food and clothing problems in a planned way in 
ethnic minority regions, and that state organs provide support 
relevant to their functions to poor regions. Xiao Yang, Tudao 
Doje, and Luo Zhiling pledged to convey the deputies' views to 
the relevant State Council departments, carry out the 
help-the-poor plan effectively, and help narrow the gap between 
the ethnic minority regions in western China and the country's 
eastern part.

  [Text] Yesterday [15 March] State Councillor Chen Junsheng 
held discussion meeting with the Guizhou delegation to the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] on 
the subject of supporting the impoverished. 
  Guizhou Governor Chen Sineng briefed him on the conditions 
and realities in supporting the impoverished in Guizhou. Deputy 
Wang Kunsheng spoke on Qianxinan Prefecture's work to support 
the impoverished. Meng Sufen, vice chairwoman of the seventh 
provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, also attended the meeting and gave a 
briefing on the impoverished conditions of the Mashan area, the 
most impoverished mountainous area in Guizhou. 
  After listening carefully to the briefings, Chen Junsheng 
said: The state all along has regarded Guizhou as a key in the 
work to support the impoverished, and it will remain so. 
Guizhou has made great progress in supporting the impoverished 
over the past few years. If soil improvement were to be pursued 
on half a million mu each year, great changes certainly would 
take place. Chen Junsheng said: There are still 129 townships 
isolated from the province's highway network, and this issue 
must be resolved as quickly as possible. It is hoped that 
Guizhou will exert efforts, from the top to to grass roots, to 
become well-off as early as possible. 
  Yang Zhong, deputy head of the leading group and director of 
the Office for the Economic Development of Impoverished Areas, 
also attended the meeting.

  [Text] At this afternoon's panel discussion of the 
Guangdong delegation to the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC], Xie Fei -- NPC deputy, CPC 
Central Committee member, and Guangdong party committee 
secretary -- stated that in his government report, Premier Li 
Peng said that the necessity to seize the opportunity, deepen 
reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain 
stability [zhua zhu ji yu shen hua gai ge kuo da kai fang wei 
chi wen ding] is the overall situation in the work of the entire 
party and country, and that we should show concern for and 
subject ourselves to this overall situation, and embody it in 
our work. Focusing on Guangdong's actual conditions, Xie Fei 
set out four principles for Guangdong's work from now on. First, 
it is necessary to seize the opportunity and deepen reform. 
Regarding the series of reforms set out by the central 
authorities this year in such domains as finance, taxation, 
banking, foreign trade, and enterprises, we must work hard to do 
a good job in their implementation, and must build the socialist 
market economy mechanism step by step. Second, it is necessary 
to seize the chance to expand opening up and to promote reform 
with opening up and development, while relying on Guangdong's 
advantages to raise the level and expand the scope of opening 
up. Third, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to develop 
the economy, exert efforts to develop new hi-technology 
industry, and three-high agriculture, and also to improve the 
managerial level and economic returns. It is particularly 
imperative to maintain agricultural stability and development, 
and to place it in a conspicuous and important position. 
Fourth, it is necessary to augment unity, and to maintain 
stability and sobriety, while promptly eradicating factors of 
instability so as to ensure the smooth progress of reform, 
opening up, and economic development.

  [Text] The Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] was solemnly inaugurated in Beijing's Great Hall 
of the People yesterday morning [10 March], becoming the focus 
of world attention. 
  At its Beijing residence yesterday afternoon, the Fujian NPC 
delegation held a conscientious discussion of Premier Li Peng's 
government work report. It was chaired by Fujian NPC delegation 
leader Yuan Qitong. The Fujian deputies to the NPC session 
spoke one after another in the discussion. 
  Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial party committee and 
governor, delivered a key-note speech in which he stated: The 
key to implementing the central principles by taking into 
account and showing concern for overall national interests lies 
in cultivating a new train of thought; learning and mastering 
dialectics; as well as emancipating our minds and seeking truth 
from facts in a down-to-earth manner. Reform, development, and 
stability -- Jia noted -- are interrelated with and are 
complementary to each other. In seeking development, we should 
take actual local conditions into consideration. In furthering 
reform, we should make every possible effort to solve various 
contradictions. In addition, we should firmly grasp the two 
aspects -- reform and stability -- simulteneously. 
  Jia Qinglin further expounded on this issue in light of the 
realities in Fujian, saying: Since last year, Fujian has 
enjoyed sound and rapid national economic growth, but also has 
undertaken more arduous reform tasks. In his government work 
report, Premier Li Peng emphatically called for rapidly building 
a socialist market economy structure, this being an issue of 
great significance to deepening reform, promoting development, 
and maintaining stability. In the years to come, we should 
always place reform high on the agenda and resolutely adhere to 
the following train of thought in the course of reform: 
Orienting production to market demands; conducting 
comprehensive reform experiments in a down-to-earth manner; 
learning and mastering international practices; integrating the 
domestic and international markets; and making the domestic and 
international markets complement each other. 
  Jia Qinglin stressed: By grasping opportunities, we mean 
grasping opportunities for reform. By promoting development, we 
mean making reform promote development. By maintaining 
stability, we mean seizing appropriate opportunities for reform 
and deepening reform in an appropriate way. Practice already 
has borne out that deepening reform and building a socialist 
market economy structure are the the only way out for Fujian. 
It is both necessary and possible for Fujian to move ahead 
earlier than others with respect to building a new socialist 
market economy structure. This year, we are going to embark on 
a series of pioneeringly deep-going reforms on an 
unprecedentedly large scale. Thus leaders at all levels across 
the province should make redoubled efforts to deepen reform, 
promote development, maintain social stability, and rapidly 
build a socialist market economy structure. 
  Huang Changxi, vice chairman of the NPC's Overseas Chinese 
Affairs Committee and vice chairman of the Fujian Provincial 
People's Congress Standing Committee; Xiamen Deputy Mayor Hong 
Yongshi; Fujian Mayor Jin Nengchou; Xiamen University Professor 
Wang Qiaoru; and others; also spoke one after the other during 
the discussion.

  [Text] At noon yesterday [11 March] in Beijing's Fujian 
Provincial Guild, provincial leading members -- including Jia 
Qinglin, You Dexin, He Shaochuan, Yuan Qitong, Huang Changxi,

<F P=106> ["Note" by station reporter Cui Tong: "Do Away With </F>
Spritual Garbage;" from the "Special Program on the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress and the Eighth 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference"] 
  [Text] Ruan Chongwu, National People's Congress [NPC] 
deputy, secretary of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee, and 
governor of Hainan, was recently interviewed by a reporter from 
Taiwan. 
  The reporter asked: Hainan is considered to be a special 
area with special power to carry out special projects. Hainan 
also enjoys greater autonomy than other provinces and regions. 
Does it mean that, in the foreseeable future, certain expensive 
sightseeing projects -- such as horse racing and dog racing 
--will be permitted in Hainan? 
  Ruan Chongwu replied: While we encourage the development of 
all kinds of recreational activities in Hainan, we firmly forbid 
three kinds: gambling, prostitution, and drugs. 
  We can say that this reply is exactly what the ordinary 
people wanted to say. People in some places have written to 
[Haikou's] mayor that they want economic growth, not spiritual 
garbage. 
  Regrettably, not all leaders see it the same way. Have we 
not heard the argument that when material civilization has 
developed, spiritual civilization will naturally follow suit? 
Some people even say that gambling, prostitution, and the like 
are no big deal; and that these ideas can bring in foreign 
capital. 
  Facts prove that this is an erroneous idea. The development 
of material civilization will indeed help the development of 
spiritual civilization because people who are well clothed and 
fed tend to pay attention to their honor. But there is also the 
observation that people who are well fed and clothed will tend 
to be obsessed with carnal pleasure. If we fail to intensify 
our efforts in building our spiritual civilization, our failure 
will certainly affect the development of material civilization. 
As far as attracting foreign capital is concerned, we should do 
so by counting on our huge markets and good services. We should 
always remember that we cannot afford to discard the traditional 
culture and ethical sense of the Chinese nation, and we cannot 
afford to let in the spiritual garbage of the Western society.

  [Text] At 1800 on 10 March, Acting Governor Zhang Wule, 
deputy head of Gansu delegation to the Second Session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress, agreed to be interviewed at 
Beijing's Guoyi Guest House by reporters from REUTER and Hong 
Kong's SING TAO WAN PAO. Dealing with the effects on Gansu of 
the implementation of the tax-sharing system, Zhang Wule 
believed that there are both advantages and disadvantages in 
implementing the tax-sharing system stipulated by the central 
authorities. There are, however, more advantages than 
disadvantages. On the issue of the widening gap between eastern 
and western China, Zhang Wule said that it is an existing fact; 
however, through reform and opening up and by giving play to our 
own advantages, we gradually may narrow the gap between 
ourselves and the economically developed areas. Gansu is full 
of confidence on that point. When Zhang Wule talked about the 
relationships among reform, development, and stability, he said 
that Gansu presently enjoys sound momentum in economic 
development, nationality solidarity, political stability, social 
progress, and reform and opening up, and that the situation is 
favorable to the province.

Li Shanyuan (2621 0810 6678): "Develop Minority Areas' Economy 
by Applying the Law of Market Economy -- Interview With Wang 
Qun, secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party 
Committee"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region is a beautiful, rich, and sprawling region 
straddling northeast, north, and northwest China; and a region 
sharing a border with Russia and the People's Republic of 
Mongolia. 
  Since the adoption of the reform and opening up policy, 
Inner 
Mongolia has achieved rapid economic and social progress, and 
the living standards of its people of various nationalities have 
improved substantially. Owing to historical, geographical, and 
social factors, however, the region remains quite underdeveloped 
when compared with developed areas. While Premier Li Peng says 
in his government work report that "it takes time before such a 
situation can be changed once and for all," what Wang Qun, 
secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party 
Committee, is thinking about is how to shorten the time as much 
as possible. 
  Wang Qun said: To speed up the development under market 
economic conditions, we must have new ideas and merge Inner 
Mongolia's economic development and the central government's 
macroeconomic regulation and control and strategy. We also must 
establish our footing in relying on our own efforts, bring our 
local resources into play, and work hard according to the law of 
market economy. By doing this we can keep our own initiative 
and achieve a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development. Under the new situation, we will miss the good 
opportunities if we wait and hesitate. 
  Wang Qun said: To develop our economy under the new 
situation, our remote minority region must reassess its 
strengths and weaknesses. Inner Mongolia is a big place with 
rich natural resources. We have an area that is one-eighth of 
the national total, but we have only 22 million people. Our 
potential for developing farming, animal husbandry, village and 
town enterprises, energy and raw material industries is great 
and our market is huge. Now the state has brought the policy of 
supporting and promoting minority areas' economic development 
into its macroeconomic regulation and control and will give 
minority areas even greater support in terms of investment and 
preferential measures, we should say that this has provided 
Inner Mongolia with a historical opportunity for development. 
  Feeling a little excited at this time, Wang Qun continued: 
"Facing such an opporrunity, the vast number of cadres and 
people in Inner Mongolia must do away with their outmoded 
concepts that took shape under the planned economic system that 
had gone on for a long time; heighten their awareness about 
information, the market, opening up, economic returns, 
competition, and the law; and understand and master objective 
laws about the market economy, such as laws governing value, 
supply and demand, and competition." 
  Commenting on cooperation between Inner Mongolia and 
neighboring regions and developed areas, Wang Qun said that the 
economic development in Inner Mongolia and those areas can be 
complementary. He said: Inner Mongolia can at least become a 
base producing meat and nonstaple foodstuffs for northeast and 
north China. Grain is a special commodity, and Inner Mongolia 
can provide them with large quantities of wheat, corn, soybean, 
and other miscellaneous cereal crops of good quality. Because 
Inner Mongolia has plenty of raw materials and fuel resources, 
we can serve as a powerful base for material and fuel supply for 
coastal areas in east China and other economically developed 
areas enjoying fast industrial growth. Generally speaking, 
people in Inner Mongolia are not very well trained; but we can 
use the vast personnel markets. We can send people to study and 
receive training in the South, and we can also hire people in 
the South to give full scope to their abilities in Inner 
Mongolia. 
  Wang Qun said: Opening up to the outside world is another 
important respect. The region's total imports and exports in 
1993 topped that of the previous year by 28 percent, reaching 
$1.2 billion. The region also made substantial headway in 1993 
with regard to utilizing foreign capital, investing in areas 
outside the region, contracting foreign construction projects, 
and exporting labor services. Inner Mongolia shares a 
4,200-kilometer long border with Russia and the People's 
Republic of Mongolia, and its 18 border towns are playing an 
increasingly important role. Many leagues, banners, and 
counties are actively bringing in the foreign capital they need 
for upgrading the technology of their enterprises so their goods 
can become more competitive in the world market. The world 
markets for the region's agricultural and livestock products, 
construction materials, alkaline-based chemical goods, and coal 
are broadening. 
  Wang Qun concluded: While Inner Mongolia will establish the 
footing of its economic development in the domestic market, we 
will also explore the world market so that these two markets can 
promote one another. Only by doing this can we train a large 
number of capable personnel; set up a great number of 
competitive enterprises; improve the efficiency, quality, and 
exchange-earning capability of our farming and animal husbandry. 
By then, the economic development of our remote, minority 
region will have a greater vitality and will have reached a 
higher level.

  [Text] In an interview with this reporter, Gyaincain 
Norbu, NPC Deputy and chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous 
Regional People's Government, pointed out: The key to 
accomplishing this year's goals lies with keeping in view the 
overall interests and handling well relations between reform, 
development, and stability. While we are deepening reform, 
opening wider to the outside world, and promoting development, 
we should also pay attention to maintaining a stable social, 
economic, and political environment. We should make efforts to 
advance reform and development in a stable environment. We 
should realize a stabilized society in the long term through 
reform and development, thereby maintaining strong momentum in 
Tibet's reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  Reviewing Tibet's achievements in economic development last 
year, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: We must integrate the CPC 
Central Committee's policy decisions with Tibet's actual 
situation, correctly recognize and handle the relationship 
between long-term and immediate interests, extensively mobilize 
and organize the masses of people to contribute to reform, and 
carefully make plans for launching and carrying out various 
reform measures. At the same time, we must pay close attention 
to agricultural and animal husbandry production to strive for 
another harvest in this year. We must focus on processing 
industry, foreign trade, tourism, and village and town 
enterprises; continue to do a good job in the construction of 
infrastructure in transportation, energy, communications fields; 
and vigorously improve the investment environment. As long as 
we follow the CPC Central Committee's plans and work in a 
down-to-earth manner, we will be able to close the gap between 
Tibet and other better-developed regions and create a brand new 
image for ourselves that will impress the entire nation.

<F P=106> ["News analysis" by Robert J. Saiget: "Emphasis on Stability </F>
Suggests Slower Pace of Reform"] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 22 KYODO -- The National People's 
Congress (NPC) ended a two-week session Tuesday [22 March] with 
the Communist Party leadership calling for the thorough 
implementation of its central policies while noting the 
importance of maintaining social stability. 
  This year's session, which many political analysts see as 
one 
of the most lackluster in recent memory, gave its routine 
approval to Premier Li Peng's work report which heralded the 
market-economic reforms adopted by a high-level party plenum 
last November. 
  However the NPC's call for "the correct handling of the 
relationship between reform, development and stability" has 
apparently become the motto for what is likely to be a 
painstakingly slow reform process, analysts said. 
  Zhou Zhengqing, a vice governor of the People's Bank of 
China, China's central bank, at a NPC-sponsored press conference 
last week gave an advance hint of this by saying banking reform 
would proceed in tandem with enterprise modernization and that 
these reforms would not occur "overnight." 
  Despite the much-talked-about plan to divide policy and 
commercial functions in the five specialized banks, Dai 
Xianglong, also a vice governor of the central bank, said that 
loans to the loss-making state enterprise sector, a major area 
of policy concern, would make up 85 percent of national bank 
loans in 1994. 
  Such a high percentage of policy loans would make it 
difficult for the banks to divide and establish commercial 
policies, "capable of being responsible for their own risks," 
analysts say. 
  According to Chinese news reports in 1993, the loss-making 
state sector received up to 75 percent of all bank loans and 
fixed-asset investment while accounting for only 42 percent of 
the country's gross industrial value. 
  Yang Qixian, a member of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which ended its two-week annual 
session Sunday, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he felt it would take at 
least until the year 2000 before state-run enterprises could be 
called truly modernized. 
  According to Yang, vice president of the research institute 
on China's market economy, total assets of China's state 
enterprises amount to nearly 3 trillion yuan (about 350 billion 
dollars), while they owe banks nearly 2 trillion yuan, or up to 
70 percent of their value. 
  Dai refused to confirm the numbers, but a report by the 
State 
Economic and Trade Commission which surveyed state enterprises 
in 16 major cities found that such enterprises were in aggregate 
debt to the tune of 319.5 billion yuan, while their total assets 
only stood at 447.1 billion yuan. 
  Yang put some of the debt burden on social costs, saying 
that 
between 20 to 30 percent of the work force at state enterprises 
were redundant while up to 20 percent of the people on state 
enterprise payrolls were actually retired. 
  Fast-paced enterprise reform would lead to widespread 
layoffs, Yang said, so the reforms must go slowly and the 
enterprises must continue to depend on central bank loans if 
social stability is to be maintained. 
  Besides the state sector, the government also must worry 
about the over 800 million rural workers, restless for a better 
life and already descending on cities looking for jobs with 
better pay. 
  Yang said the government is depending on the service and 
private sectors of the economy to develop in such a way as to 
absorb excess labor from both the state and rural sectors of the 
economy. 
  He called on the further establishment of a share-holding 
system at state enterprises and the sale and bankruptcy of 
enterprises deemed incapable of surviving without government aid.

<F P=106> ["Commentary": "People Around the Country Unite Together and </F>
Work Hard To Accomplish Tasks in Reform and Development for 
1994"; from the "National Hookup" program] 
  [Text] Having fully examined and discussed the government 
work report and adopted a series of important resolutions, the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] 
closed in victory. The Second Session of the Eighth National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] had also successfully carried out its 
missions and closed earlier. The two annual sessions are an 
important matter in the political life of the Chinese people and 
important meetings for promoting economic development and social 
progress in China. This year's two sessions were convened under 
the favorable conditions of sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development and China's efforts to push forward the 
reform of economic structure. The two sessions held high the 
grand banner of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, upheld the party's basic 
line, conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress, and proposed 
valuable opinions and made important decisions on reform and 
development for 1994. 
  Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the 
overall situation in the work of the entire party and state. 
The sessions thoroughly discussed and spoke highly of this 
overall situation proposed by the central authorities. All 
localities, units, and sectors around the country should serve 
and be subject to this overall situation in their work. 
Economic construction is the center of all work. Reform and 
opening up are the driving forces for development; development 
and reform are the basis for social stability and the state's 
long-term peace and stability; stability is the prerequisite for 
developing the economy and promoting reform. As long as we 
correctly recognize and handle the relations between reform, 
development, and stability; notice new situations and resolve 
new problems in a timely manner; and coordinate reform, 
development, and stability and make them promote each other, our 
modernization drive will win a new victory. 
  Maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development is the aspiration of the people around the country, 
as well as a pressing need for the domestic and international 
situations. The sessions fully discussed, in dialectical terms, 
the relations among sustentation, rapidity, and healthiness in 
the course of economic development. It is necessary to deepen 
reform, open up wider, strengthen and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control, vigorously readjust economic structure, 
promote technical progress, actively develop markets, and 
control inflation in this year's economic work, and we should 
virtually change our concepts for improving economic efficiency 
and should by no means resume the course of blindly pursuing 
output value, speed, and the expansion of investment scale. 
This is an important factor determining whether there will be 
healthy economic development. We should correctly analyze and 
have a clear understanding of the situation -- not only the 
favorable conditions, but also the adverse factors -- and do our 
best to maintain a vigorous and stable growth rate in line with 
reality. 
  The wheel of reform is driving China's economy and various 
undertakings to a bright future, and people of all nationalities 
in China have deep feelings for reform. The Chinese people 
shall achieve two major objectives by the end of this century, 
one is to achieve the second-step strategic objective of 
socialist modernization and to achieve a comfortable living 
standard, the other is to preliminarily establish a socialist 
market economic structure. The attainment of these two 
objectives relies on reform. In promoting this year's reform, we 
must integrate the work of making significant breakthroughs with 
the work of promoting reform as a whole. The tasks are arduous 
and strenuous as we should not only push reform forward amid the 
speedy economic operation, but also maintain stability and 
development in the accelerating transformation of systems. To 
complete this year's reform missions, we should not only 
strengthen our confidence and adopt a scientific attitude, but 
also remain sober-minded and do a solid job. 
  The two sessions have closed. As the guidelines of the 
sessions are conveyed and implemented, China's basic principles, 
policies, and measures for this year's economic work and various 
undertakings shall strike root more deeply in the hearts of the 
people and the overall situtation characterized by reform, 
development, and stability shall become the common ground of 
hundreds of millions of people. The current situation is good 
and the opportunity is rare. Under the guidance of the CPC 
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, let 
people of all nationalities across the country unite together 
with one heart and one mind and follow the course charted by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line to complete 
this year's tasks in reform and development and win a new 
victory in socialist modernization drive!

<F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporters Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 </F>
2639) and Chi Maohua (3069 5399 5363): "More Reasonable, More 
Mature -- China's Economic Development As Seen From the Topics 
of Discussion During the `Two Sessions'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (XINHUA) -- The republic has 
achieved brilliant, unprecedented economic achievements after 15 
stormy years. China's economic development has made a new step 
forward from a new starting point. The whole world is closely 
watching how we head toward the 21st century. 
  Displaying a high sense of responsibility, the 5,000 or so 
deputies and members attending the "two sessions" -- the Second 
Session of the Eighth People's Congress [NPC] and the Second 
Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] -- have also been 
seriously pondering on this issue. 
<H6>  (1) </H6>
  The calls for "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening up wider to the outside world, expediting reform, and 
maintaining stability" and "properly handling the relations 
between reform, development, and stability" have become the most 
important topics discussed, analyzed, and studied by everybody 
during and after meetings. They maintain that China's economic 
development is undergoing a transitional period toward a stage 
of more reasonable development. 
  Many deputies say that, although China has achieved world- 
renowned economic successes and enjoyed the highest economic 
growth in the world over the past 15 years, reform takes a 
relatively long time and cannot be achieved overnight. They 
also realize the simple but profound truth that haste makes 
waste. This is the same warning served by the lessons the 
nation learned the hard way from its economic development after 
the republic was founded. Some deputies say: The 9 percent 
economic growth set for this year is still quite high in the 
world. The hindrance caused by basic industries has become more 
noticeable owing to the high growth in the past two years. 
Lowering the growth appropriately is sensible and totally in 
line with economic law. This shows that the Chinese Government 
has walked out from the odd cycle -- when control was imposed, 
the economy became lifeless; and when control was removed, the 
economy was in disorder -- and become even more mature in 
applying economic law. 
  The 1.1 billion Chinese people have learned from personal 
experiences that economic prosperity depends on reform and 
development. But just as Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: 
"Stability prevails over everything." The country needs 
political unity and stability because China needs a harmonious 
social environment with less controls for reform and 
development. Without stability, nothing can be accomplished. 
Some deputies say that in this crucial year for reform, 
readjustment of interests has to be made in certain economic 
sectors, and it will give rise to many new problems. To ensure 
success, priority must be given to ensuring a stable social 
environment. When we do our work, we must pay special attention 
to discovering problems and dealing with them promptly so as to 
make sure that reform and development can proceed smoothly. 
  China's economic development is also becoming healthier and 
more mature as can be seen from the fact that stability is now 
considered as a very important part of the requirement of 
overall importance set for the whole party and the country. 
  The deputies and the CPPCC National Committee members also 
note that, while stability is underscored, it does not mean that 
we have to be overcautious and ignore the rare opportunity for 
development. On the contrary, to achieve genuine social 
stability, we must promote stability through development and 
reform. This is because if the country lacks the strength, it 
cannot improve the people's living standards, the economy will 
be bleak, the market will wither, and there will not be genuine 
social stability. The nation can have long-term peace and 
stability only when it is economically prosperous.

  Market economy is an economy supported by a legal system. 
Well- conceived laws and regulations are important indicators 
of a country's economic maturity. 
  The deputies are pleased to talk about their legislative 
achievements: Since the convening of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the NPC and its standing 
committee have enacted nearly 200 laws. The deputies and 
members of the CPPCC National Committee are excited to know 
that, to keep pace with economic development, the nation's 
legislative departments will from now on give top priority to 
providing economic development with legal protection. 
  Some CPPCC National Committee members point out that, since 
the 14th national party congress, the guiding thought for 
China's legislation has changed from serving primarily the 
planned economy to accelerating the establishment of a market 
economic system; and from primarily summing up the successes of 
reform and opening up achieved in real life to setting the norms 
governing future economic conduct. The Eighth NPC promised one 
year ago that the construction of a legal structure framework 
for the socialist market economy will be basically completed 
within five years. 
  Now, one year later, people can already see the fruitful 
results. During the six meetings it has held, the Eighth NPC 
Standing Committee has deliberated on more than 40 draft laws, 
of which two- thirds are about market economy; and drafted and 
revised 21 other laws, of which 13 are about market economy. 
This is to say that the number of market economy-related laws 
examined and adopted by the standing committee of this term is 
proportionally larger than those of all previous standing 
committees. 
  The deputies and members maintain that the establishment and 
improvement of the socialist market economic system must be 
governed and protected by a sound legal system; and that 
improvement of the law is also essential for economic prosperity 
and development. They stress: China's reforms and legislation 
must be closely coordinated and the policies governing reforms 
and legislation must be integrated. Legislation must reflect 
the spirit of reform; and our laws must guide, promote, and 
safeguard the smooth progress of reform. 
  Without a doubt, China's legal system is still far from 
being 
able to meet the requirements of China's economic development. 
Some deputies and members say that there is yet to be a legal 
structure supporting the market economy, and certain badly 
needed economic laws are still defective. Fortunately, people 
have begun to confront the defects and insufficiencies and will 
deal with them step by step. This year the NPC Standing 
Committee will continue to give top priority to speeding up 
legislation, especially economic legislation. Making laws that 
serve reform, promote reform, set the norms for reform by 
utilizing the successful experiences gained from reform, 
readjusting the new relations between economic sectors, and 
preventing mistakes from being unnecessarily made during reform 
will continue to be the core of China's economic legislation. 
  Members of the CPPCC National Committee note that the high 
speed and quick rhythm of China's economic legislation are 
telling the people that China's economic development has started 
to proceed in an orderly and healthy manner and has entered a 
brand new area in which economic development has the support of 
laws. 
<H6>  (3) </H6>
  During the two sessions this year, NPC deputies and CPPCC 
National Committee members have commented emotionally on the 
need to "study effective measures and pay attention to actual 
results." They say that the whole party and society as a whole 
must energetically advocate the need to study effective measures 
and pay attention to actual results so that new progress can be 
made in building a socialist market economic system and in 
ensuring a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other 
central leading comrades have emphasized at almost all group 
discussions that people in the country must work with one heart 
and one mind, do solid work with genuine efforts, fight in 
unity, and make concerted efforts; and that we must strengthen 
our conviction, seize the opportunity, and bring about a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development. 
  NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members coming 
from various parts of the country say that people throughout the 
country should have the common understanding that "empty talk 
can hinder national development and a strong country can be 
built by doing hard, solid work." Some deputies say: The 
central authorities have now set the general policy, the key 
requirement now is that, when we implement this policy, we must 
resort to effective measures and pay attention to achieving 
actual results. Leading cadres at all levels must guide the 
masses to exert concerted efforts, take real and effective 
measures to carry out various projects, make sure that actual 
results are achieved, and work practically in rallying and 
leading the vast number of people to push forward all economic 
and other construction projects. 
  Many deputies and CPPCC National Committee members agree 
that 
being pragmatic is the distinctive characteristics of the two 
sessions this year. They say this characteristics can be 
observed from the length of the government work report, which is 
the shortest one in recent years; from the phrases and terms 
regularly used by deputies and members in their talks; and from 
their pledges that, after the two meetings are over, they will 
make practical efforts to carrying out their guidelines. This 
shows that NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are 
improving in participating in administration and discussion of 
state affairs, and that China is also improving in handling 
economic and other affairs. Some deputies and members add that 
China's maturing economic work can also be observed from this 
year's government work report which states that the Chinese 
Government will not evade problems but will confront them. 
  Some deputies say that, in the past several years, the hot 
topics of discussion used to be policies, reforms, and 
opportunities. Since the nation's economic reform was still at 
the exploratory stage, those words were quite "insubstantial." 
Now the framework of China's economic reform has basically 
taken shape and many reform measures have been introduced. This 
means that China's economic development is maturing, and that 
NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are also 
maturing and have become more "pragmatic." In a word, the 
Chinese people have become more pragmatic. 
  A pragmatic nation is a nation imbued with hopes. We believe 
that China's economic development will proceed steadily and 
become more mature, and China will head for the world and the 
21st century with ample confidence!

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Last year saw a 
record number of Chinese people making private trips abroad, 
according to the Ministry of Public Security. 
  Mao Fengping, a ministry official, said here today that 
there 
were more than 1.52 million journeys to 189 countries and 
regions. Most voyagers were from China's coastal areas. Some 
may have made more than one visit abroad. 
  He said the number of people who applied to travel for 
private purposes got official approval and actually made the 
trip was a record. 
  He attributed the boom to the simplified system of passport 
processing, especially for scientists, technicians and students. 
  The official said that monitoring was tightened to block 
touring abroad by officials at taxpayers' expense. 
  The authorities were vigilant to prevent illegal emigration 
organized by gangland in the guise of sightseeing, and 
prosecuted perpetrators who were caught, Mao added.

  [Text] 1. Enterprises producing canned food for export 
and running this type of business must use trademarks according 
to the Trademark Law and the relevant regulations concerning 
trademarks on exports. Foreign trade enterprises that use 
others' registered trademarks on their exported canned food 
should sign contracts with registrants according to law to 
authorize the use of the trademarks. Their product quality, 
markets, clients, and prices are subject to the relevant 
departments' supervision, administration, and coordination. 
  2. The work of printing and making trademarks on exported 
canned food must be handled according to the Administrative 
Method of Printing and Making Trademarks promulgated by the 
State Administration for Industry and Commerce. If trademark 
registrants are foreign trade enterprises, the registrants or 
enterprises authorized by the registrants should be responsible 
for supervising the work of printing and making the trademarks. 
  3. Production enterprises are not permitted without 
authorization to sell others canned food with foreign trade 
enterprise trademarks which are produced for and used by foreign 
trade enterprises. If, for special reasons, production 
enterprises have to sell at home exported canned food which uses 
the trademarks of foreign trade enterprises, they are, in 
principle, not allowed to use the registered trademarks of 
foreign trade enterprises. If it is really difficult to change 
the trademarks, they should, with the consent of the trademark 
registrants, add another seal with the words "For Domestic 
Sale," which is not smaller than 2.25 square cm and which is not 
easily altered, at the conspicuous site of the trademarks. 
Canned food labelled for domestic sale is not permitted to be 
exported again. 
  4. The code names of the production plants, production 
dates, and product code must be printed on exported canned food. 
  5. Generically packed canned food without any trademarks is

and the Southeast Asian regions. 
  Units and individuals which violate the above-mentioned 
regulations will be dealt with according to the relevant 
regulations, and those violating the criminal law will be turned 
over to judicial organs for investigation and the determination 
of criminal responsibility.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (CNS) -- Noted Chinese economist 
and member of the CPPCC Mr. Gao Shangquan recently suggested 
that three measures should be adopted to solve the grim problem 
of inflation. These are a strict restriction on fixed assets 
investment, restriction of the issuing of currency and the 
amount of credit and restriction of fiscal spending [sentence as 
received] 
  Mr. Gao said that excessive investment in fixed assets and 
having too many projects under construction had resulted in the 
scattering and ineffectiveness of such investment. The 
investment system, therefore, should be reformed with the scale 
of investment and the size of credit being strictly controlled 
and the investment structure improved to better profit from 
investment. The work efficiency and simplification of the 
administrative structure should at the same time be implemented 
on order to reduce spending and waste. 
  Effective control of inflation, Mr. Gao said, in fact 
depended on the changing from a speed-seeking economy to one 
bringing benefit. Developing speed and expanding investment 
should not be pursued blindly while the management level, 
technological standard and economic results should be enhanced. 
  Enterprises should speed up their running on modern company 
lines, Mr. Gao said, and reform for strengthening macro-control 
and improving the social security system should also be 
quickened. In order to guarantee social stability, the 
establishment of an unemployment insurance system and vocational 
training schemes as well as the development of tertiary industry 
should be speeded up.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese people are 
planting a tree belt along their 18,000-km coastline, according 
to the "China Environment Journal". 
  Work began in 1988, and the tree belt has extended 14,000 km 
so far and covered two million ha. 
  The professional paper noted that Fujian and Hainan 
Provinces 
and Qingdao city in Shandong Province have taken the lead in the 
work. 
  Fujian planted a 3,100-km-long tree belt along its coast and 
around nearby farmland last year. 
  Hainan now has a 1,400-km-long tree belt along its 1,500-km 
coast. 
  Qingdao has vowed to cover its remaining 15 km of coast with 
trees this year. 
  The paper noted that the construction of the "green wall" in 
the coastal areas has effectively weakened typhoons, tidal waves 
and rainstorms, protected stretches of farmland and improved 
ecological conditions.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 17 (XINHUA) -- A three-seat mini-car 
has hit the streets in northern China's Tianjin city, and it's 
turning a lot of heads. 
  Experts believed that the vehicle is soon to enter average 
urban households. 
  Whenever the new red-and-white model is parked somewhere in 
Tianjin, it draws a crowd. Some say they want to buy one 
immediately. 
  The small car, 2.3 meters long and 1.3 meters wide, can 
squeeze through narrow lanes. Its top speed is 70 km per hour, 
and it sells for about 20,000 yuan. 
  Car experts from the China automobile technology research 
center refer to the new model as China's "Star of Hope," meaning 
the car is made for average wage-earners. 
  Making family cars in China has remained a hot topic for 
many 
Chinese sociologists and car-makers. Many of them are setting 
their sights on the cheap mini-car as more expensive models will 
be out of the reach of most of Chinese urban families. 
  Thus far, more than 30 institutions are conducting studies 
into mini-car models and four types have emerged for 
recommendation, according to experts from the Automobile 
Technology Research Center. 
  Preliminary tests by the research center show that the new 
model in Tianjin can be used to carry both people and goods and 
that it is most desirable in terms of its performance, cost and 
low level of exhaust emission. It is an advanced model of 
mini-car in China, they say. 
  Huang Jianwu, a senior engineer and head of the Tianjin 
mini-car research team, said that the new model, something in 
between the motorcar and motor-tricycle, is cheap and suitable 
for a family of three and therefore has a bright market 
potential.

forestry under a planned economy should reform itself to cope 
with a market economy. 
  Other topics to be discussed include farmers' participation 
in forestry and agricultural reform and its relation with 
forestry. 
  Zhu Guangyao, a vice-minister of the Chinese Forestry 
Ministry, which is co-sponsoring the seminar, said that the

  [Excerpts] A provincial propaganda and ideological work 
conference started in Nanchang today. Provincial leaders, 
including Mao Zhiyong, Wu Guanzheng, Lu Xiuzhen, Shu Shengyou, 
Shu Huiguo, Huang Zhiquan, Zhong Qihuang, and others, attended 
the conference. 
  Wu Guanzheng, provincial party committee deputy secretary 
and 
provincial governor, delivered a speech at this morning's 
meeting presided over by provincial party committee Secretary 
Mao Zhiyong. 
  In his speech, Governor Wu Guanzheng called on the party 
organizations and comrades on the province's propaganda and 
ideological front to focus on the following three aspects of 
work: 
  1. To clearly understand the current situation, 
further enhance a sense of mission and a sense of 
responsibility, and successfully carry out propaganda and 
ideological work, 
  2. To take account of overall interests, focus on key 
work aspects, and comprehensively accomplish propaganda and 
ideological work tasks, 
  3. To strengthen leadership, brace up, and raise 
propaganda and ideological work to a new level. 
  Wu Guanzheng said: In order to strengthen leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work, it is imperative to cultivate a 
new train of thought, adopt new work methods, closely integrate 
propaganda and ideological work with economic and other types of 
work, and enable propaganda and ideological work to promote and 
contribute to economic construction and other types of work. 
Specifically speaking, we should make redoubled efforts in the 
following three aspects: 1. To arm the whole party with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and unify the ideology of the broad 
masses of cadres and people with the party's basic line; 2. To 
constantly serve the people and socialism, strive to unite all 
forces that can be united, and mobilize all positive factors to 
build socialism with Chinese characteristics; 3. To step up 
theory, public opinion, ideological education, cultural, and 
artistic work. To this end, party committees at all levels in 
Jiangxi should place propaganda and ideological work high on the 
agenda, frequently analyze each and every major social and 
ideological trend, provide regular guidance to propaganda and 
ideological departments, and carry out regular examination and 
supervision of propaganda and ideological work. 
  At this morning's meeting, Lu Xiuzhen, provincial party 
committee deputy secretary, also delivered speech in which she 
called for conscientiously implementing the spirit of the 
recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work 
conference, and comprehensively carrying out both the basic 
principles and four basic types of work in the propaganda and 
ideological domain. [passage omitted] 
  In the end, provincial party committee Secretary Mao Zhiyong 
delivered a speech in which he said: The propaganda and 
ideological front is an important front, while propaganda and 
ideological work has a crucial impact on the overall work. Over 
the past few years, the province's propaganda and ideological 
work front has done a lot of work by adhering to economic 
construction as the center, thereby pushing ahead with the two 
civilizations building. The new situation has set higher 
requirements on the propaganda and ideological front. 
Therefore, we should attach greater importance to rather than 
neglect, further strengthen rather than weaken, and further 
improve rather than leave unattended propaganda and ideological 
work. Now that we have propaganda and ideological work 
principles to follow, the crux of the matter lies in how to 
implement these principles to the letter. We should 
conscientiously carry out province-wide propaganda and 
ideological work by implementing the basic principles and four 
basic types of work spelled out by Comrade Jiang Zemin, arm the 
mind with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, and focus on studying and 
publicizing Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, this being a fundamental ideological work task. 
We should also persistently, actively, comprehensively, and 
correctly implement the party's basic line and basic central 
work principles and consciously submit to and serve the overall 
interests of grasping each and every excellent opportunity to 
deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and 
maintain stability. We should make every possible endeavor to 
mobilize the broad masses of the people to support and 
participate in reform, continually strengthen unity, maintain 
stability, boost morale, conduct mainly positive propaganda, 
correctly guide public opinion, publicize the spirit of the 
central authorities, win people's hearts, strengthen confidence, 
step up spiritual civilization and relevant infrastructure 
building, further increase input in propaganda and cultural 
undertakings, and gradually improve propaganda work conditions. 
  Secretary Mao Zhiyong emphatically stated: Party committees 
at all levels across the province should strengthen leadership 
over propaganda and ideological work by showing concern for 
overall interests, carrying out in-depth investigations and 
study, summing up experiences, and constantly improving and 
heightening ideological work standards. 
  The provincial propaganda and ideological work conference is 
now being attended by prefectural and city party committees 
deputy secretaries and propaganda departments directors, 
provincial work committees deputy secretaries, comrades in 
charge of various propaganda units directly under the provincial 
authorities, and comrades in charge of the relevant units. 
  This morning's meeting was attended by persons in charge of 
the relevant provincial units, those at the on-going provincial 
foreign- related propaganda work conference, those at the 
on-going provincial conference of radio and television bureaus 
chiefs and radio and television stations chiefs, those at the 
on-going provincial conference of cultural affairs bureaus 
chiefs, those at the on-going provincial news and publication 
work conference, as well as those at the on-going provincial 
conference of prefectural and city party committees organization 
departments directors.

Prisoners With Outstanding Contributions Make Over 200 Yuan in 
Monthly Income"] 
  [Text] Jinan, 6 March -- Starting February this year, the 
Lunan 7 May Prison in Shandong Province put into practice a 
graded wage system among its prisons. This is the first time a 
Chinese prison has introduced such a system. 
  With a view to better transforming prisoners and ensuring 
production safety, the Lunan 7 May Prison has decided to try out 
among its prisoners a graded wage system, which consists of 1) a 
basic wage, including 45 yuan as living expenses and 5 yuan as 
pocket money; 2) a graded wage varying from 10 to 35 yuan, with 
a 5- yuan difference at each grade; 3) an incentive wage 
depending on the output of production; 4) various allowances; 
and 5) a frugality award. 
  It has been learned that under the graded wage system, 
prisoners with an outstanding performance in transformation and 
production can earn a monthly income of over 200 yuan. 
  The graded wage system practiced in the 7 May Prison has 
helped stimulate the enthusiasm and consciousness of prisoners 
in remolding themselves, ensure safety in transformation and 
production, enhance the labor and technical qualities of 
prisoners, and put an end to waste.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The setting up of 
rural correspondence schools has helped farmers in Zhejiang 
Province, east China, to master more agro-techniques and become 
well-off. 
  A provincial official in charge of rural education said that 
the province has 68 rural correspondence schools, which have 
enrolled more than 90,000 farmers since 1988. 
  So far 80,000 of them have graduated from the schools and 
mastered at least one agro-technique. 
  About one half of them have been awarded the title of agro- 
technician, and many have taken the lead in applying, spreading 
and developing scientific techniques of farming and animal 
breeding. 
  One example is Zhao Zhengming, a farmer who graduated from a 
local correspondence school. 
  By putting what he learned into practice, he earns more than 
1,000 yuan every day by raising 300 pigs and more than 13,000 
chickens. 
  According to a statistical report provided by the Zhejiang 
Provincial Statistics Bureau, the average net income of rural 
residents in Zhejiang province averaged 1,746 yuan per capita 
last year, an increase of 28.5 percent over the previous year.

  [Text] Geneva, March 22 (CNA) -- The chairman of the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 
Standing Committee said Tuesday [22 March] that Taiwan has made 
substantial progress toward wildlife conservation but must 
continue crackdowns on trade in rhino horn and tiger parts. 
  Chairman Murray Hosking, speaking during a meeting of the 
CITES Standing Committee, noted that officials in Taiwan are 
taking wildlife conservation very seriously as evidenced by 
amendments to the Wildlife Conservation Law which significantly 
increase fines and penalties for violators and establishment of 
a wildlife protection unit. 
  He added that CITES was satisfied with the amendments to the 
law, but reserved final comment until an English-language 
translation of the bill is given to the CITES Secretariat. 
  Hosking also said CITES was satisfied that Taiwan is working 
to consolidate government stockpiles of endangered species 
products and has established a database for the registration, 
marking and sizing of confiscated stocks of rhino horn or tiger 
parts.

  [Text] Geneva, March 23 (CNA) -- The Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Wednesday [23 
March] decided to begin using the name "Taiwan, China," when 
referring to Taiwan and its wildlife conservation efforts. 
  The decision was made following protests by the Mainland 
Chinese delegation which said that earlier CITES reports treated 
Taiwan as an independent state and not as an integral part of 
China. 
  Beijing's chief delegate to the CITES Standing Committee 
meeting rejected a proposal to change the name to "Chinese 
Taipei," the one used by Taiwan in the Olympic Games and other 
sporting events. 
  But delegation head Wang Weimin complained that "Chinese 
Taipei" is an exception and should not be used. Wang is deputy 
director of the Treaty and Legal Affairs Department under 
Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Wang insisted CITES revise Taiwan's name before discussing 
the alleged trade in rhino horn and tiger bone in Taiwan, 
Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Yemen. 
  As a non-CITES member, Taiwan is not allowed to attend the 
Standing Committee meeting, which opened Monday and will 
continue through Friday.

  [Text] Taipei, March 23 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] will never accept the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES) decision to refer to Taiwan as 
"Taiwan, China," Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu said 
Wednesday [23 March]. 
  Chien was responding to reports from Geneva saying that the 
CITES Standing Committee has yielded to Beijing's pressure and 
decided to refer to Taiwan as "Taiwan, China" in its report on 
wildlife conservation on the island. 
  "Such a decision is ridiculous," Chien said, stressing that 
Taiwan is a separate political entity and has never been ruled 
by Chinese Communist authorities. 
  Chien said Beijing's intention to downgrade the ROC in the 
international arena by suggesting the use of such a designation 
in the CITES report would only worsen relations across the 
Taiwan Strait and would not alter the fact that Taiwan is a 
separate political entity. 
  Beijing has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and 
sought to limit Taiwan's movements on the world stage. 
  The Council of Agriculture (COA), which is in charge of 
wildlife conservation affairs, said it will protest the CITES 
decision. 
  "If CITES does not use our formal national title in its 
report, we hope it can at least refer to US as Chinese Taipei," 
COA Vice Chairman Lin [words indistinct] said.

<F P=106> [By Vladimir Mikh in Moscow and David Hess in Taipei] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 22 (CNA) -- Mikhail Sergaivich 
Gorbachev was the first, last and only leader of the Soviet 
Union to get out of that job alive, so no one had an idea what 
former Soviet leaders do in retirement. He answered his own 
question by establishing the Gorbachev Fund in 1991. The fund 
absorbs the millions of dollars Gorbachev earns speaking and 
attending conferences, and through its activities paints a 
profile of his interests and concerns. 
  As the Soviet Union and Gorbachev's political power crumbled 
in late 1991, the international socio-economic and political 
fund, better known as the Gorbachev Fund, was formed from two 
other institutes: the Economic and Social Reforms Fund, headed 
by Stanislav Shatalin, a well-known economist, and the Foreign 
Policy Association, led by Eduard Shevarnadze, former Soviet 
foreign minister. 
  The structure of the new fund was streamlined to concentrate 
on two key areas of studies -- Russia and the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) and the future of civilization, which 
includes issues concerning Russia's return to Europe, the 
problems of transforming formerly totalitarian societies, and 
international paths to democracy. 
  Much of the focus is on domestic affairs, and the typical 
bread-and-butter reports are devoted to general topics, like the 
questionable results of "shock therapy" to establish free 
markets in Russia, the deplorable state of the CIS, the 
instruments of achieving social stability, and even the crisis 
of traditional values and the chances for Russian liberalism. 
  With so much criticism of the status quo, it is no wonder 
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has felt the heat and 
attacked the fund. Still, the fund denies it is deliberately 
antagonistic. 
  "The spirit of confrontation is alien to the fund. 
Everything that is being done is aimed at promoting the higher 
national interests of Russia", Grigory Revenko, deputy president 
of the fund said during an interview with CNA. However, he did 
not deny that some of Gorbachev's remarks might sound like 
bitter criticism to Yeltsin. 
  Revenko said all reports and papers from the fund are sent 
to 
government offices. "We consider it to be our noble duty," 
Revenko said, tacitly admitting the fund gets little in response 
for its work. 
  The new institute was originally supported by the income 
from 
several buildings, most notably a hotel on the prestigious 
Leningradskaya Prospect, which also houses the institute. But 
the hotel and other sources of funding later became enmeshed in 
a battle which threatened the fund's survival. 
  On Oct. 7th, 1992, Gorbachev refused for the second time to 
appear as a witness at the hearings of the Constitutional Court 
probing the "Communist Party Case." The case sought incidents 
of criminal behavior in the Communist Party, which Gorbachev 
headed as chairman. He refused to testify on the basis of 
presidential immunity. In retaliation, President Yeltsin issued 
a decree depriving the fund of all of its buildings, including 
the hotel which provided the fund with its necessary financial 
independence. 
  The next day, police picketed the building and barred 
entrance to all employees with the exception of Gorbachev's 
private secretary and a group of his closest aides. 
  Subsequently, President Yeltsin allowed the fund to lease 
one 
thousand square meters of the hotel building, almost two floors. 
This space accommodates the fund's 130 staff members. Last 
year,the fund paid 200 million rubles (US$125,000) rent. 
  Today, the Gorbachev Fund draws its finances from voluntary 
donations from individuals and private companies, and from the 
royalties and fees given to Gorbachev personally for his 
lecture- tours, such as here in Taiwan, articles published in 
the press and TV talk-shows and radio seminars. 
  "The very name Gorbachev remains, along with oil and the 
space program, one of the most marketable values left in our 
country," the pro-Yeltsin liberal daily IZVESTIA admitted in 
1992. 
  Making profits is not a policy of this think-tank, Revenko, 
who is also a close aide to Gorbachev, noted in his interview 
with CNA. Money is still a matter of survival for the fund. 
"The average pay of our staff is half that of government 
clerks," he said. 
  And yet, a large part of the fund's activities amount to 
charity and sponsorship of Russian art and culture. 
  The key project of the fund is focused on saving children 
with leukemia. More than one million US dollars, collected 
partially through donations, have been given to a Moscow clinic 
for children suffering from leukemia. The donation allowed the 
medical center to acquire sophisticated equipment that has 
boosted the children's recovery rate to one of the best in the 
world. 
  The Gorbachev Fund has also provided grants for other 
medical 
institutions in the city of Bryansk and in the Stavropol region. 
  The Gorbachev Fund has also given financial support to the 
children's fund, founded by the Russian film director Rolan 
Bykov; to the popular literary magazine "THE NEW WORLD;" and to 
the publishing house producing the collective works of the 
famous Russian philosopher Vladimir Vernadsky. 
  The fund's list of projects seems endless. It sponsored a TV 
program "The Green Lamp;" and launched, in cooperation with the 
fund in support of art, a monthly magazine "VIA REGIA." It 
sponsors training of young Russian talent in foreign 
universities. 
  In Moscow, the fund conducts classes for school teachers of 
the northern district of Moscow, and at one time, it tutored 
young specialists in political science, introducing them to the 
problem of conflict management and public speaking. 
  Still, with all of these activities, the center of the 
Gorbachev Fund remains Mikhail Sergaivich Gorbachev -- his 
lectures and speeches, his conferences and his TV appearances. 
This first visit to Taiwan is a part of the fund's ever 
expanding concern. 
  "The fund is keen to establish fruitful relationships with 
similar foreign funds and with research centers abroad. First 
contacts with such institutions in South Korea and Taiwan were 
made, and we are optimistic," Revenko told CNA. 
  CNA asked Revenko if there was a central set of principles 
that drew together the many activities of the Gorbachev Fund. 
"We continue to preach and practice the ideals to which we 
pledged loyalty back in 1985, we still believe in 
democratization, freedom of economic activity and glasnost." 
Glasnost is the Russian word for openness and accountability, 
applicable to how the triangle of government mass media and the 
general public interreact.

  [Text] Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development [CEPD] under the Executive 
Yuan, said at the Legislative Yuan yesterday: The United States 
and Japan, which are our country's largest and second largest 
economic and trading partners, are the countries that President 
Li Teng-hui wants to visit most following implementation of the 
policy of turning southward. Chairman Hsiao went on to say: It 
is possible to choose Central and South Africa as the 
destinations of President Li's second round of vacation trips. 
The CEPD can furnish information for use as reference to the 
Foreign Ministry at any time. 
  Speaking in the Legislative Yuan yesterday, Chairman Hsiao 
Wan-chang said: The countries that President Li wants to visit 
most on vacation are the United States and Japan, which he 
mentioned emphatically during the news conference upon returning 
from his southern tour. Hsiao Wan-chang said: The two nations 
are our country's largest and second largest economic and 
trading partners; their relations with our country are both the 
closest and the most complicated. Hsiao Wan-chang added: The 
CEPD and the Foreign Ministry also have been working hard to 
plan President Li's next round of overseas vacation trips for 
diplomatic purposes. However, it is inappropriate to announce 
the trips before the time is ripe. He also said emphatically: 
On top of its policy of turning southward, the government is 
actually moving in all directions to expand and strengthen 
relations with foreign countries. Any region could be a target 
of its diplomatic efforts.

  [Text] Taipei, March 22 KYODO -- A nonpartisan group of 
eight Japanese parliamentarians arrived in Taipei on Tuesday [22 
March] over an issue of some 452.4 million yen of unsettled 
government bonds bought by Taiwanese before and during World War 
II. 
  The Japanese Diet members said they will hold negotiations 
with 18 Taiwanese counterparts headed by Liu Sung-pan, head of 
the National Assembly, on the issue. 
  They said during their stay in Taiwan, they will also meet 
Taiwanese president Li Teng-hui. 
  The group of eight comprises two opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) parliamentarians and one each from five 
governing parties -- the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] 
(SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and new party Sakigake -- as well 
as one independent. 
  It is the first time for a Japanese Diet group including an 
SDPJ parliamentarian to visit Taiwan for the purpose of 
negotiations since Japan broke its diplomatic relations with the 
island country in 1972. The SDPJ has traditionally backed 
Mainland China since even before 1972. 
  Japan has voiced its intention to refund the unpaid money to 
the Taiwanese from the fiscal 1995 state budget beginning in 
April 1995. 
  Wartime Japanese rulers in Taiwan forced people to deposit 
part of their monthly salaries into postal savings accounts. 
  Many Taiwanese hope to link the unpaid money to indexing, 
saying the value has risen by about 4,500 times from 1943 on the 
basis of Japanese public servant salaries. 
  According to a Japanese Government estimate, the postal 
savings deposits and other unpaid money totaled 452.4 million 
yen owned by about 2,547,000 people. 
  Of the 452.4 million yen, postal savings account for 369 
million yen, postal annuities 1.4 million yen and unpaid 
salaries 82 million yen, according to the estimate. 
  The savings will be recognized as a fixed amount with high 
interest, the sources said. 
  The issue is to be handled the same way the government 
repaid 
the savings of Okinawa residents deposited before the war, the 
sources said. 
  From December 1969 to February 1972, just before the 
reversion of Okinawa to Japan from the United States, the 
government reimbursed 94 million yen in savings to residents, 
adding 339 million yen to the principal as indexing. 
  Japan occupied Taiwan from 1885 to 1945. Before and during 
the war, Japan encouraged the purchase of government bonds not 
only in Japan but also in its former colonies of Korea and 
Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance 
decided Saturday [19 March] to levy anti-dumping taxes on some 
petrochemical imports from Japan and South Korea as part of its 
effort to protect local manufacturers from unfair trade 
competition following Taiwan's trade liberalization. 
  After investigating a complaint filed by Taiwan 
Polypropylene 
Corp., the ministry's Tariff Commission found that 10 Japanese 
and eight South Korean polypropylene makers had sold their 
products to Taiwan at prices lower than fair market value. 
  The commission decided to impose anti-dumping taxes ranging 
between 5.16 percent and 68.71 percent on polypropylene imports 
from those companies. The tax rates vary with import quantities 
and prices. 
  The commission will also levy anti-dumping taxes on 
high-density and low-density polyethylene imports from five 
South Korean companies, including Daewoo, Samsung and Hyundai. 
The tax rates will range between 6.05 percent and 9.45 percent, 
retroactive to Feb. 25. 
  A Finance Ministry official said the government has levied 
6.77 to 29.16 percent temporary anti-dumping taxes on the five 
Korean firms since Feb. 25. As investigations showed the tax 
rates should not have been so high, the official said, the 
government will refund the excess tax revenues. 
  The Tariff Commission is also investigating a dumping charge 
filed by Li Chang Yung Chemical Industry Corp. against some 
Japanese Penta Manufacturers and will decide whether to impose 
anti-dumping taxes on those makers next month, the official said. 
  Taiwan has become more aggressive in handling dumping 
charges 
in response to mounting complaints by local manufacturers that 
many foreign companies have cashed in on Taiwan's trade 
liberalization policy by dumping their goods here. Finance 
Ministry sources said many dumping charges involve South Korean 
petrochemical and steel makers.

  [Text] Manila, March 20 (CNA) -- The Philippine Department 
of Trade and Investment (DTI) has reached an agreement with 
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs on a long-term loan 
assistance program for the development of small and medium sized 
enterprises. 
  DTI Undersecretary Tomas I. Alcantara said the Taiwan 
Government has agreed to extend loans worth US$10 million 
through the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund 
and the Industrial Cooperation Center. 
  The amount, however, could be increased to US$100 million 
after two years depending on the success of the initial program 
and on the needs of the users. 
  Under the plan, the amount will be lent to the Development 
Bank of the Philippines [DBP] for a 10-year period with an 
annual interest rate of 3 percent and a three year grace period. 
  The DBP will in turn re-lend the money to the private sector 
for a maximum of five years at lower than market rates, 
Alcantara said. 
  At least five sectors have been considered for the 
assistance 
package, including the metal, tool and die, garment, component 
manufacturing, and equipment and electric industries, he added.

  [Text] Taipei, March 22 (CNA) -- Taiwan businessmen can 
make a stronger impact on the Japanese market by collecting 
their strength under the same roof, according to President 
Samuel Chu of the Taiwan Trade Development Co. Ltd. 
  Chu made the remarks upon returning from a visit to Tokyo 
Monday [21 March] to finalize plans for the Taiwan trade center. 
  Chu said the trade center will be housed in a 3,600 square 
meter building located in downtown Tokyo and aims to gather the 
strength of Taiwan businessmen in Japan. 
  The building was purchased last October by the Kuomintang 
Business Management Committee for US$113 million. Space in the 
building will be rented to Taiwan enterprises at lower than 
market prices, Chu explained. 
  The center will replace the Far East Trade Center, which is 
the current meeting place for Taiwan businessmen in Japan but is 
too small, Chu added. 
  So far, a group of Taiwan enterprises have rented offices in 
the nine-floor Taiwan Trade Center, including Kokuei, UMC, China 
Airlines, and Eva Airways.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 18 (CNS) -- The entire ranks of 
civil servants, including the disciplined services in Hong Kong, 
are entitled to the through train up to the period after 1997, 
while senior officers at secretary level will be subject to 
nomination by the then special administrative region (SAR) 
government and to submission to the central authorities for 
appointment, the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong branch of the 
New China News Agency (NCNA) Mr. Zhang Junsheng said here today. 
He added that their duties performed during the rule of the 
British-Hong Kong government would not be retrospective nor 
investigated. 
  Mr. Zhang made these remarks at a seminar attended by 
district affairs advisers of the New Territory section. In 
response to attitudes held by general civil servants at present, 
Mr Zhang said that the future SAR government would not look into 
the past responsibilities they had had after 1997 and that if 
civil servants were by that time willing to retain their 
position, they could do so. He added they would not be found to 
be at fault for their former words and deeds. As for those 
criticized by the Chinese side, this was purely because their 
worlds and deeds were in violation of the Sino-British joint 
Declaration. 
  Another deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of the NCNA, 
Mr. Zheng Guoxiong, attending the same function pointed out that 
under the circumstances where the British side had destroyed the 
foundation for cooperation, the Chinese side had to rely on Hong 
Kong compatriots, including the district affairs advisers to 
make joint efforts to realize a peaceful and steady transition. 
  He added that the district affairs advisers were persons of 
influence in various districts and in different professions. 
Mr. Zheng said that they could help the Hong Kong branch of the 
NCNA to hear and collect opinions and views on a wider scope in 
a bid to ensure peace and stability during the transition.

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy in Beijing and Dick Chan] </F>
  [Text] China's legislature yesterday decided to postpone 
scrutinising a hard-line statement that denounces Hong Kong's 
three-tier political structure as set up under British rule. 
The National People's Congress (NPC) presidium suggested the 
statement--proposed by Hong Kong delegate Cheng Yiu-tong, and 
supported by more than 30 delegates--be referred to the legal 
committee, rather than being passed during this plenary session. 
It appears the move is to cool the atmosphere created by the 
row with Britain as China accelerates efforts to unite the 
people of Hong Kong. 
  Mr Cheng proposed using legislation to defy the Legislative 
Council, district boards and municipal councils set up in Hong 
Kong if Britain and China failed to agree on democratic reform. 
His proposal states China has a right to re-organise the 
government under the Basic Law and the decisions of the Congress 
and its Standing Committee. Mr Cheng said yesterday his 
proposal was not dismissed and suggested the Congress chairmen 
might have felt it was "not the best timing" to make such a 
statement. 
  In a separate move, Britain's ambassador to Beijing, Sir 
Robin McLaren, dismissed Chinese suggestions that introducing 
the single-seat, single-vote election system was a "backward 
step" in democracy for Hong Kong. He was responding to comments 
made last week by China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, Lu 
Ping, who is the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office. Sir Robin said: "That is not the view of either the 
British Government or the Hong Kong Government, and I don't 
think it is the view of Legco, since it has frequently supported 
the single-seat, single-vote system. It does not seem to me 
that 60 constituencies for a population of six million is 
excessive."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Business Should Be Done According to Agreement </F>
on Airport Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Recently, Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and 
foreign minister, said that although the Sino-British talks on 
Hong Kong's political structure had broken down, China was still 
concerned about Hong Kong's economy and Hong Kong people's 
livelihood and would do its best to cooperate with the British 
side. Whether such cooperation can be realized will depend on 
the British side's attitude and actions. 
  With regard to Hong Kong's economy and Hong Kong people's 
livelihood, the first thing that requires cooperation is the 
airport issue. Does the British side actually have sincerity 
for cooperation? Chris Patten said: "The sincerity the Chinese 
side talked about meant that the British side had to completely 
comply with the Chinese side's idea." He tried to mislead Hong 
Kong people and this showed an irresponsible attitude. 
  The attitude of the Chinese side is open and above board. 
The Chinese side holds that if there are agreements between the 
Chinese side and the British side, things should be done in 
accordance with the agreements. China has never required the 
British side to act in compliance with the Chinese side's ideas. 
The agreements were reached by the two sides on the basis of 
equality, mutual accommodation, and complete willingness. 
Acting according to the agreements does not mean that the 
British side has to be obedient to the Chinese side; instead, 
this just means that the British side should respect and abide 
by its own promises and should keep good faith. 
  China and Britain signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 
the 
new airport in 1991 and both sides agreed that the new airport 
should be constructed at low cost and should achieve high 
economic efficiency. "The Hong Kong Government is responsible 
for the 10 key projects related to the new airport" and "will 
not leave any financial burdens for the Special Administrative 
Region [SAR] Government." "The Hong Kong Government will hold 
HK$25 billion as financial reserves for the SAR Government" and 
"will consult the Chinese Government if it needs to contract 
loans over HK$5 billion." All this was the solemn agreement on 
which neither side can go back. The British side signed the 
agreement in 1991 but, after that, it has continued to distort 
and negate the provisions it did not like. Did it not just 
regard the agreement as a mere scrap of paper? In such 
circumstances, China must resolutely safeguard the agreement. 
  As a matter of fact, the Memorandum of Understanding did not 
include any concrete financial package. In 1991, Anson Chan 
openly announced that the British Hong Kong Government had 
sufficient financial capacity for the new airport projects. If 
that was the case, since the memorandum had been signed, the 
British side should have been able to start the projects in full 
scale and there should not have been any more trouble. However, 
the British side did not really want to act according to the 
memorandum. It required the Chinese side to provide a guarantee 
for over HK$5 billion of debt and required that talks be held on 
its financial package. Why did the British side insist on 
holding further talks? It just tried to gain the Chinese side's 
endorsement in order to contract loans from the private 
financial institutions. Because the loans will be repaid after 
1997 and after the withdrawal of the British people and Hong 
Kong will then be a SAR of China, without the Chinese 
Government's guarantee, the financial syndicates are not willing 
to arrange the loans. 
  The first financial package dished out by the Hong Kong 
Government included HK$73 billion of "callable equity." The 
second financial package included HK$45 billion in loans. The 
third financial package included HK$28 billion in debts. The 
fourth financial package included HK$23 billion in debts and 
mentioned that the debts owed by the Temporary Airport Authority 
and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation would not be included 
in the debts limited by the memorandum of understanding as they 
did not require Hong Kong Government guarantees. Therefore, 
there were many questionable and vague points in the fourth 
package and the British side should clarify them. Otherwise, 
the debts can become unlimited and the talks on the financial 
package may become meaningless. 
  The British side said that, by 1997, it would leave HK$120 
billion in financial surplus to the SAR but it was unwilling to 
spend this financial surplus on the airport projects. However, 
the existence of thi HK$120 billion is rather doubtful. The 
Chinese side held that it was not necessary to leave such a 
large financial surplus to the SAR, and HK$25 billion would be 
enough. The remaining amount could be spent on the construction 
of the airport. Is not that a simple way to resolve the airport 
financial problem? The British Hong Kong authorities are 
unwilling to spend the huge financial surplus and just want to 
contract loans at an interest rate of over 10 percent so that 
the SAR will have to repay both interest and principal of the 
debts. What is their real intention? Do they want to give the 
British financial institutions a business opportunity by 
enabling them to earn long-term and high-rate interest income? 
The interest expenditure will have to be borne by Hong Kong 
people in the future; is this a reasonable option? 
  It is not impossible to contract loans over the ceiling of 
HK$5 billion but it is impossible to exceed the ceiling by too 
much. Moreover, the Chinese side must be consulted if the loans 
exceed the ceiling. The British Hong Kong authorities should be 
able find some ways to quicken the pace of the financial talks 
as long as they work out a more reasonable package in accordance 
with the memorandum of understanding.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Newly-elected Hong 
Kong affairs advisors at regional levels have pledged to serve 
as a bridge between the Chinese Government and Hong Kong 
residents during the latter half of the transitional period. 
  At a meeting organized by the local branch of the XINHUA 
NEWS 
AGENCY on Thursday [17 March], they shared the views that work 
in many aspects of the preparation for the transfer of power in 
1997 would become more difficult because of lacking a "through 
train" arrangement for the 1994-95 election to be held in Hong 
Kong. 
  Many of them suggested that publicity of the Basic Law, 
known 
as the mini-constitution for the future government of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, should be put on the top of 
the agenda and be introduced into school textbook. 
  Kan Chi-ho, an advisor from the Wong Tai Sin District, said 
since work in the latter half of transitional period would not 
be as easy as many local people expected, the preliminary 
committee for the Preparatory Work Committee should speed up 
work in all fields. 
  Another advisor, Ng Siu-cheung, said he would collect 
opinions from grass roots on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements 
for the Legislative Council, two urban councils and district 
boards in a bid to close contacts between the Chinese side and 
local residents.

<F P=106> ["Dispatch" by WEN WEI PO news team: "Lu Ping Gives Account </F>
of Work Done by the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar--At a meeting of Hong Kong deputies 
to the National People's Congress held here today, Lu Ping, vice 
director and secretary general of the Preliminary Work Committee 
[PWC] of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR], gave a detailed account of progress 
made by the PWC since its establishment. His speech was well 
received by all of the NPC deputies. 
  First of all, Lu pointed out: Since the breakdown of the 
Sino-British talks, the work of the PWC has become heavier. The 
PWC is divided into five groups, i.e. the political affairs 
group, the economic group, the legal group, the security group, 
and the culture and education group. For some time now, the 
five groups have practically held meetings once a month and have 
initially exchanged views on many issues, but no final 
conclusions have been made. 
  The political affairs group has concentrated for some time 
on 
discussing the formation of the first government and legislative 
council, as well as the relationship between the executive and 
the legislature. On the formation of the first government, the 
first question is the chief executive. Candidates for chief 
executive will not and should not be discussed by the PWC, so 
this question has not been discussed at all. What has been 
discussed is mostly when the chief executive will be chosen. 
There are two views on whether the chief executive should be 
chosen sooner or later, and both have logic. Lu said: If a 
consensus cannot be reached, views will be submitted to the 
preparatory committee, which will choose. 
  On the formation of the first legislative council, most are 
inclined to leave the existing 21 functional constituencies 
unchanged. There are differing views about which the nine new 
functional constituencies should be. A fairly unanimous view is 
that China-funded enterprises should be regarded as a functional 
constituency. 
  The economic group is now divided into four special 
subgroups, i.e. the new airport issue, financial issues, issue 
of capital construction in the two places (how capital 
construction on the mainland and Hong Kong is coordinated), and 
the retirement insurance issue. The four subgroups are now 
working separately. The economic group will next study the 
issue of Hong Kong real estate policy. Prices of land and 
housing in Hong Kong have indeed reached a level that cannot be 
sustained by ordinary residents. Ordinary people virtually 
cannot afford to buy a flat. This is indeed a big problem. 
  The legal group is now examining Hong Kong laws clause by 
clause. According to the provisions of the Basic Law, the 
existing laws are basically applicable and will continue to be 
valid beyond 1997. However, if some laws contravene the Basic 
Law, the NPC will declare them null and void. 
  Some time ago, the law and order group focused on the right 
of abode and SAR passport issues. On the question of SAR 
passports, most people hope they can be issued before 1997 so 
that people can hold SAR passports to travel or discuss business 
abroad after 1 July 1997. As for those permanent Hong Kong 
residents who go abroad to gain foreign citizenship and then 
return to Hong Kong, Lu said his personal view is that this 
should be handled in a relaxed manner as far as possible. 
Specific measures to solve this problem are still being studied. 
  The culture and education group is studying the issue of 
textbooks. This is because publishing circles want to have the 
relevant principles laid down early so that they are able to 
compile textbooks according to these principles and print them 
for selection and use by 1997.

<F P=106> [By Xie Zuan (6200 9449) ] </F>
  [TEXT] Beijing, 17 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Today, 
attending a discussion to solicit opinions with a delegation of 
deputies from the Hong Kong and Macao region of Guangdong 
Province who are attending the Eighth National People's Congress 
session, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, delivered a speech on the Hong Kong issue. When dealing 
with the question of China-funded enterprises in Hong Kong, he 
pointed out: China-funded enterprises should play their due 
role in Hong Kong while refraining from involvement in some 
activities. They should not do everything they wish to. They 
should make contributions to the maintenance of Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability. 
  When discussing the question of constituencies in the first 
legislature of the special administrative region government, Lu 
Ping said: When the Preliminary Work Committee discussed this 
question, participants suggested in a relatively powerful way 
that China- funded enterprises should be counted as a 
constituency, because they play a certain role in Hong Kong's 
economy. He said: China-funded enterprises should undertake a 
mission of maintaining Hong Kong's long-term stability and 
prosperity. 
  Meanwhile, Lu Ping emphatically pointed out: China-funded 
enterprises should play their due role in Hong Kong while 
refraining from involvement in some activities. They should not 
do everything they wish to. He said: Some people say that as 
Hong Kong is a free economic society, why should China-funded 
enterprises not do things that others can do? He pointed out: 
China-funded enterprises should not get involved in certain 
activities, because they have their own mission. They should 
not just make economic contributions to the state. More 
importantly, they should maintain Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity. 
  Lu Ping stated: By playing their due role, we mean that 
China- funded enterprises should do things which are conducive 
to Hong Kong's prosperity and should refrain from doing things 
detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 
Illustrating this with examples, he said: They should not 
engage in real estate trading, and we do not allow them to do 
so. He pointed out: I hear some China-funded enterprises are 
also involved in trading real estate at a profit. This brings 
no good to Hong Kong. The price of real estate in Hong Kong has 
been pushed up too high. He said: When they lose money in real 
estate transactions, there is no need for some China-funded 
institutions to pay for the losses. This means they compete 
with other enterprises on an unequal footing. At the same time, 
as there is no need for them to take responsibility for their 
losses, they can push up real estate prices very high. He said: 
This way of doing things must be opposed. He maintained: If 
China-funded enterprises participate in the legislature as a 
constituency, they will pay a positive role in various aspects 
of endeavor, because they shoulder the glorious historical 
mission of developing Hong Kong's economy and stabilizing Hong 
Kong society.

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy and Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China's top man on Hong Kong affairs yesterday 
leveled a double-barrelled attack on Britain, criticising the 
British side for moving "backwards" on democracy and "acting 
like a child" in handling airport financing. Lu Ping of the 
State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office made the 
remarks to Hong Kong deputies at the National People's Congress 
(NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
(CPPCC). 
  He set out a rough schedule for the early months of the 
first 
Special Administrative Region government and legislature. There 
would be no "through-train" arrangement for legislators elected 
in 1995 to stay on, and the first SAR legislature would be set 
up at the end of 1997 as preparation for the elections and 
polling would take about six months. Members of Legco and 
district organisations elected in 1994/95 would probably be 
excluded by China's version of the Election Committee to return 
10 legislators. Their places would be taken up by the delegates 
to the NPC and CPPCC. The single-seat, single-vote election 
method was not preferred, as it was a "backward step" in 
democracy. The Preliminary Working Committee would have no say 
in the selection of candidates for the first chief executive, as 
the group was only helping with preparations. Neither the NPC 
Standing Committee nor the chief executive would impose 
legislation on the SAR. 
  The Chinese proposal on the composition of the Election 
Committee was in stark contrast to Britain's position during the 
failed Sino-British talks and the electoral bill being 
considered by the Legislative Council. Britain had asked that 
NPC and CPPCC delegates who were not elected by the people of 
Hong Kong, be excluded from the committee. The electoral bill 
tabled earlier this month proposed an Election Committee 
consisting entirely of directly elected members of the district 
boards. 
  China has yet to fix the size of the committee, but its 
proposal would mean that the pro-China figures would have at 
least a quarter of the votes in the committee, which is to 
return 10 legislators in 1997. Beijing has proposed that the 
committee be modelled along the lines of the 800 strong 
committee stipulated in Annex I of the Basic Law for the 
selection of the first chief executive. Thus, the committee 
would consist of an equal number of members from the industrial, 
commercial and financial sectors; professionals, labour, social 
services, religious and other sectors, as well as the members of 
the Legislative Council, representatives from the district-based 
organisations and deputies to the NPC and CPPCC. 
  Due to the collapse of the talks, the last sector would 
called "former politicians", including mainly local delegates to 
the NPC and CPPCC, Mr Lu said. Mr Lu said the single-seat, 
single-vote election method would reduce the size of the 
constituency as the SAR legislature heads for more directly 
elected seats. "This is not (a method) to promote democracy, it 
is a backward step," he said. "Imagine when such a small area as 
Hong Kong is divided into 60 geographical constituencies, the 
size (of the constituency) will get smaller and smaller while 
the number of voters will become fewer and fewer." Hong Kong 
people had proposed the "double-seat, single-vote" method, and 
proportional representation, both of which would be considered 
carefully, he said. 
  Mr Lu made no specific reference to the Government's fourth 
financing plan for the new airport, but cited three sets of 
funding proposals which contained billions in debt. "They must 
be kidding. They just cannot act like a child. It doesn't make 
sense," he said. "We are not barring any discussion on the level 
of debts (that exceeds the five billion ceiling). But that 
cannot be too large. We thought that every thing would be fine 
after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). You 
[the British side] can go ahead if you can stick to the 
agreement. But later they told us the financing package has 
greatly exceeded the provisions in the MOU. At first it was 
HK$70 billion. Are they kidding? You (the British side) are 
not a child. How can we accept it? How can you raise loans 
from banks if the future government has no liability for the 
debts. Will you give them loans, Huang?" Mr Lu jokingly asked 
Huang Diyan, head of the Bank of China in Hong Kong. "That's 
creating trouble again." 
  Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang yesterday dropped a 
strong hint that Britain was ready to make further concessions 
on the airport financing package. Although Britain had already 
addressed all the Chinese concerns with the latest financing 
proposal, Mrs Chan said, they were still happy to address new 
Chinese concerns to pave the way for an early meeting to strike 
a deal. "And it seems sensible to me that the sooner we can sit 
down to talk about this and try to address them (their 
concerns), the better it is for everyone. We do need to move 
ahead quickly on this airport," she said. "I am not quite sure 
what Mr Lu means when he refers to a gap," she said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 23 (AFP)--The installation of U.S. 
Patriot missiles in South Korea "will only accelerate the speed 
towards war" in the Korean peninsula, North Korean ambassador 
Chu Chang-chun said Wednesday. 
  He told a press conference here that the "American side 
should not forget the historical experience of the 1950s Korean 
war." 
  He was reacting to Washington's announcement that it was 
sending Patriot anti-missile missiles to South Korea as a 
defensive measure and resuming its Team Spirit military 
exercises with South Korea. 
  Those moves would "only accelerate the speed toward war. If 
they don't give up all these attempts, nothing can happen but 
war," said Chu. 
  He also said that if international sanctions were imposed on 
North Korea by the United Nations Pyongyang would "make the 
necessary response." 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency has accused North 
Korea of not fully cooperating with inspections of its nuclear 
programme and has referred the issue to the United Nations for 
possible Security Council action to obtain full compliance.

  [Text] Dear listeners: Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa made a brief visit to Shanghai yesterday. Our station 
reporter Yao Sukun and Liu Hao sent the following report: 
  [Hosokawa briefly heard, speaking in Japanese, fading into 
Chinese translation] Shanghai is the locomotive of China's 
economic development. I wanted to come and visit Shanghai for a 
long time. Today I have realized my wish. I am very happy 
indeed. 
  While giving his impressions of the visit to Pudong, 
Hosokawa 
pointed out: I am moved that Pudong has managed to develop to 
the present scale within a very short period. 
  Hosokawa showed great interest in the development of Pudong 
New Area. He said: Pudong should step up efforts to publicize 
itself in order to attract more Japanese entrepreneurs, 
especially those of medium and small enterprises, to come and 
invest here. He also hoped that Pudong New Area would provide 
facilities for schooling and housing for children of Japanese 
investors. 
  Speaking on efforts to strengthen economic cooperation 
between Japan and China, Premier Hosokawa pointed out: 
Strengthening economic cooperation between Japan and China is 
conducive to the economic development in the world. Economic 
cooperation between Japan and China can further push forward the 
world's economic development. Japan will continue to make 
efforts toward this end. Prime Minister Hosokawa hoped that the 
ties between the two countries will move toward an even better 
direction. He said this is the very purpose of his current 
visit to China.

  [Text] Buenos aires, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The prospects for 
cooperation between China and Latin american countries are very 
bright because both want long-term, stable, healthy and mutual 
beneficial relations, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu 
said here today. 
  Liu made his remarks at the end of an 11-day Latin American 
trip which took him to Venezuela, Chile and Argentina. 
  He said that Sino-Latin American relations are improving and 
the number of high-ranking officials exchanging visits is 
increasing. 
  Last year was a record year in bilateral trade, surpassing 
3.7 billion U.S. dollars, the Chinese vice-minister said. 
  He noted that China and Latin American countries share 
similar viewpoints on many international issues and support each 
other in the United Nations and on the issue of human rights. 
  Therefore, Liu said, there is a solid foundation for further 
cooperation between China and Latin America.

  [Text] The Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee yesterday held 
a provincial rural work conference in Guiyang to relay and 
implement the spirit of a recently concluded central rural work 
conference, exchange rural economic work experiences among 
various areas, discuss and study a new train of thought for as 
well as concrete measures of accelerating Guizhou's agricultural 
and rural economic growth, and arrange for the province's 
agricultural and rural work in 1994. Yesterday's conference was 
chaired by Chen Shineng, provincial party committee deputy 
secretary and provincial governor. 
  Provincial party Committee Secretary Liu Fangren attended 
and 
delivered an important speech in which he emphatically asserted: 
Under a new economic structure, so long as we strive to enhance 
a sense of market economy, firmly grasp each and every excellent 
opportunity, find new ways out by dint of in-depth reforms, and 
push ahead with development by negotiating difficulties, we will 
definitely be able to push ahead with Guizhou's agricultural and 
rural economic growth. In order to steadily resolve the problem 
of food and clothing and bring about a comparatively well-off 
livelihood, we should exert our utmost efforts to develop a 
high-yield, high-efficiency, and high-quality agriculture, 
successfully conduct land exploitation and utilization, more 
rapidly transfer surplus rural labor to nonagricultural sectors, 
secure a steady grain output growth, steadily increase peasants' 
income, simultaneously seek to bring about a comparatively 
well-off livelihood and provide assistance to poverty-stricken 
areas, and promote township and town enterprises development. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren went on: We should also make a success 
of family planning work, push forward agricultural growth by 
virtue of advanced science and technology, step up 
infrastructure construction, sucessfully develop county-level 
economy and further county-level comprehensive reform, build a 
rural economic operative mechanism and a rural management 
structure conformable to a market economy, further stabilize 
basic rural policies, be bold in developing, creating, and 
enlivening new operative and organizational modes, press ahead 
with joint-stock system development as well as establish and 
perfect a socialized service system in the rural areas, 
vigorously develop integrated rural economic operation, 
cultivate and develop a rural market system, intensify 
macroeconomic regulation and control, increase agricultural 
input, establish and perfect an agricultural protection system 
as well as an agricultural risk compensation mechanism, and 
continually and successfully build all rural reform experimental 
zones and counties. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren especially called in his speech on 
party committees and governments at all levels in Guizhou to 
direct most of their energies to agricultural and rural work, 
strengthen and improve the CPC leadership over rural work, 
constantly improve guidance and leadership over rural market 
economic operation, continually and firmly grasp two key work 
aspects at the same time, and continually enhance grass-roots 
power organs and organizations. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren finally called on leading cadres at 
all 
levels in Guizhou to practically improve leadership style and 
methods, devote more time to theory studies, conduct more 
investigations and study, do more realistic work, and persist in 
the system under which leaders at all levels go to work in the 
rural areas for some time every year. The leaders at all 
levels, he added, should go deep into villages, households, as 
well as the forefront of agricultural production to listen to 
the views of the masses, implement policies, and resolve 
problems for peasants in a down-to-earth manner. 
  Yesterday's conference was attended by principal 
prefectural, 
autonomous prefectural, city, and county party and government 
leaders; persons in charge of prefectural, autonomous 
prefectural, city, and county agricultural departments and 
miscellaneous departments; provincial party committee, people's 
congress, government, and Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference committee leaders; as well as persons in 
charge of various departments concerned.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, provincial party committee 
Secretary Xie Fei, National People's Congress [NPC] deputy and 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, spoke at a panel 
discussion held by the Guangdong NPC Delegation in Beijing. 
  Secretary Xie Fei said: Premier Li Peng called in his work 
report for grasping each and every excellent opportunity to 
deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and 
maintain stability, this being where the overall interests of 
the whole party and the whole country lie. We should show 
concern for, submit to, and embody such overall interests in our 
work. 
  In view of the realities in Guangdong, Secretary Xie Fei put 
forth the following four views on Guangdong's work in the future: 
  1. To grasp each and every excellent opportunity to deepen 
reforms in a down-to-earth manner, including financial, 
taxation, banking, foreign trade, and enterprise systems reform 
to be unfolded by the state this year, with a view to gradually 
building a socialist market economic mechanism, 
  2. To grasp each and every excellent opportunity to expand 
opening up with an eye to pushing ahead with reform and 
development, bringing into full play Guangdong's superiorities, 
raise thje standard of opening up, and expand scale of opening 
up, 
  3. To grasp each and every excellent opportunity to press 
ahead with economic development, focus on high- and 
new-technological industrial development, vigorously develop 
high-yield, high- efficiency, and high-quality agriculture, 
heighten management standard, increase economic efficiency, 
stabilize and develop agricultural production and development, 
and place agricultural production and development high on this 
year's work agenda. 
  4. To strengthen solidarity, maintain stability, remain 
sober- minded, eradicate factors of instability in a timely 
fashion, and smoothly further reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. 
  In a related development, Secretary Xie Fei disclosed in 
Beijing yesterday that Guangdong Province will mainly 
concentrate on the following eight types of work in the years 
ahead with a view to raising the standard and expanding the 
scale of opening up, pushing ahead with reform and development, 
and bringing into fuller play Guangdong's inherent superiorities. 
  1. Attach great importance to inviting modern management 
expertise, advanced equipment, and qualified personnel with an 
eye to improving enterprise operational and management standards 
and enhancing product competitiveness on the market. 
  2. Actively invite funds to develop infrastructure 
facilities, basic industries, hi-tech and new-technological 
industries and transform old enterprises as well. 
  3. Invite more financial, banking, and commercial 
institutions into the province. 
  4. Push ahead with tertiary industrial development and build 
an operational mechanism that converges with the world market 
and follows international practice. 
  5. Successfully manage and develop enterprises run with 
three types of capital [foreign capital, overseas Chinese 
capital, and with both Chinese and foreign capital] as well as 
enterprises engaged in three forms of import processing and 
compensation trade in hopes of fully developing their roles in 
promoting domestic economic growth and opening up overseas 
markets. 
  6. Locate appropriate overseas business partners to push 
forward the provincewide economic growth. 
  7. Continually and fully develop the province's local and 
regional superiorities and carry out omnidirectional opening up. 
  8. To improve investment environment and and create more 
favorable conditions for further opening up.

  [Text] In 1993 the procuratorial organs at all levels 
throughout Beijing Municipality scored new achievements in 
concentrating their efforts on investigating and handling major 
and appalling cases of corruption by resolutely implementing the 
arrangements made for the anticorruption struggle by the CPC 
Central Committee, the municipal party committee, and the 
municipal people's government. 
  The municipality placed 1,044 cases violating party 
discipline and the administrative discipline on file for 
investigation and prosecution in the year. Of these cases, 518 
are of economic ones such as embezzlement and accepting bribes 
and account for 49.6 percent of the total. Of these economic 
cases, appalling and major ones account for 42 percent of the 
total. The municipality punished 593 party-member wrongdoers. 
Of these party members, 204 were dismissed from the party; 96 
were placed on probation within the party; 17 were dismissed 
from their party posts; 276 were given serious warnings or 
warnings; and 263 were punished with administrative sanctions. 
  Since the sixth Beijing municipal conference held in June 
last year on encouraging officials to perform their duties 
honestly and particularly since the second plenum of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission, the municipal discipline 
inspection and procuratorial organs at all levels have further 
reinforced their strength in investigating and handling cases 
and increased quarter after quarter the number of new cases that 
have been placed on file for investigation and prosecution. 
According to the statistics, 177 cases were placed on file in 
the second quarter; 188 were placed on file in the third 
quarter; and 388 were placed on file in the fourth quarter. 
  Since the anticorruption struggle the municipality has 
emphatically investigated and handled the cases violating the 
discipline and law, which have been committed by the leading 
cadres of party and government organs and by the working 
personnel of judicial departments, law enforcement and 
administrative departments, and economic and managerial 
departments. E Zhiqiang, former chairman of the Chaoyang 
district commission for foreign economic relations and trade, 
was dismissed from the party on charges of embezzling public 
funds and accepting bribes worth more than 8,600 yuan during his 
tenure. Chen Zhiwen, former chief procurator of the Changping 
county people's procuratorate, was dismissed from the party on 
charges of demanding and accepting cash and materials worth more 
than 21,000 yuan and embezzling public funds and material worth 
more than 7,400 yuan.

  [Text] Yan Haiwang, secretary of the provincial party 
committee and director of the provincial two-support [the Army 
supporting the government and cherishing the people, while the 
government and people support the Army and provide preferential 
treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs] 
leading group, called and presided over a 23 February provincial 
two-support leading group meeting at which he summed up Gansu's 
two-support work in 1993. 
  Secretary Yan Haiwang delivered a speech in which he stated: 
Over the past year, all localities as well as People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] units stationed across the province have 
carried out in a down-to-earth manner activities to build model 
two-support cities and counties, with the result that Gansu's 
two-support work has made significant headway. Statistics show 
that over the past year, more than 400 cadres at the prefectural 
level and officers at the division level have personally taken 
part in national defense education and propaganda activities. 
During the New Year, the Lunar New Year, and the "1 August Army 
Day" periods, the provincial authorities sent more than 60 
delegations to various border areas and grassroots units across 
the province to extend festival greetings, to express 
appreciation to officers and soldiers who have been stationed 
there for many years, and to help officers and soldiers tackle 
problems concerning war preparations, military training, 
military maneuvers, and daily life. 
  Secretary Yan Haiwang went on: Over the past year, though 
lacking in funds, the provincial civil affairs department has 
managed to allocate some 1.7 million yuan to help demobilized 
officers and soldiers resolve problems concerning livelihood, 
housing, and medical care; has accepted and resettled some 540 
officers who had been transferred to civilian work; and has 
secured jobs for more than 100,000 demobilized officers and 
soldiers. On the other hand, the PLA units stationed in Gansu 
have dispatched more than 800 "cherish-the-people" and 
"learn-from-Lei Feng" teams to various localities to provide 
assistance to local people. Some 0.45 million officers and 
soldiers and more than 9,900 military vehicles have taken part 
in the construction of some 130 local projects on different 
occasions and have helped build more than 200 public utilities. 
The locally stationed PLA troops also have helped deal with 
some 190 local emergencies and have provided unreserved disaster 
relief to the local people, with the result that more than 3,400 
lives and large quantities of public goods and materials were 
saved on some 9,200 occasions. 
  Also attending and speaking at the meeting were Sun Ying, 
Yang Huaixiao, and Du Hua, as well as some other provincial 
party, government, and military leaders.

<F P=106> ["Li Peng and Others Attend Reception for Chinese and </F>
Foreign Journalists" -- Screen caption -- at the Great Hall of 
the People in Beijing on 22 March; from the "Special News 
Program on the Second Session of the Eighth NPC"] 
  [Text] [Moderator Zhou Jue] Friends, comrades: The 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] 
came to a successful conclusion this afternoon. Thank you for 
your positive reports on the session. Today we are very happy 
to invite Premier Li Peng to meet and answer questions from you 
at this reception. Present here are also Vice Premiers Zhu 
Rongji, Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, and Li Lanqing. Now I give the 
floor to Premier Li Peng. [camera shows Li Peng in a close-up 
shot, speaking in a relaxed manner, occasionally glancing at the 
script placed on the table; Li is seen seated at the middle of 
the table, flanked by Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen, Zhou Chengkui and 
Wu Jianmin on his right, and by an unidentified male 
interpreter, Zou Jiahua, Li Lanqing, and Zhou Jue on his left] 
  [Li Peng] The four vice premiers and I are very delighted to 
have the opportunity to attend the reception and to meet 
journalists at the invitation of Comrade Zhou Jue, spokesman for 
the session. Some 1,500 Chinese and foreign journalists have 
covered the two sessions with great enthusiasm. Their reports 
are generally fair and objective, and can help the Chinese 
people as well as the people of the world understand the two 
sessions. Therefore, I want to thank all journalists and media 
personnel who exerted great efforts to cover the sessions. The 
news spokesman for the session has forwarded to me a number of 
questions of general interest to journalists. To save time, I 
would first like to answer a few questions of general interest. 
The first question raised by journalists was whether I was 
satisfied with the results of the session and what I regard as 
the most important achievement of the session. The 
just-concluded NPC session approved a report on the work of the 
government and other reports, as well as a budget law. It 
affirmed the work of the government last year and approved the 
principles and tasks proposed by the government for this year's 
work. At the session, all deputies unanimously approved the 20- 
character principle -- that is, the principle of seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability -- as the guiding 
principle for this year's work. In my opinion, the most 
important achievement of the latest NPC session is the consensus 
reached by deputies on the need to correctly handle the 
relations between reform, development, and stability. We had 
previously discussed the issue of correctly handling relations 
among these three factors. But this is the first time we have 
reached such a consensus. Therefore, I am especially satisfied 
with this unprecedented consensus. The session also gave full 
expression to democracy. Leading comrades of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council as well as State Council 
ministers joined many delegations in discussions, exchanged 
views on state affairs with deputies, and heard criticisms and 
suggestions from them. Both the number of meetings and contacts 
have set an all-time record. Therefore, we may as well say that 
this is a session marked by democracy, pragmatism, unity, and 
courageous advance. 
  Second, commodity prices have increased by a comparatively 
big margin since early this year; some deputies doubted whether 
the rate of price hikes can be kept under 10 percent. I have 
been asked what measures the government will take on this issue. 
  It should be said the government attaches great importance 
to 
maintaining the basic stability of commodity prices. The 
government work report, indeed, proposed to keep the magnitude 
of price hikes under a prescribed range. Now that the report 
has been approved, the governments at all levels must make 
efforts to fulfill the task. It is necessary not only for 
governments but for enterprises and all circles in society as 
well to make joint efforts. It is a common task for everyone 
concerned. There are many reasons for the price hikes. China 
is now in a transition period from a planned economy to a 
socialist market economy. Since the prices set in the past were 
irrational, it is necessary for us to take the initiative to 
readjust prices, to enable a rational price mechanism to take 
shape, and to carry out some readjustments, which will cause 
prices to rise. In addition, the fact that the scale of our 
capital construction is too large and that consumption funding 
is growing too fast constitutes another factor leading to price 
hikes. However, it should be pointed out that we adopted a 
method of progressive price readjustments in more than a decade 
of implementing the policy of reform and opening up. Whenever 
we implemented a price measure, we took into account the ability 
of the state, enterprises, and individuals to withstand the 
impact so that drastic social upheavals would not result. 
Experience has shown that it was correct to adopt such a 
method. We are prepared to adopt the following three important 
measures to maintain basic stability of commodity prices. 
  1. We shall maintain a general balance between the supply of 
and demand for commodities. In particular, efforts will be made 
to maintain a steady increase in the production of grain, 
cotton, and other agricultural products. This is a basis for 
stabilizing prices. Meanwhile, we shall successfully carry out 
the vegetable basket project by implementing a responsibility 
system for city mayors. Besides, judging from the level of 
consumption of urban and rural residents in China, we can see 
that the supply of non-staple food is an issue of greatest 
concern to the vast numbers of residents and a factor that has 
the greatest bearing on the price index. 
  2. Though China decontrolled prices on the overwhelming 
majority of commodities and let the market determine prices, it 
is still necessary to implement macroeconomic regulation and 
control over important commodities that have a bearing on the 
national economy and on the people's livelihood. Macroeconomic 
regulation and control by the government is indispensable to the 
endeavor to establish a socialist market economy. If we were 
unable to reach consensus on the issue in the past, we should 
have reached one through the current session by now. The state 
has decided to list the prices of 20 categories of daily 
necessities and services as the targets for supervision and 
inspection by the state. 
  3. We shall adopt a series of measures to resolutely bring 
the expansion of investments in fixed assets and excessive 
monetary issue under control. 
  Third, I have been asked to assess the outcome of U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher's recent visit to China and to 
express my views on the prospects for Sino-U.S. relations. 
China has always attached importance to its relations with the 
United States, and hopes to resume and expand normal relations 
with the latter. This will not only benefit China and the 
United States, but will also be conducive to world peace and 
development. As to how to improve Sino-U.S. relations, I 
expounded the Chinese Government's views extensively in the 
Government Work Report. Regarding the assessment of Secretary 
of State Christopher's recent visit to China, I think his visit 
was nonetheless fruitful [hai shi you cheng guo di] although we 
had perhaps expected to achieve more results. On top of the 
results that were reflected in the understandings reached on 
some specific issues, I think a very important achievement [hen 
zhong yao di cheng guo] is the enhancement of understanding of 
each other's views through Christopher's talks and meetings with 
President Jiang Zemin, myself, and Vice Premier Qian. We 
exchanged views on a broad range of issues on Sino-U.S. 
relations, as well as international issues. We held frank and 
in-depth discussions [tan shuai di shen ru di tao lun] on human 
rights, the most-favored-nation trading status, MTCR [preceding 
four letters in English -- Missile Technology Control Regime], 
and other issues. It can be said that Christopher obtained 
first-hand information from such meetings and talks, having 
heard directly from the Chinese leaders about the issues he was 
concerned about, and about the stand and views held by the 
Chinese side on such issues. This may help the U.S. side make 
decisions, through careful consideration, over the next couple 
of months that are consistent with the interests of both the 
United States and China. We have noticed what President Clinton 
said on 16 March, and we regard it as a positive sign [ji ji di 
ji xiang]. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to 
reiterate that China is willing to improve Sino-U.S. relations. 
We have made great efforts in this regard and will continue to 
do so. However, there is one matter that I would like to 
clarify. China is a sovereign country, and we certainly will 
not make a deal by sacrificing our principles. In short, we do 
not feel pessimistic about the prospects for Sino-U.S. 
relations. I am finished with the issues that I wanted to 
address on my own. You may now raise some questions and we will 
answer them. 
  [CNN correspondent, in English fading into Mandarin 
translation] China has consistently pressed for solving North 
Korea's nuclear issue through discussions and negotiations. 
Over the past few days, however, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] has accused North Korea of not allowing its 
inspectors to conduct a wide-ranging inspection of its nuclear 
facilities. The matter has now been submitted to the UN 
Security Council. Japan, South Korea, the United States, and 
other countries have expressed concern about North Korea's 
refusal to permit a wide-ranging inspection of its nuclear 
installations. Has China also expressed concern about this 
issue? Under what circumstances will China consider supporting 
the United Nations in imposing sanctions against North Korea? 
  [Li] China is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. We do not support or encourage nuclear proliferation; 
this has been a consistent position. China has always favored 
solving Korea's nuclear inspection issue through negotiations. 
We do not favor the method of applying pressure, because this 
will not help solve the issue. Facts have proven that agreement 
can reached gradually through negotiations after a long period 
during which Korea agreed to inspections after disagreeing to 
them initially. If this matter is submitted to the UN Security 
Council, China will maintain its consistent position -- properly 
solving the issue through dialogue and negotiation -- and will 
not favor applying pressure. Our UN representative will provide 
a full explanation on China's position. We hope other member 
countries of the UN Security Council will accept China's views. 
Adopting the method of applying pressure will only make the 
situation on the Korean peninsula more complicated and tense; 
this will not be conducive to peace and security in the region. 
  [Hong Kong Television Broadcasts correspondent] After the 
breakdown of the Sino-British talks, the Chinese side said that 
it would continue its cooperation with the British side in non- 
political matters. Why was this not mentioned in this year's 
government work report? In the past one or two years, the 
Chinese side has not been cooperative with the British side on 
many issues, making it is difficult for the British Government 
in Hong Kong to govern. Does this mean that the chances for 
cooperation between the two governments in the next three years 
are remote? 
  [Li] As everyone knows, the uncooperative attitude of the 
British side led to the breakdown of the talks on election 
matters between the governments of the two countries. This is a 
development that we, and many far-sighted people and businessmen 
in Britain as well, did not want to see. This correspondent's 
question, as I understand, is whether the current status of 
Sino-British relations will affect Sino-British relations in 
other sectors -- the economic sector, for example. I can tell 
you that China will not adopt any discriminative policy against 
British businesses. We welcome them to come to China to 
participate in fair competition and to cooperate on an equal and 
mutually-beneficial footing. There has been a tradition of 
cooperation between Chinese and British businesses, and such 
cooperation has not been interrupted because of the current 
state of bilateral relations. It should certainly be pointed 
out that sound political and diplomatic relations between the 
two countries will surely help promote economic cooperation and, 
if the two countries do not have good political and diplomatic 
relations, it is impossible for bilateral economic ties not to 
suffer to some extent. The Chinese side is willing to make 
efforts to minimize any negative impact on British businesses 
when they compete in the Chinese market and make investments in 
the country. 
  [DPA correspondent, in English fading into Mandarin 
translation] We know that one of the issues the current NPC 
session has greatly emphasized is social stability. Some 
deputies brought up the subject of threats to stability in their 
discussions. Will this lead China to change its policy of 
reform or slow it down? 
  [Li] I do not fully understand this question. As we said, 
we must correctly handle the relations between reform, 
development, and stability in order to ensure our development 
will be sustained, sound, and fast. Stability is not our goal; 
development is. To develop, we must have stability. Reform 
will serve as a motivating force for development. For this 
reason, we have adopted a series of measures aimed at 
stabilizing society. Such measures will only help with the 
development and advancement of reform. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The GATT working party on China 
just concluded its 16th meeting in Geneva. I would like to ask 
Premier Li Peng: What are your views on the progress of China's 
re- entry into GATT? What are the problems and obstructions? 
In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of 
the resumption of GATT membership regarding China's future 
economic development? 
  [Li] Vice Premier Li Lanqing is in charge of economic and 
trade work, and he is also in charge of the work related to 
China's resumption of GATT membership. I would like to ask 
Comrade Lanqing to answer this question. 
  [Li Lanqing] Generally speaking, major progress was made 
during the 16th round of negotiations on China's resumption of 
its contracting party status in GATT. The overwhelming majority 
of GATT contracting parties -- except for one contracting member 
-- have supported, not just in words but in action, an early 
resumption of China's GATT membership. 
  China's re-entry into GATT would be good for China's reform, 
opening up, and economic development. China has become the 
world's 11th largest trader. China's re-entry into GATT will 
make significant contributions toward a healthy development of 
global trade. China will, as always, continue further 
negotiations with other contracting parties with a positive 
approach and in accordance with the principle of balance between 
rights and obligations. It should be pointed out that the 
European Community and other contracting parties have already 
put forward a draft protocol on China's re-entry into GATT, and 
other contracting parties have also had discussions with China. 
  Regrettably, there is one contracting party obstructing 
China's re-entry into GATT. I would especially like to point 
out that this contracting party is exactly the one that has, in 
a bilateral agreement with us, specifically pledged firm support 
for China's resumption of its contracting party status in GATT. 
We hope that the contracting party will implement its solemn 
commitment so as to change the obstructionist impression it left 
at the meeting, and to advance China's re-entry into GATT. 
Thank you.

<F P=106> [Speech by Chairman Qiao Shi at the closing of the Second </F>
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress in Beijing on 
22 March] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- Deputies: 
  Thanks to the common efforts by you all, the Second Session 
of the Eighth National People's Congress, having completed all 
the items on its agenda, has come to a successful conclusion. 
  During the session you deputies, proceeding from the 
national 
interest as a whole and from the fundamental interests of the 
people, earnestly performed the functions entrusted to you by 
the constitution. By emancipating the mind and seeking truth 
from facts, we discussed state affairs and spoke our minds 
freely. Consequently, the resolutions adopted at the session 
fully reflect the will and inspiration of the people of all 
nationalities throughout the country. This session demonstrated 
the great unity of people of all nationalities across the 
country as well as their confidence in the success of reform and 
development. This session is one of democracy, unity, 
truth-seeking, realism, and pioneering spirit. This session 
will certainly have great significance in advancing the 
socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist 
spiritual civilization in an all-round manner, with economic 
construction as the central task. 
  This session examined and approved Premier Li Peng's 
government work report as well as other reports, and adopted the 
basic policy and fundamental tasks of the state in 1994. We 
must uphold Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics as our guidance, unswervingly 
uphold the party's basic line, fully implement the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, and carry out the various 
resolutions and decisions adopted by the current session. It is 
imperative to seize current favorable international and domestic 
opportunities; to accelerate the establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure; and to achieve a sustained, rapid, 
and healthy growth of China's economy. We must also maintain 
political stability and promote all-round social progress. All 
kinds of work in China must comply with and serve the central 
task for 1994. We must correctly handle relations between 
reform, development, and stability. We must strive to push 
ahead with reform and development amid stability, and achieve 
social stability as well as the country's long-term stability 
through reform and development. 
  This year is an important one for China's economic 
restructuring because many new reform measures will be announced 
and put into practice. The task will be formidable. We must 
work cautiously and conscientiously, spare no efforts, develop 
careful and well-thought-out plans, and do solid work in 
ensuring the smooth implementation of these reform measures. It 
is necessary to further emancipate the mind; conduct everything 
in line with specific conditions; dare to explore new ways; dare 
to act; sum up our experience in a timely fashion; and properly 
resolve contradictions and problems arising in the course of 
implementing reform measures so as to perfect various reform 
measures. Localities and departments must have the overall 
interest in mind; correctly handle relations between the central 
government and localities as well as between overall and partial 
interests; subject themselves to the state's overall plan of 
reform and development; and be effective at implementing the 
principles and policies of the central government in the light 
of their specific conditions. They must do a good job in 
publicizing and explaining reform so all the reform measures 
will be fully understood and supported by the masses. So long 
as we are united ideologically and work as one, we will be able 
to achieve the hoped-for goals of reform. 
  It is imperative to strengthen socialist democracy and 
legality in order to meet the needs of a socialist market 
economic system and the modernization drive. We must work hard 
to build socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics, 
further perfect the system of people's congresses, and guarantee 
the rights of the masses as masters of the country. It is 
necessary to quicken the pace of economic legislation and use 
laws to guide, promote, and ensure the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure and the progress of various 
undertakings. The Standing Committee of the Eighth NPC has 
adopted a five-year legislative program. We must earnestly 
organize people to carry it out and attempt to complete the 
general framework of laws governing the development of a 
socialist market economy during its term. People's congresses 
at all levels and their standing committees must increase 
inspection and supervision over law enforcement; must put a stop 
to the non-observance and lax implementation of laws; and must 
ensure that law breakers are not allowed to go unpunished in 
order to safeguard the dignity of laws, to establish the 
authority of laws, and to ensure that reform, opening up, and 
the modernization drive will advance along the track of 
socialist legality in a sound manner. 
  The question utmost in the people's minds when the session 
is 
over is implementation. All kinds of work must proceed from the 
interests of the people; they must assist in freeing and 
developing productive forces, in increasing China's 
comprehensive strength, and in improving the people's standard 
of living. Government departments and functionaries at all 
levels must change their style of work, conduct investigations, 
go deeply into the realities of life, solicit people's views, 
and be concerned about their well- being. They should never 
treat lightly matters of immediate concern to the people, and 
should solve each and every one of those matters. It is 
imperative to oppose bureaucracy and boasting, and to do away 
with formalism. We should do away with meetings and documents 
that do not solve problems; we should never be content to merely 
issue general calls for action; we must not make empty talk and 
platitudes; and we must not report only good news and not the 
bad. More importantly, we should permit no lies. We should 
perform our official duties honestly and diligently in order to 
serve the people. We should work in a down-to-earth manner, 
immerse ourselves in hard work, rely on the masses, and carry 
out our work creatively. 
  After this session is over, the deputies will go back to 
their posts. It is hoped you will actively publicize and 
implement the guidelines as well as the various resolutions and 
decisions adopted by the session; will conscientiously perform 
your functions as NPC deputies; will set an example in abiding 
by the Constitution and the law; and will plunge yourselves into 
the great practice of reform and construction. 
  Deputies! China is advancing along the path of socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. Under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, people of all 
nationalities throughout the country must rally closely around 
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its 
nucleus; must work with one heart and one mind; must display the 
spirit of plain living and hard struggle; and must strive to 
establish a socialist market economic system and turn China into 
a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and 
modern socialist country by the end of the century. 
  Deputies! I now declare the Second Session of the Eighth NPC 
has come to a successful close.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Chen Jinhua, minister 
in charge of China's State Planning Commission, said here today 
that China is giving priority to the development of energy 
industry in drafting its next five-year plan -- the ninth -- and 
a long-term industrial policy. 
  Speaking today at a China petroleum investment conference 
being held here, he said that in the medium to long-term plan, 
China will "take coal as the basis and electric power the focus 
in developing energy resources." 
  At the same time, he said, it is necessary to make great 
efforts to develop fine quality, relatively clean energy sources 
such as oil and natural gas. 
  More than 300 world oil leaders, senior executives, bankers 
and experts attended the two-day conference, the highest ranking 
of its kind so far held in China. 
  Chen said that in order to ensure an average annual growth 
rate of 8-9 percent for China's national economy in the 1990s, 
developing and conserving energy should be equally stressed. 
  By maintaining the energy saving rate at the average annual 
level of 3.6 percent during the 1980s, China's annual energy 
consumption increase in the coming years will be kept below 4 
percent, he added. 
  The minister said that by the year 2000, China is expected 
to 
produce 160-170 million tons of oil and some 30 billion cubic 
meters of natural gas. Last year the production of oil was 150 
million tons and that of natural gas was 16 billion cubic meters. 
  Meanwhile, Chen said, China's electric power output is 
continuing to grow at an average annual rate of more than 8 
percent in the 1990s, with power generating capacity increasing 
by about 15 million kilowatts each year. 
  He pledged that the government will help create a more 
favorable climate for the development of the energy industry 
through deepened reforms and greater openness. 
  China has lifted controls over coal pricing and is adjusting 
the prices of electric power to ensure a reasonable return for 
investors. The prices of oil and natural gas will be gradually 
brought in line with those on the international markets. 
  Chen said that state-owned large and medium-sized energy 
enterprises, the main body of China's energy industry, should be 
introduced to the modern corporate system through a change-over 
of the management mechanism, in order to develop even better in 
a market economy. 
  He said that state development banks will grant preferential 
loans to accelerate the construction of the energy industry. In 
addition, he said, initiatives should be taken to attract local 
funds and socially idle funds to energy investment, by forming 
joint ventures and share-holding companies. 
  He said that the Chinese Government will continue to 
encourage and support the energy industry to open wider to the 
outside world and welcomes international investors to enter 
fields such as onshore oil, offshore oil, petrochemicals, 
electric power and coal. 
  The participants discussed issues concerning joint and 
cooperative exploration of China's oil and natural gas resources 
and voiced their views at the forum aimed to increase 
understanding and exchange information. 
  The conference, sponsored by the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and 
China's four oil and petrochemical giants, ended here today.

<F P=106> ["Eighth Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee </F>
Holds Eighth Session" -- ANHUI RIBAO headline] 
  [Text] The Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress 
Standing Committee began its eighth five-day session on 22 
February in Hefei. 
  Meng Fulin, chairman of the provincial people's congress 
Standing Committee, presided over a plenary meeting on the 
morning of 22 February. Present at the meeting were Vice 
Chairmen of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee 
Shao Ming, Liu Guangcai, Lu Shengdao, Wu Changqi, Lu Zixiu, 
Jiang Zehui, and Chen Jiyu as well as Secretary-General Lu 
Desheng. Present as non-voting delegates were Wang Yang, vice 
governor of Anhui; Han Yunping, president of the provincial 
higher people's court; Liu Sheng, chief procurator of the 
provincial people's procuratorate; and persons in charge of city 
and county people's congress Standing Committees and perfectural 
people's congress Liaison Committees. 
  The meeting heard explanations by Jiang Dexin, vice chairman 
of the Rural Economic Work Committee of the provincial people's 
congress Standing Committee, and by Hou Yukun, vice chairman of 
the Legislative Affairs Committee of the provincial people's 
congress Standing Committee, on revision of the drafts of the 
"Regulations of Anhui Province for Handling Disputes Over Land 
Use Rights" and the "Regulations of Anhui Province on the 
Protection of Minors" respectively. 
  Zheng Zikuan, director of the provincial Department of 
Agriculture, explained the draft of the "Procedures of Anhui 
Province for Implementing the `Agrotechnique Diffusion Law'" on 
behalf of the provincial people's government. He said: The 
utility rate of agrotechnical achievements is low, and many 
major agrotechnical achievements have not yet been widely used 
in Anhui Province. This has become a major factor impeding 
further development of Anhui's agriculture and rural economy. 
For this reason, it is necessary for us to sum up our own 
practical experience, learn from others' experience of success 
both at home and abroad, and formulate local regulations for 
agrotechnical diffusion which suit the conditions of this 
province so as to ensure sustained agricultural development and 
rural prosperity in this province. 
  Huang Rongzong, vice chairman of the Financial and Economic 
Committee of the provincial people's congress Standing 
Committee, explained the drafts of four regulations and 
provisions concerning the Wuhu Economic and Technological 
Development Zone. He stated: Since its promulgation, the 
"Regulations on the Wuhu Economic and Technological Development 
Zone," adopted by the sixth session of the provincial people's 
congress Standing Committee, has played a guiding, promoting, 
and protecting role. However, the "regulations" deal more with 
principles. In view of the current situation and 
contradictions, we are urgently in need of more clear and 
definite legislation governing land management, the sale and 
transfer of land use rights, construction planning, project 
examination and approval, enterprise registration, and labor 
management in foreign-funded enterprises. The new legislation 
will certainly promote further development of the economic and 
technological development zone, improve the investment 
environment there, improve the rules and regulations for the 
development zone, and accelerate the process of attracting 
foreign investment in the development zone. 
  The revised draft of the "Regulations of Anhui Province for 
Handling Disputes Over Land Use Rights" was examined and 
discussed at small group meetings in the afternoon.

  [Text] Jerusalem, March 16 (CNA) -- The Taiwan delegation 
to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
(CITES) Asian region meeting Wednesday [16 March] distributed 
pamphlets to conference delegates detailing Taiwan's 
environmental protection efforts. 
  The pamphlets featured a report published in the US magazine 
THE EARTH TIMES which came out in support of Taiwan's 
environmental protection programs and raised the ire of British 
Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) official Peter Knights. 
  Knights argued that the report, which quoted a Taiwan 
Government official as saying the EIA has misrepresented 
Taiwan's trade in endangered species parts, was written without 
consultations with his organization. 
  Knights added that the EIA would call for sanctions against 
Taiwan for its alleged trade in rhino horns and tiger parts 
during the forthcoming CITES Standing Committee meeting. 
  Li San-wei, deputy director of the Taiwan Council of 
Agriculture's Forestry Department and leader of the Taiwan 
delegation to the CITES regional meeting, said that the threats 
by EIA will increase the pressure on Taiwan. 
  The CITES Asian region meeting opened in Jerusalem on March 
15. It will be followed by a CITES Standing Committee meeting in 
Geneva on March 21 during which Standing Committee members will 
vote on whether to impose sanctions against Taiwan and other 
countries.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese side 
should rely more on Hong Kong compatriots in achieving a smooth 
transition of the territory, especially when the Sino-British 
cooperation has been sabotaged by the British side. 
  Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong 
Kong Branch, made the above remarks here today at a meeting 
attended by some newly-appointed Hong Kong district affairs 
advisors. 
  Recently the Chinese side has appointed 274 local residents 
as its advisors on district affairs in the territory. 
Appointment of these advisors is mainly designed to help China 
solicit opinions and advices from local residents on the Hong 
Kong issue. 
  Zheng encouraged these newly-appointed advisors to 
participate actively in activities which are conducive to the 
smooth transition of Hong Kong so as to create a good condition 
for the smooth transfer of power in the territory in 1997. 
  During the meeting, Zheng also briefed them on the recent 
breakdown of the Sino-British talks over the 1994-95 electoral 
arrangements in the territory. 
  He said that the political reform bill which the British 
side 
has adhered to is in violation of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the Basic Law and the agreements and understandings 
reached between the two countries. 
  The real intention of the British side, he continued, was to 
create obstacles for the smooth transition of Hong Kong during 
its remaining administration days by stirring up discords and 
chaos in the territory under the disguise of democracy. 
  At the meeting, many district affairs advisors expressed 
their willingness to actively cooperate with the Chinese side to 
ensure a smooth transition of Hong Kong and maintain its 
long-term prosperity and stability.

<F P=106> [CHINA DAILY commentary: "Three-Prong Strategy"] </F>
  [Text] A keynote of the deliberations in the sessions of 
the National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] is the correct 
handling of the relationships between reform, development, and 
stability, that is, to strike a balance of the three so that 
they will promote each other. 
  Participants at the sessions share the view that stability 
is 
a prerequisite of reform and development for, without political 
and social stability, nothing can be achieved. 
  On the other hand, reform and development constitute the 
groundwork of stability for, unless reform and development are 
pushed forward vigorously, stability can hardly be firm and 
enduring. 
  The economy has developed remarkably fast in the last two 
years. Meanwhile, however, the inflationary pressures have 
mounted and bottlenecks have formed in certain fields. 
Therefore, the planned growth rate for this year has been 
reduced to 9 percent from last year's 13.4 percent. 
  This cut is necessary because painful experience in the past 
has taught us that growth, when it comes too fast, without 
regard to economic laws and with no real benefit, is false 
growth that will eventually become a burden. 
  Development must be steady and healthy with a 
well-coordinated and rational industrial structure and an 
efficient mechanism for economic operations. 
  Several essential reform measures in key economic sectors 
have already been introduced. Their impact will certainly be 
strong and far reaching. 
  These reforms are being carried out as the economy continues 
to grow fast. They should constitute a great driving force for 
development rather than a hindrance. We should always be on the 
alert and take prompt action to iron out any problems that may 
crop up. 
  It is clear that a stable political and social climate must 
be maintained if the aforesaid reform measures are to be 
implemented smoothly. 
  Participants in the NPC and CPPCC sessions have offered 
valuable suggestions to ensure the success of this year's 
reforms and consolidate the country's present stable scene. 
Several issues have drawn their intensive attention. 
  Last year while the income of urban residents increased 10.2 
percent, that of their rural brothers increased only 3.2 
percent. This shows the rural people are at a great disadvantage. 
  Price hikes and inflation immediately affect the lives of 
the 
people, particularly those in towns and cities. 
  The government has adopted concrete measures to combat 
inflation and rein in prices. 
  The recent decision to monitor and strengthen supervision of 
prices for 20 basic necessities and service items for the people 
is an apt example. 
  Then there is the issue of corruption. The crackdown on 
corruption has been given much publicity since last year and has 
so far achieved notable results. This has enhanced the image of 
the Party and the government in the eyes of the people at large. 
  However, corruption is still a serious problem and resented 
by the man in the street. There must be no let-up in the fight 
against corruption and for a clean government. 
  A proper settlement of these and some other issues will 
provide, by and large, a stable environment for the 
accomplishment of this year's tasks. 
  We believe the blueprint mapped out by the NPC and CPPCC 
sessions will win wholehearted support of the whole nation and 
we hope 1994 will be a fruitful year for China's economic 
development and drive towards a socialist market economy.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 KYODO -- Chinese authorities 
released activist Tong Zeng on Tuesday [22 March] from five days 
of detention after demanding compensation for civilian victims 
of the war with Japan, reliable sources said. 
  Tong is a long-time activist in a movement which saw 
hundreds 
of elderly victims come to Beijing to petition Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. He was taken from his Beijing home 
by police last Friday, one day before Hosokawa arrived for a 
three-day visit to China, one source said. 
  Authorities detained at least 100 of the victims in front of 
the Japanese embassy in Beijing on Friday as they came to 
deliver letters to Hosokawa demanding compensation and a public 
apology for Japanese war crimes. 
  The release of Tong and others detained by police for 
related 
activities was the focus of an open letter to China's National 
People's Congress on Monday. The letter was signed by 500 
Chinese intellectuals. 
  In a related development, Gao Hongmin, a government official 
detained Monday for allegedly planning to distribute political 
leaflets in Tiananmen Square, was also released after undergoing 
four hours of interrogation by police. Gao returned to work 
Tuesday.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist 
Party and Chinese president, called for attaching importance to 
family planning work so as to contribute to China's economic and 
social development. 
  At a national family planning forum sponsored by the State 
Council, Jiang urged local governments to make efforts to 
realize plans to control population growth and to raise family 
planning work to a new height. 
  Premier Li Peng and other Chinese leaders Qiao Shi, Li 
Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao attended the 
forum. 
  After analyzing China's population situation, Jiang said 
that 
while the achievements in family planning work have been 
confirmed, the task of China's family planning work remains 
arduous. 
  He pointed out that China's family planning policy is based 
on the Marxist theory that population growth must fit in with 
the production of materials and therefore is a correct policy 
decision in line with China's basic conditions. 
  He said that now there is a viewpoint that under the market 
economic structure, population control should also be regulated 
by the market. 
  He noted that the viewpoint is incorrect. The family 
planning policy is decided by China's basic conditions and the 
demands of socialist modernization. 
  He said that the problem of a huge population coupled with 
underdeveloped production will result in a series of problems in 
food supply and education. 
  He said that even though China's population has ceased to 
grow, the huge size of the present population will continue to 
last for a period. 
  He said that if China does not carry out the family planning 
policy, the uncontrolled growth of the population will produce 
an adverse effect on economic development and the interests of 
both the state and individuals. 
  He stressed that under the circumstances of establishing a 
socialist market economic structure, population control is a 
function of the government and the attempt to regulate 
population growth through the market cannot realize China's plan 
for population growth. 
  He called for mobilizing the people in family planning work. 
It is every citizen's obligation and contribution to the state 
and society to abide by the family planning policy. 
  He urged officials and party members to take the lead in 
carrying out the family planning policy. 
  Jiang said that this year the CPC Central Committee will 
take 
measures to enhance the construction of the party organization 
in rural areas. The family planning work will be one of the 
elements in appraising the party's work in rural areas. 
  Jiang also talked about study of the population policy and 
measures for promoting family planning work. 
  Premier Li Peng said that the key to family planning work is 
in rural areas and he stressed conducting family planning work 
among the floating population.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Fresh Call for Family Planning"] </F>
  [Text] China will not change its policy on population 
control, declared the country's top family planning official, 
State Councillor Peng Peiyun. 
  The country's birth rate was stable last year compared with 
the previous year, which is an encouraging sign. However, Peng 
warned government officials not to feel complacent over last 
year's success. 
  Peng made the remarks on Sunday at the opening of the 
National Family Planning Work Conference in Beijing. 
  Statistics from the State Family Planning Commission showed 
that last year, China registered a birth rate of 18.09 per 
1,000, despite a surge in the number of women entering 
childbearing age. 
  Women in the 20 to 29 age group topped 121 million last 
year, 
just 1.13 million fewer than the peak in 1992. 
  However, both the country's overall birth rate and the 
natural growth rate of the population last year held steady with 
the previous year -- considering the allowable margin of error 
in the annual census. 
  Last year's birth rate was 18.09 per 1,000 and the natural 
growth rate was 11.45 per 1,000. The corresponding figures for 
1992 were 18.24 and 11.6 per 1,000. 
  By the end of last year, the Chinese population had reached 
1,185 million, a net increase of 13.46 million from a year ago. 
  The birth rate in 10 provinces and municipalities, including 
Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, has dropped to below 15 per 1,000. 
  The rate for minority ethnic groups also went down to below 
22 per 1,000. 
  Peng attributed the success to enhanced leadership in the 
government's family planning work and improved services in urban 
neighborhoods and rural villages. 
  She said that she believed the current economic reform has 
encouraged more people to have fewer children in order to have 
more flexibility for better jobs and a higher living standard. 
  The country still faces severe population problems in the 
next few years, cautioned Peng, who is also Minister of the 
State Family Planning Com mission. 
  Peng said the country's family planning policy, aimed at 
controlling rapid population growth and improving the people's 
physical quality, suits China's basic conditions and serves the 
interests of the whole nation. 
  The current family planning policy encourages urban families 
to have only one child. Rural families, however, may have a 
second child if they already have one girl and need additional 
help in their families. The policy is more flexible for ethnic 
minorities. 
  Peng stressed that controlling population in the rural areas 
remains the critical point in the country's family planning 
programme. 
  She also urged governments at different levels to increase 
their input into the national family planning programme. 
  The family planning service in villages should be improved 
to 
include education facilities and the distribution of 
contraceptives. Village services also should provide premarital 
physical examinations and health care services for babies and 
women.

  [Text] Kunming, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Officials of the 
World Health Organization (WHO) said the cooperation with the 
Chinese Government in implementing the woman-child health care 
and planned parenthood program in poverty-stricken areas is 
"pleasing and fruitful". 
  One of the biggest cooperative programs between the Chinese 
Government and international organizations ever, the program 
started in 1990 has witnessed remarkable progress in improving 
the health and nutrition of pregnant women and little children. 
  Some 120 million people, nearly one-ninth of the country's 
population, in about 300 poverty-stricken counties all over 
China have benefited from the program. 
  Official sources said that by the end of this year, the 
death 
rates of pregnant women and little children in those counties 
will have been reduced by some 20 percent from rates in 1990. 
  A 1990 survey showed that the death rate for children in 108 
of those 300 counties reached more than 68.02 per thousand, and 
the maternal mortality rate was even higher in some half of the 
project counties. 
  According to the survey, in those poor counties, pneumonia, 
diarrhea and asphyxia are the main killers of little children, 
while two-thirds of the pregnant women die of puerperal 
infection and ante partum hemorrhage. 
  Scheduled to conclude in 1995, the program is aimed at 
reducing death rates of mothers and children by improving and 
expanding primary health care services in the remote and poor 
districts. 
  With the help of the United Nations Children's Fund, the 
United Nations Population Fund and the World Health 
Organization, Chinese Governments at all levels have trained 
more than 120,000 village and county doctors in the latest 
practical methods of treating deadly diseases and in preventive 
health care. 
  According to statistics offered by the Ministry of Public 
Health, from 1990 to 1993, those international organizations 
have invested some 24 million U.S. dollars to improve the 
village and county health care centers as well as anti-epidemic 
institutes in the 300 project counties. 
  Meanwhile, governments at all levels in those districts have 
poured some 47 million yuan into buying medical instruments for 
those grassroots health care centers. 
  Official sources said that at the beginning of this year, 
the 
international organizations had decided to prolong the program 
for a few years more and had increased the number of the project 
counties to 305. 
  Though China has a large population living in 
poverty-stricken areas, officials from the international 
organizations said that they believed that the program will be 
able to realize its objective of `everyone enjoying free health 
care from the year 2000' through continued hard work.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Boom Towns Bring Relief For Surplus </F>
Rural Force"] 
  [Text] China's surplus rural labour force is finding work 
and a better standard of living in the many new townships and 
small cities sprouting up in the countryside and development of 
these jurisdictions should be encouraged, a top official said. 
  "The boom of rural townships has greatly helped boost local 
economic and social development," said Minister of Construction 
Hou Jie yesterday. 
  He spoke at a national meeting held by the ministry, in 
which 
25 rural township heads from around the country were invited to 
be advisers on rural township construction. 
  The rapid development of rural reform over the past years 
has 
brought an unprecedented surge of townships and small cities in 
the country's vast rural areas. 
  Some 40,000 villages have expanded to become towns since 
1978, when China launched its reform drive in rural areas, 
according to ministry sources. 
  Another 14,500 small or medium cities have also sprung up, 
with their own administrative, cultural, and economic 
structures, modern public services and advanced living 
facilities. In 1979, there were only 2,850 such entities--most 
of them established by the government. 
  The newly-emerged towns have accommodated more than 150 
million residents, of whom 100 million are former farmers. 
  Most of the new towns have been founded on the success of 
rural industry, especially in economically developed rural areas 
such as south China's Pearl River Delta, east China's Yangtze 
[Chang Jiang] River Delta, and the Jiaodong and Liaodong 
Peninsulas. 
  In East China's Anhui Province, some 40 new rural towns have 
mushroomed in recent years. 
  Hou pointed out that these boom towns play an important role 
in absorbing the excessive rural labour force, furthering the 
rural market economy, and helping to restructure and reform 
rural production. 
  The development of small towns also means residents can 
enjoy 
improved living conditions with more roads, water supply 
facilities, communications and other public service facilities, 
and special districts for industry and commerce, Hou said. 
  The towns have increasingly become political, economic, 
cultural, scientific and technological, educational, and 
information centres in the country's rural areas, said the 
minister.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (AFP)--China sought to reassure 
investors Thursday of Hong Kong's long-term stability following 
the decision by the territory's oldest trading house to 
discontinue its listing on the local stock exchange. 
  Foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin also reiterated 
pledges 
that Beijing would not discriminate against British companies 
because of a dispute over Hong Kong's electoral reform -- while 
hinting that the government could not eliminate all the row's 
"adverse effects" on business. 
  Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., which has been the target of 
Beijing's wrath because of its support for Governor Chris 
Patten's democratic reform package, announced Wednesday it would 
leave the exchange from December 31, 1994 -- exactly 2-1/2 years 
before the British colony reverts to China. 
  "It is a matter for Jardines to decide whether it will end 
its listing on the Hong Kong market," Wu told a weekly news 
briefing. "As for the future of Hong Kong and the stability and 
prosperity of Hong kong, not only the Chinese side but the large 
number of investors abroad are confident in this regard," he 
said. "That's why so many investors have entered the Hong Kong 
market." 
  Jardines chairman Henry Keswick said in a statement 
Wednesday 
the move was not related to concerns about Hong Kong's future 
but to the Bermuda-registered group's failure to get exemption 
from the local takeover code. 
  Wu reiterated Premier Li Peng's recent pledges not to block 
British companies from the booming Chinese market but added that 
Britain's "non-cooperative attitude" on political issues had 
taken its toll on Sino-British cooperation. "The Chinese side 
wishes to reduce as far as possible the adverse affects of this 
issue on the conduct of business activities by British 
companies," he said. 
  China attracted widespread criticism last month after it 
warned that British interests would suffer as a result of the 
Hong Kong legislature's adoption of the first part of Patten's 
reform package. 
  Legislators are expected to adopt the second and final stage 
of the reforms by mid-year, despite Beijing's vow to scrap the 
changes and stage fresh elections in 1997 in accordance with its 
own, as yet unspecified, criteria.

<F P=106> [By the LIEN HO PAO news team] </F>
  [Text] Li Peng, the premier of mainland China, will visit 
Mongolia and four former Soviet republics in Central Asia in 
late April. Li Peng originally planned to visit the five 
countries in the summer of 1993, but the visit was postponed for 
health reasons. It is said that the nationality issue will be 
the main subject to be discussed during the upcoming visit. 
  The Republic of Mongolia [as published] attaches importance 
to Li Peng's visit. Senior Mongolian officials will visit 
Beijing in early April to discuss the arrangements for Li Peng's 
visit with the mainland Chinese authorities. Although the 
Mainland Chinese authorities recognize Mongolia's independent 
status, few senior Chinese officials have visited Mongolia in 
the past, and Mongolia has always kept a wary eye on China. Li 
Peng's visit will be the first visit by a Chinese premier to 
Mongolia, and this is of great significance for Mongolia. 
  In the Cold War period, Mongolia survived amid the balance 
of 
the two great powers, the Soviet Union and mainland China. 
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's 
influence in Mongolia decreased, and mainland China's influence 
gradually increased. In recent years, large numbers of Chinese 
people entered Mongolia, and this gave the Mongolian authorities 
cause for serious concern, as they feared that Beijing might 
increase its control over Mongolia along with the increasing 
Chinese immigrants to the country. 
  On the other hand, Mongolia needs mainland China's 
cooperation in the field of economic development. For example, 
the Tumen Jiang Development Project -- which incorporates the 
joint participation of mainland China, Russia, Japan, and North 
and South Korea -- will give Mongolia an important opportunity 
to seek a maritime outlet for its inland economy, and Mongolia 
has consistently been enthusiastic about the project. 
  Li Peng will also visit four Central Asian republics of the 
former Soviet Union, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and 
Uzbekistan. In recent years, radical Muslim movements have been 
prevailing in various Central Asian countries and have had a 
major impact on China's Muslim-inhabited areas. There have been 
increasing conflicts between Muslims and Han people in China, 
and Chinese Muslims have developed stronger separatist ideas. 
Reportedly, during his visit, Li Peng will discuss this issue 
with leaders of the Central Asian countries and will try to seek 
a way to check communication between radical Muslims in Central 
Asia and Muslims within China.

"`Honeymoon Is Over, Marriage Still Exists' -- Changing 
U.S.-Russian Relations"] 
  [Text] Washington (RENMIN RIBAO) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher concluded his visit to Asia on 14 March. On 
his way home, he stopped over in Vladivostok, a Russian city on 
the east coast, and met with Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev. 
Although both sides stressed their bilateral relations had 
become mature and had withstood recent tests, they also admitted 
that differences were unavoidable and they had yet to improve 
their cooperation. According to reports here, Christopher warned 
Russia against taking actions alone on issues in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Middle East, but Kozthez insisted 
that Russia must not be excluded from the process of 
deliberating on international affairs and complained that 
Russia's cooperation with the United States in foreign affairs 
did not bring any substantial benefit to Russia. 
  The less-than-friendly exchange [jiao feng 0074 6912] 
between 
the two foreign ministers was an inevitable result of the 
changes in U.S.-Russian relations. 
  For a certain period, leading Russian politicians continued 
to stress the need to safeguard Russia's national and state 
interests and to play a leading role in international affairs. 
Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev recently made it plain that 
Russia was "facing the task of resolutely, and even toughly in 
some aspects, safeguarding and developing our interests," and 
should "reinforce its status on the international stage." At 
the same time, Russia changed certain practices it pursued in 
previous years and took a series of diplomatic initiatives. 
  In order to contend for the dominating power in the 
political 
settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, Russia took the 
initiative in getting involved in the issue early this year. 
When the United States and its West European allies issued an 
ultimatum to the Serbs in Bosnia, Russia not only opposed the 
Western plan for launching air strikes against the Serbs, but 
also persuaded the Serbs to withdraw from the vicinity of 
Sarajevo and hand over their heavy weapons. Russia then 
dispatched its own peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. Recently, 
when the Croatians and the Muslims in Bosnia reached an 
agreement on establishing a federation in Washington, Russia 
summoned the Serb leaders to Moscow almost at the same time to 
discuss corresponding steps. In addition, Russia not only 
strongly opposed NATO's eastward expansion, but also put forth 
the "pan-European security conception" in order to check and 
balance the "peace partnership" initiated by the United States. 
In Middle East affairs, Russia also showed a positive attitude 
toward participation in the process of peace. After Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozthev met with PLO Chairman 'Arafat in 
Tunisia, Moscow announced that `Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Rabin had been invited to visit Russia in order to seek 
a breakthrough in the impasse in Palestinian-Israeli relations. 
  Russia also became tougher when dealing with its relations 
with the United States, and this caused concern and apprehension 
in the United States. After the Ames spy case was exposed, the 
Russian Government rejected the United States' demand to recall 
the Russian diplomat in charge of intelligence affairs, and then 
took corresponding action after the United States expelled the 
Russian diplomat. During former U.S. President Nixon's visit to 
Russia, President Yeltsin refused to meet him on the grounds 
that Nixon had met with the opposition leaders. This move was 
viewed here as "making it hot" for the Americans. In view of 
the United States' activities of drawing some former USSR 
republics over to its side and forcing Russia to withdraw troops 
from the Baltic countries, Russia reiterated that it had the 
right and duty to interfere in affairs in the "close neighbors 
outside its territory." The appearance of the above-mentioned 
situation made people in the United States think that relations 
between the two countries had become frigid, and were 
"undergoing the most serious crisis since the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union." THE WASHINGTON POST said that "the Russian bear 
has awoke." Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev used a figure of 
speech: "The honeymoon is over, but the marriage remains in a 
good condition." 
  According to analysis by the mass media here, the changes in 
the political situation after the Russian parliamentary election 
constituted the major reason for certain changes in its foreign 
policy. The radical economic reform scheme, which was called 
"shock therapy," was set back, and Russia did not actually 
benefit from the assistance promises made by the United States 
and the West. This forced the Russian authorities to adjust its 
foreign policy by making themselves farther distant from the 
United States and trying harder to safeguard Russia's status and 
influence as a big power. 
  The mass media here held that, although the United States 
recently kept a wary eye on the changes in Russia's foreign 
policy, it still continued to stabilize U.S.-Russian relations 
and took this as a major component of its efforts to play a 
"global leading role." For its own interests, Russia also needs 
to cooperate with the United States in some fields and to 
maintain the lukewarm "partnership." 
  In order to patch up relations with Russia, U.S. Secretary 
of 
Defense Perry [as published] recently visited Moscow. Before he 
set off, he indicated that the United States would pursued a 
dual policy. On the one hand, it would promote Russia's 
positive developments through various types of cooperation; on 
the other hand, it would prepare for Russia's adoption of a 
policy hostile to the West.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Hata's Busy Day in Moscow"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata left here for home after ending a busy 
Monday [21 March] of activity and his three-day Moscow visit. 
  Hata met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in 
the morning and later held talks with his Russian Counterpart 
Andrey Kozyrev. He also met with state Duma (lower house of 
parliament) Chairman Ivan Rybkin in the afternoon. 
  Discussing the outcome of his talks with Russian leaders in 
the final day of his visit, the Japanese minister confirmed that 
the two sides had agreed to promote economic cooperation. 
  Japan will grant Russia a credit of 200 million U.S. dollars 
through the export-import bank for the construction of a 
fiber-optic communication line between Moscow and Russia's far 
eastern city of Khabarovsk. 
  Hata told Russian leaders that Japan will aid Russia in 
creating a number of training centers for market reforms in 
Moscow and the Far East, and for developing oil and gas fields 
on the Sakhalin shelf. 
  He also said that Japan, together with the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, will establish a 50 million 
dollar fund for aiding Russia's medium-sized and small 
enterprises. 
  Moreover, the two sides agreed in principle to hold defense 
and security exchanges, stressing that cooperation between Tokyo 
and Moscow will have a "favorable impact" not only on the Asia 
Pacific region, but also on the rest of the world. 
  Both sides shared the views on the current "alarming 
situation" caused by the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula, 
and said they stand for making the region a nuclear-free zone. 
  After their meeting, both Hata and Kozyrev told reporters 
they had "detailed and constructive talks on a broad spectrum of 
bilateral problems and some international issues, "stressing 
that Japan and Russia have developed "very good relations." 
  However, the long dispute over the northern territory issue 
was only touched upon and no progress was made. 
  "We do not avoid discussions on these problems," Kozyrev 
said, adding that these issues will be thoroughly discussed at 
future meetings on the basis of the "Tokyo declaration" signed 
during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. 
  The Japanese minister pointed out that in order to improve 
bilateral relations it is necessary to conclude a peace treaty 
and resolve the territorial dispute as soon as possible. 
  He called for a step by step advance toward a settlement of 
the territorial dispute. 
  Chernomyrdin told Hata during their morning talks that 
Russia 
"will not act with haste" in handling this dispute, left over 
from the Second World War. 
  The four islands were occupied by the Soviet troops towards 
the end of the war. 
  "One way or another we will move towards the signing of a 
peace treaty between our countries," the Russian premier stated. 
  Before leaving Russia, Hata also agreed to set a date for 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Moscow.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 24 (AFP) -- A Hong Kong-based 
Chinese American businessman has been freed after seven months 
detention in southern China's Hunan province due to an 
investment dispute, his wife said Thursday. Philip Hui-Ho 
Cheng, 64, is expected to return to Hong Kong Friday from 
Changsha, where he was detained after his business partner in 
the mainland decided to withdraw from an investment project and 
wanted his money back. Cheng's passport was returned to him on 
Tuesday after a court in Changsha found his business partner had 
falsified business documents in order to convince court 
officials to arrest him. Cheng was arrested and during a 
three-day interrogation in a detention centre headed by his 
partner's brother-in-law was told to return the money 
immediately or face a jail term.

XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Washington, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
seeks a broad, positive relationship with a strong, secure and 
prosperous China, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
today. 
  "We pursue many important common goals on a bilateral, 
regional and global basis," Christopher said in his article 
published in THE WASHINGTON POST today. 
  "Our economic interests are also converging," he said, 
"China's explosive growth is increasingly attractive to American 
exporters and investors." 
  "We are determined to expand American participation in the 
Chinese market. China has an even more significant stake in 
open and profitable access to the American market," he added. 
  Christopher said that the U.S. Administration's foreign 
policy stands for open societies as well as open markets and 
"this balance shapes our approach toward China." 
  He said that the purpose of his recent trip to Beijing was 
to 
inform China's leaders of the need to make further progress on 
human rights and to reaffirm U.S. intentions to engage China 
constructively on the many issues where the interests of the two 
countries coincide.

  [Text] Taiyuan, March 23 (XINHUA) -- North China's Shanxi 
Province, the country's largest energy and petrochemical 
district, plans to send an economic and trade delegation to Los 
Angeles, U.S.A., next month. 
  The delegation will take 500 agricultural and industrial 
products and 333 co-operation projects with them to seek 
investors and trade partners in America. 
  All the projects, focusing on such fields as electronics, 
machinery and transport, have been carefully chosen to 
restructure the local economy and produce the greatest possible 
profits. 
  More than 50 co-operation projects will be launched 
especially to satisfy the demand of the U.S. domestic market. 
  The economy of China's inland Shanxi Province for long 
lagged 
behind other developed parts of the country because it centered 
solely on the coal industry and entrepot trade. 
  Along with the efforts of the central government to tap the 
potential of mid-western China in recent years, Shanxi has 
consolidated its strength as the number one energy supplier of 
the country. 
  To foster technological innovation in old enterprises and 
accelerate development of all local economic sectors, Shanxi has 
put the utilization of foreign investment and expansion of 
foreign trade on top of its agenda. 
  The province has previously sent an economic delegation to 
the Republic of Korea and hopes that the voyage to the United 
States will prove to be fruitful.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 KYODO -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
will visit four former Soviet states in Central Asia in April, 
diplomatic sources in Beijing said Thursday [24 March]. 
  The premier will visit Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan 
and Kazakhstan from April 18 to 28, a diplomatic source said. 
  The visit will be the first visit by a top Chinese leader to 
a country belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States 
since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
  A visit by President Jiang Zemin to Russia could happen in 
the fall, the source said. 
  The high-level visits are seen as resulting from China's 
determination to engage in economic and trade activities with 
its neighbors, especially in light of recent frictions in 
Sino-U.S. relations, analysts said. 
  The trip will be the first overseas visit for Li since going 
to Vietnam in November 1992. Li's trip, which originally 
included a trip to Mongolia, was first scheduled for April last 
year, but was canceled after he had a heart attack. 
  Mongolia is presently consulting with China for a visit by 
Li 
in June or July, the source said. 
  Trade, especially in oil and oil exploration, will be the 
main theme of the trip, the diplomat said, with a 90-member 
Chinese ministerial and business delegation expected to 
accompany Li. 
  A border agreement with Kazakhstan will also be signed, he 
said.

<F P=106> ["Special Article" by Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511): "The </F>
Trend of Russia's Domestic and Foreign Policies as Viewed From 
Yeltsin's Address on the National Situation"] 
  [Text] In his lengthy address on the national situation 
recently delivered to the new parliament, Russian President 
Yeltsin expounded on the situation at home and Russia's domestic 
and foreign policies. Observers believe that the address 
reflects to a certain extent the trend of Russia's domestic and 
foreign policies this year. 
  Since the new Russian Parliament was established last 
December, some changes have taken place in Russia's political 
situation. The "democrats," represented by Gaydar, who 
supported Yeltsin, withdrew from the government, the radical 
economic reform characterized by "shock therapy" that was 
implemented over the past two years failed, and the Agriculture 
Party, Liberal Democratic Party, and Russian Communist Party -- 
formerly opposition parties -- took a predominant position in 
the new parliament. To address the new situation, the Russian 
authorities had to readjust their domestic and foreign policies. 
It was under these circumstances that Yeltsin delivered his 
address on the national situation. 
  How will Russia proceed with economic reform? This is a 
major question of common concern. Although Yeltsin did not 
clearly state in the address on the national situation the 
failure of the radical economic reform which he backed, he had 
to acknowledge that "the cost of reform was high." He said that 
the serious mistakes in reform "not only damaged Russia's 
economic structure but also seriously harmed its political 
system." Hence, Yeltsin on the one hand proposed that "the 
speed of reform must not slow down" and on the other hand called 
for "alleviating the heavy burden brought to society by market 
reform." Yeltsin put forward the new idea of "establishing a 
market economic regulation mechanism." In other words, future 
reforms will change the liberal market economic pattern and will 
put in place a market economic system which can be regulated by 
the state. This shows that the radical economic reform policy 
advocated by former First Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar has been 
abolished. 
  Strengthening social protection for inhabitants so as to 
avoid social unrest constitutes an important element of 
Yeltsin's address as well as a pressing and arduous task facing 
Russia this year. To date, one-third of Russia's inhabitants 
remain below the poverty line. This is a major factor which 
could trigger social unrest. Hence, Yeltsin called for 
strengthening social protection measures to ensure the stability 
of the people's livelihood. To increase the people's sense of 
security, Yeltsin also regarded the struggle against criminal 
offenses as one of this year's urgent tasks. He believed that 
criminal offenses "constituted a threat" to state security. It 
seems that tackling poverty and crime is an important 
requirement for easing popular discontent and stabilizing the 
political situation. 
  Yeltsin is now holding high the banner of comprehensively 
protecting Russia's national interests. Due to the turbulent 
political situation and economic crisis at home following the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia's status as a major 
power has continued to decline. The pride of the Russians has 
been injured and those abroad have a sense of inferiority. 
Russians are discriminated against and even driven away from 
the territory of the former Soviet Union. Long ago, the people 
urged the authorities to strengthen the policy of revitalizing 
the Russian nation. We can see from the address on the national 
situation that Yeltsin considers the safeguarding of Russia's 
national interests as the main condition for developing 
relations with the newly independent nations of the former 
Soviet Union. The Russian authorities have recently made 
efforts to strive for dual nationality for Russians abroad. At 
the same time, the Russian Army has attempted to permanently 
station armed forces in the CIS in order to maintain Russia's 
"special interests" in the region. 
  The readjustment of Russia's foreign policy is also obvious. 
Following its independence, Russia has basically implemented a 
foreign policy which caters to the West, solely seeking 
"coordination" with the West. Instead of obtaining fitting 
economic interests in turn, the move evoked more popular 
discontent against the authorities. Yeltsin admitted in his 
address that Russia's foreign policy "lacked vigorous and 
creative initiative spirit" and stressed that Russia will no 
longer make any unilateral concessions. Apparently, Russia will 
pursue an independent foreign policy and will try to resume its 
status as a major player in the international arena. 
  Russia's domestic political situation and diplomacy are 
facing many complicated problems. Hence, it will be difficult 
to make a final conclusion as to whether the goal and tasks set 
in Yeltsin's address can be turned into reality.

  [Excerpts] Chinese Premier Li Peng and four vice premiers, 
namely, Zhu Rongji, Li Langing, Qian Qichen, and Zou Jiahua, met 
with domestic and foreign reporters who had been covering the 
National People's Congress meeting and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference meeting yesterday [22 March] 
at the Great People's Hall in Beijing. At the meeting Premier 
Li Peng expressed gratitude to the reporters for their news 
coverage of the meetings and answered some questions raised by 
them. [passage omitted] 
  Referring to relations between China and the United States 
Premier Li Peng said that China attaches importance to Sino-U.S 
relations and is ready to improve the relations and that it has 
been making efforts for this end and will continue to make 
efforts in the future, too. However, he stressed that China is a 
sovereign state and that, accordingly, it will not hold 
negotiations on principled matters. 
  Referring to U.S. Secretary of State Cristopher's recent 
visit to China Premier Li Peng said that Cristopher's visit was 
successful and that China hopes he will attain greater success. 
He also said that the two sides reached an agreement on some 
specific matters and promoted mutual understanding. [passage 
omitted] 
  Referring to the nuclear issue of Korea, Premier Li Peng, 
saying that China has always insisted on resolving the nuclear 
inspection issue of Korea through negotiations, said that using 
a method of applying pressure would make the situation on the 
Korean peninsula more complicated and tense and would be 
unfavorable for the peace and stability of this region. 
  Premier Li Peng said that North Korea's acceptance of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection proved that the 
two sides can gradually reach agreement through negotiations. 
He said that if the issue on the nuclear inspection of North 
Korea is referred to a discussion at the UN Security Council, 
China will adhere to its consistent position of reasonably 
resolving the issue through dialogue and negotiations, not 
through applying pressure. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China Does Not Favor Applying Pressure on </F>
Korea"] 
  [Text] In the past few days, the situation on the Korean 
peninsula has once again become the focus of attention in the 
world. Because the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
considers that the North Korean side has failed to give full 
cooperation and assistance to its delegation in completing the 
nuclear inspection work in North Korea, countries such as the 
United States and Japan have adopted measures and resorted to 
threats, one after another, trying to use blackmail and pressure 
to force North Korea to change its position. The latest threat 
by the United States is to send 850 U.S. troops and to ship 200 
Patriot missiles to South Korea "as a deterrent force against a 
missile attach by North Korea." According to reports, Japan 
also is "drafting punitive measures against North Korea in the 
economic area," including ending remittances from Japan to North 
Korea by Koreans, stopping bilateral trade, cutting off 
communications links, and halting sea and air transportation 
between the two countries. The South Korean Defense Ministry 
announced that since Wednesday, its Navy, Army, and Air Force 
have begun to enter a "nine-day special full alert." It is not 
difficult to see that all these are to deliberately create a 
tense situation. 
  On the previous day, Chinese Premier Li Peng has explained 
clearly China's position on the Korean peninsula issue which is 
that China is in favor of solving the problem of nuclear 
inspections on the Korean peninsula through negotiations, and is 
not in favor of exerting pressure, as this will not help solve 
the problem. The Chinese representative to the United Nations 
has thoroughly expounded China's viewpoint at the Security 
Council, hoping that other Security Council members can accept 
China's idea. Using negotiations to settle international 
disputes is China's consistent position. At this moment, when 
swords are drawn and bows bent on both sides, greater efforts 
must be made to urge both sides to sit down at the negotiating 
table. 
  In fact, regarding this international incident, which has 
been caused by the problem of IAEA nuclear inspections, the two 
sides have completely different viewpoints. The IAEA, which 
sent personnel to North Korea to carry out nuclear inspections, 
claimed that North Korea "refused inspection of a radioactive 
chemical laboratory at Yongbyon," therefore "up to now it still 
is not certain whether North Korea has used nuclear materials 
for military purposes." The North Korean side, however, held 
that it had "enthusiastically assisted the inspection delegation 
in its work," and that "the inspection delegation accomplished 
successfully all the activities stipulated by the 15 February 
Vienna Agreement." Under these circumstances, the sensible 
method is first to clarify the truth, and not to hastily carry 
out blackmail and threats. 
  If the IAEA wants to send someone to North Korea to carry 
out 
inspections once again, then it is completely possible to sit 
down to discuss and study the issue. On the last occasion, it 
was negotiation that worked in talking North Korea, which had 
not agreed to an inspection, into accepting an inspection. Why 
can the issue not be settled through negotiations this time? 
Some people in the international community hope that China, 
which maintains friendly relations with North Korea, will exert 
pressure on North Korea. In fact, China's position is very 
clear. China is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, and China's consistent position is that it neither 
encourages nor supports nuclear proliferation. Regarding the 
current dispute, it should be settled through negotiations. 
China and North Korea are two completely independent countries, 
so the problem of exerting pressure does not exist. 
  The United States is now drumming up support; it says it 
will 
impose so-called "sanctions" on North Korea, adding that among 
the permanent members of the UN Security Council, only China is 
against "sanctions," but this is not correct. The news 
yesterday reported that Russia, another permanent member of the 
UN Security Council, also said that it "hoped to solve the 
international dispute over inspection of nuclear facilities in 
North Korea through talks," and they thought that "it is too 
early to talk about sanctions." Naturally, inspection of nuclear 
facilities in North Korea is an issue meriting people's 
attention, but it is an issue that has existed for months, or 
even years. Why must the Americans so hastily resort to 
blackmail and threats at this moment in time, and send troops 
and missiles? People know that President Clinton has met with 
many difficulties abroad, and also has been battered by the 
"Whitewater" incident at home. Are the Americans trying to 
divert people's attention with this issue so as to cast off 
their dilemma? Regarding this, we must watch very carefully.

  [Text] Beijing March 24 (XINHUA) -- The upcoming visit to 
China by President Kim Young-sam of the Republic of Korea (ROK), 
will further promote the two countries' relations, especially in 
the economic field, said the ROK's ambassador to China, Hwang 
Pyong-tae, in a recent interview here with XINHUA. 
  Hwang noted that although it is only a year and a half since 
the two countries set up diplomatic ties, China and ROK have 
greatly increased political, economic and cultural contacts. 
  He said that the trade volume between the two countries last 
year reached 9.1 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 50 percent 
over 1992. 
  He noted that China has become ROK's third largest trade 
partner and ROK is now the sixth largest trade partner of China, 
adding that by the end of last year ROK's total investment in 
China exceeded one billion U.S. dollars. 
  Hwang predicted that the annual trade volume between China 
and ROK will increase greatly by the year 2000 if the two sides 
keep up the current momentum of economic and trade cooperation. 
  Exchanges in the cultural and other fields between the two 
countries are increasing as well, the ambassador said, adding 
some of the well-known universities, such as Beijing University 
and Fudan University (in Shanghai), now have research institutes 
on ROK studies. 
  More than 150,000 people from the ROK toured China last 
year, 
according to Hwang, and is estimated to grow to about 500,000 
this year. 
  On the prospect of Sino-ROK ties in the 21st century, Hwang 
said that the biggest problem of the coming century would be the 
economy. He stressed that China and ROK, bringing their 
respective economic advantages into play, should make joint 
efforts to strengthen their economic cooperation.

  [Text] Seoul, March 24 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam left here this morning for official visits to Japan 
and China aimed at improving cooperation with the two countries. 
  In a speech at the Seoul airport, Kim said that he will 
discuss with Japanese and Chinese leaders cooperation among the 
three countries as well as peace and stability in eastern Asia, 
including the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. 
  He said that Japan and China were geographically and 
historically South Korea's close neighbors, and that the three 
will become partners in the forthcoming Asia-Pacific era. 
  He pointed out that interdependence among nations is 
increasingly important, especially since the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade reached an agreement which will bring about fierce 
competition in world trade. 
  This situation highlights the significance of close 
cooperation among South Korea, Japan and China in seeking joint 
stability and prosperity, he stated. 
  The three countries can benefit from complimentary 
cooperation to improve their own competitiveness as they have 
different business structures and are in different stages of 
development, President Kim stressed. 
  He added that Japan is South Korea's second largest trading 
partner, while China is the third largest and has attracted most 
of South Korea's overseas investment. 
  Kim is expected to meet with Japanese Emperor Akihito and 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, address the Japanese 
parliament, and visit Waseda University. 
  He is scheduled to leave Japan on March 26 for Shanghai, 
China's largest city, and will remain in China for five days. 
During his stay he will hold talks with President Jiang Zemin, 
Premier Li Peng and other top Chinese leaders. 
  President Kim will also visit the economic development zones 
in Shanghai and Tianjin and deliver a speech at Beijing 
University.

  [Text] Nairobi, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Somali faction leader 
Mohamed Farah Aidid will sign a peace agreement with his rival 
Ali Mahdi Mohamed tomorrow. 
  The chairman of the Somali Patriotic Movement Aden Abdullahi 
Nur told XINHUA late tonight that "Aidid and Ali Mahdi have 
reached a compromise and will sign a peace agreement tonight or 
tomorrow. Now they are preparing for the signing." 
  Secretary General of the Somali Intellectuals Forum Zakaria 
Mohamud Haji Abdi disclosed that after the press release issued 
by the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM), Aidid 
called on the acting special representative of U.N. 
Secretary-General Lansana Kouyate and proposed that he and Ali 
Mahdi could represent their separate alliance to sign the 
agreement. 
  This afternoon, the acting special representative stated in 
the press release that as the faction leaders were not able to 
resolve the problem of representation of the Southern Somali 
National Movement (SSNM), he decided that the United Nations was 
no longer able to provide the faction leaders with good offices 
and facilities to continue their current consultations. 
  In an interview with XINHUA late tonight, SSNM Secretary 
General Abdullahi Sheikh confirmed the compromise. 
  "That (the compromise) has given a mandate to group of 12 
spokesman Awad Ashareh Mohamed, and let us sign on behalf of 
SSNM, Aidid gets another mandate. Both of them will sign a 
document on behalf of the factions belonging to them", said 
Abdullahi. 
  "This is what we have reached at this time. Maybe tomorrow 
we will have another development and we will sign a document 
along this line," he added. 
  This afternoon, Awad Ashareh, spokeman for the group of 12 
led by Ali Mahdi, noted that the Nairobi peace talks on the 
Somali issue have collapsed "because Aidid refused to sign the 
reconciliation agreement," adding that "we have accepted all 
conditions raised by him (Aidid) during the peace talks." 
  The Somali peace talks sponsored by the United Nations 
Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) began here on March 17.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- South Africa's 
Nedbank opened its Beijing office here today. 
  Zheng Hongye, president of the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade, and John Maree, chairman of 
the Nedcor Group, attended the opening ceremony. 
  Zheng said in his speech that Nedbank, as a financial bridge 
linking Asia and Africa, has spared no effort to promote the 
economic and trade ties between the two continents, especially 
those between China and South Africa. 
  The establishment of its Beijing office will open a new 
channel for Sino-South African cooperation in the fields of 
trade and finance, he said. 
  Maree told those attending the ceremony that as the largest 
finance group in South Africa, Nedbank has always attached great 
importance to expanding its business in the Far East region, 
especially in China, because the region is developing very fast 
economically, and China has kept the highest development speed. 
  The bank established an office in Hong Kong in 1984, he 
said, 
adding that its Beijing office will provide loans and 
information to those South African companies coming to China and 
help Chinese enterprises which are interested in investing in 
South Africa. 
  Nedbank, founded in 1888, has assets of R [Rand] 51 billion 
and a total capital stock of R2.5 billion.

  [Text] Fuzhou, March 24 (XINHUA) -- Southeast China's 
Fujian Province will foster stronger links with other parts of 
the country by building up its road systems this year. 
  The whole project includes the construction of the 
Quanzhou-Xiamen section of the Fuzhou-Xiamen-Zhangzhou-Zhaoan 
Highway, three long bridges, four tunnels and two highways 
connecting Fujian with neighboring provinces. 
  The coastal province has decided to earmark 2.4 billion yuan 
this year for the undertaking, according to Shen Xueguang, 
director of the provincial transportation bureau. 
  The investment will be 67 percent higher than that of 1993. 
  As a mountainous region, Fujian has a poor transportation 
infrastructure. The total length of highways amounted to a mere 
945 km in 1949. By 1992, however, 41,882 km of highways had 
been built. But the road quality was inferior in terms of 
design, technical standards and surface conditions. 
  To meet the demands of rapid economic growth, Fujian poured 
1.3 billion yuan last year into the construction of 1,200 km of 
highways. 
  The extra 2.4 billion yuan this year will be used to build 
400 km of high-class highways, revamp 430 km of roads designed 
solely for automobiles and pave 4,000 km of regular roads. 
  Shen said, altogether 24 billion yuan is needed to complete 
Fujian's highway network. Therefore, the province has framed 
preferential policies allowing overseas investors to develop 
land along the highways and open service industries, according 
to Shen.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Shen 
Daren, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Jiangsu 
People's Congress, said here yesterday that Jiangsu, as one of 
the provinces whose economy has developed rapidly, resolutely 
supports the financial and taxation reform launched by the 
central government. 
  Over the years, Jiangsu has been one of the provinces 
delivering a large portion of its revenue to the central 
government. In 1993, Jiangsu's gross national product [GNP] 
totaled 255 billion yuan, an increase of 18.5 percent over the 
previous year. Per capita income in the year amounted to 3,270 
yuan. The province delivered 7.6 billion yuan to the state last 
year. 
  Shen Daren, who has held the offices of member of the 
Ningxia 
CPC Committee and secretary of the Jiangsu CPC Committee for 17 
years, told this reporter that Jiangsu's 1994 economic growth is 
set at 12 percent, 3 percentage points higher than the country's 
average. At the same time, Jiangsu will seek unity of economic 
efficiency and growth. 
  Shen Daren said that the purpose of the system of 
revenue-sharing between the central and localities, which came 
to effect commencing 1 January this year, is to enhance the 
state's capability of macroeconomic regulation and control. 
This will offer reliable guarantee for China's sustained, 
rapid, and steady economic growth. Thanks to this reform, 
Jiangsu and many other provinces will be in a relatively fair 
position for competition. However, it will also temporarily 
affect the interests of some parts of Jiangsu. To this end, 
Jiangsu's attitude is that local and partial interests should be 
subordinate to those of the central. Jiangsu will resolutely 
maintain the authority of the central government and proceed in 
all cases from the overall situation. The leaders at all levels 
in Jiangsu should explain this to the broad ranks of the people 
and seek unity of thinking. 
  As the country's reform has entered a crucial stage, 
Chairman 
Shen said Jiangsu will implement the reforms introduced by the 
central government in a down-to-earth manner.

  [Text] Nanjing, March 24 (XINHUA) -- Yangzhou city in 
coastal Jiangsu Province is speeding up the construction of the 
Yangzhou and Gaogang Ports to streamline access for the northern 
part of the province to the outside world. 
  Since construction started in 1985 the Yangzhou Port has 
acquired a passenger dock, a floating pier able to handle ships 
of 10,000 dwt and two wharves for 3,000-dwt ships. 
  The Gaogang Port is already open to the outside world. 
  Located at the confluence of the Chang Jiang River, China's 
longest, and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, Yangzhou has long 
been a commercial port. 
  The area is also a key production base for grain, cotton, 
edible oil and non-staple foodstuffs. 
  Local officials believe that the development of Yangzhou, 
which abounds in oil and natural gas resources, will surely help 
boost the economy in north Jiangsu. 
  At present, the Yangzhou city government is working on a 
series of preferential policies to encourage foreign investment 
in the port construction.

  [Text] The provincial party committee and government 
recently invited some deputies to the second session of the 
eighth National People's Congress and some members to the second 
session of the eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], who were from Hong 
Kong and Macao, to the Taishan Hotel in Beijing to a sincere 
discussion meeting to introduce Shandong's economic and social 
development, investment climate, and policies on bringing in 
investment and to hear the views and suggestions of the friends 
from Hong Kong and Macao on ways for Shandong to further 
accelerate reform and opening up. 
  In his speech, Jiang Chunyun, member of the Political Bureau 
of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shandong 
provincial party committee, expressed heartfelt gratitude, on 
behalf of the provincial party committee and government, to the 
friends from Hong Kong and Macao for their many years of great 
support to the promotion of the economies of Hong Kong, Macao, 
and Shandong and to Shandong's modernization drive. He said: 
Over the past decade and more since reform and opening up 
started, Shandong has continuously emancipated the mind, 
deepened reform, opened wider to the outside world, and 
accelerated development thanks to the guidance of Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the CPC's basic line, principles, and 
policies. It has created an excellent situation characterized 
by rapid economic development and social stability and unity. 
Meanwhile, we have remained clear- headed to note that Shandong 
is still lagging rather far behind the requirements of the party 
Central Committee and other provinces and municipalities in 
southern China in its extent of opening up and pace of 
development. It is hoped that friends from Hong Kong and Macao 
will continue their concern and support for Shandong and offer 
more valuable opinions on Shandong's future work. 
  Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of Shandong, introduced to the friends 
from Hong Kong and Macao the basic situation of Shandong, its 
economic and social development in the past few years, its ideas 
for the development and work for some time to come, and the key 
areas of foreign investment for the near future and relevant 
policies. He said: Introducing more investment from abroad is 
the focus of Shandong's endeavor to open to the outside world 
more rapidly. To introduce investment from abroad more rapidly, 
we will greatly optimize the investment climate, simplify work 
procedures, improve the later-stage management of 
foreign-invested enterprises, and provide good-quality and 
high-efficient service to the foreign firms who have come to 
invest in Shandong. 
  He emphasized: We wholeheartedly welcome the friends and 
relatives from Hong Kong and Macao to come to Shandong more 
often to visit, inspect, and give guidance and wholeheartedly 
hoped that, in the future, they will, as always, show concern 
for and support Shandong's modernization drive and, together 
with us, open up a still better future in the economic and trade 
cooperation between Shandong Province and Hong Kong and Macao. 
  Thirty-seven deputies and members attended the meeting, 
including Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice chairman of the National 
CPPCC Committee and president of the China Chamber of Commerce 
of Hong Kong. In their speeches, they held unanimously: 
Shandong is an important coastal open province, which has 
abundant resources and preferential policies for opening up, and 
whose people are loyal to friends and as good as their word. 
They said that they would visit Shandong more often to learn 
more about it and develop economic and trade cooperation. They 
believed that Shandong's economic and trade cooperation and 
exchanges with Hong Kong and Macao would be further developed. 
  Li Zhen, chairman of the provincial people's congress 
standing committee; Lu Maozeng, chairman of the provincial CPPCC 
committee; Song Fatang, standing committee member of the 
provincial party committee and vice governor of Shandong; and 
persons in charge from pertinent provincial departments, were 
present at the meeting.

<F P=106> [By reporters Geng Jun (5105 6511) and Xiao Rui (5135 3843)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Shandong is 
called the "black horse" of China's economic development. What 
is its attitude toward the tax-sharing system? Shandong 
Governor Zhao Zhihao, who is also a deputy to the National 
People's Congress, said: We are all for it! 
  When asked by these reporters about the tax-sharing system, 
Zhao Zhihao replied by raising a hypothetic question: "If the 
State lacks financial resources and a competent national defense 
and is confronted with disasters, which localities will be able 
to solve their problems by themselves? Without a sense of 
overall situation, it will be difficult for the state to achieve 
development. If the state runs into difficulties and pressure 
is coming from the outside, which localities can solve problems 
in lieu of the state?" 
  Zhao Zhihao continued his response by making a comparison: 
"It is an long-acknowledged fact that Shandong has rich 
resources and good natural conditions. Prior to reform and 
opening up, however, Shandong was always associated with the 
word `poverty,' and people always called us "poor Shandong men." 
The total economic volume of Shandong is now ranked second 
among other provinces in the country. What do we rely on? It 
is all due to the positive state policies of reform and opening 
up, and Shandong has benefited from these good policies!" 
  After pondering the matter for a while, Zhao Zhihao made 
some 
weighty remarks: "If the state runs into financial 
difficulties, we should keep the cardinal principles in mind, 
take the overall situation into account, and help the state get 
over the difficulties. In wartime, 220,000 martyrs from 
Shandong Province sacrificed their lives, and today, it is our 
duty to make some contributions. Shandong will only be one of 
30 provinces in China, even when it becomes richer. A single 
flower cannot blossom, but hundreds of flowers can." 
  Zhao Zhihao told these reporters that, as a governor who was 
also in charge of financial work, he started conveying the 
importance of financial work to financial officials at all 
levels throughout the province: We cannot collect less money 
than we should; nor can we collect more. We must turn in the 
required funds to the central authorities and never can we be 
vague in this respect. 
  Some localities widened the tax base and made too many 
levies 
in order to receive more repaid funds after tax from the central 
authorities, but Zhao Zhihao opposed this practice. He said: 
"This is not only a serious violation of discipline but is also 
an irresponsible act toward the enterprises. If enterprise 
circulating funds are all considered the base figure, how can 
enterprises develop their production, and what can they do in 
the future?" 
  Zhao Zhihao made his final remarks: "Taking the overall 
situation into account precisely means taking long-term 
interests into account. Our enthusiasm should be used to seize 
the opportunity for development offered by the current reform in 
taxation and readjust and optimize the economic structure so as 
to tap new financial resources.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 24 (XINHUA) -- This, China's largest 
economic center is broadening ways for foreign co-operation. 
  "The municipal government has published its first batch of 
ten urban infrastructure facilities open to foreign investment 
this year," a municipal official said. 
  Included are 180 projects, each of which is scheduled to use 
at least 10 million U.S. dollars. 
  The city plans to publish a second batch of ten 
infrastructure facilities, including a power plant, a subway, a 
railway, an airport, roads and bridges this year. 
  In addition, it will list large industrial projects for 
foreign co-operation. These projects involve mainly 
petrochemicals, metallurgy, complete sets of power plants, 
telecommunications, electronics, tyres and computers. 
  Foreign business people are welcome to invest in leasing or 
transforming shanghai's urban districts, the official said. 
  According to the official, Shanghai approved the 
establishment of 3,650 foreign-funded projects involving a total 
contractual investment of 7.01 billion U.S. dollars last year. 
  The municipal government has pledged to absorb more foreign 
investment this year than last year. 
  According to statistics, Shanghai has used a total of 14.9 
billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment and approved the 
establishment of 7,500 projects so far.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 23 (XINHUA) -- This, China's largest 
economic center is employing advanced auditing methods to 
supervise its rapidly growing economy. 
  According to Deputy Mayor Meng Jianzhu, 84.2 percent of the 
government's financial activities came under the supervision of 
auditing departments last year, in comparison with 71.4 percent 
in 1992. 
  He praised the auditing departments for playing an important 
role in economizing on capital and improving work efficiency in 
urban construction last year. 
  Shanghai is China's leading industrial center with many key 
state enterprises. 
  To help these enterprises to adopt a modern enterprise 
system 
as quickly as possible, the auditing departments audited ten 
joint- stock companies, 82 partnership enterprises and three 
nationwide exchanges of goods and materials last year. 
  The auditing departments also completed checks on 22 items 
of 
loans granted by international banking organizations and put 
forward proposals on making efficient use of the loans to the 
municipal government last year.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 23 (XINHUA) -- An additional air- 
corridor has been opened here to ease the congestion of the 
skies above the China's leading metropolis. 
  Air-traffic control first started in Shanghai in May, 1992, 
with two sectors opened, one extending to the south and the 
other to the north. 
  But the sharp rise in the number of flights has far exceeded 
the ceiling limit in a single regulatory sector, which could be 
a threat to safety. 
  The new fan-shaped control area stretches to the east to 
strike a balance of flight numbers.

  [Text] Ningbo, March 23 (XINHUA) -- People living in 
Ningbo, in east China's Zhejiang Province, now enjoy more green 
space and breathe cleaner air than before. 
  Over the past couple of years, the port city has been 
building itself into a "garden port". 
  The area where three rivers which run through the city 
converge has been transformed into a greenland densely covered 
with trees, bushes and grass, from the scene of ruin and 
desolation it presented only seven years ago. 
  While the focus of the greening project was on the river 
banks, trees have also been planted along more than 240 roads. 
Small greenery has also been added at more than 40 street 
corners. 
  There were only five little parks in 1978. Now the city has 
17 parks, including a zoo.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 23 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang 
province, cradle of township enterprises, now has over 4,300 
commodities markets, with 107 of them registering annual 
turnovers of more than 100 million yuan each. 
  Thanks to these brisk markets, the province, which lacks 
natural resources, has become one of the country's richest. 
  Statistics show that over 80 percent of local commodities go 
through these markets. 
  The economic boom in Wenzhou city, a pioneer in the shift to 
the market-oriented economy, can be dated back to the early 
1980s, when smart local people grasped golden opportunities to 
become well-off as the government loosened economic control. 
  Many stalls selling clothes, shoes and other small 
commodities were set up and gradually gathered together into 
markets for various special items. 
  Last year the province injected 1.83 billion yuan into 
market 
expansion and renovation. 
  In 1982 the Yiwu Small Commodities Market was launched. It 
claims to be the largest of its kind in the country, registering 
4.52 billion yuan in turnover last year, a jump of 2.47 billion 
yuan from 1992. 
  Now it has eight trading zones, 16,000 stalls and a complete 
set of service facilities, with over 30,000 businessmen and 
100,000 customers streaming into the market every day. 
  Another noted market is China's "textile city" in Shaoxing 
County, which achieved a turnover of 3.5 billion yuan in 1993, 
more than double the previous year's figure. 
  Every day the market of 70,000 sq m receives 30,000-100,000 
people and sends more than one million m of cloth to various 
parts of the country. 
  Riding the crest of the fast-growing economy, the markets of 
production materials and factors of production have also seen a 
robust development in the province. 
  A financial market has taken shape with the setting up of 
three centers specialising in securities, foreign currency and 
inter-bank lending, respectively. 
  Meanwhile, the labor market helps over 200,000 people find 
jobs in Zhejiang every year. 
  The province's 290 capital goods markets register a total of 
more than 18 billion yuan in annual turnover. 
  At present, the province is making efforts to boost the 
markets dealing with futures, property rights and real estate, 
to further develop the local economy.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Another senior leader renewed 
attacks on Britain on the airport projects, suggesting that the 
UK was trying to tap money from Hong Kong by building a new 
airport which was "unreasonably expensive." 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told Hong Kong and Macau 
delegates that he could not understand why construction costs 
had been so high, even after taking into account high prices for 
labour and reclamation in Hong Kong. "The construction of the 
airport is to cost U.S.$20 billion (HK$154.38 billion), a price 
so expensive it has never been heard of," said Mr Li, a member 
of the ruling Politburo. "How much of it will be taken away? 
And who will take this money away?" 
  Mr Li asked the people of Hong Kong to shift their focus 
towards the development of the economy, instead of worrying 
about the lack of smooth transition on the political structure.

  [Text] The chairman of a new political party, the 123 
Democratic Alliance, said he did not want the party to be 
labelled pro-Taiwanese. 
  According to the party's declaration issued yesterday, its 
objectives are to support the unification of China, promote 
sincere interaction between the mainland and Taiwan as well as 
uphold the prosperity of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
  At the party's inaugural ceremony yesterday, chairman 
Lawrence Yum Sinling said people could not label the party as 
pro-Taiwan. 
  "We have just started up. I think people should see what we 
are doing before labelling us," he said. 
  Although about 10 of the party's members were graduates from 
universities in Taiwan, it did not mean the party was 
pro-Taiwan, he said. The members were Chinese and had lived and 
grown up in Hong Kong. 
  The party's vice-chairman, Willy Ng Wai-cho, said the party 
had 82 members. Nine of them were municipal council and 
district board members, including Chiang Sai-cheong, Shung 
King-fai and Christopher Chu Cho-yan. 
  Mr Yum said the party would communicate with other liberal 
camps because it demanded that councillors of all levels be 
elected by universal suffrage as soon as possible to ensure a 
high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong. 
  Mr Ng said that, like the democratic flagship the United 
Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK), the party wanted to have 30 
directly elected seats in the Legislative Council returned in 
the 1995 election. 
  He said about 10 members of the new party were also members 
of the UDHK and a few were members of Meeting Point or the 
Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. 
  The party would accept members who belonged to other 
parties. 
  Mr Ng, who is also a member of the UDHK, said he had decided 
to run in the district board elections in September as a 
candidate of the new party. He said he had informed the UDHK of 
his decision. 
  He did not want to withdraw from the UDHK but he would 
respect its decision if the party would not allow a candidate 
running for elections to belong to more than one party. 
  Mr Ng said 13 other members of the new alliance had informed 
the party that they would be interested in running in the 
district board elections. 
  The party would need further discussion to decide how many 
candidates to field in the election, he said. 
  Mr Yum said the party had raised about $100,000 mainly from 
friends. 
  When asked whether the party would accept financial support 
from pro-Taiwan organisations, Mr Yum said it would accept 
anybody's contributions as long as they were unconditional.

  [Excerpt] A senior Chinese official has warned that an 
increase in the number of new political parties in Hong Kong 
would cause instability in the territory. 
  In a candid reference to the growing number of political 
groups, director of the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, Zhou 
Nan, said: "If three or four persons are able to form a 
political party, the number of parties would be more than the 
rebellions in the Cultural Revolution. 
  "Then it will be difficult to maintain stability -- and Hong 
Kong cannot be without stability." 
  Mr Zhou also said he would like a meeting with Governor 
Chris 
Patten one day -- to discuss poetry, not politics. 
  Mr Zhou was speaking at a poetry meeting he initiated for 
reporters in Beijing. 
  He said too many political parties meant too many choices 
for 
Hong Kong people. 
  China, he stressed, could never fully adopt the Western 
style 
of parliament. 
  "China has her own style for democratic development," he 
said. "We should not and need not take the Western style for 
reference because China is a democratic country and we have got 
wider democracy." 
  Recalling conversations with members of Britain's House of 
Lords, Mr Zhou said: "If Britain has taken about 400 years to 
develop this style of Parliament, how can Hong Kong take only a 
few years to come up to that point?" Mr Zhou also said the 
greatest wish of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was to 
stand on Hong Kong soil, even if only for a minute, after it was 
returned to China in 1997. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Plans to upgrade cross-border road links between 
China and Hong Kong would be hit by the Sino-British political 
row, the head of the Ministry of Communications, Huang Zhenlai, 
said yesterday. 
  Mr Huang, who was attending the National People's Congress 
meeting, said there was "nothing to discuss" with Britain which 
was adopting an "unco-operative" attitude with China over 
political development in Hong Kong. 
  His comment, different in tone to Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen, cast doubt on projects to ease traffic congestion 
between China and Hong Kong. 
  Mr Qian had pledged that China was willing to cooperate with 
Britain on issues outside politics. 
  The Shenzhen government has been discussing with Hong Kong 
the 24-hour opening of the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint. 
  But Mr Huang said that although there were a few projects in 
the pipeline, discussions would not be started at present, 
apparently referring to the construction of a Shenzhen-Hong Kong 
highway.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by James Tien Pei-chun (3944 0554 0193), </F>
legislative councillor and member of the Liberal Party: "There 
Should Be No Discrimination Regarding the Most-Favored-Nation 
Trade Statute"] 
  [Text] In a few months, the United States will make the 
decision on the issue of extending China's most-favored nation 
(MFN) trade status. I would like to point out that the factors 
for considering whether nor not the United States should extend 
China's MFN trade status unconditionally at present are 
different from those before 1992. The combination of the two 
factors that Bill Clinton of the Democratic Party has become 
U.S. President and the overall situation of the U.S. Congress is 
controlled by the Democratic Party will become a key factor for 
us in assessing whether or not the United States will extend the 
MFN trade status unconditionally because Bill Clinton will not 
revoke a resolution adopted by his own party in the Congress. 
<H5>  MFN Trade Status Is Not a Kind of Preferential Treatment </H5>
  As a matter of fact, extending China's MFN trade status is 
basically a trade affair between China and the United States. 
However, the United States has changed it into a political tool. 
The so-called MFN status is only a bilateral trade arrangement 
on the basis of equality and mutual benefit which does not 
involve discrimination and is not a special preferential 
treatment. On the contrary, not granting MFN trade status is a 
kind of discrimination directed against a nation. 
  In 1992, the United States had trade relations with a total 
of more than 170 countries, and it needs to extend the MFN 
status each year to only three countries: Bulgaria, the former 
Soviet Union, and China. 
  This phenomenon fully demonstrates that, in fact, the United 
States has not regarded China as an equal trade partner and is 
attempting to make China compromise or submit on other non-trade 
issues by threatening to discriminate against China on its trade 
status. 
  It is to be regretted that this discriminative act in 
handling the trade relationship with China has deceived the 
majority of the residents so that they think the United States 
will give preferential treatment in trade to China as long as 
China improves the human rights situation. To date, some people 
still are mistakenly following the U.S. line and have brought 
the human rights issue into the discussion on the MFN status, 
thus blurring the heart of the entire issue. 
  Their criticism of human rights in China shows only that 
they 
have scanty knowledge about human rights and think that 
political rights are the sum total of human rights. As a matter 
of fact, human rights also include civil rights. For example, 
the Chinese people can choose their jobs freely and are not 
restricted in traveling from province to province, and so on. 
Are these human rights? 
<H5>  Do Not Mix Trade With Human Rights </H5>
  That I have flatly refused to link human rights in China 
with 
the MFN status does not mean that I am satisfied with the human 
rights situation in China at present. As a matter of fact, I 
too think that there is ample room for improvement regarding 
human rights in China. I also hope that human rights in China 
can be escalated. However, the experience of Western countries 
has also told us that it has taken 40 to 50 years of constant 
development before their human rights reached today's level. 
This development was not completed overnight, like magic. 
  The experience of Western countries also tells us that they 
too first developed their economy to motivate the escalation of 
the level of the people's living standard, and then the progress 
of the entire society, including human rights and political 
rights. China's achievements in economic development, gradual 
opening up in the field of information, and gradual realization 
of universal education among the people, and other factors at 
present have laid a foundation for further development of human 
rights in China. 
  At present, in Guangdong Province alone, there are more than 
10 million laborers who have come from Hunan and Hubei. Among 
them, more than 4 million are employed by more than 10,000 
plants set up with the investment of Hong Kong businessmen. 
They have remitted their earnings to their hometowns. This 
undoubtedly is conducive to improving the living standards of 
more people there. In their spare time after work in the 
plants, these laborers have more opportunities to come into 
contact with foreign information. In their correspondence with 
their friends and relatives in the rural areas, they also can 
help them acquire more information. 
  People who hope to promote the improvement of human rights 
in 
China by means of the MFN status should understand that human 
rights in China already are developing steadily and that trying 
to help the shoots grow by pulling them up will not work. On 
the contrary, China's loss of MFN trade status will deal a heavy 
blow to the economic development in south China, and employment 
opportunities will be reduced. This will only further degrade 
the quality of life for more people and damage the foundation 
for the development of human rights. 
  Let us take a look at the former Soviet Union, a country 
that 
started reform at about the same time as China. It has taken 
the road of developing politics first, while China has regarded 
economic development as the leading factor. To date, we can see 
that some progress has been made in the political rights of the 
Russian people, but they still have to join long lines to buy 
bread and other daily necessities. Comparatively speaking, 
people in China can buy various kinds of food at will and they 
have clothing of various colors to choose and buy. The people 
are universally earning more and can even afford to make tours 
of other localities. I would like to ask: What kind of living 
do they expect to have as ordinary citizens? 
  That the United States has used human rights as a condition 
for giving MFN status does not mean that such an act is correct, 
and it is not necessary for everyone to following such an idea 
blindly. In fact, the political rights of the American people 
are more progressive than those of the Chinese people, but their 
civil rights are lagging behind in some ways. For example, even 
to date, some small towns in the United States still practice 
apartheid, prohibit the entry of black people, and even 
persecute and murder black people who move into such towns. 
<H5>  Give China Permanent MFN Status </H5>
  Although the demand for the United States to extend China's 
MFN trade status is a routine and important official matter, 
there is, in fact, a thorough solution to it, which is that the 
United States can grant China permanent MFN trade status on an 
equal and mutually beneficial trade basis. 
  We have urged the United States to extend China's MFN 
status. 
We have made this most basic appeal because we are faced with 
the reality that the United States gives the MFN status on a 
yearly basis, but such an arrangement has not proceeded from an 
equal and mutually beneficial basis and is only a pretext for 
making use of a trade issue to pin down another country to 
attain its hidden purpose. 
  What we should strive for in the future is a permanent MFN 
trade status granted by the United States to China. We should 
let the residents of Hong Kong, the American people, and even 
the whole world understand that granting permanent MFN trade 
status to China is not a favor bestowed by the United States on 
China, but is only a bilateral, equal, and non-discriminative 
trade arrangement with China. If the United States is willing 
to delete its political purpose from the trade issue, I see no 
reason why the United States should not grant China permanent 
MFN trade status.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters] </F>
  [Text] China has withdrawn nine official entries to the 
Hong Kong Film Festival because two productions by independent 
mainland film-makers are being shown, sources said. Although 
the official reason for withdrawing the nine entries was that 
they were not available, sources said both the film festival 
management and the Urban Council had been warned. Beijing does 
not consider the unofficial films to be representative of China. 
  A press conference to promote the 16-day event yesterday was 
postponed. However, tickets for the nine withdrawn movies were 
still available through the Urban Council's telephone 
reservation services. 
  The council's culture select committee will hold a 
closed-door meeting this morning to discuss the programme 
changes. An internal circular was distributed within the 
festival unit of the Urban Services Department yesterday, 
preventing staff from commenting or giving information on the 
issue. 
  Select committee chairman Man Sai-cheong described China's 
move as "absurd", while another committee member, Ma Lee-wo, 
said it was stupid for China to interfere in Hong Kong's 
artistic life during the transitional period. "The film 
festival is purely a cultural exchange which should not be fused 
with political factors," Mr Man said. He accused China of 
spoiling the integrity of the film festival and pledged not to 
bow to pressure to withdraw the independent productions. "It is 
a very bad precedent. I can't stop worrying about film 
festivals after 1997, since China could ban all the films it 
dislikes regardless of where they come from," he said. 
  It is understood Urbco has already dropped the independently 
made film Blue Kite by mainland director Tian Zhuanzhuan, which 
was the centre of a similar row in Japan. The two unofficial 
entries to be screened this year are The Days and Red [as 
published].

<F P=106> ["Full Text of PRC Film Industry Administration's Answer to </F>
HSIN PAO Reporter's Questionnaire on the Chinese Side's 
Withdrawing Nine Official Entries in the Hong Kong Film 
Festival" -- first three paragraphs are editor's note] 
  [Text] The day before yesterday, our staff reporter 
faxed a questionnaire to the PRC Film Industry Administration on 
the Chinese side's withdrawing nine official entries in the Hong 
Kong Film Festival. We received the reply yesterday 
afternoon. 
  The full text of Beijing's reply to this newspaper is as 
follows: 
  (The letter sent by the Urban Council to Beijing has never 
been made public) 
  Your newspaper raised several questions to us: 1) What 
promises has the Hong Kong Film Festival breached so that the 
Film Industry Administration decided to withdraw copies of two 
movies? 2) Why did the Film Festival have to make these 
promises? 3) Why does the Chinese side oppose showing the two 
independently produced movies: "Red Beans" and "The Days"? 
These movies are only short stories about romantic love, 
without any political content. 4) "Blue Kite" was shown at the 
Tokyo Film Festival. At that time, the Film Industry 
Administration withdrew only its delegation, but the movie was 
still shown. Why have both the delegation and the movies been 
withdrawn this time? 5) Will this incident affect future 
cooperation? 
  Now, our brief answers to these questions are as follows: 
  1. Last September, the 18th Hong Kong International Film 
Festival wrote a letter to the Film Industry Administration 
asking to be allowed to send its personnel to Beijing to select 
movies. In our reply letter, the Film Industry Administration 
unequivocally said that "according to the regulations of our 
country, all Chinese entries in international film festivals 
(including movies produced in cooperation with the outside) must 
be screened and authorized by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and 
Television. Only movies authorized can enter international film 
festivals." "If personnel of your festival come to Beijing to 
select movies, our administration will give our support and 
assistance, but the scope of movie selection and movies to be 
shown in the film festival should be movies provided by us. 
Movies to which the Ministry of Radio, Film, and 
Television has not given consent for their showing in the 
International Film Festival are not within the scope of 
selection." The Hong Kong Film Festival replied on 8 November, 
saying they consented to the conditions and promised that "they 
will follow this practice." After that, our administration 
agreed to receive and help Miss Wong Oi-ling, one of the program 
planners of the Hong Kong Film Festival, to select movies in 
Beijing. In our conversation with Miss Wong before the formal 
movie selection, we once again told her that we hoped the Hong 
Kong International Film Festival would respect our views when 
selecting movies and would not select movies without our 
administration's screening and authorization or programs 
unfriendly to our country or even willfully vilifying our social 
system and policies, and that only with mutual respect and equal 
treatment can both sides continue to cooperate with each other 
on a long-term basis. Miss Wong Oi-ling gave her consent to our 
views right away. Meanwhile, we also specially briefed 
Miss Wong on which movies -- such as "Blue Kite" and "Beijing 
Bastard" -- were taken out of the country illegally to enter the 
Tokyo Film Festival and other film festivals, as well as on our 
position and attitude, hoping that similar problems would not 
arise again in the Hong Kong International Film Festival. In 
this connection, Miss Wong also indicated her understanding of 
and respect for us. The two movies -- "The Days" and "Red 
Beans" -- have not been screened by our administration and have 
been taken out of the country without going through exit 
formalities in accordance with our relevant customs regulations. 
The fact that these two movies were invited to enter the film 
festival very obviously has breached the original promises made 
by the Hong Kong Film Festival and Miss Wong. Our requests are 
fair and reasonable and we do not have any alternative. 
  2. We have discussed this point in the section above. We 
consider the selection of movies to enter a film festival a 
matter of mutual support and respect, rather than an imposition 
of one party on the other. Moreover, we ought to uphold the 
relevant regulations on the administration of our film industry. 
Since these situations have emerged in the Tokyo Film Festival 
and other film festivals, we do not want them to recur in the 
Hong Kong Film Festival. Hence, it is reasonable to ask our 
cooperators to make promises. This is common sense. If you 
have different views, you also can give voice to them. However, 
since an agreement (be it oral or written) has been reached, 
both parties should observe and fulfill it. 
  3. We have never said that these two movies had any 
political problems. The key lies in the fact that movie 
producers have violated our relevant existing regulations. It 
is natural for us to handle these cases in accordance with 
relevant regulations. 
  4. Regarding the fact that the international film festival 
is going to show movies illegally produced without our 
administration's screening, our attitude toward and principle of 
handling this matter is consistent. 
  As the Hong Kong Film Festival has breached its promises, we 
can no longer cooperate with them. Hence, we have decided not 
to enter the current Hong Kong Film Festival. Since three 
Chinese movies were shown in the Tokyo Film Festival when 
negotiations were going on, it was insignificant to withdraw the 
movies. 
  5. You should raise this question with the person in charge 
of the Hong Kong Film Festival. Over so many years in the past, 
we have always taken a positively supportive and sincerely 
cooperative attitude toward the Hong Kong International Film 
Festival and never have done anything that violated any 
regulations laid down by the film festival. However, unhappy 
events have occured for three years in a row (N.B.), which 
cannot but cast a shadow and bring about a certain impact on our 
future cooperation. How great the impact will be must depend on 
the way the Hong Kong Film Festival handles this incident. 
  N.B. Apart from withdrawing movies this year, the 
unhappy events for three years in a row refer to an American 
independent producer's documentary called "Compassion in Exile," 
which was about the life of the Dalai Lama of Tibet. In the 
documentary, scenes were shown of Tibetans being beaten by 
People's Liberation Army soldiers, scenes which were shot 
secretly by Western journalists. At that time, the Chinese side 
lodged a protest with the Hong Kong Film Festival and asked for 
the banning of this documentary, but the film festival took no 
heed. This incident was widely covered by foreign news agencies. 
  This year, two independently produced movies have been 
selected by the Hong Kong Film Festival. Although the Chinese 
side has not lodged an official protest with the film festival, 
it may be considered one of the unhappy events mentioned in the 
letter.

  [Text] Maverick Hong Kong lawyer Liu Yiu-chu has become 
the first to quit Beijing's handpicked elite preparing for the 
1997 change of sovereignty. Ms Liu's resignation yesterday from 
the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) came as no surprise. 
She has long been an outspoken critic of the body, which 
oversees preparations for the transition. 
  In recent weeks, she had vocally criticised the nomination 
of 
pro-British Hong Kong personalities to the PWC. 
  Ms Liu had already threatened to resign on several 
occasions, 
at one time openly crying when forced to be seated next to a 
pro-British appointee during a meeting. Her resignation was 
accepted during an hour-long meeting with China's most senior 
official dealing with the territory, the director of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping. 
  "As a delegate to the NPC (National People's Congress), I 
have the responsibility to watch the work of the PWC and to give 
advice to the PWC," Ms Liu stated after her meeting with Mr Lu. 
"I think that's enough for me. In order to work better in the 
NPC, I want to resign as a member of the PWC." 
  Mr Lu will now formally report Ms Liu's resignation to the 
NPC Standing Committee. 
  When granted Mr Lu's approval to resign, it felt "just like 
a 
stone lifting up from my heart," Ms Liu said. But she warned 
that the Chinese government should not ignore the results of the 
1994-95 elections, the last ones under British rule.

  [Text] The cargo ship Tequila reported to have been 
hijacked by armed men from a speedboat inside Hong Kong waters 
on Sunday [20 March] is being held by Chinese authorities at 
Zhuhai, it was revealed last night. 
  A shipping agent, Leung Kam-hung, said that he had been 
assured by Chinese officials that the ship, the 14 crew and its 
cargo of second-hand cars would be released within three days. 
  "I have been told that they [the mainland officials] are 
checking the legitimacy of the cargo and will then release the 
ship," Leung said. "That cargo is clear and properly 
manifested. There is no problem." 
  How the Honduran-registered ship was "seized" south of Hong 
Kong island on Sunday evening is a mystery. "There are a lot of 
things about this which do not add up," one Hong Kong security 
source said. 
  Marine Police sent two launches to the aid of the Tequila 
after a distress call which said the vessel was under attack, 
apparently by armed men from a speedboat. Analysis of Marine 
Department and Marine Police records of radio messages and radar 
surveillance had shown no evidence of any incursion inside the 
territory's marine boundary by any speedboat at the time the 
Tequila disappeared. 
  The crew of another ship near the scene of the "incident," 
about 2.4 kilometres from Waglan Island, saw and heard nothing, 
the source said. "Smuggling is known to be a big problem and 
causing a lot of concern for China," he said. "The Chinese are 
known to blacklist certain ships. It could be that they had an 
agent on board who forced the ship to change course." 
  Leung, managing director of the Tequila's Hong Kong agents, 
Fitter Marine, said: "I do not know who exactly is holding the 
ship. 
  "I know they are officials. I cannot tell you more. There 
was a report from the ship that there was a speedboat and armed 
men. Otherwise, why would it have changed course?" Leung, who 
flew to Bejing this week to negotiate the release, said the 
Tequila was carrying 36 second-hand cars worth a total of $1.2m 
to Taiwan. 
  "This is the third trip the ship has made. We have had no 
problems before." Leung said the ship's captain was helping the 
mainland officials with their investigation. 
  The crew were still on board and being treated well.

  [Text] STAR TV viewers will lose the BBC World Service 
channel in less than a month, it was confirmed last night. 
  It will be replaced by 24-hour screening of Mandarin movies 
from April 17. 
  The decision follows the settlement out of court of a 
dispute 
between the BBC and STAR which arose shortly after media mogul 
Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling interest in STAR last summer. 
  Under the terms of the agreement, the transmission of the 
BBC's news and information channel on the northern beam of the 
satellite used by STAR -- serving Northeastern China, Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, Korea and Mongolia -- will cease. 
  Deputy director-general of the BBC Bob Phyllis said the 
corporation regretted the contraction or withdrawal of any of 
its services to worldwide audiences. 
  However, he said: "The agreement with STAR TV places no 
restriction on the BBC's future access to these major and 
important potential audiences and we will be doing everything 
possible to establish an alternative means of delivery to the 
peoples of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong at the earliest 
opportunity." 
  The World Service will continue to be transmitted on STAR's 
southern beam until March 31, 1996. This means most of 
Continental Asia, including India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, will 
still receive the service. 
  It has been suggested that Mr Murdoch was opposed to the 
editorial independence of the BBC. During a visit to India last 
month, he is reported to have said, in the wake of the BBC 
documentary on Mao Zedong, that the corporation was a liability. 
  Mr Murdoch has also accused the BBC of bias against China 
and 
India.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 17 (AFP)--STAR TV, the Asian 
satellite broadcaster controlled by media baron Rupert Murdoch, 
refused to comment Thursday on a press report that it plans to 
drop BBC World Service Television in favor of a Chinese movie 
channel. 
  "I don't want to speculate on it," a STAR TV spokesman said 
when questioned on the report in the latest issue of the Far 
Eastern Economic Review. 
  The newsmagazine said STAR TV -- which Murdoch's News Corp. 
Ltd. acquired last year for 525 million U.S. dollars -- would 
cease relaying the BBC to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in May in 
favor of the new movie service. The BBC would still be 
available to STAR TV viewers in other parts of Asia and in the 
Middle East, according to the report. 
  Media analysts believe Murdoch is keen to drop the BBC -- 
which enjoys editorial autonomy -- in favor of his Sky News 
channel, now seen in Europe. China strongly criticized the BBC 
last year for a critical documentary on late chairman Mao Zedong 
that was aired in Britain, although it has yet to be repeated on 
the BBC's Asian service.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 17 (AFP) -- China has strongly 
denied to a United Nations official that its security forces 
committed acts of piracy against commercial shipping in the 
South China Sea. "They do not accept that there have by any 
attacks (on shipping) by units belonging to the government," 
Thimio Mitropoulos of the UN's International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) told reporters Thursday. He said the 
officials he met in Beijing early this week insisted that if 
commercial shipping had been intercepted by Chinese security 
forces, it was only in the normal course of law enforcement, 
including anti-smuggling efforts. 
  Mitropoulos is in East Asia on a fact-finding mission ahead 
of a meeting of the IMO's marine safety committee, which he 
chairs, to discuss an upsurge of piracy in the South China Sea. 
During his stay in Hong Kong, the British administration gave 
him a list of nearly 100 reported attacks on shipping, many of 
them apparently committed by renegade Chinese naval and police 
units. 
  In Beijing, the official PEOPLE'S DAILY newspaper said China 
was drawing up strict guidelines for its maritime security 
forces to curb what it called the "chaotic state of some 
anti-smuggling units." But Mitropoulos said his hosts in China 
-- including the foreign and public security ministries -- never 
told him that new rules were in the pipeline. 
  Mitropoulos was proceeding to Manila on Thursday to continue 
his research before heading back to IMO headquarters in London.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Getting Tougher on Piracy"] </F>
  [Text] The government's failure to table a report on 
Chinese piracy at last year's International Maritime 
Organisation (IMO) meeting embarrassed the Marine Department, 
infuriated the shipping industry, and let Chinese authorities 
off the hook. The official excuse was that interceptions by 
representatives of a national authority could not be described 
as piracy. Such sophistry cut no ice with crews risking their 
lives in the South China Sea or with shippers facing damage to, 
or theft of, vessels and cargoes. 
  Aside from the ludicrous symbolism of forcing the IMO 
representative to hold a news conference in an airport 
lounge--as if this absolved Hong Kong from responsibility for 
hosting his visit-- the government has done better this time. 
Confidential papers describing Chinese official involvement in 
almost 50 attacks on shipping over the past 18 months have been 
handed to IMO Safety Committee chairman Admiral Thimio 
Mitropoulos. 
  For all the government's talk about preserving the integrity 
of the shipping lanes and maintaining Hong Kong's reputation as 
a safe port, this is the first time it has let international 
authorities do anything about it. For once, Foreign Office and 
Security Branch reservations about offending China or 
overstepping Hong Kong's jurisdiction have been set aside, 
giving the United Nations maritime body grounds for examination 
of China's behaviour on the high seas. 
  China's initial response to the release of the report has 
been positive. It said yesterday it would bring in new 
regulations to restore order to some anti-smuggling units. The 
words will have to be followed by firm action. But the fear 
that making the report public would cause a new rift with China 
has not been realised. Instead, there is pressure on China to 
curb piracy. What a pity it took the Hong Kong and British 
Governments so long to act.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Mediators from 
Guangzhou's many resident committees have helped patch up over 
9,000 cases of disputes between citizens in the past year, local 
police officials said here recently. 
  Through their mediation, they have prevented 76 crimes or 
suicides, which might have cost 22 lives, the officials said. 
  According to the officials, some 35 percent of these 
disputes 
were related to matrimonial or love affairs, from which quarrels 
easily arise and worsen into crimes. 
  The officials said disputes arising from unreasonable 
behavior in house decorating, noise from home karaoke 
performances and other entertainments also accounted for a large 
share of the mediators' work. 
  While applying traditional morals and laws, the officials 
said, the mediators also used psychological skills in clamping 
down on short-tempered displays by those involved in quarrels. 
  The mediators also helped resident committees organize 
entertainment, sports or mere talks between neighbors to promote 
understanding, harmony and friendship in communities, the 
officials added.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 14 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Last 
year, the Guangzhou City police seized 145.3 kg of heroin and 
over 3.9 kg of "ice" and investigated and punished over 6,500 
people involving in drug trafficking and drug abuse. 
  In reporting to the city people's congress, the Guangzhou 
City Public Security Bureau said that it also seized 1,425 guns 
of various kinds (of which 57 were designed for military use) 
and 3,237 bullets last year. 
  Data has shown that, last year, more than 32,000 people in 
Guangzhou were involved in gambling and were punished, and more 
than 9,700 people were investigated for being involved in 
prostitution, patronizing prostitutes, procuring prostitutes, 
and harboring prostitution. 
  Statistics have indicated that the total value of goods and 
money confiscated by the Guangzhou police in criminal cases 
amounts to more than 310 million yuan. 
  A Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau report says that the 
social order situation in Guangzhou remains quite grim. The 
number of serious criminal cases is increasing steadily, the 
damage resulting from organized crime is increasing day by day, 
and some criminal gangs are becoming underworld societies. 
Manifestations of the "vices in seven aspects" sometimes rise 
and sometimes fall. Road and fire accidents occur frequently. 
  Wang Long, deputy director of the Guangzhou City Public 
Security Bureau has revealed that the number of cases of missing 
cars is increasing day by day, and such cases have become an 
important part of criminal cases in Guangzhou. Last year, 965 
cars and more than 6,600 motor cycles were stolen in Guangzhou. 
  Deputy Bureau Director Wang Long said that, this year, the 
Guangzhou police will make great efforts to improve Guangzhou's 
social order and will curb the momentum in the rising number of 
major and serious cases, will send more policemen to patrol the 
streets, will arm traffic policemen so that they can take care 
of both traffic and social order, and will strengthen the 
management of people from other localities and mobilize the 
residents to set up "small security zones" to promote the 
comprehensive improvement of social order.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 12 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Guangdong 
Province made great efforts to develop the construction of basic 
port facilities and constantly reformed inspection work last 
year so that the comprehensive management level of ports was 
noticeably raised and the capacity of the ports to handle entry 
and exit passengers was greatly increased. 
  Weng Zongyong, director of the Port Office of the Guangdong 
Provincial People's Government, told this reporter that the 
number of entry and exit passengers passing through Guangdong 
Province's ports last year reached 71.384 million, the volume of 
imported and exported goods amounted to 11.51 million tonnes, 
and the number of vehicles used for transportation was 8.42 
million, respectively 5.6, 29.9, and 10.1 percent up on the 
previous year. The total amount of tariffs collected in all 
Guangdong's ports reached 6.32 billion yuan, and the amount of 
unified industrial and commercial tax collected for other 
departments was 4.44 billion yuan, respectively 12.3 and 21 
percent up on the previous year, a record high for both. 
  According to Weng, the number of ports completed and 
officially open to foreign countries last year in Guangdong 
Province was the highest for many years. These ports are the 
through-train railroad station in Foshan, Shenzhen Airport, 
Nansha Port, Huizhou Port, Xinhui Port, and two other ports of 
the first category. In addition, 13 ports in the second 
category were also newly built. 
  It is learned that by the end of last year, the number of 
sea, land, and air ports of the first category in Guangdong 
Province approved by the State Council for opening to foreign 
countries had reached 44, and there were 153 ports of the second 
category approved by Guangdong Province. At present, 20 cities 
at the prefectural level and 73 counties (districts) in 
Guangdong Province have set up ports or port inspection organs. 
This has created a favorable environment for Guangdong Province 
to open wider to the outside world and to speed up economic 
construction.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 22 (CNS) -- Mayor of Shenzhen Mr. 
Li Youwei, speaking today at the sixth meeting of the First 
Municipal People's Congress, said that Shenzhen would take 
positive measures to rectify existing problems. 
  Mayor Li said that the city was still facing some problems 
despite the good results achieved last year. The outstanding 
problem was the grim public order situation with an increase in 
serious criminal cases. The management level over the city was 
not commensurate with the economic development there and this 
resulted in frequent big accidents. There were arduous tasks to 
be done in ensuring safety in the workplace and in protecting 
workers' legal interests and rights. The high inflation rate 
had affected the residents' lives and the industrial structure 
was not reasonable and needed to be adjusted while the pace of 
the transferring of government functions, macro-control and 
administration were not able to meet the demands of development 
of a market economy. All these problems, he added, would be 
solved this year.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- Shenzhen and Zhuhai 
have proposed to allow foreigners to enter the territory without 
entry visas provided that the period of their stay does not 
exceed 72 hours. The applications are awaiting approval from 
the State Council. It has been reported that the central 
authorities intend to make an experiment in Shenzhen. 
  Shenzhen's Mayor Li Youwei and Zhuhai's Mayor Liang Guangda 
said today that the two cities had submitted applications to the 
central authorities. Liang Guangda added: It has been learned 
that relevant central ministries and offices, including the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Office for Port Administration, and 
Economic and Trade Office [as published] have been to Shenzhen 
and Zhuhai to conduct on-the-spot study. They are considering 
making an experiment in Shenzhen first and summing up the 
experience some time afterward. 
  Answering a reporter, Li Youwei said: Shenzhen is advancing 
as an international financial city. That is why we made the 
above proposal and are awaiting instructions from the State 
Council.

  [Text] A shortage of manpower has left a "large batch" of 
files on major corruption cases in Shenzhen unopened, according 
to the anti-graft boss of the Special Economic Zone. 
  Last year, Shenzhen spent 186 million yuan (HK$165.2 
million), about five per cent of the SEZ's total expenditure, on 
public security, the judiciary and procuratorate. 
  This figure, a tiny amount compared with the SEZ's budget 
for 
infrastructure which stands at 1.3 billion yuan, is already an 
87.87 percent increase on 1992. In his report to Shenzhen's 
anticorruption meeting last week, Mo Huashu, secretary of 
Shenzhen's Commission for Discipline Inspection urged party and 
government officials of all levels to place more emphasis on 
anti-graft work. 
  "In Shenzhen's anti-corruption drive there are aspects which 
are still far from satisfactory," he said. 
  And in his report to Shenzhen's People's Congress which 
opened on Tuesday, Mayor Li Youwei underscored the importance of 
clean government. He said yesterday that the number of 
government officials and heads of enterprises who had run off 
with public money had dropped sharply in the wake of the 
crackdown. More than 21 had been arrested last year alone and 
the Public Security Bureau had caught a total of 40 in the past 
two years, he said. About 80 had fled in that time. 
  "It doesn't matter whether they have been on the run a long 
time. nor how far they have gone. Even if they have gone to 
countries with which we have no diplomatic relation, we can get 
them back," Mr Li said with confidence. Among the 40-odd 
arrested were a former head of the finance and trade department 
of Shenzhen's Planning Bureau. The money involved in some cases 
amounted to millions of yuan. 
  Mr Mo said that in the last four months of last year a total 
of 2,832 complaints of corruption were made an increase of 102 
percent over the same period in 1992. Of the 167 cases that had 
been closed, 67 percent were classed as serious. 
  Authorities were also investigating 52 cases involving 
senior 
officials, about five times more than in the previous year, he 
said.

  [Text] Shenzhen has decided to postpone construction of a 
second runway for Huangtian airport. 
  Last year, the Shenzhen Government said a second runway 
should be built on reclaimed land. 
  But yesterday, in his report to the Shenzhen Chinese 
People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), vice-chairman Liu Bo 
said many deputies thought one runway was enough and a second 
might not be urgently needed -- at least in the next 10 years. 
  It would require a lot of money and too early a start would 
put a strain on the Government's capital for infrastructure 
projects, Mr Liu said. 
  However, William Man, a Hong Kong deputy to the Shenzhen 
CPPCC Standing Committee, and chairman of Yuen Long District 
Board's Transport Advisory Committee, said construction for the 
second runway should go ahead. 
  Because completion of Hong Kong's new airport before 1997 
looked unlikely Shenzhen airport could be used to ease 
congestion, Mr Man said. 
  He suggested building an international airport terminal at 
Shenzhen airport and connecting it with the Lok Ma Chau border 
checkpoint by a 25-kilometre enclosed highway. 
  Hong Kong Customs could be transferred to the Shenzhen 
terminal and the problem of transport between Hong Kong and the 
areas beyond the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone would be solved.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 24 (XINHUA) -- Ground was broken 
Wednesday [23 March] for three large construction projects in 
the Futian Bonded Zone of this south China boom town 
simultaneously. 
  The largest of the three is the Shenzhen International 
Commercial Center, a cooperative venture between a Canadian 
company and the bonded zone. It consists of two 48-story 
buildings, one 20-story five-star hotel and a host of five-story 
buildings, with a total floor space of some 180,000 sq km. 
  The other two projects are a Hong Kong-funded storage 
building and the 30,000-sq-km Changbao Mansion. 
  According to official sources, the improvement in the 
infrastructure of the bonded zone over the past three years has 
drawn an increasing number of investors. 
  Statistics show that the 19 projects already started in the 
zone involve a total of more than 5.5 billion Hong Kong dollars 
in overseas investment. 
  Over 120 trading companies are ready to start business. 
  The head of the bonded zone said a series of 
foreign-invested 
projects are expected to be launched there this year.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Shenzhen, China's 
first special economic zone, has opened its bonded capital goods 
market to foreign-funded enterprises, the city's Mayor Li Youwei 
announced here today. 
  Mayor Li told a press conference that the bonded capital 
goods market will become a national market where prices are 
about five to ten percent lower than those on the world market. 
  Foreign investors in China can buy whatever imported 
products 
they need in Shenzhen instead of going abroad so as to lower 
production costs, he added. 
  The Shenzhen bonded capital goods market has 12 affiliates 
specializing in various kinds of capital goods, with a total 
transaction reaching 400 million U.S. dollars in 1993. 
  The opening of the market, he said, will help bring the role 
of the city as a coastal special economic zone and an economic 
information center into fuller play.

  [Text] In response to the central Government's call to 
cool the overheated economy Shenzhen plans to lower its economic 
growth to 24.5 per cent and keep inflation below 15 per cent 
this year. 
  The two figures are only slightly lower than last year but 
still much higher than the national average set by Beijing nine 
per cent economic growth and 10 per cent inflation. 
  In his report to the Sixth Plenum of the Shenzhen People's 
Congress which opened yesterday, Mayor Li Youwei said that the 
Special Economic Zone's (SEZ) total output value this year would 
stand at 51.5 billion yuan (HK$45.73 billion) [Hong Kong 
dollars], a 24.5 per cent increase over last year's -- a milder 
but still significant increase compared with 30 per cent growth 
in 1992. 
  Mr Li said that inflation would be kept below 15 per cent 
compared with 19.9 per cent in 1993. Soaring inflation had been 
a major headache for Chinese leaders who saw it as the source 
for social discontent and potential disorder. Mr Li said that 
the Government faced the arduous task of keeping prices stable 
because the central Government planned to implement a number of 
important reforms. He said pricing departments must strengthen 
control over prices of basic necessities and services 
particularly the so-called "vegetable basket" and the "rice bag" 
for consumers. 
  And according to an SEZ Finance Bureau official Chen Xitao, 
Shenzhen will allocate 10 million yuan to subsidise prices, a 
staggering increase of 153 per cent over 1993. 
  Despite steady economic growth last year, Mr Li said social 
order had deteriorated to an alarming level with an increase in 
serious crime. Corruption, particularly that involving 
government officials, remained a major concern. Also of concern 
was the need for a better monitoring system. Public securities, 
legal and judicial forces would also be strengthened and 
improved, with more people, better equipment and in tense 
training, he said. 
  The SEZ government would pool resources to clamp down on 
serious crime, like murder, robbery kidnapping and triad 
activities. A system to make public securities' officials more 
accountable would be introduced to improve their performance. 
Shenzhen also planned to tighten control on migrants? Labour 
and housing management to control unauthorised workers in the 
city. Mr Li said. 
  The mayor made only one reference to the Qinshuihe explosion 
in August and the Zhili factory fire in November in Kwairong 
which killed 84 workers. 
  Instead of reporting on the investigation of these two 
accidents, he only called for better safety precautions. 
Meanwhile, Mr Li revealed in his report that 86 government 
officials including more than 30 senior one had been punished 
for corruption or unlawful conduct last year and 68 party cadres 
had been ordered to sever their relationship with various 
companies. 
  Mr Li told delegates that 192 administrative charges had 
been 
cancelled and other unlawful charges and penalities checked.

  [Text] Wuhan, March 23 (XINHUA) -- A new form of 
notarization -- notarization of technological and scientific 
documents -- is booming in this capital of central China's Hubei 
Province. 
  In the past two years the practice of notarization of 
technological contracts has caught on in Wuhan. 
  Last year there were a total of 862 science and technology 
trade contracts handled by notaries public, nearly 40 times more 
than in 1991. 
  The volume of trade notarized has reached over 12 million 
yuan (about 1.3 million U.S. dollars)-worth in the city. 
  Wuhan boasts 35 universities and colleges, and nearly 500 
scientific institutes which are active in research and 
technological development. 
  In order to strengthen mutual trust in the course of 
technology trade, notary offices first started experiments with 
scientific and technological trade documents in 1991. 
  For example, in 1992 the Wuhan Jianmin Pharmaceuticals 
Factory spent 350,000 yuan to buy the technology for making a 
new medicine from an army hospital. Both sides were somewhat 
worried about the result of the completion of the contract. 
  But the notarization of the contract put them at ease. The 
new product helped the factory achieve an output value of 3.81 
million yuan (about 400,000 U.S. dollars) last year. It has 
already been exported to Southeast Asian countries.

  [Text] Wuhan, March 24 (XINHUA) -- A highway bridge will be 
built over the Chang Jiang River in central China's Hubei 
Province, officials from the provincial transport department 
said here today. 
  The officials said the State Planning Commission has 
approved 
the plan to build the bridge crossing the river at the border 
between Jingzhou and Shashi cities on the north bank and Gongan 
County on the south bank. 
  The bridge will connect with the No. 207 National Highway 
connecting Inner Mongolia and Guangdong, and the No. 318 
National Highway connecting Shanghai and Lhasa. 
  According to the officials, the prestressed stay-cable 
bridge 
will be 4,015 m long and 24 to 25 m wide, with six lanes. It 
will allow a clear height of 18 m for navigation at the highest 
water level. 
  Investment for the bridge is estimated at 1.13 billion yuan. 
The officials hope that the overseas economic cooperation fund 
of Japan will be able to provide a loan of 60 million U.S. 
dollars. The rest of the money will be provided by the local 
government. 
  Construction of the bridge is expected to start in 1995 and 
be completed in five years, the officials said. 
  It is believed that the bridge will greatly boost the 
economic development of the area, which is reputed as one of 
China's most important producers of grain, cotton and oil plants.

  [Text] Yichang, February 27 (XINHUA) -- The construction of 
China's largest water conservancy scheme, the Three Gorges 
Project, has boosted real estate development in the project area. 
  Both domestic and overseas real estate investors are 
optimistic about the prospects for and potential of the real 
estate market there. 
  Yichang, the city in Central China's Hubei Province, next to 
the project, had 156 real estate development companies by the 
end of 1993. 
  Some 890,000 sq m of houses were built last year, 2.3 times 
more than in the previous year. 
  Of the real estate firms set up in Yichang, 30 are 
Sino-foreign companies which have imported funds amounting to 
one billion yuan (about 90 million U.S. dollars). 
  The city now has 329 construction companies with over 40,000 
workers building houses. 
  The Chinese Government plans to invest five billion yuan 
(about 510 million U.S. dollars) in the Three Gorges project, 
which is scheduled to take 17 years to complete. 
  Yichang has an ambitious plan to turn this medium-sized city 
into a big one along the Chang Jiang River by the end of the 
century. It has stepped up infrastructure and real estate 
progress, according to Liu Xuhui, head of the city construction 
committee. 
  It plans to carry out an upgrading project on 67 ha of old 
urban areas, and build a number of residential areas, holiday 
villages and six million sq m of new houses in the next three 
years, Liu said.

  [Text] The enlarged sixth plenary session of the 
provincial discipline inspection commission opened in Changsha 
yesterday. The session was convened to relay and implement the 
spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Committee and arrange for Hunan's anticorruption work 
in 1994. 
  Yesterday's meeting was attended by more than 600 people, 
including provincial party, government, and military leaders, 
such as Wang Maolin, Yang Zhengwu, Yang Minzhi, Luo Haifan, Wang 
Keying, Wen Xuande, Shen Ruiting, Zhou Shichang, Zhuo Kangning, 
Liu Tingying, and Huang Shigen; provincial discipline inspection 
commission members; prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and 
city party committee secretaries or deputy secretaries in charge 
of discipline inspection work; prefectural, autonomous 
prefectural, and city discipline inspection commission 
secretaries and supervision bureau chiefs; leading party group 
secretaries, discipline inspection group leaders or secretaries, 
and supervision office directors of the units directly under the 
provincial authorities; retired veteran leaders of the 
provincial discipline inspection commission and supervision 
department; and other leaders. 
  Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Yang Minzhi, 
provincial party committee standing committee member and 
provincial discipline inspection commission secretary. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin delivered 
an 
important speech divided into the following three parts: 
  1. Conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin's important 
speech as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 
Central Discipline Inspection Committee. 
  2. Fruitfully, consistently, and profoundly carry out the 
anticorruption struggle. 
  3. Further Strengthen leadership over the anticorruption 
struggle. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin emphatically stated in his speech: In 
order to implement to the letter the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee, we 
should first and foremost appraise the anticorruption struggle 
in the previous period, strengthen confidence in the 
anticorruption struggle, and profoundly and protractedly carry 
on the anticorruption struggle. At the moment, we should 
further heighten and unify understanding in this connection, 
this being of paramount importance. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin pointed out: We should see to it that 
leading cadres at all levels in Hunan continually remain honest 
and strictly abide by discipline in discharging official duties. 
To this end, the provincial, prefectural, autonomous 
prefectural, and county party committees leaders, as well as the 
principal party and government leaders at all levels in the 
province, should take the lead and set a good example in the 
anticorruption struggle. We should waste no time in 
investigating and handling major and serious corruption cases, 
severely punish corrupt elements, and resolutely put an end to 
those malpractices that have caused strong resentment among the 
broad masses of people. To this end, first and foremost, we 
should make continued efforts to wipe out all unreasonable 
administrative charges and service fees. Second, we should 
strictly investigate and handle cases of commercializing the 
party and state powers as well as such cases as distortion, 
blackmail, holding banquets at public expense, demanding gifts, 
and so on. Third, we should make continued efforts to put an 
end to such malpractices as making overseas and domestic trips 
at public expense. Fourth, we should be cautious in handing 
economic entities run by party or government organs. Fifth, we 
should strictly investigate and ban such malpractices as party 
and government organs or functionaries using, by abusing their 
powers, vehicles, computers, telephones, and other types of 
equipment of enterprises without compensation and such 
malpractices as party and government organs making unauthorized 
use of enterprises' funds under various pretexts for their own 
financial purposes. Moreover, we should make redoubled efforts 
to eradicate such malpractices as party or government organs 
making unauthorized use of public funds to decorate offices and 
residences or installing central air-conditioners and 
residential telephone lines, and resolutely put an end to 
extravagance and waste as well. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin asserted: The enterprises should also 
step up clean government building and wipe out all sorts of 
corrupt phenomena. In combating corruption, we should make 
persistent efforts to rectify and eradicate each and every 
malpractice by looking into both root causes and symptoms. The 
anticorruption struggle conforms, he noted, with the fundamental 
interests of the party and state and enjoys popular support 
among the people. So long as we strictly follow the basic work 
principles worked out by the central authorities, unswervingly 
rely on the party organizations and the broad masses of people, 
and work with one heart and one mind and in a down-to-earth 
manner, we will certainly be able to attain more tangible 
results in the first-stage anticorruption struggle in 1994, 
thereby making due contributions to the overall work of the 
party!

  [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- Taiwan has won the right 
to host an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) seminar on 
trade promotion and financing of small and medium sized 
enterprises Jan. 18-21, 1995, the government reported Saturday 
[19 March]. 
  Lin Yi-fu, deputy director of the Board of Foreign Trade 
(BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that nearly 
60 delegates from the 17 APEC members, including Mainland China, 
are expected to attend the meeting. 
  Discussion will focus on export-import loans, financial 
planning, and the development of small and medium sized 
businesses, Lin pointed out. 
  To prepare for the 1995 seminar, a task force comprising 
officials from the BOFT, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
China External Trade Development Council, and the China 
Productivity Center will be formed. Lin will head the task 
force. 
  Observers here noted that Taiwan is well qualified to host 
the meeting as its successful experience in the development of 
small and medium sized enterprises has won recognition from the 
international community. 
  Taiwan should also bid to host an APEC ministerial level 
meeting on small and medium sized businesses, the observers 
suggested. 
  The first APEC ministerial level meeting in this regard will 
be held in Tokyo early October. Economic Affairs Minister P.K. 
Chiang will represent Taiwan at the meeting. 
  Meanwhile, Wu Jong-yi, president of the private Taiwan 
Institute of Economic Research, said that he helped promote 
Taiwan's bid to host an APEC senior officials' meeting in Taipei. 
  Wu made the remark late Friday prior to his departure for 
Kuala Lumpur, where he will join 12 other delegates from the 
United States, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Hong Kong, 
and Mainland China at a senior officials' meeting March 19-20. 
  APEC is scheduled to hold four senior officials' meetings 
this year. The second meeting will take place in Hong Kong in 
early June and Taiwan hopes to host the third or fourth meeting, 
Wu said. 
  The Kuala Lumpur meeting will focus on the liberalization of 
global trade, he added.

  [Text] The 11-member Taipei delegation on Sunday [20 
March] prepared to return from the two-day meeting of 
Asic-Pacific Economic Copperation finance ministers in Honolulu, 
Hawaii, after making significant progress in developing close

  [Text] Taipei, March 24 (CNA) -- An eight-member Taiwan 
delegation, headed by Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-you of 
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), left for Beijing Thursday 
[24 March] for talks with Mainland Chinese officials on some 
technical issues arising from increasing cross-Taiwan Strait 
exchanges. 
  Hsu said prior to his departure he will meet with officials 
of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS) on three issues -- repatriation of illegal 
mainland immigrants and hijackers as well as a solution to 
cross-strait fishing disputes. 
  The talks will begin Friday and continue through March 30. 
If necessary, Hsu said, the schedule may be extended for one or 
two days. 
  "We are hopeful the talks will be fruitful and help pave the 
way for closer bilateral cooperation in the future," Hsu noted. 
  It will be the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks on the three 
thorny issues since the heads of the two semi-official 
intermediary organizations met in Singapore last April. The 
first three rounds were held in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei 
during the second half of last year. 
  Hsu said although the two sides managed to reach consensus 
on 
some points in the previous rounds of talks, fundamental 
political differences still hinder the signing of a final 
agreement on the three non-political issues. 
  Nevertheless, Hsu said, the two sides reaffirmed their 
commitment to resolve the problems during a high-level meeting 
between SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho and his ARATS counterpart 
Tang Shubei in Beijing in early February. 
  Beijing's reluctance to recognize Taiwan's jurisdiction over 
the territories now under its control has been the greatest 
obstacle to reaching an agreement on the three basically 
administrative issues, local political observers said. 
  Hsu said he believes the Chiao-Tang meeting will speed 
proceedings at the coming talks. "I also hope Beijing will show 
its sincerity so that the talks can produce concrete results," 
he added. 
  According to a joint news statement issued at the end of the 
Chiao-Tang talks, if the two sides can reach agreements on the 
three topics, Tang Shubei will visit Taipei to sign a formal 
accord. 
  Many illegal mainland immigrants have been forced to remain 
at two detention centers in northern Taiwan for long periods of 
time because of Beijing's recalcitrance. Repeated hijackings of 
mainland commercial airliners to Taiwan have also created 
problems for Taiwan. Eleven hijackings took place since last 
April. Taiwan hopes the two issues can be resolved soon.

  [Text] Taipei, March 23 (CNA) -- An eight-member 
delegation of Japanese parliamentarians, led by Kei Imoue of 
Japan's Social Democratic Party, visited Legislative Yuan 
President Tiu Sung-fan Wednesday [23 March]. 
  The Japanese are here to discuss Japan's reparations to 
Taiwan soldiers drafted by the Japanese Government to fight 
abroad during World War II, when Taiwan was still under the 
Japanese occupation. 
  Big differences remain between the two sides, with the 
Japanese side only willing to discuss six issues, including the 
amount of the soldiers' back salaries, their bank deposits, and 
insurance payments still due them, Liu said after the meeting. 
  Given that the Japanese Government has said it would 
compensate only 20 times the face value of the bank deposits, 
and the Taiwan side is demanding a 7,000-fold return, more 
rounds of talks will be needed to bridge the huge gap, Liu said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 23 KYODO -- Japanese and Taiwanese 
lawmakers failed to come to terms in talks Wednesday [23 March] 
over the issue of some 452.4 million yen of unsettled debts, 
including postal savings deposited by Taiwanese before and 
during World War II. 
  Japanese sources said the talks between a nonpartisan group 
of eight Japanese parliamentarians, who arrived in Taipei on 
Tuesday, and 18 Taiwanese counterparts would continue. 
  Japan occupied Taiwan from 1885 to 1945. Before and during 
the war it forced people in Taiwan to deposit part of their 
monthly salaries in postal savings accounts. 
  According to a Japanese Government estimate, the postal 
savings deposits, postal annuities and unpaid salaries totaled 
452.4 million yen, owing to some 2,547,000 people. 
  Japan has voiced its intention to refund the unpaid money 
from the fiscal 1995 state budget beginning in April 1995. 
  But many Taiwanese hope to link the unpaid money to 
indexing, 
saying the value has risen by about 4,500 times from 1943 on the 
basis of Japanese public servant salaries. 
  Sources said the issue is to be handled the same way the 
government repaid the savings of Okinawa residents deposited 
before the war. The government reimbursed 94 million yen in 
savings to the residents, adding 339 million yen to the 
principal as indexing.

  [Text] Taipei, March 24 KYODO -- Taiwan President Li 
Teng-hui called Thursday [24 March] for improved ties with 
Japan, telling a group of Japanese parliamentarians he wants to 
see the Japanese people develop better feelings about their 
neighbors to the south. 
  Members of the inter-party group of eight Japanese 
legislators said Li made the remarks in a 45-minute meeting with 
them. 
  The group arrived in Taipei on Tuesday to discuss the issue 
of some 452.4 million yen of unsettled debts, including postal 
savings deposited by Taiwanese before and during World War II. 
  Their talks on the issue Wednesday with 18 Taiwan 
legislators 
headed by Liu Sung-pan, head of the National Assembly, ended 
inconclusively. 
  Li was quoted as thanking the Japanese parliamentarians for 
facing the tough issue head-on, despite tough remarks directed 
at them by the Taiwanese side. 
  Such remarks, he said, probably stem from dissatisfaction 
with the Japanese Government's "cool" stance towards Taiwan 
after Taiwan severed relations with Japan in 1972. 
  He noted that Taiwan, unlike other former Japanese colonial 
possessions, has not brought up with Japan the issue of 
compensation for women who were forced to provide sex for 
frontline Japanese soldiers during the war.

  [Text] Taipei, March 24 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui is 
not likely to visit Russia in early April, a presidential office 
spokesman said Thursday [24 March]. 
  The spokesman made the statement after the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs confirmed it has received a letter from Russia's 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party inviting President Li to 
attend the party's fifth national congress scheduled to open 
April 2. 
  The spokesman said President Li is willing to visit any 
country as long as such visit is in the nation's interest. But, 
he said, it takes time to arrange Li's overseas trips. 
  "So I don't think it is feasible for our president to accept 
the Russian party's invitation at the moment," he noted. 
  Earlier in the day, a Foreign Ministry official said the 
invitation from Russia's largest opposition party lacks the 
necessary imprimatur of the Russian Government. 
  "It takes the Russian Government's endorsement before Li can 
visit," said Lo Jih-yuan, director of the ministry's West Asian 
Affairs Department. 
  "It remains unclear whether the Russian Government would 
approve our president's visit," Lo noted. Taiwan doesn't 
maintain diplomatic relations with Russia. 
  Li made unofficial visits to the Philippines, Indonesia and 
Thailand in February. Although the three Southeast Asian 
countries do not have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, they treated 
Li as a national guest. 
  The largest Russian opposition party said in its letter, 
signed by its chairman, the controversial Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
that its leaders hope to discuss with Li international affairs 
and prospects for Taiwan-Russian cooperation, particularly in 
economic and cultural fields. 
  It also said if Li cannot attend the party congress, he is 
welcome to visit Russia at any time.

  [Text] Taipei, March 23 (CNA) -- Russian scientists are 
flocking to Taiwan for work, a National Science Council (NSC) 
official reported Wednesday [23 March]. 
  Twenty-three Russian scientists are now teaching or doing 
research at various Taiwan universities, accounting for 
one-tenth of the total number of foreign high-technology 
personnel the NSC hires annually, said NSC Vice Chairman Hu 
Ching-piao. 
  The cabinet-level council has received many job applications 
from Russia in the past two years, Hu said. "The Russians have 
mostly applied for teaching and research jobs in Taiwan," he 
added. 
  "The increase in the number of job seekers from Russia may 
be 
prompted by higher pay here," Hu noted. 
  Hu, who visited Russia last June as the head of a delegation 
of Taiwan officials and scientists, pointed out that Russia is 
highly advanced in such high-tech fields as material sciences, 
optoelectronics and aerospace engineering. 
  "Taiwan will benefit from strengthening technological 
exchanges with Russia," Hu said. 
  He noted that language barriers and Russian red tape may be 
the two greatest obstacles to promoting Taiwan-Russian 
scientific and technological exchanges. 
  Hu said the NSC is considering setting up a representative 
office in Moscow to facilitate bilateral technological 
cooperation and recruitment of Russia scientists. 
  Meanwhile, the government-funded Industrial Technology 
Research Institute said it will send officials to Russia in May 
to recruit Russian engineers and technicians to work for private 
enterprises here. 
  A group of senior executives from Russian small and medium 
sized businesses is scheduled to visit Taiwan in may to seek 
possible trade and joint-venture opportunities, NSC sources said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 23 (CNA) -- Acting to ease the 
soaring demand for construction workers in northern Taiwan, 
local contractory increased the pace with which they hired 
foreign laborers last year, the Taipei city government's 
Department of Labor reported. 
  According to statistics released recently by the department, 
5,830 overseas laborers were imported to Taiwan last year, up 
from the 2,300 recruited in 1992. The number of construction 
firms that applied for imported labor jumped to 38 from 17 
during the same period. 
  Of the 5,830 imports, 5,500, or 95 percent were from 
Thailand, 252 from the Philippines, 18 from Indonesia, and 11 
from Malaysia, Council of Labor Affairs officials said. 
  The officials attributed the increased demand to the ongoing 
construction of Taipei's mass rapid transit system and a booming 
housing market islandwide. 
  Council tallies show that 75,700 foreign laborers have been 
imported to Taiwan through legal channels, but if illegal 
laborers are included, that figure is thought to be more than 
130,000. 
  Although foreign laborers have been indispensable to the 
local labor market, their existence has also promoted social 
concerns. For example, 26 foreign workers returned to their 
countries last year without completing contracts with their 
Taiwan employers, a sign that the foreign laborers are having 
trouble adjusting to life here. 
  In addition, some private foreign workers service centers 
are 
reportedly offering sex services at fees as low as NT$50 (US$2) 
to NT$300, with many of the women employed in this line of work 
entering Taiwan through clandestine transportation networks.

  [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- Bhutanese Princess Dekiy 
Wangchuck, arrested last September for attempting to smuggle 22 
rhino horns and nine bear gall bladders into Taiwan, was 
sentenced to 10 months in jail Friday [18 March]. 
  Wangchuck, 43, had been detained by the Taoyuan District 
Court since last Sept. 18 on charges of smuggling endangered 
species products and violating the wildlife conservation laws. 
  Although Wangchuck holds a diplomatic passport, the 
prosecutors said the case was handled according to ordinary 
criminal procedures to demonstrate the government's 
determination in cracking down on smuggling and illegal trade in 
endangered species and related products. Taiwan and Bhutan do 
not have formal diplomatic ties. 
  Police seized the 22 rhino horns, weighing 14.8 kilograms 
and 
nine bear gall bladders, reportedly worth US$300,000 on the 
Taiwan market, when Wangchuck arrived at Chiang Kai-shek 
International Airport from Hong Kong Sept. 17, 1993.

  [Text] Geneva, March 21 (CNA) -- South Africa supports 
Taiwan's early entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), a South African representative said here Monday 
[21 March]. 
  Abraham Roodt, deputy head of the South African mission at 
the GATT headquarters, made the statement while meeting with a 
Taiwan delegation for tariff-reduction talks under the GATT 
framework. 
  During the talks, Roodt asked Taiwan to cut tariff rates on 
22 agricultural and 126 industrial products in accordance with 
GATT requirements. 
  Roodt complained that South Africa has been unable to raise 
agricultural exports to Taiwan because Taiwan maintains quota 
and area restrictions on farm imports. 
  "We hope Taiwan can raise annual import quota for our apples 
and allow our grapes and grapefruit to enter its market," Roodt 
said. Taiwan currently allows annual importation of 500 tons of 
South African apples. 
  In response, Huang Yen-chao, head of the Taiwan delegation, 
said Taiwan has decided to remove quota and area restrictions on 
farm imports after it gains GATT membership. "We'll instead 
regulate farm imports with a tariff system," said Huang, also 
director- general of the Board of Foreign Trade. 
  This was the first round of Taiwan-South African tariff 
talks 
in connection with Taiwan's bid to join the Geneva-based world 
trade regulatory body. As the two countries have maintained 
close relations, Huang said, the talks proceeded under a 
"friendly, pleasant" atmosphere. The two sides will hold 
further discussions later this year. 
  Earlier in the day, the Taiwan delegation also held tariff- 
reduction talks with its Hungarian counterpart. Hungary was the 
second country that expressed the intention to hold bilateral 
tariff-reduction talks with Taiwan after the United States. 
  The Hungarian mission, headed by Aniko Ivanka, a senior 
secretary in charge of economic affairs at the Hungarian GATT 
office, asked Taiwan to cut tariff rates on 28 agricultural and 
34 industrial products, including auto parts, engines, meat and 
dairy products. 
  Huang told hungarian delegates that large quantities of 
Hungarian auto parts have entered Taiwan, indicating that Taiwan 
has not discriminated against Hungarian products. 
  The two sides agreed to meet again later this year to 
further 
discuss tariff and non-tariff problems. They also agreed to 
promote bilateral trade and economic cooperation. 
  The Taiwan delegation arrived in Geneva Sunday for tariff- 
reduction talks with six countries, including Hungary, South 
Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Turkey. 
  Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and 
is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.

  [Text] Johannesburg, March 22 (CNA) -- South African 
police on Tuesday [22 March] rapped Britain's Environmental 
Investigation Agency (EIA) for falsely accusing a Taiwan 
diplomat of involvement in rhino horn trade. 
  Pieter Lategan, chief of the Endangered Species Protection 
Unit (ESPU) under the South African Police Administration, said 
the Republic of China [ROC] Embassy and the Republic of China's 
National Police Administration have worked closely with the ESPU 
on wildlife protection. 
  None of the embassy officials or vehicles were ever involved 
in rhino horn smuggling, Lategan said. 
  Moreover, he noted, no one from the ESPU has ever been 
interviewed by the EIA. 
  The South African official said he has phoned the EIA to 
express his strong dissatisfaction at the accusations. In 
addition, he has sent a letter to the London-based conservation 
group requesting a detailed explanation of the accusations. 
  During a meeting of non-government organizations (NGO) 
following the Standing Committee meeting of the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Geneva 
Monday, the EIA aired a 20-minute videotape, in which a South 
African policeman charged Taiwan envoys with smuggling rhino 
horns. 
  A statement issued by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Tuesday said the man accused of rhino horn smuggling was not a 
diplomat but an Overseas Chinese who once worked as a member of 
the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog body. 
  The man, Yen Nuo, was [word indistinct] in South Africa in 
February 1986 for illegally trading in rhino horns, but was 
found not guilty as Yen had a license to sell rhino horns issued 
by the South African Government. 
  Meanwhile, a report from Geneva said the CITES Standing 
Committee has decided to ignore the EIA's accusations.

  [text] Taipei, March 18 (CNA) -- The government on Friday 
[18 March] pledged to accelerate the development of the Changhua 
Coastal Industrial Zone in central Taiwan, where 15 domestic 
steelmakers are planning to establish a steel complex. 
  Officials of the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under 
the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the bureau recently 
gave a green light to the building of a large thermal power 
plant in the zone by the state-run Taiwan Power Company. 
  Completion of the power plant will help ensure a sufficient 
supply of electricity in the industrial zone, the officials 
stressed. 
  The IDB will do its best to continue building the reclaimed 
land in Changhua County into an industrial area in order to meet 
the strong demand in Taiwan for land suitable for industrial 
purposes, they said. 
  A total of 83 manufacturers of everything from precision 
machinery to computers [words indistinct] applied to open plants 
in the industrial zone, they added. 
  Meanwhile, the Taiwan Steel and Iron Industries Association 
announced that 15 steelmakers have decided to join hands to 
build a steel complex in the zone. 
  Coordinated efforts will help reduce development costs of 
the 
steel complex, thereby increasing the competitiveness of the 
domestic steelmakers, he elaborated. 
  He said the complex will help make Taiwan self-sufficient in 
steel. Taiwan imported 15 million tons of steel products last 
year, making it the world' third-largest steel importing country. 
  The spokesman said that the 15 steelmakers are planning to 
invest NT$30 [New Taiwan dollars] billion (us$1.13 billion) in 
the five-year project, which will occupy an area of about 200 
hectares for the production of a dozen steel products. 
  The IDB officials, however, said that they cannot promise 
that the steel complex will be completed as planned by the 
steelmakers because construction of the industrial zone itself 
might cost more money and take longer than expected.

  [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- In a new bid to help 
address Taiwan's snowballing trade deficit with Japan, a market 
development and technology transfer center will be established 
on July 1, economics officials said Saturday [19 March] 
  Promoted by C.F. Koo, chairman of the Taiwan-Japan Economic 
and Trade Development Foundation, and Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang, the center aims to push for trade and technological 
cooperation between the two countries, they noted. 
  The center will coordinate domestic efforts to seek 
technology transfers from Japan, which could be achieved through 
strategic business alliances, they pointed out. 
  Currently, domestic organizations responsible for promoting 
trade ties with Japan include the Republic of China [ROC] 
Committee of the East Asian Businessmen Conference, the 
Taiwan-Japan Business Cooperation Conference, and Taiwan's 
Japan-oriented Exporters Association. 
  The officials stressed that the combined business forces of 
the two countries in capital, technology, and marketing will 
certainly help promote the upgrading of the industrial base in 
Taiwan. 
  The goal could be achieved by beginning with the 
establishment of joint ventures to produce key parts and 
components in Taiwan, they said. 
  In goodwill response to Taiwan's new move, a group of 
Japan's 
senior business executives including Shoichiro Toyota, the 
newly- elected president of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), will visit Taiwan in early July. 
  The Japanese side is planning to organize the largest-ever 
technology transfer group with a view to promoting the transfer 
of high-tech know-how to Taiwan, the officials said. 
  Taiwan has been plagued by a huge trade deficit with Japan. 
The trade imbalance, which totaled US$14.22 billion in 1993, is 
expected to top US$16 billion this year.

outflow dropped to a six-year low of US$4.049 billion in 1993, 
according to statistics released by the Central Bank of China 
(CBC) Tuesday [22 March]. 
  In 1992, net capital outflow was US$8.556 billion, more than 
double the 1993 figure, a CBC official noted. 
  In 1987, net capital outflow was US$2.386 billion. In 1990, 
the figure hit a six-year high of US$10.552 billion, the 
statistics showed. 
  CBC attributed the sharp decrease in net capital outflow to 
the inward remittance of cash by foreign institutional investors 
and a decrease in outward investment by local investors.

  [Text] Taipei, March 17 (CNA) -- The Executive Yuan, or 
cabinet, on Thursday [17 March] endorsed an amendment to the 
Wildlife Conservation Law as part of the government's efforts to 
stave off trade boycott pressure from the international 
community. 
  The revised law, pending the approval of the Legislative 
Yuan, stipulates that without the permission of relevant 
government authorities, endangered wildlife and endangered 
wildlife products may not be traded or displayed at public 
places. 
  Anyone found guilty could face penalties up to five years in 
jail or a fine of up to NT$1.5 million [New Taiwan dollars] 
(US$56,820). Repeat offenders could be sentenced up to seven 
years or fined up to NT$2.5 million. 
  Executive Yuan officials have been working nights in an 
effort to finish screening the revised law, hoping that it can 
be admitted to the legislature for final approval by March 20, a 
deadline previously set by the United States. 
  US Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit announced in mid-1993 
that 
Taiwan, along with several other countries, had only 
perfunctorily cracked down on the illegal trade of rhino horn 
and tiger bone, and threatened to hit Taiwan with sanctions. 
  US President Bill Clinton later postponed the deadline 
Clinton will announce at the end of this month whether to effect 
sanctions against Taiwan. [sentence as received] 
  The US is linking its boycott decision to a fact-finding 
report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES), which is charting Taiwan's progress in cracking 
down on the trade. 
  It is reported that CITES, now gathering in Jerusalem, is 
mulling the possibility of recommending that the United States 
go ahead with a boycott. 
  According to a CNA dispatch from Israel two days ago, Murray 
Hosking, director of the CITES Standing Committee, in his speech 
to the CITES Asian regional conference, pointed out that he 
hopes more substantial results come out before a meeting of the 
CITES Standing Committee opens in Geneva on March 21.

  [Text] Taipei, March 18 (CNA) -- Canada has overtaken the 
United States as the most popular destination for Republic of 
China [ROC] emigrants, according to the Ministry of Interior 
Affairs. 
  Between 20,000 and 25,000 ROC citizens immigrate to foreign 
countries each year, most going to the US, the ministry said. 
  But the latest statistics show the US is losing its 
attraction among ROC citizens seeking life abroad. 
  Of the some 20,800 ROC citizens who emigrated last year, 
only 
7,800 went to the US, about 1,600 less than those who chose to 
make Canada their new home. 
  New Zealand came in third, attracting 2,400 ROC immigrants, 
followed by Australia, with 770 and South Africa, 300. 
  The ministry did not speculate on why the US is dwindling in 
popularity.

<F P=106> [By Xing Bensi (6717 6321 1835): "An Important Breakthrough </F>
in the Concept of Socialism--Studying the Third Volume of 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] (Editor's note: Due to limited space, we are 
carrying only the first two parts of Comrade Xing Bensi's 
article, with some abridgements. The sub-heading to the 
remaining part of the article is "The Two Pillars of a 
Theoretical Edifice." [end editor's note]) 
  The theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics 
represents a great theoretical achievement for our party in the 
new historical period. This theory has integrated the universal 
principles of Marxism with the concrete realities of China and 
has taken shape on the basis of summarizing our previous 
practical experience, especially the new experience gained in 
building socialism since the commencement of reforms and the 
open policy. This theory represents the crystallization of our 
party's and people's wisdom. 
  The theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics 
initiates a whole range of breakthroughs in traditional Marxism. 
It represents new and important developments in 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. It is Marxism of 
contemporary China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the founder of 
contemporary Marxism. His related works, especially the 
recently published Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, reveal the most important and highly original 
thinking during the process of forming and developing the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 
is rich in content and profound in ideology. Let me now talk 
about some of the things I have learned from this important 
breakthrough made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in the concept of 
socialism. 
<H5>  A New Concept of Socialism </H5>
  The most conspicuous aspect of this theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the creative 
development of Marxism is that it expounds a new concept of 
socialism, one which is different from that espoused by 
traditional Marxism. 
  In order to explain that this is a new concept of socialism 
one needs to recall history. 
  Traditional Marxism vigorously stresses class struggle and 
the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is because during the 
lifetimes of Marx, Engels and even Lenin class struggle was, in 
reality, widespread and manifested itself quite sharply. The 
doctrines of Marx and Engels, taken in their literal sense, 
sought the emancipation of both the proletariat and the whole of 
mankind and the eventual realization of communism. However, 
because the times in which they lived reflected the harsh rule 
exercised by the bourgeoisie, and because of the fact that the 
bourgeoisie would neither relinquish its rule nor automatically 
retreat from the stage of history, the proletariat therefore had 
to use revolutionary means to overthrow bourgeois rule and, 
moreover, by means of the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
protect the newly established socialist system. Only then could 
it liberate itself from capitalist oppression. Under such 
circumstances scientific socialism could not but change its 
emphasis from general inquiries into the question of the 
emancipation of the proletariat and mankind to that of probing 
questions related to the conditions required for emancipating 
the proletariat. Engels, in his work Socialism: Utopian 
and Scientific, defined scientific socialism as "the 
doctrine of conditions required for the emancipation of the 
proletariat." At that time the so-called conditions for the 
emancipation of the proletariat referred to the elimination of 
capitalist exploitation and oppression and thereby the 
establishment of the socialist system through the proletarian 
revolution and dictatorship of the proletariat. However, as 
Marx and Engels saw it, this was merely the first step in the 
emancipation of the proletariat and there were still questions 
to be resolved in relation to its further emancipation. In the 
Communist Manifesto and in many other works they 
repeatedly observed that the proletariat had to achieve its own 
complete emancipation only by emancipating the whole of mankind. 
This so-called emancipation of the whole of mankind is none 
other than the implementation of communism, which in turn is the 
final goal in emancipating the proletariat. Thus the conditions 
required for emancipation are far more complex than just 
revolution or the dictatorship of the proletariat. Since the 
whole of mankind must be emancipated, the productive forces in 
society should be highly developed, material goods should be 
abundant and peoples's spiritual horizons should be greatly 
enhanced. Only in this way can mankind become the master of 
nature, society and itself; only in this way can one traverse 
the narrow-mindedness of the bourgeois right and genuinely 
implement "from each according to his ability, to each according 
to his need." This mission is different from that of a 
revolution or a dictatorship which, through radical means, 
brings about a sudden change in society. It is, from start to 
finish, a gradual process of change from a quantitative to a 
partially qualitative nature; it is a gradual cumulative 
progression of a new nature. For a country which, in any case, 
is economically and culturally backward it is necessary to 
undergo even greater hardship. These ideas of Marx and Engels 
are an important element of scientific socialism; however, they 
have gradually faded from people's minds. Because Marx and 
Engels were never able to see with their own eyes the 
emancipation of the proletariat from the capitalist system and, 
moreover, since no such emancipation took place for a period 
even after their deaths, but indeed, on the contrary, the 
bourgeoisie continued its exploitation and oppression of the 
proletariat, the urgent and practical task of the Marxist 
political parties in each country became the realization of the 
first stage of emancipation of the proletariat. Thence, the 
proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat 
became the central theme of Marxism. In this way, an incomplete 
understanding of Marxism affected Marxists for several decades. 
  Lenin led the emancipation of the Russian proletariat from 
Czarist rule and thereby transformed a militaristic, feudal 
imperialist state into a socialist country. Although the 
Russian proletariat overthrew the rule of the exploiting 
classes, the exploiting classes nevertheless could not reconcile 
themselves to their defeat and they collaborated with external 
imperialist forces to crazily attack the newly established 
Soviet power. This created a situation whereby, although Russia 
had already overthrown the exploitative ruling classes, it 
nevertheless found itself still embroiled in class struggle. 
Thereupon, the goal of achieving communism and the emancipation 
of the whole of mankind became a distant ambition. This is why 
Lenin still frequently pondered upon the questions of class 
struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Later the 
internal situation of the Soviet Union and the international 
environment both improved, and the main emphasis in Lenin's 
deliberations began to change. Questions of economics and the 
development of productive forces clearly gained more importance 
in Lenin's works. For example, he states: "After the 
proletariat achieves political power in the state its most 
fundamental interest is in increasing the quantity of products 
and in vastly expanding social productive forces. This task has 
already been clearly stated in the program of the Russian 
Communist Party. In today's post-war situation, with a bankrupt 
economy, starvation and destruction, this task is even more 
important." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 4, p 586) 
He also states: "If we cannot rebuild our country's economy, 
then we shall lag behind and continue to lag behind the big 
capitalist powers, and as a result we shall be vulnerable to 
attack." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 4, p 384) 
Lenin even makes the following assertion: "In the final 
analysis labor productivity is the most important thing in 
guaranteeing the success of the new social system." 
(Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 4, p 16) In talking 
about the party's work, Lenin states that the party must improve 
all aspects of its work so that it can lead the Soviet economic 
construction. In 1921, Lenin addressed the realities facing 
Russia by decisively advocating the New Economic Policy which, 
in essence, was a policy to improve Russia's economic 
circumstances by developing a commodity economy and increasing 
the level of production. Unfortunately, the untimely death of 
Lenin brought about an immediate end to these very valuable 
explorations. 
  Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong the CPC 
consistently emphasized that the universal truths of Marxism and 
Leninism must be integrated with the actual realities of China. 
During his long revolutionary practice Comrade Mao Zedong 
consistently upheld a creative Marxist attitude of rejecting 
bookishness and dogmatism and choosing to use China's national 
conditions as a starting point. He led the whole party to a 
glorious victory along a democratic revolutionary path which had 
its own Chinese characteristics. However, as China found itself 
in a prolonged revolutionary war, the Chinese democratic 
revolution was astonishingly complex, and this could not but be 
reflected in the works of Mao Zedong at that time. During this 
period Comrade Mao Zedong's most important theoretical 
achievement was that of the theory on new democracy. In the 
important work On New Democracy, Comrade Mao Zedong 
theoretically expounds a whole host of questions, including the 
relationship between the democratic and socialist revolutions, 
the composition of the future state and the politics, economics, 
culture, and so on of new democracy. However, when all is said 
and done, it is nevertheless a theoretical summary of the 
practical experience of a democratic revolution, and in no way 
can it involve questions on how to undertake construction work 
after the victory of the democratic revolution. After the 
founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong led the whole party in 
completing the remaining tasks of the democratic revolution, 
rebuilding the economy, implementating socialist reforms and the 
commencement of industrialization. This clearly shows the 
importance our party gave to the development of productive 
forces and the building of the economy for a particular period. 
The Eighth CPC National Congress, which was convened in 
September 1956, testifies to this fact, the congress clearly 
highlighting the central task of the party as being the 
development of productive forces. However, shortly afterward, 
because of the drastic changes in the international situation, 
our party made the "leftist" mistake of over-enlarging the scope 
of class struggle. Consequently, the strategic plan drawn up by 
the eighth party congress, with the development of productive 
forces as its centerpiece, was never really put into effect and 
came to a premature end. Thereafter, we became enmeshed in the 
"struggle philosophy" and constant, never- ending class 
struggle. That is to say, having completed the task of 
socialist transformation and having established a socialist 
system, just when we ought to have changed the emphasis of the 
whole party's work to that of building the economy, we never 
really undertook the change; alternatively it could be said that 
while class struggle was already diminishing and the need to 
strengthen the economy was growing, we were still continuing to 
practice and preach the importance of class struggle. This 
meant not only that we lost a very good opportunity to develop 
the economy, but also that we lost an excellent chance to break 
the fetters of tradition and create a new theoretical pattern. 
  The above is a historical perspective on the traditional 
concept of socialism. This concept of socialism has its 
rationality, i.e. when class struggle becomes an important 
reality and when the only means open to the proletariat for 
emancipating itself from exploitation is through revolution and 
dictatorship, then this interpretation is correct. However, 
when the proletariat has already been emancipated from 
exploitation and it needs to greatly enhance productive capacity 
in order to significantly increase material and spiritual 
civilization and thereby create conditions for its own continued 
emancipation, then this concept is not completely correct, or is 
incorrect. In such circumstances one needs to take as the 
centerpiece of this theory the conditions required for the 
continued emancipation of the proletariat as espoused, but never 
developed, by Marx and Engels at the time. Moreover, they should 
be creatively developed by incorporating the special features of 
this new age and the circumstances of each particular country. 
  The concept of socialism as conveyed by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is such a concept of socialism. This concept of 
socialism takes the liberation and development of productive 
forces as the turning point, the establishment of a high degree 
of material culture and spiritual enlightenment as the condition 
and the elimination of polarization and the creation of common 
prosperity as the goal in establishing its basic theoretical 
framework. 
  Through reading the related works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, 
especially Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, we can understand that since the Third Plenary 
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's constant pondering of questions relating to Marxism, 
communism and socialism all concern that of developing 
productive forces. In June 1984, in a discussion with Japanese 
friends, he said: "What is socialism? What is Marxism? In the 
past our understanding of these questions was not entirely 
clear. Marxism attaches the greatest importance to developing 
productive forces. We state that socialism is the initial stage 
of communism and that when a higher stage of communism is 
achieved then we must implement the practice of from each 
according to his ability, to each according to his need. To do 
this society needs highly developed productive forces and an 
abundance of material goods and wealth. Therefore, the most 
fundamental task of socialism is to develop productive forces. 
The superiority of socialism is, in the final analysis, 
embodied in its ability to develop productive forces faster and 
better than the capitalist system and, moreover, on the basis of 
developing productive capacity, to constantly improve the 
material well-being of the people." (Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, Vol 3, p 63. Hereinafter, quotations from 
this work will be designated by the page number only) In August 
1985, Comrade Deng, at a meeting with Prime Minister of Zimbabwe 
Robert Mugabe, said: "We have summarized the experiences of 
several decades of practicing socialism. In the past we were 
not absolutely clear what socialism and Marxism were. Another 
word for Marxism is communism. Our struggle over many years has 
been for communism, our ideal is to achieve communism. During 
our most difficult periods the ideal of communism was our 
spiritual pillar. Countless people sacrificed themselves for 
this ideal. Communism is a society without exploitation, a 
society abundant in goods which practices the principle of from 
each according to his ability, to each according to his need. 
Unless conditions exist for material abundance then one cannot 
put into effect the principle of to each according to his need. 
In order to implement communism it is absolutely necessary to 
complete all the tasks in the socialist stage. The tasks 
involved in building socialism are many; however, the most basic 
is to develop productive forces. On the basis of developing 
productive forces socialism will prove superior to capitalism 
and will create the material basis for the implementation of 
communism." (p 137) In October 1987, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, 
during a meeting with Janos Kader, general secretary of the 
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, reiterated his viewpoint: 
"Marxism is also called communism. The basic principle of 
Marxism is to implement `from each according to his ability, to 
each according to his work' in the socialist stage, and during 
the communist period to implement `from each according to his 
ability, to each according to his need.' To practice to each 
according to his need requires an abundance of goods. Can this 
be achieved in a poor society? Can communism be 
poverty-stricken? On the basis of synthesizing these 
experiences we have concluded that for the whole historical 
stage of socialism the central task is to develop productive 
forces. This is real Marxism." (pp 254-255) Similar assertions 
are numerous. From these expositions we can see that Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping has all along considered the question of 
productive forces to be a key point in his theoretical 
explorations on what is Marxism, what is communism and 
socialism, and how to effectively build socialism in China, 
thereby creating a new concept of socialism which is different 
from the traditional concept. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theories 
concerning the nature of socialism, the motivation for the 
development of a socialist society and the guarantee for the 
development of a socialist society form the cornerstone of a new 
concept of socialism. 

<H5>    The Cornerstone of a Theoretical Edifice </H5>
  In an important talk given during an inspection in south 
China in early 1992 Comrade Deng expounded a new view on the 
nature of socialism. He said: "The intrinsic nature of 
socialism is the liberation of productive forces, the 
development of productive forces, the abolition of exploitation 
and the eradication of polarization in order to reach the final 
objective of common prosperity." (p 373) What is new about this 
view? We can make a comparison with the traditional concept of 
socialism. Although the traditional concept of socialism gives 
no definition of the intrinsic nature of socialism, 
nevertheless, over the years, the traditional viewpoint has 
formed that the factors determining a socialist system are: 1) 
The socialist system of public ownership; 2) to each according 
to his work; 3) the dictatorship of the proletariat. These 
three elements are generally considered to be the special 
features highlighting the intrinsic nature of socialism. 
Although these three elements are very important, nevertheless 
this concept has a major weakness because it overlooks the 
significance of productive forces and common prosperity. That 
is to say, it overlooks the goal of socialism and overlooks the 
material basis for achieving that goal. 
  What really is the goal of socialism? Over the years 
countless high-minded people have made great sacrifices for the 
cause of socialism, but why have they done so? Comrade Deng has 
categorically answered this question by saying: "The goal of 
socialism is to achieve common prosperity for the people of the 
whole country without the polarization of society." (pp 
110-111) In September 1986, in response to a question from the 
American reporter Mike Wallace, Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed 
that the principle of socialism was common prosperity, and that 
the prerequisite condition for achieving this was the 
development of productive forces. He said: "During the 
socialist period the most important task is to develop 
productive forces so that society's material goods will continue 
to expand and the people's livelihood will improve day by day in 
such a way that the material conditions are created for 
implementing communism. In the same way that one cannot have a 
poor communist society, one cannot have a poor socialist 
society. Getting rich is not a crime. However, what we call 
getting rich differs from what you talk about. Socialist wealth 
belongs to the people; the creation of wealth in a socialist 
society is for the common good. The principles of socialism 
are: 1) The development of production; 2) common prosperity." 
(pp 171-172) From these pronouncements one can see that in his 
theory on the intrinsic nature of socialism, Comrade Deng places 
common prosperity and the development of productive forces as 
its centerpiece, that the former is the goal and the latter is 
the material basis required for achieving this goal. If there 
is no development of productive forces to create a material 
base, then common prosperity is merely empty words. Therefore, 
of these two points, developing productive forces is more 
fundamental. This is why Comrade Deng sees development of 
productive forces as the "most fundamental task" (p 63), the 
"primary task" (p 116), and the "central task" (p 131) of 
socialism, as well as the criterion for assessing right and 
wrong, gains and losses. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has not only 
linked the development of productive forces to the intrinsic 
nature of socialism, but also linked it to the future and 
destiny of socialism. He emphasized: "Our country's overriding 
task at the present time is to wholeheartedly carry out the four 
modernizations. We have given full rein to the intrinsic 
features of socialism and even employed certain capitalist 
methods (employing them as methods only) to speed up the 
development of productive forces." He added: "China has no 
choice but to take this path. Only this path can lead to 
prosperity and boom." (pp 149-150) It can be clearly seen from 
the above that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's viewpoint on the 
intrinsic nature of socialism is different from that of the 
traditionalists. The traditional view of socialism omitted the 
two principles concerning the goal of socialism--common 
prosperity and the material base, i.e. the development of 
productive forces, needed to achieve that goal. Consequently, 
the traditional concept of socialism was inaccurate and 
incomplete. 
  The establishment of the ideas outlined above means that on 
this most important question of what socialism is, Comrade Deng 
has shown the difference between his concept of socialism and 
that of the traditional socialist and that of traditional 
Marxism. This has laid a firm foundation for the concept of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<F P=106> [By MING PAO news team: "Deng Rong Says Her Father Supports </F>
`Stability'"] 
  [Text] Deng Rong, Deng Xiaoping's daughter and PLA 
(People's Liberation Army) delegate to the NPC, said yesterday 
that her father "strongly supports" the current policy of 
attaching importance to "stability" because the relations 
between stability and development, which rely upon each other 
for existence, are dialectical. 
  In an interview with reporters in the Beijing Great Hall of 
the People yesterday, Deng Rong did not mention Deng Xiaoping's 
specific views about the current "two sessions." She only said 
that Deng Xiaoping, being an NPC delegate himself, had closely 
followed the course of the "two sessions." Apart from reading 
newspapers every day, she added, he also read documents on the 
sessions and watched special programs on the sessions. 
  Deng Rong pointed out that her father had all along 
advocated 
strengthening democracy and the legal system. She said that she 
had also worked with the NPC Standing Committee for a long time 
adding that, before transferring to the Central Military 
Commission, she served on the NPC Standing Committee Legislative 
Affairs Commission. 
  Regarding the impact the current reform has had on the "two 
sessions," Deng Rong said that since the 14th CPC National 
Congress held two years ago, Deng Xiaoping has maintained that 
the current reform is a deep-seated one, which does not only 
exercise influence on the current "two sessions," but also 
exercises far-reaching influence on China's future. 
  When asked about China's future priorities, Deng Rong said 
China should focus on developing its economy to increase the 
national strength and gradually improve the people's living 
standards. This, she added, also accords with the three 
criteria for judging any principle and policy proposed by her 
father. The three criteria are "whether the principle and 
policy helps develop the productive forces, strengthens the 
overall capacity of the country, and improves the people's 
living standards." The "three criteria" were first put forward 
by Deng Xiaoping during his 1992 south China inspection tour.

delegation to the NPC was stationed, to discuss Premier Li 
Peng's government work report together with the deputies from 
Hubei. 
  It was noon when the meeting ended, and Jia Zhijie, head of 
Hubei delegation, invited the two leading members to have lunch 
with the delegation. Vice Premier Zou and Vice Chairman Ni 
accepted the invitation with pleasure. 
  Hearing that the two leading members were to stay for lunch, 
Laudong Building's manager got really busy and urged service 
workers to make preparations for a special meal for the two 
leading members alone as a token of respect. 
  When the two leading members heard this, they expressed 
their 
thanks but said no, they would rather have buffet together with 
the deputies. 
  At 1230 lunch began, and Vice Premier Zou first took a close 
look at every dish, nodding with praise. Then he quietly took a 
seat by a dining table and waited for the deputies to take their 
turns. Ten minutes passed, and Vice Premier Zou and Vice 
Chairman Ni quietly went to the end of the queue and waited 
their turn. The deputies, and employees of the building as 
well, on several occasions tried to get two plates of food for 
the leading members, but Vice Premier Zou turned down the offer 
with thanks.

<F P=106> ["Two Sessions" analysis by staff correspondents Mo Fei </F>
(5459 7236) and Xiao Rui (5135 3843): "Migrant Workers, Both 
Good and Bad News"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The sight 
of tens of millions of peasants traveling north or south for 
jobs during the Spring Festival was spectacular, and migrant 
workers naturally became a hot subject of conversation between 
deputies and delegates to the "two sessions." 
  Henan Governor Li Changchun applauded the outflow of the 
surplus labor force from underdeveloped rural areas, describing 
the results of peasants' job hunting in the following terms: 
"Obtaining food, coupons, ideas, and connections and finding 
the path to get rich." 
  Sichuan Governor Xiao Yang called migrant workers China's 
third great phenomenon after the contract responsibility system 
on a household basis with remuneration linked to output and 
township and town enterprises, saying that these workers gave a 
hint of what was going on in the labor market. In 1993, 10 
million Sichuanese marched out of the basin and sent back to the 
province over 10 billion yuan. Labor exports have become one of 
the major sources of income for peasants in the province's poor 
areas. 
  Guangdong views the vast inflow of migrant workers with 
mixed 
feelings. Tens of thousands of migrants are snapping up jobs 
that are dirty, physically demanding, and shunned by city 
residents, unwittingly accelerating urban development. The many 
services they provide for urban residents in their lives and 
work have become essential to the cities. However, the vast 
influx of migrant populations have increased the pressure on 
transportation, urban administration, and the already 
insufficient infrastructure. Eighty percent of crimes in 
Guangdong involved migrant workers. At the current NPC session, 
the Guangdong deputies tabled a motion calling for strengthening 
migrant population administration. 
  Guo Lin, NPC deputy and vice minister of railways in charge 
of transportation, called "migrant worker tides" an inevitable 
result from the market allocation of labor force. When the 
decades-old "grain rationing" and "work-point system" that tied 
the peasantry to their land were revoked, peasants could no 
longer be content with farming drudgery and the leisure imposed 
on them by the farming rhythm that left them "nothing to do for 
eight months." They certainly wanted to go out "to get a piece 
of the action" and earn money wherever they can. 
  The swelling "migrant worker" tide had a tremendous impact 
on 
the railway when it was already running above capacity. During 
this spring season, trains carried 3.08 million passengers a 
day, 20,000 a day more than the same period last year. With 
huge passenger flows packing into crowded cars, trains had to 
carry twice the capacity number of passengers. To ease migrant 
flows, the Ministry of Railway provided an additional 5,036 
contingent trains and cut 10,000 freight trains. Railway 
bureaus in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Liuzhou, Zhengzhou, and Chengdu 
were forced to use freighters. 
  The rise of township and town enterprises has enabled 110 
million of the 400 million-strong rural labor force to quit 
farming. There are still close to 200 million idle laborers, 
with 10 million joining their ranks each year. These people 
need to eat, make a living, and get rich. And the widening 
scissors gap for "agricultural products" and the lowering 
comparative advantage of agriculture inevitably set enormous 
rural surplus labor in motion. It has been forecast that by the 
year 2000, there will be 100 million peasants joining the 
"migrant worker" force; that is to say, the "migrant worker" 
tide is destined to rumble on for many years to come. 
  The appearance of migrant workers carries profound 
historical 
significance and indicates the direction of the times. It 
signals China's reform and opening up and changes ushered in by 
market economic reforms, and is a by-product of China's 
transition from an agricultural country to an industrial one. 
As Gu Shengzu, a CPPCC delegate in Beijing for the session, 
said: Migrant workers can only be channeled, not blocked. 
Because the migration of tens of millions of peasants 
represents in fact the choice of tens of billions of peasants 
behind them. Such a choice represents an irresistible 
historical force. Certain disorder and negative phenomena 
arising from the choice should be seen as the price for reforms. 
  One school of thought holds that the day when the whole 
rural 
surplus labor force is successfully transferred to 
nonagricultural occupations is the day of success for China's 
reforms. Though this viewpoint may sound a little too extreme, 
it nevertheless states the essential truth. Without a doubt, 
once the peasants are freed from the entanglement of the old 
system and the constraint of the old order, they will certainly 
become a powerful propelling force for China's move toward a 
market economy.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Mar (XINHUA) -- The People's Liberation 
Army [PLA] General Political Department today issued a circular 
urging the troops of the whole army to conscientiously study the 
guiding spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC]. 
  The circular said: The Second Session of the Eighth NPC was 
held at a critical moment of the development stage in China's 
reform, opening up, and modernization drive. Guided by Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the CPC's basic line, the meeting has 
comprehensively carried out the guiding spirit of the 14th 
National CPC Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee [CPCCC]. In the light of the fundamental 
principle of this year's work for the whole party and country, 
the meeting has forwarded the goals and missions for the 
country's work. The meeting served to promote democracy, unity, 
matter-of-fact attitude, practical spirit, as well as readiness 
for new explorations and progresses. Conscientiously conveying 
and studying the guiding spirit of this meeting will bear great 
significance to educating officials and soldiers of the whole 
army to have a better understanding of the overall situation; 
defining their responsibilities; strengthening the army 
building; and making new contributions to China's reform, 
opening up, economic development, and social stability. 
  The circular says: The task of conveying and studying the 
guiding spirit of the meeting should be closely related to the 
new situation in which China's economic reform enters a critical 
stage of integrating the overall improvement with the 
breakthrough of major points. With Premier Li Peng's government 
work report as well as the important speech made by Jiang Zemin, 
general secretary of the CPCCC and chairman of the CPCCC 
Military Commission, at the plenary session of the PLA 
representatives as a major content, the task aims to guide all 
personnel to have full understanding of new achievements and the 
great situation of China's reform and modernization drive, 
further consolidate their faith, and strengthen their 
self-awareness of carrying out the party's basic line and 
various principled policies. It also means to help them 
correctly understand the importance of "seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability" -- a general principle for the work of 
the whole party and the country, resolutely safeguard the 
authority of the CPCCC and the CPCCC Military Commission with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, conscientiously act with the 
overall situation in mind, and maintain a high degree of 
stability and centralized unity of the troops. The task should 
define the basic goal and this year's tasks for setting up a 
socialist market economy; give resolute and active support to a 
series of important reforming measures adopted by the state for 
the establishment of a socialist market economy; and become a 
model for conscientiously subordinating interests of the part to 
those of the whole and for attaching importance to ideal, 
discipline, unity, and overall situation. The task should serve 
to help all personnel to have a profound understanding of 
historical responsibility and the glorious mission of our army 
under the new situation; further play the role of the enthusiasm 
of officers and soldiers of the whole army; and strengthen the 
overall work of army building, continue to enhance combat 
readiness, and make contributions to the reform, development, 
and stability of the state under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and his ideology concerning the army building in 
the new period as well as in the light of the requirement put 
forward by Chairman Jiang Zemin -- "The PLA must be qualified 
politically and competent militarily. It must have a fine work 
style, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate 
logistical support." 
  The circular urges party committees and political 
organizations at all levels to make an overall arrangement for 
integrating the work of conveying and studying the Second 
Session of the Eighth NPC's guiding spirit with the troops' 
theoretical and political education. It is necessary to study 
in a thoroughgoing manner the meeting's guiding spirit by 
integrating the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping with that of the basic viewpoints of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which 
is currently conducted at the grass-roots level.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Today, Xie 
Fei, member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and secretary of 
the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, said that it is 
necessary to work intensively to build up the rule-of-law 
mechanism and the democratic supervision mechanism. He said 
that the establishment of these two mechanisms represents the 
key point of the current political structural reform in 
Guangdong and should be carried out simultaneously with the 
economic structural reform so that the reform in these two 
aspects can complement each other in guaranteeing the healthy 
development of the socialist market economy. 
  This afternoon, when attending the meeting of the Guangdong 
delegation to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC], Xie Fei, who is also a deputy to the NPC, 
pointed out: This year, the state has adopted and will adopt a 
series of financial and taxation, banking, foreign trade, and 
enterprise reform measures. Guangdong must make efforts to 
implement these measures, and should discover and properly 
settle new problems in good time in the course of implementing 
these measures, and thus continuously improve the new systems 
and gradually establish the structure of the socialist market 
economy. 
  Xie Fei said: It is necessary to give play to Guangdong's 
advantages, enhance the level of opening, expand the scope of 
opening, and actively do a good job in the following eight 
aspects: 
  Attach importance to introducing advanced management 
expertise, technology, and experienced personnel in order to 
eventually enhance economic efficiency. 
  Actively absorb funds to develop infrastructural facilities, 
basic industries, new and high-technology industries, and to 
transform old enterprises and old urban districts. 
  Bring in financial and commercial institutions to promote 
the 
development of the tertiary industry. 
  Establish mechanisms of operation in convergence with the 
international market and in compliance with international 
practice. 
  Properly manage and run the three types of existing foreign- 
funded enterprises and the enterprises processing imported 
materials for reexport purposes according to samples offered by 
importers, as well as those involved in compensation trade so 
that they may influence and bring along other domestic 
enterprises in expanding overseas economic cooperation and 
overseas markets. 
  Launch economic cooperation projects and open up markets in 
overseas areas and in other provinces of the country. 
  Give play to the advantages of various types of localities 
in 
Guangdong, further develop the multitiered and multiformed 
opening pattern. Continue to give play to the role of the three 
special economic zones and the four economic and technological 
development zones as windows for opening, and effect 
across-the-board opening in the whole province. 
  Improve the style of work, improve the investment 
environment, and create better conditions for the expansion of 
opening.

and Achieve Breakthrough in Four Areas; Abulaiti Abudurexiti 
Discusses Development of the Xinjiang Economy; Tomur Dawamat and 
Ismail Amat Join in the Discussions" -- XINJIANG RIBAO headline] 
  [Text] At the discussion meeting for the entire 
delegation, held in the Xinjiang Room of the Great Hall of the 
People on 13 March, Abulaiti Abudurexiti, Chairman of the 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, attending as an observer, 
said: In developing the Xinjiang economy, we should seize five 
tasks firmly and achieve breakthroughs in four areas. Also 
attending the meeting were: Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman of the 
National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee; Ismail 
Amat, State Councillor and minister in charge of the State 
Nationalities Affairs Commission; and comrades in charge of the 
Ministry of Finance, the State Planning Commission, and the 
State General Administration of Taxation. 
  Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: Since reform and opening to the 
outside world, the autonomous region has made greater progress 
in its economic construction; however, when compared with its 
fraternal provinces and regions, the gap between Xinjiang and 
these provinces and regions is widening. To narrow the gap in a 
short time and achieve more rapid economic development in 
Xinjiang, we must turn our attention to both the international 
and domestic markets; seize such opportunities as the state's 
adoption of policies in favor of industry, the inauguration of 
the second Eurasian Continental Bridge, and the grand oil 
exploration; take advantage of resources and geographical 
features; and carry out the development strategy to convert 
advantageous resources. He said: In the meantime, we should 
seize five tasks firmly and achieve breakthroughs in four areas. 
The five tasks are: the development of agriculture and the 
rural economy; the construction of infrastructural facilities 
and basic industries; the exploitation of mineral resources such 
as oil, natural gas, and nonferrous metals; the restructuring of 
enterprises; and reinvigorating economic development on the 
county level. To achieve breakthroughs in four areas is to make 
the development of state-owned large- and medium-sized 
enterprises a major task and to transform enterprises' operating 
mechanisms so as to achieve new breakthroughs in restructuring 
traditional industries; to make the development of large-scale 
agriculture a major task and to put great efforts into the 
development of secondary and tertiary industries in rural areas, 
centering on village and town enterprises, so as to achieve new 
breakthroughs in economic development on the county level; to 
open up in an all-round manner and to diversify markets, so as 
to achieve new breakthroughs in foreign trade; and to move 
forward with the exploitation of oil and nonferrous metals, so 
as to achieve new breakthroughs in promoting local economic 
development.

  [Text] During an interview on 11 March at Beijing's Jingxi 
Guesthouse, Chen Huanyou, a deputy from Jiangsu Province to the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], 
secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee, and governor 
of Jiangsu Province, pointed out that Jiangsu's work for this 
year will conform to and serve the work of the whole party and 
country, and the focus of its work will be placed on deepening 
reform and ensuring sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development. 
  Chen Huangyou said: In his government work report 
develivered 
at the current NPC session, Premier Li Peng, in accordance with 
the basic work principle decided by the party Central Committee, 
set forth the various tasks for 1994. The report fully 
manifests the "general principle for the work of the whole party 
and country" -- "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up 
wider, promote development, and maintain stability" -- set by 
the CPC Central Committee. The work for this year of the 
Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee and government will conform to 
and serve this principle; we will rely on the common efforts of 
people across the province and do a better job in our work in 
all areas. 
  "How will Jiangsu accommodate and serve the work of the 
whole 
party and country to promote its own development?" Chen Huanyou 
said the first thing to do is to continue to deepen reform. He 
said: The scope, depth, difficulty, and intensity of the major 
reform measures adopted by the state this year are all greater 
than those of the past. Although there are risks and 
contradictions in making reforms, now is a favorable time for 
making reforms -- a good job in reform this year will lay a good 
foundation for our future reform and development. According to 
the central authorities' plan, this year Jiangsu will give 
prominence to making reforms -- we will promote 
mutually-supportive reforms in all areas, with the focus on 
building a modern enterprise system and on promoting reform of 
the macroeconomic management system. We will do specific work 
in detail and in a down-to-earth manner, and will properly 
publicize, explain, organize, coordinate, and carry out the 
adopted reform measures to ensure practical results. He added: 
The task of this year's reform and development is very heavy. 
By seizing the opportunity of this year's reform of the foreign 
trade system and the foreign exchange management system, Jiangsu 
will promote opening up to the outside world within a larger 
scope and sphere and at a higher level, and will interweave its 
economy with the international economy at a faster pace and in a 
better way. We will further expand the capacity for and raise 
the level of utilizing foreign funds, make positive efforts to 
expand foreign economic and technological cooperation, and build 
up various kinds of development zones starting from a high level 
and using high standards. Chen Huanyou stressed: The heavier 
the task of reform and development is, the more we need to work 
hard to improve the quality of economic growth. This year, the 
focus of Jiangsu's economic work will be placed on improving the 
quality and efficiency of and on raising the level of its 
economic growth. We should bear in mind that "development is 
the last word." We should develop at the highest possible speed 
those export-oriented projects producing marketable products 
with good efficiency. Of course we should make the best use of 
our subjective initiative and attach special importance to 
relying on technological progress and on raising workers' 
educational levels in readjusting the economic structure, in 
improving the quality of economic growth, in raising the entire 
economic level, and in improving the overall economic results. 
  Chen Huanyou also explained how Jiangsu will accommodate and 
serve the work of the whole party and country and promote 
regional economic development by further improving the 
province's infrastructural facilities, by stepping up the 
development of its basic industries, and by further ensuring its 
social stability.

<F P=106> [By Zhong Jianyan (6988 0256 0917): "Strengthen Party </F>
Building and Leadership"] 
  [Text] The Party Building Research Office of the CPC 
Central Committee's Organization Department held a seminar a few 
days ago. More than 20 leaders, experts, and scholars who have 
long been engaged in the party's practical work attended the 
seminar, studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the decision of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and 
probed the theory of further strengthening party leadership over 
socialist economy, politics, and culture with Chinese 
characteristics. Those attending the seminar held the consensus 
that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics inherited and developed 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and that strengthening and 
improving party leadership constituted an important component of 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
It is necessary to vigorously, comprehensively, and correctly 
study, publicize, and implement the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and 
apply them in seeking unity of thought within the whole party 
and guide all fields of work. 
  As China's reform and opening up has entered a very 
important 
historic period, the attendants pointed out at the seminar, we 
must follow the party's basic line and theories, seize the 
favorable opportunity, exert ourselves, and strive to push 
forward China's socialist cause. In view of the problems of 
mass concern, the attendants made many good proposals: The 
socialist market economic system, which is combined with the 
basic socialist system, is different from the capitalist market 
economic system. While establishing the socialist market 
economic system, it is absolutely necessary to consciously 
maintain and uphold the predominant position of public ownership 
and distribution according to work and resist the ideas and 
actions which attempt to shake the predominance of these two 
factors. "Emancipation and development of the productive 
forces, elimination of exploitation and polarization, and 
attainment of the ultimate goal of common prosperity" proposed 
by Deng Xiaoping is the scientific expression of the essence of 
socialism and integrated thinking, which cannot be separated or 
even willfully quoted out of context. The CPC is the core of 
leadership for the building of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, while the masses of people, centered on 
workers, peasants, and intellectuals, are the vital force for 
this grand cause. It is very important to strengthen the 
party's ideological, theoretical, and political building, launch 
protracted struggles against corruption, and maintain purity of 
the party's ranks to ensure that leadership of all levels is 
firmly in the hands of those loyal to contemporary Chinese 
Marxism. If we weaken party leadership, neglect party building, 
forsake the mass line, diminish the status of master of the 
working class, divorce ourselves from the peasants, and slacken 
efforts to build socialist spiritual civilization, our cause 
will suffer and even meet with failure. We must firmly bear in 
mind the historic lesson drawn from being hard on one aspect but 
soft on the other, do two types of work simultaneously and pay 
equal attention to both, and ensure the healthy growth of 
China's reform and construction.

  [Text] Beijing, March 23 (CNS) -- A taxation inspection of 
enterprises last year discovered various kinds of illegal tax- 
related practices involving RMB [Renminbi] 15.4 billion with RMB 
10 billion being recovered by the state. 
  Tax evasion has become rampant in the country with more than 
50 percent of all enterprises and individually-owned business 
households found guilty of such practices. Some enterprises 
were found to have evaded taxes of more than RMB 1 million. 
Last year saw the industrial and commercial tax evasion being 
put at RMB 6.18 billion, evasion of income tax RMB 1.85 billion 
and evasion of payment for key items' construction as well as 
for budgetary regulation RMB 1.187 billion, adding up to RMB 
9.22 billion and constituting 63.4 percent of all illegal funds. 
  Another serious problem was the deduction of sums of state 
revenue. 
  Rampant money-collecting by administrative departments and 
institutions was also serious. According to experts, there was 
an urgent need to establish a supervisory mechanism for handling 
such illegal matters in the country.

<F P=106> [Article by Bai Shijie (4101 0013 2638) and Cui Dianbiao </F>
(1508 3013 1753): "A Probe Into the Management of Party Members 
Who Are Private Business Operators From Other Localities"] 
  [Text] Along with the establishment and development of the 
socialist market economy, the job variety and mobility of party 
members have increased greatly. How should we strengthen the 
management and education of party members operating private 
businesses from other localities? The party committee of Xinhua 
District in the city of Shijiazhuang took some experimental 
measures and has achieved some results. 
  Establishing organization. The Xinhua Country 
Fair Center in this district ranks fourth among the 10 biggest 
country fairs in China. In 1992, this center boasted over 
20,000 private business operators, among whom 134 were nonlocal 
party members. Most of these party members, in effect, had 
disconnected themselves from the party organizations they 
originally belonged to and had not been subjected to management 
and education by their party organizations for a long time. As 
a result, their exemplary vanguard role and political influence 
as party members had weakened significantly. Some of these party 
members took care of their personal interests at the expense of 
the party's interests and substituted the party's principle with 
the principle of exchange of equal value. They turned a deaf 
ear or a blind eye to practices that violated the party's 
principles and policies or that disrupted market order, and to 
the phenomena of bullying and wheeler-dealering. The party 
branch of the Xinhua District Country Fair Center keenly felt 
that in order for them to play an exemplary vanguard role on the 
market, there must be a set of organizational forms that would 
suit the nature of their work and their characteristics, and 
that they should be subjected to regular and undisrupted 
management and education. 
  In June 1989, in pursuance of the "party constitution" 
provision that "a grass-roots party organization should be set 
up wherever there are three or more full members of the party," 
the party committee of Shijiazhuang's Xinhua District founded a 
local party branch among the private business operators at the 
Xinhua Country Fair Center, subordinate to the general party 
branch of the district's industrial and commercial 
administration bureau. The head of the industrial and 
commercial administration office became the branch secretary, 
and retired senior cadres were appointed deputy secretaries. 
The branch committee consisted of five private business 
operators holding party membership. The general party branch of 
the industrial and commercial administration bureau made it 
clear that all private business operators who are party members 
and have worked in the market for more than six months must have 
their formal or temporary membership credentials transferred to 
the party branch of private business operators here, take part 
in the regular activities of the party organization, and pay 
membership fees in a timely manner. The party branch set up a 
file for each of its members and entered into it their 
biographic information, as well as their main accomplishments 
and problems in participating in the branch's regular 
activities, playing an exemplary role, adhering to various 
relevant regimes, and observing discipline and law. The 
establishment of the party branch of private business operators 
effectively strengthened the organizational awareness of the 
party members among the private business operators, as well as 
their conscientiousness in exercising self-control, 
self-education, and self-restraint. 
  Improving the system. System building is a key 
link in strengthening education for party members, especially 
for those among private business operators who cannot do without 
the restraint of systems. After the party branch of private 
business operators was established, it introduced, over a period 
of time, a full set of systems, such as: the system of 
reporting the branch's work to the general party branch, the 
system of party-member management with prescribed objectives, 
the system of regular appraisal of members, the system of 
filling out monthly introspection reports by members, the system 
of regular democratic meetings, the system of reporting to the 
party branch one's ideological experience in the form of 
correspondence when absent from the market on a business trip or 
on a visit to one's family for over a month, the system of 
two-way communication with the party organizations to which its 
members used to belong, and some other operational systems that 
suit the management of party members among private business 
operators. In the meantime, the branch exercised management by 
objective toward each member in such areas as participating in 
regular organization activities, operating according to the law, 
paying required taxes in a timely manner, and giving 
enthusiastic support to public welfare undertakings. It 
quantified the members' rights, obligations, and 
responsibilities, and appraised their performance every six 
months, the results of which were used as the main basis for 
conferring the title of exemplary party member at the end of 
each year. Through the building of systems, the management and 
education of party members among private business operators were 
institutionalized and regularized, which brought the behavior of 
the party members into bounds and enhanced their 
conscientiousness in observing discipline and law. 
  At the Xinhua Country Fair, party members among the private 
business operators not only took the lead in paying various 
taxes and levies required by laws and regulations, but also 
explained state laws and the rules and regulations of the market 
to other private business operators in their respective lots. 
As a result, the broad ranks of operators obviously were more 
willing to observe discipline and the law, and to pay taxes as 
required. Before long, the authorities began to be able to 
collect all the required taxes and levies within five days each 
month. 
  Strengthening education. The party members among 
the private business operators were specifically educated to 
"take the lead in doing five things." In other words, they 
should take the lead in implementing the party's principles and 
policies, working hard while maintaining a simple lifestyle, and 
dedicating themselves selflessly; take the lead in operating 
according to the law, providing quality service, and fighting 
unlawful businessmen and bad people or practices; take the lead 
in combating all sorts of negative and corrupt phenomena, and in 
promoting new positive practices of a socialist nature; take the 
lead in attaining prosperity through hard work, not forgetting 
those who lag behind in the process of getting rich, and 
contributing to common prosperity; and take the lead in doing 
business in a civilized manner and striving to win the title of 
civilized private business operator. In the meantime, the 
district industrial and commercial administration bureau also 
invested 12,000 yuan and built a "function room for party 
members operating private businesses" and a "party school for 
private business operators," to provide activity and study 
venues for party members operating private businesses. 
  The consistent education with definite objectives 
significantly enhanced the party spirit and awareness of party 
members operating private businesses. As a result, cases 
emerged one after another in which advanced individuals 
conscientiously engaged themselves in business in a civilized 
way and took the lead in being selflessly dedicated. Last year, 
a customer from Shanxi Province left his wallet containing 5,800 
yuan cash and his driver's license and identification card at 
the stall owned by party member Wen Hui, after buying some 
clothes from him. As soon as he saw it, Wen Hui left his stall 
unattended and went all over the place in search of the owner. 
When the moved owner got his wallet back and offered him 1,000 
yuan as a token of gratitude, Wen Hui said: "This is what I 
should do. I should not make money this way. Otherwise I will 
not be living up to the title of party member, will I?" Wang 
Yinhe, a party-member private business operator in his 70's, 
donated thousands of yuan in a space of eight consecutive years 
for the purchase of saplings and seeds, and grafted more than 
22,800 jujube and peach trees for his home village, and 
cultivated by himself more than 21,000 black date and apricot 
saplings on the hillside and edges of the fields in his home 
village. Over the years, the party members operating private 
businesses contributed a total of more than 350,000 yuan in 
support of the construction undertakings in their home towns and 
home villages in various ways and did over 2,400 good deeds for 
the public. All the 134 party members among the private 
business operators at this fair received the title of "civilized 
private business operator" and five of them were chosen as 
exemplary party members. 
  Stepping up supervision. While the party branch 
among the private business operators was improving the 
responsibility system for party building and strictly exercising 
organizational supervision, it also subjected its members to the 
supervision by the public. For this purpose, the party branch 
worked out a rational and evenly distributed pattern of stalls 
run by its members, each marked with a conspicuous, red sign: 
"Party Member Stall." The branch clearly assigned to each of 
its members individuals to whom they should pass on experience, 
give help, and set an example, on the basis of the findings of 
investigation and analysis on the ideological and political 
quality and performance of more than 7,000 private business 
operators at the fair. This way, they not only reinforced the 
supervision of party members by customers and their non-member 
colleagues, but also achieved the result of "party members 
setting an example for their colleagues" and "party members 
taking care of their colleagues." This has ensured the 
implementation of all the measures for building a civilized 
market, as a result of which the Xinhua Country Fair Center has 
been chosen a national civilized market for six consecutive 
years.

  [Text] Beijing, March 23 (XINHUA) -- The private schools 
boom last year here in Beijing has met with a mixed reception, 
according to a wide range of sources. 
  City officials said that ten private primary and middle 
schools were set up in the capital last year. 
  The well-designed teaching programs and a comfortable study 
environment in such schools have drawn flocks of parents keen to 
provide the best possible education for their children. 
  However, more parents have been held back by the 
frighteningly high tuition and other fees. For instance, when a 
student is enrolled, he must pay as high as 43,000 yuan or more 
than 4,000 U.S. dollars of the tuition and other fees in the 
first year, almost equalling to ten years' income for an 
ordinary Chinese worker. 
  According to an official survey, the pupils in such schools 
are mainly the offspring of the newly-rich. 
  The survey revealed that 39 percent of the parents are heads 
of companies and factories or senior executives of high-tech 
enterprises; 17.9 percent are employees in Beijing of firms and 
institutions of other provinces; 14 percent have been abroad; 
8.6 percent work in foreign-funded ventures; 5.5 percent are 
self- employed bosses; and the rest come from other walks of 
life. 
  A self-employed boss said: "People like me now live a 
comfortable life and we lack nothing but time and energy to care 
for and cultivate our children. The private schools take all 
the responsibility for their study and living." 
  The private schools have been dubbed "schools for children 
of 
aristocrats", as they so far have largely remained a kingdom for 
children of people who have got rich fast. 
  An educator said that the "aristocrats' schools" phenomenon 
had caused a psychological imbalance among other parents. But 
he denied the possibility of providing all children with 
absolutely equal living standards and educational opportunities, 
as long as economic and income differentials continued to exist. 
  Private schools authorities said that high fees were a 
guarantee for the normal operation of the schools. Without 
money they could not have comfortable class-rooms and advanced 
equipment, which was one of the factors distinguishing private 
schools from the general public schools. 
  The principal of Jinghua Private Primary School, one of 
Beijing's most prominent ones, said frankly that his school had 
been established to serve the special needs of those capable of 
paying the high fees. 
  Officials said that private schools are very different from 
public schools in teaching programs, facilities, equipment, the 
layout of courses and had a markedly better teaching staff. 
  They said that most of the private schools were boarding 
schools, which appeal to parents who are single-mindedly 
pursuing their careers. 
  Meanwhile, they said, the teachers in private schools are 
among the best of the city's and they are often paid several 
times more than their counterparts in public schools. A teacher 
at the private Jinghua Primary School is paid more than 1,000 
yuan (about 115 U.S. dollars) a month, about three times the 
salary for a teacher in other schools. 
  Besides a well-designed school syllabus, a major appeal of 
the private schools is their wide set of interesting courses and 
extracurricular activities. 
  Learning English and computers, courses traditionally first 
introduced for junior middle school pupils or college students, 
starts in the first year in private schools, officials said. 
  They said that private schools also have smaller classes of 
no more than 25. They provide five meals a day, and 
air-conditioning in pupils' dormitories. 
  At a New Year get-together of teachers, pupils and parents, 
many parents said that their children have become healthier, 
more active, polite and eager to learn. They said they were 
satisfied with the progress their children had achieved in 
singing, dancing, typewriting, calculation and playing chess and 
musical instruments. 
  Several third-formers said that they liked to be strictly 
treated and liked their teachers. Parents said that they could 
sense the intimacy between their children and the staff. 
  However, city officials have cautioned that not all the 
private schools have been set up for the benefit of the pupils: 
some rather in pursuit of the irresistible high incomes 
obtainable. 
  The officials said that an unhealthy trend of only pursuing 
money had emerged in some of the private schools established 
without strict scientific studies. 
  They also said that a lack of supporting funds had affected 
the normal operation of the schools and is expected to force 
some of them to close. The officials warned that some private 
schools have neglected teaching social morals to pupils. 
  A well-respected expert from the city's education community 
said an overheating in running private schools must be avoided, 
as such schools are now faced with specific difficulties such as 
fund shortfalls, limited campus size and classrooms, short-stay 
teaching staff, insufficient sources of pupils and lax 
management. 
  The expert said that a headmaster of a private school has to 
be a combination of educator, social activist and a modern 
entrepreneur. 
  Officials said that most private schools are still not 
independent bodies and do not have their own campuses and 
classrooms. They have to rent those of public schools. 
  The officials pointed out that the establishment of private 
schools has caused a flow of primary and middle school teachers 
from public to private establishments in the city. 
  The high pay for private school teachers has led some 
teachers to the pursuit of nothing but material gains. 
  Relevant government sources said that private schools often 
fall short of the expectations of their teachers in housing, 
medicare and welfare, resulting in a drain of teachers. 
  "An unstable teaching staff cannot ensure the continuity of 
teaching," the sources warned. They also noted that some 
parents have covertly passed on the cost of their children's 
tuition to their work units. 
  Officials said that they have noticed the sharp contrast 
between the superior economic position of private schools and 
the country's difficulties in implementing universal nine-year 
compulsory education. 
  China's call last year for support for the "Hope Project", a 
nationwide program designed to help the poor and school 
drop-outs, was contrasted with the boom in "aristocrats' 
schools". This has aroused an unhappy social sentiment among 
the grassroots, officials said. 
  However, some educators and representatives in the municipal 
people's congress said the fast development of private schools 
was sure to have a significant impact on China's public schools 
as well as on the country's elementary education system. 
  "Private schools will not only reduce state financial 
burdens, but help nurture an atmosphere in which teachers are 
well respected and knowledge is well valued," they said. 
  Officials said that currently private schools are at their 
initial stages, with their number and enrolment remaining on a 
small scale. 
  To curb the blindness in establishing private schools, 
departments of Beijing municipality have been advised to take 
prudent measures and step up checking of applications to set up 
private schools. They said a reasonable ceiling will be placed 
on the number of private schools. 
  A senior scholar with a state educational institution has 
called for tighter government approval of private schools as 
well as stricter regulations to guard the development of such 
schools. 
  The scholar also urged related departments to learn from 
their foreign counterparts in running private schools, such as 
passing laws on private schools, and set up necessary 
organizations to standardize and supervise the operation of the 
schools as well as to protect the rights of private school 
teachers. 
  Officials said it is of utmost importance to drive home the 
fact that private schools, like public ones, are long-term 
systematic social projects, whose terminal objective is to train 
people for the next century. 
  They said that the development of private schools should be 
brought under the macro-control of the government, adding a 
coordinated relationship between private schools and public 
schools will help avoid a blind flow of teachers. 
  People from China's educational communities said that they 
are sure that private schools will become an important part of 
China's educational structure.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According 
to the results of a sample opinion survey, Beijing residents are 
currently most concerned about the reform of the housing system 
(59 percent), and this is followed by their concern over the 
reform of the medical insurance system (56 percent) and the 
reform of the retirement pension system (36.7 percent). 
  The opinion poll was conducted by the Urban Socioeconomic 
Investigation Team of the State Statistical Bureau under the 
auspices of BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO [Beijing Youth News] between 23 
and 28 February. The pollers issued 1,001 questionnaires to 
Beijing residents and collected 997 replies. BEIJING QINGNIAN 
BAO reported the results on 10 March. 
  Commodity and service prices were also a major issue which 
concerned the residents of Beijing, and 46 percent of the 
respondents placed the issue of prices in the top position. 
  Other reform issues which concerned Beijing residents -- in 
addition to the housing, medical-care, and retirement pension 
reforms -- were the construction of the legal system (25 
percent), reform of the political structure (23 percent), 
educational reform (21 percent), reform of the labor, 
employment, and personnel system (19 percent), and reform of 
government institutions (15 percent). 
  Most people maintained that the most important criterion for 
assessing the success of the reform is that most people are 
better- off. People who hold this opinion accounted for 66.5 
percent of the respondents. On the other hand, 76.7 percent of 
the respondents maintained that the main threat to reform comes 
from corruption, and 72 percent of the respondents said that 
only if the government makes great efforts can the 
anticorruption struggle achieve solid results. 
  Among the Beijing residents who were polled, 79 percent 
believed that reform would improve their standard of living, but 
23 percent of older people, especially those above 65, feared 
that reform might lead to a decline in their living standards.

<F P=106> [By Ai Zhisheng (5337 4249 3932), minister of radio, film, </F>
and television: "Persist in the Policy of Doing Two Types of 
Work Simultaneously; Do a Better Job in Radio, Film, and 
Television Propaganda Work"] 
  [Text] Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC 
Central Committee, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core has introduced a series of measures in 
resolutely implementing the policy of "doing two types of work 
simultaneously and laying equal stress on both." The CPC 
Central Committee has incessantly strengthened its leadership 
over propaganda and ideological work and made tremendous 
achievements and progress in overcoming the practice of 
"stressing one aspect to the neglect of others." On guidance 
for the media, the policy of unity, stability, and boosting 
morale has been implemented in the last few years. Under the 
care and direct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and its 
Propaganda Department, press and publication departments have 
united and coordinated with each other in forming a joint force 
and have maintained a high degree of unanimity with the party 
Central Committee, enabling propaganda and ideological work to 
create a comparatively good environment of public opinion for 
reform, opening up, and modernization. All major press units 
are devoting their efforts to deepen press reform. Radio and 
television stations have practiced a rolling, 24-hour broadcast 
system, during which the number of news broadcasts has been 
increased, the volume of information has been expanded, and the 
efficiency has been improved. They have provided some new 
columns including the "oriental era," and have also broadcast 
some good special reports and news commentaries. 
  Some good creations have also emerged in the fields of 
literature and art. Take television series as an example. 
Their quantity and quality are steadily improving. Now there 
about 5,000 television series each year. The Central Television 
Studio alone broadcasts 1,800 television series each year and 
some are fine television series, such as "Tangming Huang," "A 
Native of Beijing in New York," "Big Tide," and "Zhu Jiang 
Filled With Sentiments." 
  Despite big economic difficulties, the film business 
produced 
a number of fine movies with historical subjects on the 
occasions of the 40th founding anniversary of the PRC, the 70th 
founding anniversary of the CPC, and Chairman Mao's centennial. 
For example, the movie "Chongqing Negotiations" has produced 
good social effects and economic results. There are also good 
movies depicting real life. Some days ago, Comrade Li Lanqing 
spoke highly of the movie "Fenghuang Qin" over the telephone. 
Several central leaders also said the movie had practical 
significance. 
  Facts have fully proved that the CPC Central Committee with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is firm and forceful in 
implementing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's policy of "doing two types 
of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both." 
Recently, we have received many letters from watchers, 
including workers, peasants, teachers, intellectuals, and 
leading cadres. Some of them are still working and others have 
retired. Judging from these letters, the people welcome and are 
happy about the practice of doing two types of work 
simultaneously and giving correct guidance to the media. A 
grass-roots-level cadre in Yingkou City, Liaoning Province, 
wrote us a letter saying: "The Central Television Studio has 
recently broadcast rich and exciting programs on evening 
parties, documentary films, and feature films. This is very 
good. I hope your ministry (including provincial and city 
television studios) will frequently make and broadcast exciting, 
interesting, and varied entertainment programs the people like 
to see." "I also ask Minister Ai to inform other central-level 
leaders that China's press publicity and television guidance are 
correct, good, and well-received at present. Only by carrying 
out publicity in this way will a coherent and centripetal force 
be formed, will the entire party, the entire armed forces, and 
the entire people unite around the CPC Central Committee with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and will they work in unity and 
advance bravely according to the grand blueprint on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics designed by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping." 
  After the Central Television Studio broadcast 100 television 
series on patriotism, primary school teachers in Beijing and 
some retired cadres wrote enthusiastic letters to us saying: 
"We are gratified to see recent changes in propaganda work." 
"Broadcasting 100 television series on patriotism is a wise 
move. Many of us warmly support this, both parents and students 
are happy about it." 
  Recently, the Central Radio Station and Television Studio 
increased fine ethnic songs and dances in their broadcasts, as 
well as world famous, high-style entertainment programs. This 
immediately won the masses' approval. A member of the Shanxi 
Provincial Party Committee's Standing Committee wrote a letter 
saying: "Tonight I watched the Central Television Studio's live 
coverage of a `New Year's Concert.' Evidently, the mood in 
literature and art circles is changing for the better and solemn 
music is beginning to appear again. Hopefully, more 
entertainment programs like this will be broadcast. In this 
way, the mood in the entire society will change for the better." 
  Although there has been some improvement in films and 
television programs, there are also some aspects we must face 
squarely. The ideological and artistic quality of films and 
television programs is far from meeting the expectations of the 
party and the people. In pursuit of economic interests, many 
television studios and radio stations have complied with some 
watchers' vulgarity and their programs are full of sex, 
violence, and sordidness. And there have been too many imported 
television programs. Some Chinese-made movies and television 
programs have also adopted a vulgar style imported from abroad 
and some have even distorted history, disseminated wrong ideas, 
and are full of fabrications. These facts have proved that in 
our actual work there is still a need to overcome the habit of 
"stressing one aspect to the neglect of others." In the field 
of radio and television, material development is fast, but the 
quality of movies and television programs cannot meet the 
masses' demand or the need of socialist spiritual civilization. 
  To further implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech 
and the instructions of the national meeting on propaganda and 
ideological work, consolidate our achievements, resolve the 
existing problems, and further carry out the policy of "doing 
two types of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on 
both," we must strengthen our leadership and the entire party 
must take action. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "There is a need 
to strengthen party leadership over the ideological front. 
Principal leaders of party committees from central to local 
levels must take into account the situation, problems, and work 
in theoretical circles, literature and art circles, as well as 
the entire ideological front." Radio broadcasts, films, and 
television programs are a component of the party's ideological 
front, are the mouthpieces of the party and the government, and 
are the bridges between the party and the government on the one 
hand and the people on the other. Radio, film, and television 
departments are exercising dual leadership with equal- level 
party committee and government leadership as the main component. 
We hope that party committees and governments in all localities 
will continue to strengthen their leadership over radio, film, 
and television work and enable local radio and television 
departments and film studios to take propaganda and creation 
work as their central task and improve the quality of their 
programs. 
  I have the following five ideas on how to strengthen 
leadership: 
  1. The task must be clearly defined and our understanding 
must be unified. What is the task of radio, film, and 
television departments? This seems a simple question, but our 
front must clearly understand it. Comrade Deng Xiaoping set a 
clear task and demand on the entire propaganda and ideological 
front, including those engaged in radio, film, and television 
undertakings: "Our publication, television, and all other 
publicity workers must pay attention to this problem. There are 
communist ideals and beliefs in these people's minds. Our next 
generation and the subsequent generation must be educated in 
such a manner that they have lofty communist ideals. Our young 
people must be prevented from falling captive to the decadent 
capitalist ideology. This will absolutely not do." He 
explicitly pointed out that "warriors on the ideological front 
should be engineers of the human soul, hold high the banner of 
Marxism and socialism, educate and guide the people in correctly 
treating history, understanding practice, and having firm faith 
in socialism and party leadership, and encourage the people to 
work harder, make progress, have ideals, morality, culture, and 
discipline, and heroically strive for the materialization of our 
great and magnificent cause of socialist modernization." In 
press work on our front, we must uphold party spirit and 
provided correct guidance for the media. We have a 
comparatively unanimous understanding of this. But our 
understanding of literature and art is a little confused. Some 
comrades only stress that films and television plays are art and 
they themselves are artists; they do not agree that films and 
television programs have educational functions, still less they 
agree with the concept of a "main theme." Some commentaries even 
put forward specious slogans, such as "nonpoliticization," 
"nonheroization," "nontypification," and 
"nonutilitarianization." Some comrades say that film and 
television should mainly be for entertainment purposes. We 
should comprehensively, not one-sidedly, apprehend this issue. 
Films and television programs are for entertainment and 
enjoyment, but are also for improving the people's understanding 
and educating them. We should not stress one of their functions 
to the neglect of the others. These functions are complementary 
to each other and inseparable from each other. Radio, film, and 
television workers are propagandists of the party. In 
particular, they should not forget their heavy responsibility 
for providing ideological education and should, like Premier 
Zhou said, "take pleasure in educating people." They should 
bring the main theme into prominence and stick to 
diversification. They should sing in praise of the main theme 
-- patriotism, collectivism, and socialism -- and make their 
programs rich, healthy, and civilized so as to meet the 
increasing and diverse cultural and entertainment needs of the 
people to the maximum. 
  Last year four departments and commissions, including the 
CPC 
Central Committee's Propaganda Department, selected 100 films 
and television programs on patriotism for public showing once a 
week. This was warmly welcomed by the people and provided us 
with much enlightenment. It completely conformed with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "Chinese history must be used to 
educate young people," and "it is necessary to understand some 
Chinese history, this is a spiritual impetus for China's 
development." In music and songs, we will also sort out and 
select fine works in different historical periods in a planned 
way for reservation purposes. They will be broadcast one after 
another and popularized among the people, with the aim of 
combining popularization and improvement. Efforts will be made 
to gradually substitute high-style, superior Chinese and foreign 
music and plays for negative, decadent, and unhealthy 
entertainment programs and to replace vulgar art with elegant 
art. 
  In accordance with Central Committee and State Council 
leading comrades' instructions, we recently broadcast the 
advanced deeds of a number of middle-aged and young scientists, 
teachers, and personnel who returned from overseas studies. 
They have good morality and are highly professional and 
selflessly dedicated to the motherland's four modernizations. 
This has produced good results. In the future, we will conduct 
more interviews so that advanced people and heroes on all fronts 
will appear on television to display the heroic style and 
features of our era, set a good example for others to follow, 
and encourage healthy trends. 
  2. Corrosion by decadent ideas from abroad must be 
resolutely resisted and the bourgeois life-style must not be 
allowed to spread unchecked in China. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping made overall remarks on what attitude 
should be taken toward Western bourgeois culture: "We should 
learn from the advanced science and technology of developed 
capitalist countries, their operational and managerial methods, 
as well as their knowledge and culture which are beneficial to 
us. Closing ourselves to foreign countries and refusing to make 
progress are stupid. But regarding things in the cultural 
field, Marxism must be used to analyze, appraise, and criticize 
their ideological contents and ways of manifestation." These 
remarks are suitable for our work concerning radio, film, and 
television productions. We must make efforts to follow these. 
Radio, film, and television equipment and technology are 
introduced from advanced countries. We have agreements on 
cooperation and exchanges with more than 100 countries and 
regions in the world and many of our television programs are 
introduced from outside the country. This is necessary. The 
problem is that the programs introduced from outside the country 
are not analyzed or appraised. Comrade Deng Xiaoping criticized 
this situation by saying that even films and video and audio 
tapes which are regarded as being of a low taste, vulgar, and 
harmful by Western countries are imported to China. For some 
time some lowly popular music, rock-and-roll music, and even 
disguised beauty pageants were rampant in radio broadcasts and 
television programs. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has advised us time 
and again: "The implementation of an open policy will 
inevitably bring about some bad things affecting our people. If 
there is any risk to mention, this is the biggest risk." 
"Historical experience suggests that it will not do without 
opening up to the world...opening up to the world will certainly 
bring about some negative factors." We must maintain high 
vigilance against the decadent ideology and culture from outside 
the country. 
  In the media field, a large quantity of Western, Hong Kong, 
and Taiwan films, laser discs, and audio and video products are 
flooding into China through all kinds of legal and illegal 
channels (most are illegal), seriously affecting Chinese-made 
films and occupying most video showing centers in urban and 
rural areas. Most of these films and video and audio products 
are of a low style and have done much damage to young people's 
minds. 
  What is equally noteworthy, some people outside the country 
use money and prizes as bait to reduce others into making films 
which denigrate Chinese history, disseminate China's dark side, 
and negate socialism. Some people have even come to China to 
hold all sorts of "charity performances" disguised as "beauty 
pageants." They use a great deal of money and prizes to 
recklessly propagate high consumption, pleasure seeking, a 
corrupt life-style, and a negative and decadent ideology and 
culture. These activities have produced a great deal of serious 
consequences. For the sake of socialist spiritual civilization 
and to provide better education for the next generation, we must 
firmly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "We are 
firmly pursuing a policy of opening up to the outside world and 
are expanding our exchanges with foreign countries on the basis 
of equality and mutual benefit. At the same time, we should 
remain sober-minded, resolutely resist the corrosion of decadent 
ideas from abroad, and absolutely not allow the bourgeois 
lifestyle to spread in China." 
  3. The relations between economic returns and social benefit 
should be correctly handled and the wrong practice of "gearing 
all efforts toward money-making" must be resolutely opposed. 
  In an article "The Party's Urgent Task on the Organizational 
and Ideological Fronts," Comrade Deng Xiaoping sharply 
criticized the manifestation of "gearing all efforts toward 
money-making" in the cultural field. He pointed out: "This 
`gearing all efforts toward money-making' -- a tendency of 
commercializing spiritual production -- has also found 
expression in other aspects of spiritual production. Some 
people have simply become businessmen who put profit-making 
first." Through practice, we deeply feel that "gearing all 
efforts toward money-making" is an important factor causing the 
practice of "stressing one point to the neglect of others." For 
example, what attitude should we take on satellite television 
programs from outside the country? Out of consideration for the 
country's fundamental interests and for the sake of 
strengthening socialist spiritual civilization, we should 
exercise strict management. This is very explicit, but we have 
encountered many difficulties. An important reason is that some 
people think that there is a large market for manufacturing and 
selling ground antennas, therefore they favor "lifting control." 
In the final analysis, the rampant import of films has been 
caused by "gearing all efforts toward money-making." Some 
Chinese-made films have also imitated imported films to meet the 
vulgar taste of some people, thus causing an unhealthy cycle and 
seriously damaging our spiritual civilization. 
  Through practice, we deeply feel that, although spiritual 
products also bear a commercial nature and the law of value 
should be respected, it is all the more necessary to exercise 
macrocontrol and regulation over spiritual products than 
material products. We should not blindly allow the market to 
regulate the prices of spiritual products. The quality of some 
high-budget television series in the market is not good, and 
this is a clear example. 
  It is the same with films. Films with good box office are 
not necessarily good in quality, because rich people do not 
necessarily have a great ability to appreciate good films. 
Those who can appraise the quality of films are not necessarily 
those who have a lot of money. In the final analysis, this 
boils down to what Premier Zhou has said, namely, it is the 
people who are the most authoritative judges. In a word, we 
must resolutely carry out Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions: 
"Ideological, cultural, educational, and health departments 
should take social effects as their only criterion for judging 
all their activities, and enterprises affiliated with these 
departments should also take social effects as their supreme 
criterion." 
  4. We hope all localities will provide support and assurance 
in terms of policy and principle so as to promote our cause. 
  We hope to introduce some policies to support and encourage 
radio, film, and television businesses. For example, following 
the increase in revenue, our investment should also be increased 
to provide financial support. All local party committees and 
governments are required to do a good job in relaying the 
first-channel programs from central, provincial, and city radio 
and television broadcasts. Many comrades said that reception of 
Central Television Studio programs is hardly available from 
localities outside Beijing, particularly from the grass-roots 
level. The CPC Central Committee's Propaganda Department and the 
Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television have jointly issued a 
circular asking localities to make a success of relaying central 
programs. We suggest "sending charcoal in snowy weather" in 
improving radio and television understanding. We should expand 
our broadcast coverage and should not carry out duplicate 
construction or blindly pursue many programs. It is necessary 
to further resolve the difficulties of rural, mountainous, and 
ethnic areas in receiving radio and television programs. All 
localities should take radio, film, and television undertakings 
seriously. 
  5. We should build our contingent with unremitting efforts 
and improve its quality. 
  The core of strengthening our contingent is strengthening 
party building. In particular, the entire party must be armed 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. In the meantime, we should also 
conduct a profound struggle against corruption for a clean 
administration and firmly stop the practice of "compensatory 
press reports." Now initial results have been achieved in 
stopping the practice of "compensatory press reports." But 
there are still some prominent problems: A small number of 
famous actors and program presenters like to ask for "appearance 
charges," and others are in the habit of demanding pay and 
commission in soliciting sponsorships to evade personal income 
tax. We will continue to resolutely rectify malpractices in our 
undertakings, improve professional ethics, energetically 
propagate the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, hard 
struggle, and selfless dedication, and strive to cultivate a 
fine image and reputation in our socialist radio, film, and 
television undertakings. We are engaged in the production of 
spiritual products, and therefore we should remain in a lofty 
ideological realm. 
  In short, in this new situation, our field undertakes a 
heavy 
task and there are also many problems and difficulties. But we 
firmly believe that under the leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and the State 
Council, with the common efforts of all localities and 
departments, we will uphold the policy of doing two types of 
work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both, proceed 
with our work in a down-to-earth manner, do our jobs solidly, 
scale new heights in radio, film, and television undertakings, 
achieve new progress, and make contributions to strengthening 
socialist spiritual civilization and expediting reform, opening 
up, and modernization.

  [Text] An intellectual salon born during the 1989 
Tiananmen Square protests is to drop its focus on present-day 
China after five years of government imposed restrictions. 
  The Modern Culture Society of China, which held its founding 
meeting within earshot of students parading for change in May 
1989, will turn its attention to ancient Chinese culture, say 
founding members at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 
(Cass) in Beijing. 
  The renamed Chinese Cultural Society will stress "the 
traditional virtues of the Chinese people", one founding member 
said. "We will no longer pay attention to modern problems. 
It's no good doing that now." 
  The society has been under strict supervision by the State 
Council, which runs Cass, since its brief flirtation with free 
expression in 1989, members said. "The society was established 
during a high-point of discussion about Chinese culture and 
society. We could hear the students chanting on Changan Avenue 
during the founding meeting," one member said. The original 50 
members came mainly from the history and literature departments 
of leading Beijing universities. "The permitted scope of the 
society has faced many restrictions. Not all the territory has 
been opened for discussion," said one member at the People's 
University. 
  The move into an area more palatable to the senior 
leadership 
will be supported by the central government, which will approve 
a national charitable society to support the new group's 
academic endeavours, the founding member said. Wealthy foreign 
and domestic businessmen will be sought as benefactors of the 
Chinese Cultural Research Fund, which the central bank was 
expected to grant tax-free status as a charity this year. 
  The society has been suffering from money shortages since 
its 
inauspicious founding and had difficulty scraping together funds 
for its fifth anniversary celebration this year. About 60 
mainland scholars attended the society's seminars in Beijing in 
1991 and in Hainan province last year. The society was 
criticised by Beijing leaders after a resolution was passed at 
the Hainan seminar calling for "a new culture to fit the new 
era". "This was at odds with the party's stress on the 
construction of a civilised society based on traditional Chinese 
morals and values," said one member who attended the Hainan 
seminar, entitled "Trends in modern Chinese culture". 
  Months of internal bickering among members about how to 
resolve the society's financial and intellectual crises finally 
ended earlier this month when a decision was made to "follow the 
trend and concentrate on ancient things", one member said. 
  Some dissenting members have resigned from the society in 
protest. "They have effectively ended the whole idea of the 
society," said one ex-member. "In five years of activities they 
never managed to achieve a breakthrough."

  [Text] Beijing, 15 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Five 
films "met their fates" in China last year, as they touched upon 
"nudity" or "sex." 
  The film "Ghost in the Painting" [hua huan 3973 7609] was 
never approved, although it was revised many times. Its showing 
could have been allowed had the segments containing nudity been 
removed. 
  The film "Red" [hong fen 4767 4720], a co-production between 
a mainland film company and one from Hong Kong, was a story 
adapted from a novel under the same title by Su Tong. 
  Based on a novel under the same title, the Guangdong 
Zhongshan Television Arts Center had originally planned to make 
"White Deer Wilderness" [bai lu yuan 4101 7773 0626] into three 
films and 40 television shows. Since the film had many 
depictions of sex acts, the plan was finally dropped after the 
filmmaker was "internally dissuaded from making it." 
  The film "Jinpingmei" [jin ping mei 6855 3910 2734], a 
40-part television series approved by the Jilin Broadcast and 
Television Department and to be made by the Jilin Culture 
Department, was banned because it contained a great deal of sex, 
which presented a very difficult situation from the visual 
perspective, although the film is based on a classical Chinese 
work and is of a very high academic value. If the film totally 
avoided the topic, it would not be the real "Jinpingmei." If it 
depicted the story as it is written, it would be unsuitable to 
China's national conditions or as a television series and a film. 
  A certain film-making unit in Anhui had planned to produce 
the "Sai Jinhua," which depicts the sex life of deluxe brothels 
during the Qing Dynasty. As the news got around, their 
film-making license was immediately revoked by the relevant 
authorities.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter He Jun: "Digital Network To Upgrade Data </F>
Links"] 
  [Text] China's booming telecommunications sector is 
speeding up development of a nationwide information network as a 
part of its modernization programme for the next century. 
  The drive aims to accelerate information exchange through a 
global digital system to meet the demands of China's fledgling 
market economy. 
  The current task is focused on expanding and upgrading the 
public packet-switching data network, known as Chinapac, said 
Hao Weimin, an official with the Ministry of Post and 
Telecommunications. 
  After joining the network, computers across the country can 
exchange information and contact with other computers at home or 
abroad. 
  The network covers the capitals of China's 30 provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions and is linked with 37 
switching networks in 19 countries and regions. 
  By the end of this year, it will cover 500 domestic cities, 
as local authorities are building 14 provincial networks. 
Another 15 provincial networks have already been established . 
  According to the official, Chinapac is expected to cover all 
the counties in East, South and Central China and part of the 
counties in West China by 1995. 
  Hao also expects that the number of Chinapac users will 
triple to 8,000 this year and grow to 20,000 by 1995. 
  Most of the current Chinapac users are financial 
organizations, banks, stock exchanges and government departments. 
  He stressed the importance of constantly upgrading the 
network's technology and facilities to meet customers' needs.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "High-Powered: A Nuclear Future"] </F>
  [Text] Severe electricity shortages are whetting China's 
appetite for nuclear power, but satisfying this hunger will 
require foreign capital. 
  Sun Guangdi, chief engineer for nuclear power for the China 
National Nuclear Corp (CNNC), said some foreign businesses have 
shown interest in financing new nuclear power plants. 
  As a showcase of what Sino-foreign co-operation can 
accomplish, CNNC officials cite the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant 
in Guangdong Province, the country's first joint venture in this 
field. 
  Sun said many provinces are eager to build more plants, but 
developing nuclear power is hindered by the shortage of capital. 
  Some provinces -- such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, 
Shandong 
and Hainan -- are actively looking for sites and conducting 
feasibility studies of nuclear power plants. 
  All these provinces are in South and East China and suffer 
severe shortages of electricity. 
  "The market for nuclear electricity is potentially vast, and 
with advanced nuclear technology we have the ability to develop 
nuclear power," Sun said. 
  Encouraged by the safe and efficient operation of the 
country's first two nuclear power stations, in Qinshan, 
Zhejiang, and at Daya Bay in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, 
China is stepping up work on other plants. 
  Second-phase construction has already begun at the Qinshan 
plant to install two 600,000-kilowatt generators, Sun said. A 
planned third phase would expand total capacity to 3 million 
kilowatts. 
  The capital for the project came from the State and from 
Shanghai Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui, which use the plant's 
electricity. 
  China also plans to build another nuclear plant in Guangdong 
and one in Liaoning Province. 
  The new plant in Guangdong will be located at Lingao, north 
of Daya Bay. The plant will house two 900,000-kilowatt 
generators, and construction is due to be completed in 2002. 
  Part of the capital for the project will come from the 
profits of Daya Bay, whose No 1 Generator went into commercial 
operation on February 6. Its No 2 Generator is expected to 
begin operating commercially in May or June. 
  The Liaoning plant will be located at Wafangdian near Bohai 
Bay and will have two Russian generators, each with a capacity 
of 1 million kilowatts. 
  Sun said designing of the plant has already begun. 
  "With power shortages becoming increasingly severe in 
China," 
Sun said "nuclear power is a safe, economical and clean way for 
the country to resolve its difficulties." However, Sun said, 
China got a late start in nuclear power and must make big 
strides to catch up with other countries. 
  Nuclear power accounted for only 0.3 per cent of the 
country's total electricity output last year, compared with 78 
per cent in France, 43 per cent in South Korea and 27.7 per cent 
in Japan. 
  China's two nuclear plants generated 2.49 billion kilowatts 
last year and the figure this year is expected to climb to 8 
billion to 10 billion kilowatts. 
  In addition, China is negotiating to build a nuclear power 
plant in Iran with two 300,000-kilowatt generators. 
  Sun said that construction is in full swing on the Chashima 
Nuclear Power Plant in Pakistan, one of China's biggest 
assistance projects in a Third World country.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Electronic Information Network Is On </F>
Horizon"] 
  [Text] While the United States, the European Union and 
Japan are poised to build their "Information Highways," China is 
also gearing up to enter the information era. 
  The ambitious plan, called "The Golden Bridge" project, was 
put forward last July by Hu Qili, Minister of Electronics 
Industry, and is now a national priority. 
  According to experts from the ministry, the massive project 
would set up a nationwide channel devoted to making economic 
information available to the public. 
  This information network would cover all provinces and 
autonomous regions, 500 main cities, 12,000 large enterprises, 
and some key projects such as the Three Gorges dam and the Daya 
Bay Nuclear Power Plant. 
  Experts say the network would transmit data, voices, images 
and faxes by way of fibre-optic cable, satellites, microwave 
transmissions and programme-controlled and mobile 
telecommunications. 
  In addition, financial networks would accommodate the 
demands 
of foreign trade, customs and banking. 
  Such a project could greatly strengthen the government's 
macrocontrol over the economy and bolster the development of 
information services, experts say. 
  The first stage of the project is called "Golden Customs;" 
the second stage, the "Golden Card." 
  "Golden Customs" would link all customs and foreign trade 
enterprises electronically, with the intention of creating a 
paperless trade. 
  Experts say the project would ensure accurate and timely 
statistics on the country's foreign trade and would help check 
malpractices regarding licenses, quotas, settlement of foreign 
exchanges, and taxes. 
  The aim of "Golden Card" is to replace cash with electronic 
money -- credit cards. 
  China, with nearly 1.2 billion people, has issued only 4 
million credit cards. In the United States, on the other hand, 
more than 1 billion credit cards are used by a population of 260 
million. In other words, the average American has nearly four 
credit cards. 
  "Golden Card" would spread the use of credit cards 
throughout 
the major urban areas within 10 years. 
  The "Three Golden" projects would open massive opportunities 
for the electronics industry, said Minister Hu Qili. 
  Electronics enterprises would have to provide large 
quantities of hardware and software for the projects, Hu said. 
  The ministry would also actively co-operate with foreign 
companies to inject capital and advanced technology into the 
projects, said Qu Weizhi, Vice-Minister of Electronics Industry. 
  But Qu stressed that the projects would follow a unified 
standard. Local authorities are prohibited from negotiating 
with foreign companies to import products and technology of 
varying standards. 
  The overall design for the Golden Bridge project will be 
worked out this year, Hu said. 
  Satellite stations for Golden Customs will be linked 
together 
during the first half of the year. 
  Some cities will be selected to test the Golden Card project 
this year. The likely candidates include Beijing, Shanghai, 
Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, Guangzhou.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ou Zhengtao (0260 2973 3447)] </F>
  [Text] Hefei, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- Since the National 
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory [NSRL], which is located at the 
Chinese University of Science and Technology [CUST] in Anhui, 
formally opened to the public in April 1993, it has provided 
advanced-level conditions for scientific research institutes and 
researchers at home to conduct scientific research and 
experiments. So far, it has undertaken more than 120 scientific 
research tasks from 45 research institutes, colleges, and 
universities across the country and has scored a number of 
gratifying achievements in physics, chemistry, life sciences, 
materials sciences, and other branches of learning. 
  Synchrotron radiation is an extremely powerful 
electromagnetic radiation emitted by high-energy electrons 
traveling in the direction of the orbital tangential line at a 
speed close to light in a ring-shaped accelerator. It is very 
powerful and bright, has a continuous frequency spectrum and 
good polarization, has a pulse time structure, and has a clean 
vacuum environment. It has extensive applications in such basic 
sciences as physics, chemistry, biology, medical science, 
surface science, and metrology as well as in fine processing and 
super integrated circuits. As such, it is an advanced means for 
scientific research in the world today and constitutes a field 
of very active forward science and technology. 
  NSRL's synchrotron radiation installation in Hefei is the 
first installation of its kind in China and the only one in 
operation. Construction of the NSRL, which was mainly designed 
by CUST personnel, was completed in 1989; the installation began 
emitting light the same year. It was checked and accepted by 
the government in December 1991. Its major performance figures 
have reached the advanced level of similar installations in 
other parts of the world. After more than a year's operational 
practice, adjustments, and tests, it has succeeded in producing 
a high-brightness operational pattern for the first time through 
adjustments and tests. Its synchronous light source can 
continuously emit light 24 hours a day. With annual operation 
time in excess of 6,000 hours, it can provide more than 3,600 
hours for experiments. All five of its stations for experiments 
in photochemistry, optoelectron energy spectrum, soft X- ray 
microscopy, X-ray phototechnology, and time-sharing light 
spectrum have been put into operation. 
  According to a briefing by Professor Zhang Xinyi, principal 
person in charge of the NSRL and vice president of the CUST, the 
NSRL's scientific and technological personnel and the CUST's 
task force have conducted extensive cooperation with researchers 
of some research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
Southeast China University, Fudan University, Xiamen University, 
Zhejiang University, and the Anhui Provincial Family Planning 
Commission. Using the NSRL's advanced means and multiple 
functions, they have conducted intensive research and 
exploration in both basic sciences and applied technologies, and 
have scored one achievement after another in just a few months. 
Some of their achievements have not been reported to the world. 
Using synchrotron radiation phototechnology to manufacture 
micromachinery is a high technology that rose in the world in 
the eighties. Using the mask they made, lab scientific and 
technological personnel succeeded in etching out a gear with a 
thickness of 50 micrometers plus, which is thinner than hair. 
The technology's development makes it possible to manufacture 
machinery for surgical operations in human blood vessels. They 
have made comparatively great progress in the research and 
application of porous silicon and other materials. They have 
developed porous silicon capable of photo- and 
electroluminescence; and they have observed photosensitive, air 
sensitive, and moisture sensitive phenomena. Among the 
materials they have developed, the moisture sensitive 
transmitter has been granted a patent by the government. They 
have achieved important successes from conducting a great deal 
of research in and tests with such catalysis as oxidation and 
nitrodation on the surface of semiconductors and vacuum 
ultraviolet reflection light spectrum. Taking advantage of 
synchrotron radiation light's special ability to conduct 
microexamination of fresh and living specimen, they have 
succeeded in taking micrographs of the contact between cancerous 
cells in esophagus. They have made satisfactory progress in 
conducting microscopic mechanical research of defects inside 
silicon beams, in conducting research in a free-electron laser 
device and accelerator which were included in the "863" high 
technology program, and in conducting research in short lived 
nuclide radiation medicine. Meanwhile, a number of projects 
currently under research and experimentation are also making 
rapid progress. 
  Scientific and technological personnel have made many 
improvements of the light source of synchrotron radiation, 
thereby greatly enhancing its stability in operation and 
receiving favorable comments from lab users.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (CNS) -- The seismic belt along 
the coastal area of southeast China has not been active when 
compared with the average historical level of activity. This 
justifies the establishment of a second batch of nuclear power 
stations in Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces as being 
relatively safe, member of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the 
State Seismological Bureau Mr. Fang Zhangshun said in an 
interview with this agency. 
  The southern area of Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan suffered 
from fewer earthquakes than North China and Taiwan even though 
they are situated on a seismic belt and quakes measuring more 
than seven on the Richter scale have rocked Quanzhou in Fujian 
and Xiongzhou in Hainan on several occasions in the distant 
past. Quakes which have hit southeast China have mostly been of 
small magnitude and of short duration. 
  The selection of sites for the setting up of nuclear power 
stations is in line with international practice and the 
geological structure of potential sites. A nuclear power 
station must be seated directly in bedrock, meaning no 
establishment of a nuclear power station within a radius of five 
kilometres of an active fault. Anti-quake facilities for nuclear 
power stations are constructed with reference to the greatest 
precautions to cope with the biggest quake which could possibly 
occur within a period of some 10,000 years. The standard in the 
Mainland is much higher than that in Japan and Taiwan where 
nuclear power stations are mushrooming. 
  China will spend ten years on safety assessment and 
anti-quake work on its major nuclear power station projects, 
according to Mr. Fang. A quake measuring six on the Richter 
scale will not be likely to cause great damage or casualties in 
economically-developed areas after a period of ten years. 
  The second nuclear power station in Guangdong will also 
probably be built at Daya Bay while a third one is likely to be 
located at Yangjiang, another city in Guangdong. A nuclear 
power station in Fujian will be constructed either in Huian 
County or Changle County while a second nuclear power plant in 
Zhejiang will be most likely situated at Sanmen. Jiangxi, 
Shandong and Hainan are now working towards the establishment of 
nuclear power stations, having feasibility studies already 
passed.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Fresh Bid To Switch Viewers On to Cable TV"] </F>
  [Text] Cable television is flourishing and recent efforts 
should bring it into the homes of even more Chinese families. 
  The goal is to set up bigger cable TV networks and produce 
more programmes made in China, said Zhou Caifu of the Ministry 
of Radio Film and Television. 
  More than 30 million city residents in the country receive 
cable TV. 
  While the figure is high, it is not very impressive compared 
with China's 800 million TV viewers who own 230 million TV sets. 
  Nevertheless, the popular television service is heading for 
"healthy development," said Zhou, who is head of the ministry's 
cable TV division. 
  Cable TV viewers pay about 300 yuan ($34.50) for equipment 
and a 5 yuan ($0.60) monthly fee for a wider selection of TV 
programmes. 
  The ministry's priority is to expand big cable networks like 
those in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin citywide and to rural 
areas. 
  Zhou said there should be little problem in achieving this 
goal. 
  In the 1980's, cable TV stations and small networks that 
covered factories and districts mushroomed when the new 
entertainment was first introduced into China. 
  In 1991 there were over 1,300 cable TV stations and 10,000 
community cable services. 
  But the development of cable TV was "out of control" before 
1991, Zhou said. 
  Moreover, many stations broadcast smuggled video tapes that 
featured violence or pornography. 
  In 1992, the ministry began to put the cable TV market in 
order. 
  Last year, it inspected cable TV services and approved 744 
stations including 307 city or provincial stations and 437 run 
by large and medium sized enterprises. 
  All provincial capitals and cities under direct central 
planning were required to submit a comprehensive cable TV 
development agenda. To date, the ministry has received 18 
proposals. 
  The other 18 cities are expected to complete their schemes 
this year. 
  Each proposal, Zhou said, contains four parts that deal with 
management, technology, finances, and programmes. 
  Most cable TV stations are unable to produce their own TV 
series. Many have news programmes and sometimes record song and 
dance parties. 
  But most replay programmes from the major networks. And a 
third of the shows come from abroad. Zhou said efforts to 
produce more domestic shows should remedy this problem. 
  Shanghai Cable TV, one of the country's top networks with an 
audience of 700,000, is beginning to experiment with shooting TV 
series. 
  And to produce more high-quality programmes, Zhou said, the 
ministry plans to set up a programme exchange centre. 
  Although cable TV remains in its infancy, the ministry also 
has plans to tap cable's other functions, from communications to 
multimedia information services. 
  It plans trial projects that use cable to transmit telephone 
calls.

  [Text] Harbin, March 16 (XINHUA) -- A new kind of 
intelligent robot which is able to climb vertical walls to 
examine storage tanks of dangerous materials has been created. 
  The remote-controlled robot, developed mainly by researchers 
at the Harbin Engineering University in Heilongjiang Province, 
is the first of its kind in China. 
  It can adhere to the surface of storage tanks holding 
radioactive materials to check their brazing seams and the 
thickness of the tank walls. It can also carry out safety 
examinations, rust ridding and lacquer spraying for various 
containers in the chemical industry, and clean-up work on 
skyscrapers. 
  The machine consists of six parts: a robot transporter, the 
robot itself, highly flexible mechanical arms, a control system, 
a visual system and an ultrasonic detection system.

<F P=106> [By Rao Tianfa (7437 3240 4099), Luo Weizheng (5012 4850 </F>
2398) and Sun Lianxing (1327 6647 5281): "To Achieve the 
Brilliance Today -- an Account of the Data-Collection Operation 
on China's First Hydrogen Bomb Explosion"] 
  [Text] The historical account reads like a legend. 
  In the late 1960's, 30 minutes after the detonation of a 
hydrogen bomb, nine crewmen attached to a certain air force unit 
stationed in Jiangxi flew through the mushroom cloud, at the 
risk of their lives, and completed a sample-gathering mission 
for scientific research, thereby making an outstanding 
contribution to accelerating the development of our country's 
nuclear weapons. They astonished the world, and the Chinese 
were proud of them. For reasons of scientific research 
confidentiality, until recently this amazing story was known to 
only a few. 
<H5>  Secret Site Transfers </H5>
  The story began in 1964, after China had successfully 
detonated the first atomic bomb, and the scientific research 
departments of the Ministry of National Defense were working at 
full throttle to make a hydrogen bomb. The making of a hydrogen 
bomb, however, could not be achieved at one go. The United 
States spent seven years in the process. France was still 
empty-handed after four years of effort. Chairman Mao said: 
"Our country must even be faster than the United States and 
France; we will make a hydrogen bomb in three years." 
  Very high speed requires supreme scientific and 
technological 
efforts, as well as extraordinary courage. After repeated 
argumentation, scientists boldly floated the idea of collecting 
nucleoids and observing the whole nuclear proliferation process 
by means of manned aircraft. After the headquarters and the Air 
Force Combat Department studied had the idea, they handed the 
important mission down to a certain Air Force unit that had won 
great merit in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. 
  On an unforgettable spring evening, the conference room of 
the party committee of the certain unit was brightly lit and 
very quiet. A special, secret meeting was taking place. 
  Yu Qiancheng, director of the Air Force Combat Department, 
on 
behalf of the Central Military Commission, ordered a special 
sortie: "The military commission is ordering a secret site 
transfer; you will be sent to northwest to carry out the mission 
of flying through the mushroom cloud to retrieve samples 
resulting from a nuclear experiment...." 
  After a short mobilization, the secret site transfer began. 
  That day, they took off and flew into the morning sun [zhao 
yang 2600 7122], having set their navigational compasses in a 
northwesterly direction. Their destination: Gansu's Wuwei 
Airport. 
  The site-transfer flight lasted more than two hours. Fuel 
consumption projections estimated that the fuel-consumption 
warning lights would be blinking by the time the planes reached 
the destination. This meant the pilots would face disastrous 
consequences if they wasted so much as one drop of fuel. 
  However, the flight path was the shortest one possible; 
there 
was no other choice. They had to go that way, even if it meant 
going through hell. 
  The planes were now off the ground and climbing rapidly. 
They set their engines to cruising speed, so as to economize on 
fuel. Twenty minutes later, the weather of a sparsely inhabited 
desert turned nasty. Black clouds appeared in the sky, and the 
planes flew past them. Approaching the airport, the planes 
began to lose altitude in preparation for landing. The clouds 
were low and dense, and the rain was heavy. Through their radio 
headphones, the crewmen could hear the rain hitting the 
fuselages. The dials of the radio compasses were spinning 
violently. The ground was all foggy. 
  "Don't panic; land with the help of instruments," instructed 
the tower conductors. The slightest hesitation or error at a 
critical moment meant running out of fuel, abandoning planes, 
and bailing out. All the ground staff were worried sick. 
  The pilots kept their nerve, their eyes glued to the 
altitude 
and horizontal level meters, their hands reducing fuel and 
pushing levers. The planes were coming down. 
  100 m, 50 m, 20 m... 
  At last, the planes touched the ground, with sparks trailing 
on the runway. All nine planes landed safely. 
<H5>  Flying Through the "Forbidden Zone" </H5>
  No one had attempted to fly through a mushroom cloud to 
collect samples. The Soviet Union and the United States had 
made such attempts, but when the pilots saw the thick fiery 
clouds with blood- red gaping mouths, none of them wanted to 
risk their lives, and all bypassed the clouds. What would the 
Chinese pilots do? People waited anxiously to find out. 
  A silver-haired scholar on the dais explained, in all 
seriousness, the dangers of passing through mushroom clouds. 
He said: "I will adopt corresponding measures to ensure the 
safety of your lives to the extent possible, but your health 
will be affected to varying degrees." 
  He paused, then asked each pilot about his immediate family, 
including their sexes. In fact, one of the selection criteria 
for personnel on this mission was that they had to be married 
and have children. 
  It was easy to see that the professor was caught in a 
dilemma: He hoped the personnel could complete the mission in a 
satisfactory manner, but dreaded the physical damage caused by 
nuclear radiation. 
  "Just give the order, professor; do what you should do. All 
of us are mentally prepared. We want to complete the mission; 
that is all we care about." Although they were not top-notch 
scientists and technologists, the pilots were equally eager and 
sincere in working for the scientific and technological 
development of their motherland. 
  "Thank you, everyone. I believe that at the end of the day 
we 
can submit to the motherland and the people some test results 
that can measure up." The old professor was visibly touched and 
tears welled up his eyes. 
  The desert storm worsened after dark. The pilots found 
themselves keyed up and unable to relax. 
  "To the Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We are 
determined to complete the mission and we hold no grudges, even 
if we all become vegetables after the mission..." At the 
headquarters, Zhang Aiping, deputy chief of the PLA General 
Staff, held in his hand the letter of determination signed by 
the nine crewmen. He was overwhelmed with emotion. He reported 
to the military commission that the air crew was ready. 
  It was a sunny day on 9 May 1966, the day China's first 
hydrogen bomb was to be tested. 
  The airport looked particularly grim that day. Chairman 
Mao's quotations and various slogans could be seen everywhere. 
Dozens of scientists were looking through their binoculars, and 
Zhang Aiping was seated in front of the radio to update the 
central leaders on the progress. The atmosphere was so tense it 
was nerve-wrecking. 
  The planes were to fly past the cloud in five formations. 
Regimental Commander Huan Shulin got the right to lead the 
formation because he held the highest rank. 
  At 0940, a green signal flare arched through the sky. 
  The planes taxied, took off, and flew into the sky. 
  "Taishan reporting: We have reached the destination." 
Twenty minutes later, the planes were above the test site. 
Before them was a glaring tangerine mushroom cloud, slowly 
rising and expanding, and looking like a sunset from afar with a 
burning volcano nearby. Hang Shulin flew into the mushroom 
cloud without the slightest hesitation. 
  "Proceed as planned"; the commander's order came through the 
radio. All of sudden, the cabin was lit by very bright light. 
Hang quickly flipped on all the instruments and the 
electrically powered door for the retrieval operation. The 
meter dials jumped to the top, and engine temperature and 
revolution rate all rose slightly. Hang registered every detail 
with his eyes. 
  With the courage of a superman, Hang Shulin obtained highly 
valuable data and information. Encouraged by his actions, his 
comrades-in-arms completed the mission brilliantly and in high 
spirits. 
  The vast desert witnessed the entire flight. These names 
were inscribed in the republic's roll of honor: Hang Shulin, Hu 
Guangqiang, Xu Shaochen, Zhang Changkun, Qian Yingfa, Chen 
Qingluan, Du Jicheng, Liu Yuji, and Liu Zitian. 
  The Central Military Commission signed an order to confer 
Grade 1 individual and collective merits on all nine crewmen. 
<H5>  The Story Did Not End There </H5>
  With their lives, they wrote a glorious chapter. How are 
these merit-winning fighters faring today? 
  On a warm and sunny day, this writer arrived at the Nanchang 
Military Cadre Guest House. 
  Welcoming him at the door was an old man with a white beard 
and deep wrinkles on his forehead. He was Chen Qingluan. A few 
years ago, he retired as deputy divisional commander. The 
writer introduced himself and stated his purpose of the visit. 
Chen opened the conversation. 
  One week after completing their mission, they all lost their 
appetite and strength. Many of them became bald within days as 
a result of exposure to radiation. The impact of radiation on 
the human body varies, and as the victims age the differences 
become more noticeable. 
  His name is Hu Guangqiang. Aged 61 and wearing a cotton hat 
rarely seen in the south, he has a very old and sallow face, one 
that is much older than his age. It is hard to see in him even 
a trace of the heroic demeanor of his youth. He was exposed to 
twice as much radiation as the others, and since then has 
complained of tinnitus, dizziness, lack of strength, and being 
subject to attacks of influenza. His white cell count is 300 
cc, one-third lower than normal. He suffers from chronic 
hepatitis and incurable liver inflammation. His physician can 
do nothing about his case, merely advising him to exercise more 
and pay attention to his diet. 
  He jogs four miles along the riverside every morning and 
practices one hour of qigong during the day, whether in freezing 
cold or scorching heat. He is fighting the diseases and 
struggling to stay alive. People around him are touched by his 
tenacious spirit. 
  With the onslaught of mercantile values, concepts of value 
and outlook on life have changed. How does Hu Guangqiang view 
his past act of dedication? 
  "I have never regretted it. It was our duty to contribute to 
national revitalization, and this was even truer for a soldier 
like me." He views what he did as a requirement and as a 
mission every soldier would be glad to accept. He has sent two 
of his children into the Army who would relive what he has gone 
through. 
  Owing to the constraints of time and the journey, this 
writer 
was unable to fathom the inner recesses of all nine 
merit-winners, but he believes that these fearless and selfless 
people of the older generation all have a noble heart. Without 
regret or complaint, they dedicated themselves to national 
wealth and power.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- China's economic 
surge will lead to fast development of coal, oil, natural gas, 
nuclear power and its mining and smelting industries, according 
to organizers of the Sixth Minerals and Energy Forum. 
  The symposium, sponsored by the Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Council (PECK), closed here Friday [18 March] in Beijing. 
  During the two-day meeting, Chinese energy officials 
introduced the state plans to develop the country's energy and 
minerals industries. 
  They noted that the demand for energy and minerals will soar 
by the end of the century. 
  They said the government encourages domestic enterprises to 
tap foreign funds, technology and management to ease current and 
predicted shortages. 
  In China, the annual demand for coal in 1995 is estimated to 
reach 1.23 billion tons and hit 1.4 billion tons by the year 
2000. 
  To meet the burgeoning demand, China will pump 200 billion 
yuan in the coming years to build 20 energy bases and 15 key 
mines, said Fan Weitang, vice minister of coal industry. 
  About 19 major projects, including 14 mine-mouth power 
plants 
and three coal mines, are being offered for development with 
foreign investment. 
  The ministry also is considering the construction of a 
300-km 
pipeline for transporting coal from Yuxian County in Shanxi 
Province to Weifang, Shandong Province. 
  Some U.S. firms have shown interest in investing in this 
project. 
  Also, China is planning to produce 100 to 120 million tons 
of 
steel by the turn of the century.

<F P=106> [Report by WEN WEI PO news team: "Central Authorities Seek </F>
To Maintain Stability, Decide To Postpone Some Reforms"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- As disclosed by an 
authoritative source here, a senior CPC leader said a few days 
ago: The central authorities have made it clear that future 
reforms will be carried out in the light of overall benefits and 
tolerance. This year, except for the financial structural 
reforms in taxation, pricing, banking, foreign trade, 
investment, and so on, which must be put into effect, other 
reforms may be postponed for the time being after consultation, 
if people really have misgivings about them. However, the 
authoritative source did not give details about which reforms 
would be put off. 
  According to the source, this is the latest guideline from 
the CPC hierarchy on reform issues this year, after listening to 
opinions from various quarters including deputies to the 
National People's Congress, Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference committee members, and so on, in order 
to maintain a stable situation wherein everybody has peace of 
mind. The source quoted the senior CPC leader as saying: When 
discussing the reforms for this year, in view of the fact that 
the reform measures will be more vigorous and the reform content 
more comprehensive, the central authorities are worried about 
the issue of tolerance and, accordingly, have set out this 
principle: All reform measures which can be introduced should 
be put into practice as soon as possible but the risks from 
should be assessed and those measures lacking the confidence of 
success can be postponed for the time being. 
  The senior leader stressed that the financial structural 
reforms in taxation, pricing, banking, foreign trade, 
investment, and so on should be carried out this year. 
Otherwise, reforms will never be accomplished. Since China now 
wants to establish a market economy, these issues must be 
settled sooner or later. As to how to get things done in a 
safer way, we must be very careful indeed, in handling the 
issues. Regarding those issues which people are really worried 
about, these can be put off for the time being after 
consultation. The central authorities have clarified the point 
that, in future, the following two principles relating to reform 
and opening up should be adhered to: 1) the people as a whole 
should receive benefits, which means that the introduction of 
any reform measure must bring benefits rather than losses to the 
majority of the masses; and 2) taken as a whole, all reform 
measures must be tolerable for the masses and, if they are 
intolerable, they must not be introduced even though they are 
correct. The question of when they should be introduced should 
be decided in accordance with actual conditions. 
  The CPC leader maintained that the guiding ideology for 
reforms this year is to exercise prudence in introducing reform 
measures. If reform measures adopted this years are successfully 
implemented, that will be a very important advance toward the 
establishment of the market economy. Although we must be on the 
alert against a number of issues, some of them being 
comparatively serious, the central authorities are still 
optimistic that reforms will meet with success. First, the 
central leadership is relatively sober-minded as it has kept a 
constant watch on the issue of overall benefits and tolerance. 
Secondly, the current conditions are different from those in 
1988, as there are more commodities in the markets and the 
tolerance of the masses is also much greater. Thirdly, the 
leading cadres in localities have preparations, aspirations, and 
demands for accelerating in-depth reforms, so that some tough 
reform problems can be tackled effectively together with the 
central authorities with concerted efforts. The central 
authorities call on leading cadres at all levels to be prepared 
for danger in times of peace despite the exceptionally favorable 
situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Qingxian (3769 3237 2009) from the "Talks </F>
on Building a Modern Enterprise System" column: "The Deepening 
and Development of Enterprise Reform"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: The objective of deepened 
enterprise reform is to establish a modern enterprise system. 
Beginning today, RENMIN RIBAO will open a column entitled 
"Talks on Building a Modern Enterprise System," which is aimed 
at answering new questions as the are raised in practice. We 
hope that the readers will join us in thinking, exploring, and 
triumphantly fulfilling this major task entrusted by history. 
[end editor's note] 
  As enterprise reform has entered the stage of the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system, does it mean that 
we are introducing something new with enterprise reform? The 
managers of some enterprises have even asked with doubt: Do we 
have to stop the ongoing enterprise reform and start over with 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system? 
  This question shows that our publicity and explanation of 
the 
reform, specifically, the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system, is not sufficient. 
  Thanks to the vigorous explorations in various fields over 
the past decade or so, enterprise reform has undergone the 
different stages of the delegation of power and the sharing of 
benefits, the two-step reform of substituting taxes for the 
delivery of profits, the enterprise contract responsibility 
system, and the transformation of the enterprise operational 
mechanism. A review of the course that has been taken clearly 
shows that it has developed from outside to inside, from shallow 
to deep, and from easy to difficult. The next stage of reform 
never negates the former. Conversely, the former reform is 
always the basis and prerequisite of the one that follows, which 
is introduced on the basis of the priorities and difficult 
points raised by the former. The relationship between the two 
is between inheritance and development. The four aspects of a 
modern enterprise system constitute the highest objective of 
enterprise reform. Now this objective has been clearly set 
forth before us. It is the result of constant explorations over 
the past decade or so. This objective is not the result of one 
individual's sudden inspiration. Instead, it lay latent in 
every stage of enterprise reform. The "Decision of the CPC 
Central Committee on Economic Structural Reform" adopted by the 
Third Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee clearly 
stated that the purpose of enterprise reform is that "the 
enterprise should truly be made a relatively independent 
economic entity and should become a producer and operator in 
socialist commodity production which is independent and 
responsible for its own profits and losses, which is capable of 
transforming and developing itself, and which acts as a legal 
person with certain rights and duties." When the "regulations" 
were promulgated, the objective of enterprise reform were 
expressed in more explicit terms: "The enterprise should meet 
market demand and become a producer and operational unit of 
commodity production which is independent and responsible for 
its own profits and losses, which is capable of developing 
itself and exercising self restraint, and acts which as a legal 
person enjoying independent civil rights and undertaking civil 
duties." The different expressions may inevitably indicate the 
characteristics of the specific stage, but the theme of pushing 
enterprises to the market and changing their status of being 
attached to the government is the same. 
  There are successful experiences as well as setbacks and 
lessons to be drawn from the past decade of enterprise reform. 
The formulation of establishing a modern enterprise system 
derives from summing up both experience and lessons. Separating 
government administration from enterprise management and 
ownership from operation has been the clear guiding ideology of 
enterprise reform. With the further deepening of reform, we are 
making more explorations in this field. As both the contract 
system and the "regulations" have not touched on the central 
question of enterprise property rights, there will be numerous 
difficulties in implementing the guiding ideology. Proceeding 
from the analysis of these circumstances, we have come to the 
following conclusion: When property rights are not clearly 
defined, it will be impossible to separate government 
administration from enterprise management and ownership from 
operation. 
  Therefore, we say that the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system, which clearly defines property rights, is 
being proposed to meet the needs of deepened enterprise reform. 
It is aimed at developing and improving rather than negating 
the measures of enterprise reform, which include the contracted 
responsibility system and the "regulations." When the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system is still being tried 
out, the enterprises that have not been selected for undergoing 
the experiment should continue the effective reform methods, 
which have been implemented or are being implemented and which 
conform to enterprise reality. In the course of practice, they 
should try to move closer to the standard of a modern enterprise 
system.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (CNS) -- The State Statistical 
Bureau and the Ministry of Supervision have joined forces to 
fight against false reports on industrial output value. The two 
departments have since the beginning of this year dispatched 
investigative teams to several areas to look into allegations 
relating to violations of the regulations on statistics mainly 
due to individual interest sought by some leading cadres and 
officials. It was found that such infringements were quite 
serious and covered a wide area. 
  Some party and government leaders exaggerated their 
achievements and made false reports on industrial output value. 
Local statistical bureaus under pressures from their leading 
organs could not help but follow instructions from the local 
leadership in making false reports on industrial output value in 
breach of regulations on statistics. Some local party and 
government organs comparing themselves with other regions in 
terms of success achieved in industrial production were to blame 
for false reports on industrial output value made by some towns 
and enterprises. 
  Some regions changed the unified statistical practice 
available nationwide causing false statistics on industrial 
output value. 
  A circular issued by the two departments pointed out that 
infringement of the regulations on statistics and making false 
reports on statistical work ran counter to the spirit of seeking 
truth from facts required of the party. As a result the state 
loses reliable scientific data and information for 
macro-economic regulation. Wrong decisions mainly due to wrong 
information have caused the state serious economic damage.

  [Text] Select enterprises in key industries would be kept 
afloat by funds from the central Government in Beijing, 
according to a Ministry of Labour report to the NPC. Some 
enterprises in the coal, metal, electricity, machinery and 
petro-chemical industries would be helped to meet their debts, 
pay wages and maintain normal production. The reports said the 
State Council would select which enterprises would be helped. 
Meanwhile, the State Economic and Trade Commission would join 
hands with other ministries in searching for a solution to the 
problem of so-called triangular debts, those owed by enterprises 
to each other. 
  Documents compiled for NPC delegates acknowledge more state 
firms were running at a loss and that the chronic problem of 
triangular debts had worsened. The Ministry of Labour said an 
acute problem of the economy was growing losses in a 
considerable number of state enterprises. Worst hit were 
enterprises in the coal, textile, military, forestry and 
mechanical industries. The number of cases of suspension, or 
part suspension, of production has grown. "Some enterprises 
were only able to provide enough for the living expenses of 
workers. Some even failed to do this," the report said. Much 
had been done but the problem had not been solved. 
  The State Council met earlier this month to discuss the 
issue 
and called for prompt action to maintain stability. The report 
said the Government would take immediate steps to solve 
livelihood issues facing the people while intensifying reform of 
state firms. 
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Security reported an 
increase in public petitions last year over work-related 
matters. In Liaoning, a major bastion of state enterprises, 
some workers were not paid for up to two months. The provincial 
governor, Yue Qifeng, warned such problems could not be allowed 
to continue. Mr Yue said their state firms carried triangular 
debts of 46 billion yuan (HK$40.8 billion) last year, up from 36 
billion yuan in 1992. Although no strikes took place in 
factories, the governor said more people have petitioned the 
Government for assistance.

  [Text] China's ailing state enterprises have suffered 
losses of at least 130 billion yuan (HK$115.44 billion) and the 
multiple debts among them stood at 140 billion yuan, according 
to official statistics. The plight of the 14,000-strong 
state-owned medium and large enterprises was addressed in a 
report compiled by the State Economic and Trade Commission 
(SETC). 
  Giving an account of the chronic problems facing state 
firms, 
the report said many of these enterprises encountered grave 
operational difficulties. "They are faced with (the threat of) 
closure, half- closure or even bankruptcy. Many enterprises 
have had difficulty in paying wages to their workers," the SETC 
report said. 
  The SETC said the problem of so-called triangular debts had 
worsened. Based on a survey among coal, electricity and 
metallurgical industries conducted recently, the report said the 
total size of triangular debts had reached 140 billion yuan. 
The shortage of funds for fixed-asset investments was also 
responsible for the increase in debts, it said. In the face of 
the re-emergence of the triangular debt problem, senior Chinese 
officials at the NPC have indicated that another concentrated 
drive to clear the debts would be launched in some badly-hit 
regions. 
  Based on a joint survey conducted by several ministries in 
16 
major cities, the SETC reported that state enterprises were also 
faced with a huge external debt burden. The enterprises 
surveyed had a total of 319.5 billion yuan of debts--excluding 
the debts they owed each other--while their total assets stood 
at 447.1 billion yuan. The same survey found that the state 
enterprises in the 16 cities had to shoulder the financial 
burden of giving pensions to 3.07 million retired workers, who 
represented 36.7 percent of their payroll. The SETC report 
admitted that the burden of community services, low floating 
capital and out-dated production structures had added to the 
plight. 
  The SETC report said the central Government would take steps 
to close loopholes through which state assets could be lost 
during the transitional period of enterprise reform. Mapping 
out the strategy to revamp the state sector this year, the 
report said the central Government would organise relevant 
departments to solve the problem of multiple debts. 
  The problems of the past--unreasonable debts and the 
shortage 
of funds for retired workers--would be solved so that 
enterprises could compete in a market economy, the report said. 
It said the SETC would launch a joint inspection with the 
Finance Ministry to asses the assets of 10,000 medium and large 
enterprises later this year. Emphasising that state firms had 
contributed 67 percent of the total business tax in the country, 
the report said their standing as the backbone of the national 
economy must be upheld. This would guarantee the stability and 
development of the national economy, the report said.

  [Text] Senior officials have hinted that containing 
inflation to 10 percent this year will be almost impossible. In 
a report to the National People's Congress (NPC) the State 
Planning Commission said it anticipated an "extremely arduous" 
battle against inflation. 
  The commission said prices had stayed high since the start 
of 
this year after a rebound of inflation in November and December. 
Steadily increasing grain price rises were pushing inflation, 
the commission said. The commission said Beijing also recently 
drew from the grain reserve to provide relief to some disaster 
and poverty-stricken regions. "Although grain prices have 
receded from high levels it will be extremely difficult to keep 
it to a lower level," the commission said. "It is anticipated 
that grain prices across the country will stay at the present 
high level or above." Prices of vegetables, meat, consumer 
products such as shoes, home appliances and publications as well 
as raw materials for agriculture including fertilisers had 
continued to rise. 
  Looking ahead, it said high overall demand would continue to 
put great pressure on prices. Excessive growth in fixed-assets 
investment and money supply last year would continue to make an 
impact. The commission predicted that the growth in consumption 
would outstrip last year's increase. And last year's 
deregulation of price controls over many basic goods would begin 
to influence production costs. Moreover, the State Planning 
Commission warned that there was no room for optimism for the 
so-called "vegetable basket" project aimed at ensuring adequate 
supply of non-staple food this year. Much farming land had been 
taken over by urban development. "It will take time for the 
various measures to boost the supply of grain, cotton, edible 
oil and other non-staple food products. The supply of some 
agricultural products will remain strained." 
  Outlining the anti-inflation measures this year, the 
commission said the State Council would control the introduction 
of price reforms. Price readjustments to help solve the 
problem of unreasonably low prices for grain, cotton and 
petroleum would remain the centre-piece of this year's reform 
programme. The State Council would strictly supervise reform at 
all levels to ensure increases imposed were not excessive. And 
the commission said regional authorities should introduce the 
reforms gradually and should fully consider how much the public 
could bear and whether the reform would undermine stability. 
  "The prices of daily necessities should not be arbitrarily 
raised," the commission said. "(Local Governments) can provide 
some price subsidies whenever necessary." Local Government 
should not lower the amount of money allocated to subsidising 
price of goods, it said. [sentence as published]

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Excessively Rapid Growth by </F>
Foreign-Funded Enterprises Will Adversely Affect Foreign 
Exchange Market"] 
  [Text] An internal State Council analysis report has 
pointed out that the excessively rapid growth of investment by 
foreign businessmen in China will adversely affect China's 
surging foreign debt and will weaken the foreign exchange market 
and the balance between international income and expenditure. 
Adequate attention must be paid to this issue. 
  Figures show that in 1993, the total value of imports and 
exports by foreign-funded enterprises in China was $67.07 
billion, a 53.3- percent increase over 1992. Of the total 
import and export value, all of the economic sectors in China 
(referring to state-owned, collective, joint-venture, solely 
foreign-owned, and individual economies) they account for 34.3 
percent, while exports by foreign- funded industries increased 
by almost 8 percentage points over 1992. According to estimates, 
in 1994, the volume of exports by foreign- funded enterprises 
will account for 40 percent of the total volume of exports in 
the country. 
  According to relevant experts, what is noteworthy is that, 
China's estimated foreign debt in 1993 was $80 billion, $10.7 
billion more than in 1992. The debt repayment rate is about 16 
percent, and this means it has come closer to the foreign debt 
warning line generally used by the international community. 
After the unification of China's exchange rate, when 
foreign-funded enterprises use foreign exchange to pay principle 
and interest or remit profits, a new, strong external force will 
emerge and affect the foreign exchange market. 
  Another thing which worries the relevant departments in 
China 
is that the net increase in value of exports by foreign-funded 
enterprises has already surpassed the net increase in the value 
of exports by other economic sectors in China (mainly 
state-owned and collective enterprises). In 1993, the total 
export value of foreign-funded enterprises was $25.24 billion, a 
45.4 percent increase over 1992, and the net increase in value 
was $7.87 billion, which is 27.5 percent of the country's total 
export value and an increase of 7 percentage points over 1992. 
The total value of exports by other economic sectors in China 
decreased in 1993, whereas for imports, the total value of 
imports by foreign-funded enterprises also climbed to an 
important position: accounting for 32.8 percent of the 
country's total import value in 1992 to 40.2 percent of the 
country's total import value in 1993, and the net value of 
imports increased 66.1 percent over 1992, whereas the net value 
of imports by other economic sectors in China increased by only 
1.7 percentage points. In order words, growth in imports and 
exports in China in 1993 was basically determined and realized 
by foreign-funded enterprises. In addition, data and figures 
also show that in 1993, China's unfavorable foreign trade 
balance also came mainly from unfavorable trade balances among 
foreign-funded enterprises. 
  In 1993, the unfavorable balance between imports and exports 
in China was $12.18 billion. This was due to the fact that 
although other economic sectors in China had a favorable balance 
between imports and exports of about $4 billion, the unfavorable 
balance between imports and exports from foreign-funded 
enterprises was $16.59 billion. The unfavorable balance in 
foreign-funded enterprises was mainly manifested in the use of 
equipment and materials for their investments in China, with the 
amount reaching $16.63 billion. 
  According to a relevant informed source, the rapid increase 
in the proportion of foreign trade carried out by foreign-funded 
enterprises in China has caused a decrease in the share of 
foreign trade held by China's state-owned and collective 
enterprises, and relevant departments in Beijing worry that this 
will constitute a threat to China's balance of international 
income and expenditure to the extent of affecting the country's 
long-term and stable economic development.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "State to Issue Treasury </F>
Notes Next Month"] 
  [Text] China is expected to issue two-and three-year 
treasury bonds starting April 1 in a bid to pool idle funds from 
the public to support the country's economic development. 
  The two-year bonds will carry an interest rate of 13 
percent, 
1.3 points higher than bank deposits of the same term. 
  Interest rates for the three-year bonds will be 13.96 
percent, 1.72 points higher than a three-year fixed deposit. 
  These bonds will be sold to both individual investors and 
institutional buyers. 
  This bond issue comes at a crucial time for the Finance 
Ministry, which hopes treasury bonds to become a key tool for 
raising capital from residents. 
  And starting this year, State treasury bonds will be the 
sole 
means of offsetting the national deficit--estimated at 60 
billion yuan ($6.9 billion) for 1994. 
  Meanwhile, the two-year bonds are expected to be traded in 
markets two months after the issuance concludes on May 31. 
  The three-year bond purchasers will be given certificates to 
prove ownership, rather than the normal paper bonds. This 
should be more convenient for buyers. 
  The three-year issuance is expected to end on June 30. 
  In addition, to attract more investors, the ministry will 
encourage people to cash in their 1991 three-year treasury bonds 
-- due on July 1 -- and the five-year 1989 special treasury 
bonds early and use the money to buy the new bonds. 
  These buyers will get 1 percentage point more interest for 
their old bonds. 
  And investors will also be able to cash their new three-year 
certificates in advance and still earn more interest than bank a 
deposit if they hold the bonds for more than six months. 
  The ministry is optimistic this year's bond issue because of 
the high interest rates, the flexible means in floating the 
bonds, the improved macro-economic order and the central 
government's determination in controlling the inflation. 
  Meanwhile, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli vowed on Wednesday 
that State employees will not have to buy into its treasury 
bonds flotation this year. 
  "I believe issuance will be much easier than last year since 
we are operating a better financial market," he said. 
  Last year's 30 billion yuan ($3.45 billion) bond flotation 
was hampered by illegal fund raising early in 1993 which 
siphoned off bank deposits. 
  China plans to issue a total of 100 billion yuan ($11.5 
billion) in treasury bonds this year. 
  In January, the ministry issued six month and one year 
paperless treasury bonds mainly to institutional buyers.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "Beijing Tops Trade of </F>
Treasury Bonds"] 
  [Text] The Beijing Commodity Exchange (BCE) has become 
the country's biggest centre for futures trading in State 
treasury bonds. 
  BCE Director Chen Xiong said 60 million yuan ($6.9 million) 
of treasury bond futures are traded each day at the exchange. 
  Speaking yesterday at the exchange's first meeting of member 
companies, he said transaction value in bond futures at BCE has 
been 1.3 billion yuan ($149.4 million) since it opened on 
December 15 last year. 
  Futures trading in treasury bonds started on the Shanghai 
Stock Exchange last October. 
  Chen said prospects for the market are rosy since China 
plans 
to issue 1OO billion yuan ($11.4 billion) worth of treasury 
bonds this year. 
  More importantly, the People's Bank of China's open market 
operation is to start this year. 
  Its control of the money supply through buying and selling 
government bonds should improve futures trading, Chen said. 
  BCE officials said treasury bonds, along with corn, bean, 
sugar and copper futures are the most actively traded products 
on the exchange. 
  And since it opened, total transaction value at the BCE has 
topped 8 billion yuan ($919 million). 
  More than 500 people from the exchange's 225 member 
companies 
attended yesterday's meeting.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Bankers to Beat Inflation </F>
Without Austerity Drive"] 
  [Text] China's central bank has ruled out the possibility 
of an austerity drive to fight inflation. 
  "We're concerned about inflationary pressure at present, but 
we are confident we can deal with it," Zhou Zhengqing, 
Vice-Governor of the People's Bank of China, told journalists in 
Beijing yesterday. 
  Inflation in 35 major Chinese cities hit 23.3 percent in 
January. This far exceeds the government target of 10 percent 
for the whole year. 
  "We will screen out excessive investment in fixed assets, 
but 
that does not mean a stringent policy will be imposed," said Dai 
Xianglong, another vice-governor of the bank. 
  The country's commercial banks have big reserves and are 
ready to finance "sustained development" of the economy, he said. 
  He predicted that domestic production would soon pick up 
from 
a low last month when the country was on holiday. 
  Tight control over money supply means funding key projects 
afloat, while putting a brake on runaway investment, he 
explained. [sentence as published] 
  And Zhou said his bank would continue to support 
manufacturers whose products sell well. 
  At the moment about 80 percent of national banks loans are 
used to bolster large and medium-sized State-enterprises. 
  The bankers sought to dispel fears that China's economy 
would 
continue to suffer money floods alternating with financial 
drought. 
  "We have adopted a cautious monetary policy since last year, 
which is neither austere nor liberal." Dai said. 
  Zhou outlined measures to control growing inflation. These 
included: 
  -- Keeping a tight control over the national credit, 
especially in fixed assets; 
  -- Bolstering the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, 
meat, sugar and vegetables to curb price rises; 
  -- Making every effort to recoup bank loans on time; 
  -- Putting an end to borrowing from banks to settle the 
nation's budgetary deficit. Instead the deficit will be offset 
by the sale of State treasury bonds. 
  Bond issues help stabilize the value of the yuan, Zhou said. 
  Whereas funding the deficit with massive bank loans only 
leads to currency fluctuation. 
  Zhou said the yuan had held its value against the US dollar 
after the unification of the two-tier foreign exchange rates. 
  But he added that the devaluation of the yuan on the black 
market, must end. 
  "On the whole, we're confident we can maintain a stable yuan 
against the US dollar. 
  "This is because current account exchanges have been 
conducted at the market rate of $1 against 8.7 yuan," he 
explained. 
  Zhou also said that the central bank would not raise its 
interest rate to boost savings. 
  Bank deposits by city dwellers had increased 320 billion 
yuan 
($36.8 billion) by the end of last year. 
  Bank interest rates were raised twice last year as a result 
of runaway money supply that fueled the inflation. 
  The country's foreign exchange reserves also jumped from 
$21.2 billion at the end of last year to $27.2 billion by 
February. 
  Zhou said the nation will have embraced a unified inter-bank 
foreign exchange swap market in April, to which both domestic 
and foreign banks can have access. 
  In another development, Zhou said China is to hammer out a 
series of banking laws this year to bring its financial reforms 
onto a legal track. 
  The laws concerning the central bank, commercial banks, 
securities, negotiable instruments and insurance are all 
expected to be ready by the end of the year, he said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Xie Yicheng: "State to Spend $3.3B on </F>
Railroad Building"] 
  [Text] Railway development will boom across China this 
year, as the country aims to ease its transport bottle-neck. 
  The government, which has prioritised railways, will give 29 
billion yuan ($3.3 billion) for construction this year. 
  The original investment target for this year was 41.7 
billion 
($4.8 billion). 
  But the planned funding will out-strip last year's input by 
6.5 billion yuan ($747 million), said a Railways Ministry source. 
  The ministry will build 2,100 kilometres of new lines, 
double- track 1,335 kiloemtres of existing single-track 
capacity, and electrify another 194 kilometres of railway. 
  The government agenda is topped by seven key railway 
projects, which are underway. 
  And quality engineering and labour safety will be 
prioritised. 
  The Beijing-Kowloon Railway will get 1,386 kilometres of new 
line by the end of this year. 
  Roadbeds, bridges and tunnels along its projected 
2,538-kilometre length will also be completed. 
  The north-south thoroughfare project kicked off in early 
1993. Over 1,700 kilometres of track will have been completed on 
it by the end of 1994. 
  The Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway, will be double-tracked along its 
entire 1,620 kilometres by the year's end. But only half of the 
new second track will be up and running by then. 
  Workers will finish construction and electrification of the 
new 498-kilometre Baoji-Zhongwei line in the northern Shaanxi 
Province and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. 
  And the new 252-kilometre Houma-Yueshan line will be laid 
and 
electrified within the year. 
  A 154-kilometre section of the Hangzhou-Zhuzhou Railway will 
be double-tracked and another 166 kilometres of dual-track line 
will be opened to traffic. 
  Construction on the 898-kilometre Nanning-Kunming Railway, 
which is the toughest building project, will press ahead. 
  And work will continue on a huge new passenger station in 
west Beijing. 
  The national rail network this year plans to move 1.56 
billion tons of freight, which includes 640 million tons of coal. 
  A project 1.04 billion people will catch trains this year. 
  The cargo and passenger targets are close to last year's 
figures, said the ministry.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The construction of 
the controversial Daliushu Hydropower Plant on the Huanghe River 
in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is urged to 
start as soon as possible. 
  More than 60 experts called for an early start of the 
construction at a meeting organized by the China Association for 
Science and Technology, which closed here Thursday [17 March]. 
  The opinion of the experts agrees with that of deputies from 
Ningxia, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia, who have put forward the 
same suggestion to the ongoing session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress. 
  Experts at the association's meeting, including noted 
academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhang Zongyou, 
Ma Zongjin and Li Tingdong, hold that the construction of a 
hydropower plant at Daliushu in the Heishan Gorge, on the upper 
reaches of the Huanghe River, is feasible both technologically 
and economically. 
  The experts said that the loose rock base at the proposed 
reservoir covers only part of the area and is superficial. It 
poses no major difficulty for construction or safety. 
  In fact, the experts pointed out that loose rock has been 
handled successfully at power plants both in China and abroad. 
  Feasibility studies of the plant in the past decades have 
been accompanied by controversies over whether there should be 
two lower dams at Xiaoguanyin in Gansu Province and Daliushu in 
Ningxia, or only one high dam at Daliushu. 
  The high dam plan won the argument in November, 1991, when 
an 
experts group of the Ministry of Water Resources conducted 
studies in geology, construction, investment and irrigation. 
  According to the final plan approved by the State Council, 
the Daliushu plant will have a 160 meter high dam and a 
reservoir containing 1.1 million cu m of water. The generating 
sets will have a capacity of two million kw, generating 7.8 
billion kwh of electricity a year. 
  The water of the reservoir will be able to irrigate 400,000 
ha of farmland in the region in the short term, and more than 
one million ha in the long run. 
  It will also supply abundant water resources to the energy 
and chemical industries in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and Inner 
Mongolia, and cleaner water to hundreds of thousands of local 
people who are suffering from a too-high fluorine content in 
their drinking water. 
  As the construction of the plant is of great significance to 
the development of western China and has been put on the agenda 
by the State Council in its plan for China's agricultural 
development in the 1990s, the experts urged that it should be 
started as soon as possible.
