  [Text] Hong Kong, March 29 (XINHUA) -- The Agricultural 
Bank of China, one of China's four principal state-owned 
specialized banks, opened a representative office here today. 
  This was the bank's first representative office in Hong Kong 
and the fourth one opened abroad after Tokyo, Singapore and 
London. It is preparing for the establishment of the fifth one 
in New York, according to the bank's President Ma Yongwei. 
  The opening of the office was in line with China's open 
policy and the bank's own strategic plans to internationalize 
its operations and increase its overseas presence, Ma said. 
  He expressed that his bank would further strengthen, through 
co- operation, its relations with the financial community of 
Hong Kong and contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 
  As one of the top 50 banks in the world, the agricultural 
bank now has 54,000 branch offices with 540,000 staff. Its 
total assets has come to 1.05 trillion renminbi (184 billion 
U.S. dollars). It also has correspondent banking arrangements 
with 244 overseas banks in 71 countries and regions.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (CNS)--The People's Insurance 
Company of China signed a document with its 44 branches today 
for reform of management to bring their business into line with 
the international insurance market. 
  General manager of the company Mr. Li Yumin said that he 
hoped the restructuring of the company's international opeations 
would help China's insurance business move in step with its 
international counterparts as soon as possible. The move is 
considered as a preparation in the insurance sector for the 
restoration of China's signatory status to the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. 
  According to the document, the company will to some extent 
allow autonomy to its branches for various measures to be 
adopted in accordance with their own business situation. The 
branches are free to implement measures in terms of insurance 
charge rate, insurance provisions and insurance cost while at 
the same time being responsible to the parent company in terms 
of profit, insurance premiums and indemnity. If a branch 
fulfills a particular set target, then it will be given a reward 
or a penalty if the case is the oposite. Mr Li said that he 
hoped this practice would help increase the revenue from 
premiums by 15 percent this year compared with that in the year 
before. 
  The insurance company founded on October 20, 1949 has an 
employment of 110,000 and premium revenue was RMB 49.96 billion 
[renminbi] last year, 35.6 percent up over the previous year. 
The total amount in indemnities paid at home and broad was 
valued at RMB 27.85 billion.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 29 (XINHUA) -- China's largest 
producer of polyester products started floating its shares on 
the stock market here today, becoming the seventh Chinese 
state-owned enterprise to be listed here. 
  The Yizheng Chemical Fiber Company Limited offered 3 million 
shares at a price of 2.38 H.K. dollars per share on the stock 
exchange of Hong Kong and 7 million shares for international 
placement, raising a total of 2,265 million H.K. dollars (290 
million U.S. dollars) after deducting service fees. 
  A spokesman for the company said that most of the money 
raised will be used to pay off the company's debt and start 
technical innovation programs next year. 
  Yizheng, the third largest polyester fiber producer in the 
world, produces 550,000 tons of polyester products each year, 
accounting for about half of China's domestic polyester market. 
  The polyester producer is one of the first nine state-owned 
enterprises selected by the Chinese Government for listing on 
the Hong Kong market. So far seven of them have been listed.

  [Text] After one day's recess, the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and Taiwan's Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) resumed in Beijing in the morning of 
29 March comprehensive discussion of three routine topics, 
including fishing disputes. 
  After the meeting, Sun Yafu, deputy secretary-general of 
ARATS, said: During the discussion, both parties expressed their 
opinions about the crucial points of the three topics which need 
to be resolved. Both sides further exchanged their opinions and 
deepened their understanding. But the two sides have not yet 
reached a consensus on some issues that need to be resolved. 
  According to a suggestion raised by Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu], 
deputy secretary-general of SEF, both sides have decided through 
consultation to hold another comprehensive discussion on the 
morning of 30 March to give it another try. 
  It was learned that discussion of the three topics -- 
including cracking down on criminal activities committed at sea, 
as well as other topics concerning economic, scientific, and 
technological matters which were scheduled to be discussed by 
ARATS and SEF on 28 March -- were not conducted due to the 
absence of Shi Qiping [Shih Chi-ping], another deputy 
secretary-general of SEF.

  [Text] Taipei, March 30 (CNA) -- A senior Taiwan official 
Wednesday [30 March] urged the United States to make careful 
assessment before deciding whether to sanction Taiwan over 
wildlife conservation issues. 
  "We hope the U.S. Government and private conservation 
organizations can acknowledge the progress we have made in 
wildlife conservation in recent years," said Vice Chairman Lin 
Shiang-nung of the Council of Agriculture (COA). 
  The Clinton administration is scheduled to decide in April 
whether to impose trade sanctions on Taiwan in accordance with 
the U.S. legislation meant to protect wildlife, known as the 
Pelly Amendments. 
  Some local media quoted COA sources as reporting Tuesday 
that 
the U.S. Government has agreed to follow a recent decision by a 
United Nations wildlife conservation organization to give Taiwan 
more time to improve its conservation measures before taking any 
punitive measures against Taiwan for its failure to stamp out 
its alleged tiger bone and rhino horn trade. 
  Lin, however, denied the reports, saying the council has not 
received any information about a final U.S. decision. "I know 
nothing about whether the U.S. will follow the CITES [Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species] decision," he 
noted. 
  Nevertheless, Lin said he earnestly hopes America can take 
note of Taiwan's conservation efforts and technically assist 
Taiwan to eliminate illicit wildlife product trade. 
  "We'll continue to crack down on illicit rhino horn and 
tiger 
bone trade and hope to cooperate with the U.S. in wildlife 
conservation," he added. 
  The UN's Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) recently agreed to postpone a decision on 
whether to sanction Taiwan until November.

  [Text] Taipei, March 30 (CNA) -- The fifth meeting of the 
GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership application has 
been postponed until June, a Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) 
official said Wednesday [30 March]. 
  "The postponement will enable Taiwan to complete bilateral 
tariff reduction talks with more countries under the framework 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," said Tsai 
Lien- sheng, director of the BOFT's Third Department. The 
meeting was originally scheduled for may. 
  Twenty-one GATT contracting parties have expressed interest 
in holding bilateral tariff talks with Taiwan, Tsai said. 
Taiwan has so far held consultations with only seven -- the 
United States, Hungary, South Africa, Chile, New Zealand, Turkey 
and Australia. 
  The talks with those countries in February and March did not 
produce any concrete results because nearly all were not 
satisfied with Taiwan's market-opening plans, Tsai said. 
  Although Taiwan promised to replace its current quota and 
area restrictions on farm trade by imposing high tariff rates on 
agricultural imports within a certain period of time, most of 
those countries opposed the proposal. "They insisted that 
Taiwan liberalize farm trade immediately and adopt tariff rates 
compatible with GATT requirements," Tsai explained. 
  Taiwan originally planned to reduce its tariff rates on 
agricultural imports to GATT-acceptable levels within six to 10 
years. 
  "After the first round of talks with those countries, we 
have 
come to understand that the chances of realizing our originial 
plans are slim," Tsai noted. 
  "We can now only seek to gain a shorter `adjustment period' 
for our farmers to cope with open market challenges," he said. 
  Against this background, Tsai said, the government must 
modify trade liberalization plans before it can begin 
multilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties. 
  "We have therefore asked for the postponement of the fifth 
GATT working meeting on our membership bid," Tsai noted. 
  Taiwan is scheduled to hold first-round tariff reduction 
talks with Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore in 
April, Tsai said, adding these countries are also most concerned 
about Taiwan's farm trade liberalization plans. 
  Taiwan will also consult with the 12-member European Union, 
El Salvador and several other countries on tariff and non-tariff 
trade issues before June, Tsai added. 
  Taiwan was granted GATT observer status in September 1992 
and 
is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.

  [Text] Makung, Penghu, March 29 (CNA) -- Six Taiwan Coast 
Guard Police were forced to jump off a mainland Chinese boat 
they had boarded after spotting its crew trying to unload 
smuggled foreign cigarettes Monday [28 March] night near the 
Penghu Islands off Taiwan's west coast. 
  The policemen had boarded the iron-hulled ship while it was 
trying to escape from their two Makung-based police cutters, but 
discovered the crew barricaded behind a locked cabin door, which 
they tried without success to break down. 
  After a two-hour stand-off, they were forced to jump into 
the 
sea when the mainland vessel made a drastic turn to the west and 
sped up to enter the territorial waters of Mainland China. 
  All six were immediately picked up by the trailing police 
boats. 
  By jumping off the smuggling boat, the policemen prevented a 
rerun of a similar incident two years ago in which a mainland 
iron- hulled vessel kidnapped a Taiwan patrol guard when the 
guard boarded the mainland vessel to arrest the crew for 
smuggling. 
  The guard was repatriated to Taiwan a couple of weeks later 
after bargaining between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the two semi-official 
organizations edicated to the promotion of civilian exchanges 
between Taiwan and the mainland.

  [Text] Budapest, March 11 (CNA) -- Orders worth US$50,000 
were placed by Hungarian distributors with 14 Taiwan exporters 
at a Thursday [10 March] meeting between the two sides, and as a 
result the Taiwan businesses can expect to see US$3 million of 
new business come their way, Sun Jui-lin, manager of the 
Budapest office of the China External Trade Relations 
Association, or CETRA, said. 
  Sun said that the Taiwan businessmen were impressed by their 
prospects in the Hungarian market, mainly because of the low 
rate of inflation here. But he admitted that the Hungarians 
were reticent to do more business because of their concerns 
about the relatively high cost of Taiwan products and the time 
it takes for them to be delivered, which can be up to three 
months. 
  He said that until the Taiwan companies feel assured of the 
reliability of doing business with the Hungarian importers 
through Hungarian banks, the time of delivery would be a 
sticking point between the two sides. 
  Another group of Taiwan business representatives will visit 
Hungary in June, Sun said. That delegation will include Taiwan 
importers as well as exporters, he stressed. In reciprocation, 
Hungarian manufacturers will have a chance to sell their wares 
in Taiwan when they participate in the Taipei International 
Trade Fair in October.

  [Text] Taipei, March 12 (CNA) -- The China External Trade 
Development Council (CETRA) will help local machinery 
manufacturers tap Latin American markets, a spokesman said 
Saturday [12 March]. 
  As part of the drive, the semi-official trade promotion body 
is organizing a delegation of machinery manufacturers and 
traders to attend an international trade fair to be held in 
Bogota, Colombia in July, the spokesman reported. 
  CETRA will provide transport subsidies for local machinery 
manufacturers who want to exhibit their products at the Bogota 
trade show, the spokesman said. 
  "We are also compiling a list of major Colombian machinery 
importers and will help local manufacturers negotiate trade 
deals with them," the spokesman said. "We hope we can sell all 
the Taiwan machines displayed at the Bogota show," he added. 
  The spokesman said the biennial Bogota Trade Fair used to 
focus on consumer goods, but, starting this year, it will also 
feature machines and other production equipment. 
  The demand for production facilities in Bogota and other 
Latin American countries has been growing steadily in recent 
years, fueled by recovering economies, the spokesman said. 
  Moreover, the spokesman said, Bogota has largely cut its 
tariff rates on machinery imports. "This is a good time for 
Taiwan machinery makers to penetrate that market," he noted. 
  CETRA will rent a large booth for local manufacturers to 
display their machinery at the Bogota fair, the spokesman said. 
"Local manufacturers of plastics, footwear, textile and molding 
machines are welcome to join the CETRA mission to tap the 
Colombian market," he added. 
  If the Bogota show turns out to be a success, the spokesman 
said, CETRA will use similar tactics to help local machinery 
manufacturers explore other Latin American markets.

  [Text] Moscow is opening a consulate in Hong Kong next 
month as part of an aggressive drive to attract investment, 
trade and tourism. Russian Ambassador to China Igor Rogachev 
said in Hong Kong yesterday that five or six diplomats would be 
stationed here. 
  It is understood that the Consul-General, who will be named 
soon, is fluent in Chinese and English and has served in China 
and the West. "Hong Kong is such a major international 
financial centre, we missed a lot by not having diplomatic 
representation," Mr Rogachev said. 
  Mr Rogachev, who is Russia's premier sinologist, called on 
Hong Kong businessmen to take advantage of the opportunities 
afforded by economic reform. "Our parliament is enacting new 
laws on investment, trade, and other aspects of the economy," he 
said. "In addition to doing business in the big cities, Hong 
Kong companies may play a particularly large role in the 
development of Siberia and the (Russian) Far East." He 
disclosed that a delegation of central bankers had recently 
visited Hong Kong in search of investment. 
  Last year, Hong Kong exported $2.44 billion worth of goods 
to 
Russia, most of them re-exports. Imports were a relatively 
paltry $706.93 million. 
  Poland is the first country in the former East Bloc that has 
diplomatic representation in the territory. 
  The Director of Protocol of the Hong Kong Government Vivian 
Warrington yesterday welcomed the setting up of the Russian 
mission. He said approval in principle had been given to Hungary 
and the Czech Republic to open consulates here. 
  Both countries, however, have yet to begin the formalities 
of 
establishing their missions.

<F P=106> [By Robert MacPherson] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 30 March (AFP)--North Korea is playing a 
dangerous game of brinksmanship in its nuclear stand-off with 
the West, and China's role is crucial in defusing the crisis, 
Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Wednesday. 
  "The worry is whether or not they are capable of carrying 
out 
feats of brinksmanship without stumbling over," Evans said here 
ahead of a week-long visit to China. 
  "It may be that they just want diplomatic gains and economic 
gains," he said. "If that is so, they ought to be achievable 
without raising the stakes to the level to which they have been 
raised so far." 
  Evans told reporters that he would discuss North Korea with 
Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen -- "my friend and colleague" -- 
when they meet in Beijing. 
  He declined to say what specific ideas he might discuss with 
Qian, but he stressed that China had an "extremely important" 
role to play in convincing North Korea to accept international 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  "They do probably know more about what's going on in North 
Korea than anybody else -- and they have a greater capacity than 
anybody else in the world to influence North Korea," he said. 
  "I am sure that the last thing on earth that the Chinese 
want 
is to see the North Koreans acquiring a nuclear capability ... 
and an erosion of the credibility and integrity of the nuclear 
non- proliferation process," he added. 
  North Korea, the world's last hardline Stalinist state, is 
alleged to be developing nuclear weapons as it continues 
blocking inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) of what it insists are non-military nuclear installations. 
  Many analysts suspect it is using the nuclear issue as a 
lever to win diplomatic recognition and economic support from 
Western nations, particuarly the United States, which remains 
South Korea's main ally. 
  Australia has a special interest as it chairs the IAEA, the 
nuclear watchdog responsible for inspecting the North Korean 
facilities. 
  The issue is liable to overtake human rights concerns in 
China during Evans' trip, although he stressed that he will be 
taking up such topics as jailed dissidents and repression in 
Tibet. 
  "We'd like to see some significant gains made... Human 
rights these days are everybody's business," he said. 
  But earlier, Evans was taken aback when he was asked at an 
Asia Society luncheon what he might do in Beijing for the 
release of Sydney businessman James Peng, jailed without charge 
in China for the past 5-1/2 months. 
  "I will seek a brief on that particular matter," he said, 
without elaborating. 
  Peng is being held in Shenzhen city, adjacent to Hong Kong, 
in connection with a business dispute. Australian diplomats are 
able to see him only three minutes per month. 
  In his speech to the luncheon, Evans argued for a 
"pragmatic" 
approach over human rights. 
  "Very often, particularly in Asian contexts, quiet dialogue 
and persuasion -- systematically pursued -- will give better 
results than drum-beating," the senator said. 
  He also reaffirmed support for Governor Chris Patten's 
democratic reforms for Hong Kong -- despite the lukewarm 
endorsement given earlier this year by Prime Minister Paul 
Keating when Patten visited Australia. 
  China has bitterly opposed Patten's reforms, pledging to 
scrap them immediately after taking back the British colony in 
1997. 
  But Evans told reporters that in his view, the Sino-British 
row over Hong Kong is "rather a lot to do about little. China 
should be prepared to take a deep breath and accept these 
relatively modest changes."

Understanding Sino-British Dispute Over Hong Kong's Political 
Structure"] 
  [Text] Recently, the British side published a white paper 
entitled "On Representative Government in Hong Kong" without 
consulting with the Chinese side. In doing this, the British 
side unilaterally released some information about the talks 
between the Chinese and British Governments on the arrangements 
for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. This constituted a 
breach of the understanding reached between the two sides before 
the opening of the talks, in which they committed themselves not 
to reveal the substance of the talks. Furthermore, the British 
side also misrepresented and lashed out at the Chinese side's 
stance, in an attempt to lay blame on the Chinese side for 
disrupting the talks. 
  In response to this, the Chinese side had no choice but to 
release its version--"The Facts Concerning Several Major 
Questions on the Sino-British Talks on the 1994/95 Electoral 
Arrangements for Hong Kong," with the aim of dispelling 
confusion among the public. 
  This dispute between China and Britain is not about arguing 
whether Hong Kong needs democracy, as alleged by Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten, but whether it is still necessary to keep 
international commitments and whether the local constitutional 
development still needs to converge with the Basic Law so as to 
ensure a stable transition in Hong Kong. The substance of the 
dispute is that the Chinese side wants to uphold national 
dignity, to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as 
scheduled, to found the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
[SAR] -- which will be placed directly under the central 
people's government -- and to set up an SAR government primarily 
constituted by Hong Kong people who love China and Hong Kong. 
Britain, on the other hand, is not willing to give up its 
colonial rule over Hong Kong but is attempting to extend its 
influence on Hong Kong as a former colony after 1997, by 
knocking together a pro-British clique under the pretext of 
"constitutional reform." This is our key to understanding the 
disputes between China and Britain on a series of issues. 
<H5>  Ulterior Motives Behind Major Changes </H5>
  Section 3 of Article 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration 
provides that "the laws currently in force in Hong Kong will 
remain basically unchanged;" Section 5 provides that "the 
current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain 
unchanged, and so will the life style." The Basic Law provides: 
Hong Kong's political structure should evolve "in accordance 
with the principle of gradual and orderly progress." However, 
Chris Patten's "constitutional reform package" intends to 
substantially change Hong Kong's existing political structure. 
This obviously goes counter to the stipulations of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. 
  Over the more than 100 years of British occupation, Hong 
Kong's political structure has always been based on the 
principles laid down in the "Letters Patent" and the "Royal 
Instructions" and was seldom changed. Then why is it necessary 
to introduce such major changes in the political structure of 
Hong Kong during the late transitional period? All 
clear-thinking people can see the ulterior motive behind this 
illogic and faith-breaking act by Britain. Let us review the 
following facts: 
  Hong Kong has always upheld an executive-led political 
structure. The term "executive-led" means that ruling Hong Kong 
is primarily the responsibility of the executive organ. The 
Legislative Council [Legco] is merely a consultative 
organization for the Hong Kong governor in the legislative 
process which does not hold any real power of legislation. Any 
law bill adopted by Legco must be ratified by the Hong Kong 
governor before it comes into force, otherwise it cannot be 
implemented. What is more, laws that have been ratified by the 
Hong Kong governor can still be overruled by the British royal 
family, which can even create legislation for Hong Kong directly. 
  In the past, Britain upheld the executive-led structure. 
Britain's ultimate purpose in doing this was to ensure that the 
British monarch and the Hong Kong governor appointed by him 
could exclusively hold power and maintain Britain's absolute 
rule over Hong Kong, so that Britain's interests in Hong Kong 
could be safeguarded. Given this objective fact, the executive 
organ -- free of interference from the legislative organ -- 
could have a free rein in handling affairs, which enabled the 
government to make decisions and operate in a highly efficient 
manner. 
  With his "constitutional reform package," Chris Patten has 
been trying very hard to introduce the representative government 
system practiced in western countries into Hong Kong, augment 
the Legco's power, and change the existing executive-led 
structure, so as to develop a structure under which "the 
legislative branch dominates the executive branch." Hong Kong, 
however, is not a state-like entity but merely an area. The 
above development will inevitably lead to a loss of stability in 
the decisionmaking process within the executive organ, thus 
weakening the government's management efficiency. What is even 
more serious is that, once the executive organ is dominated by 
the legislative organ, Hong Kong will land in a position in 
which it is vulnerable to endless disputes on political affairs, 
the executive organ will be faced with difficulty in exercising 
its power, and is likely to experience intervention by foreign 
political forces in local affairs. Consequently, the 
sovereignty that the Chinese Government is to exercise over Hong 
Kong after 1997 will be nullified, and Britain will be able to 
sustain its control over Hong Kong through this legislative body 
which plays a dominant role. 
  The Basic Law has already expressly described the process 
for introducing the democratic system into Hong Kong and 
developing democracy in the territory, and it has set a rather 
rapid pace for the process. For example, the future SAR 
legislative organ will be completely constituted by elections 
(including direct and indirect elections -- the number of seats 
returned by direct election will be increased with every round 
of elections until finally all the seats will be returned by 
general election); the chief executive will be selected through 
consultations or election; the legislative organ will be vested 
with genuine legislative power, and so on. Therefore, this 
dispute is not to argue whether democracy is wanted or not. 
Whether the executive-led political structure is to be changed 
or not is in substance a major issue of principle which has a 
bearing on the smooth exercise of sovereignty and ruling power 
over Hong Kong by the Chinese Government beyond 1997. 
<H5>  Breaking Faith and Going Back on Their Word </H5>
  As far as the issue of Hong Kong's political structure is 
concerned, the British side has violated the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law, 
and the agreements and understandings already reached between 
the Chinese and British sides. Examples of the "three 
violations" by the British side are numerous in the 
"constitutional reform package" put forth by Chris Patten. 
  According to the decision of the National People's Congress 
[NPC], the first Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR will be 
formed by 60 members, of whom 30 are to be returned by 
functional constituencies. If the term of office of the last 
Legco to be formed in 1995 is to stride past 1997 to become the 
first Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR, then the last Legco 
will have to be formed in accordance with the above principle. 
However, Chris Patten's package proposes that 21 of the 30 
seats returned by functional constituencies should be selected 
through vote by individuals rather than through vote by 
corporate bodies, and, for the nine newly installed seats, the 
method of election by functional constituencies should be 
replaced by a method in which "every individual member of every 
functional sector will have a vote." In other words, the 
package intends to make the indirect functional constituency 
elections into a disguised form of direct elections based on 
trades. 
  At present, of the 60 seats in the Hong Kong Legco, 21 (or 
35 
percent) are returned from 19 corporate bodies based on 
different social functions. These seats are called seats 
returned by "functional constituencies" (or "functional 
sectors"). In the Basic Law, election by functional 
constituencies is called "election by functional bodies." It is 
obvious that elections by functional constituencies is an 
indirect election based on the votes of functional bodies, which 
is different from direct elections based on a vote by the entire 
electorate. 
  Election by functional constituencies was first proposed by 
the White Paper on representative government published by the 
British Hong Kong Government in November 1984. In 1987, when 
reviewing this system, the British Hong Kong Government 
maintained that it had been approved by the majority of the 
population, and therefore it decided to retain the system. 
Since then, the number of Legco members returned by this form 
of election has been increasing, going from six members in 1985 
to 21 in 1991. During the drafting of the Basic Law, the 
British side continued to recommend this form of election to the 
Chinese side again and again. The number of seats returned by 
direct election, even when it was referred to in the letter that 
the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd wrote to Foreign 
Minister Qian on 12 February 1990, did not include seats 
returned by functional bodies. This is more proof indicating 
that the British side always considered elections by functional 
bodies as indirect elections. 
  In the belief that this form of election had been accepted 
by 
the Hong Kong people and did have some advantages, the Basic Law 
drafting committee included in the Basic Law this form of 
election by functional bodies, based on the principle that what 
has been practiced and proved useful in Hong Kong shall be 
retained, and this decision had the endorsement by the National 
People's Congress. 
  Thus it can be seen that Chris Patten, in changing the 
election by functional bodies as a form of indirect election 
into a kind of disguised direct election, has totally violated 
the Basic Law and the understandings and agreements reached 
between the Chinese and British sides in the past, as well as 
the original idea behind the introduction of seats for 
functional constituencies. Even the former chief secretary of 
the Hong Kong Government, David Akers- Jones, who was also the 
author of this form of election, criticized Chris Patten's 
constitutional package for contravening the original purpose of 
elections by functional constituencies. This change will also 
result in inequality in the right of election among citizens 
because, of the more than 6 million population in Hong Kong, 2.7 
million members of the working population will enjoy an extra 
chance to vote in the disguised form of direct elections based 
on profession, in addition to their first chance to vote already 
granted on the basis of geographical divisions, while those 
retired from these selected professions and other people outside 
these professions enjoy only one chance to vote in the direct 
election based on geographical divisions. This man-made 
discrimination regarding the citizens' right to vote is 
definitely unreasonable. It also violates the principle of 
"gradual and orderly progress" for the development of the 
elections by functional bodies. Although the British side later 
submitted a revised program, it still will drastically expand 
the electorate for the election by functional constituencies to 
nearly 900,000, which means the 90,000-strong electorate, as 
originally set for indirect election, will be drastically 
increased by eight times. This obviously does not conform with 
the principle of "gradual and orderly progress." 
  Then why did the British side recommend to the Chinese side 
the form of election by functional constituencies in the past 
but now intend to change it into a disguised form of direct 
elections? The basic reason is that, as 1997 draws nearer and 
nearer, the British side wants to arrange for more of its 
followers to enter Legco. Indirect elections by functional 
bodies can more easily return candidates who are prestigious and 
influential within their functional sectors and who are willing 
to assume responsibility for the Hong Kong community, and it is 
more difficult for the British side to manipulate these people. 
In direct elections, however, many professionals have neither 
adequate financial resources nor the intention to run for 
election. Thus, the British side will be able to manipulate the 
elections behind the scenes and arrange for its favored 
candidates to be elected to Legco. 
<H3>  The True Color of the Colonialists Who Attempt in Vain To 
Infringe Upon China's Sovereignty </H3>
  When it comes to the issues of the "through train" program 
and the electoral committee, the British side has more blatantly 
exposed its true color as a colonialist attempting in vain to 
infringe upon China's sovereignty over Hong Kong in regard of 
the constitutional system issue. 
  The so-called "through train" refers to an arrangement by 
which the members of the last Legco formed under the British 
Hong Kong authorities; specifically, that Legco members elected 
in 1995 will have their term of office carried forward beyond 
1997 and thus they will become members of the first Legco of the 
Hong Kong SAR of the PRC. 
  When drafting the Basic Law, the Chinese Government adopted 
some opinions put forth by the British Government. The Basic 
Law has included some provisions related to the "through train." 
When the Basic Law was ratified by the Third Plenary Session of 
the Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] on 4 April 1990, 
the session also adopted the "Decision of the NPC on the Method 
for the Formation of the First Government and the First 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR." Paragraph 6 of this 
decision reads: "If the composition of the last Hong Kong Legco 
before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR is in conformity 
with the relevant provisions of this Decision and the Basic Law 
of the Hong Kong SAR, those of its members who uphold the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC 
and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC, and who 
meet the requirements set forth in the Basic Law of the Region 
may, upon confirmation by the Preparatory Committee, become 
members of the first Legco for the Region." 
  In other words, whether the incumbent Legco members can 
benefit from the "through train" program is conditional; it is 
not unconditional. As long as the requirements as cited above 
are met, the "through train" program will work. 
  However, Chris Patten is attempting to slap together a Legco 
lineup according to his "constitutional reform package," which 
he expects will take the "through train" and operate beyond 1997 
as the future Hong Kong SAR Legco. It is obvious that this is 
wishful thinking on his part, by which he is attempting to 
ensure that this lineup will play a "legislative-led" role to 
extend the influence of British colonial rule in Hong Kong. 
  Now let us review the disputes provoked by the British side 
over the formation of the election committee. 
  According to the provisions set forth by Annex I and Annex 
II 
of the Basic Law, the chief executive and some members of the 
Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR will be elected by a broadly 
representative election committee. Annex I of the Basic Law 
also expressly provides: "The Election Committee shall be 
composed of 800 members from the following sectors: Industrial, 
commercial, and financial sectors, 200; the professions, 200; 
labor, social services, religious, and other sectors, 200; 
members of the Legislative Council, representatives of 
district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the NPC, and 
representatives of Hong Kong members of the National Committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, 200. 
The Election Committee's term of office shall be five years." 
  As far as this question is concerned, the Chinese and 
British 
sides reached an understanding through an exchange of letters in 
the spring of 1990 before the NPC adopted the Basic Law. By 
that time, the British side had already agreed in principle on 
the composition and ratio of members of the election committee 
as prescribed by Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (Draft). 
  However, with his constitutional reform package, Chris 
Patten 
wants the 1995 election committee to "be composed completely or 
mostly of members of district boards returned by direct 
election." According to Chris Patten's package, both Hong Kong 
deputies to the NPC and Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National 
Committee will not be able to become members of the election 
committee as prescribed in Annex I of the Basic Law, nor can the 
four categories of people join the election committee to make it 
more balanced as prescribed in the Basic Law. 
  British Ambassador to China Alan Donald handed a written 
note 
to the Chinese side on 6 February 1990, putting forth five 
principles on the formation of the election committee and a 
proposal that the committee be formed by four categories of 
people. The Chinese side gave a written reply to the British 
side on 8 February that year, expressly stating that "the 
Chinese side agrees with the five principles concerning the 
election committee proposed by the British side in the document. 
However, the Chinese side maintains that the provisions on the 
composition and ratio of the election committee as specified in 
Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (Draft) must be followed 
in terms of its proportional composition. This is because Annex 
I was approved by a two-thirds majority of the membership of the 
Drafting Committee at its eighth plenary session. China 
believes that its provisions on composition and ratio are 
appropriate and should therefore not be subject to change." 
Then, in his letter to Foreign Minister Qian Qichen dated 12 
February, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd confirmed: "I 
agree in principle with the arrangements which you propose for 
an Electoral Committee, which could be established in 1995. The 
precise details of how this should be done can be discussed 
between our two sides in due course." This evidence in black 
and white shows that the British side did agree at that time to 
have an election committee formed in 1995 in accordance with 
Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. In other words, the 
Chinese and British sides at that time had already reached an 
agreement and understanding on the formation of an election 
committee in 1995. 
  According to Chris Patten's package, all Legco members 
elected in 1995 should be allowed to board the "through train" 
to become members of the first Legco of the Hong Kong SAR of 
China, whereas Hong Kong deputies to the NPC -- China's highest 
organ of power -- and Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National 
Committee -- China's highest consultative organ -- will not be 
admitted into the Electoral Committee that is to elect some of 
the Legco members. This is an extremely absurd plan which 
constitutes an infringement upon China's sovereignty and the 
Hong Kong people's rights. 
<H3>  The Old Trick Is Played Again; Their Character Remains 
Unchanged </H3>
  Hong Kong has been a part of China since ancient times. 
Following the Opium War of 1840, with solidly built warships and 
powerful cannons, Britain forced the Qing government to sign 
three unequal treaties and thus occupied Hong Kong, Kowloon, and 
the New Territories. After the founding of new China, the 
Chinese Government has been consistently upholding its stance of 
not recognizing the three unequal treaties that the imperialists 
forced upon China but has maintained that Hong Kong as a whole 
should be recovered in due course through negotiations. In 
1982, Chinese leaders officially informed the British side that 
the Chinese Government had decided to recover the entire Hong 
Kong area in 1997. After that, in the Sino-British talks on the 
Hong Kong issue, the British side first argued that "the three 
treaties are valid," then put forth the idea of "exchange of 
sovereignty for ruling power," and later on the idea of "largest 
extent of autonomy," with the aim of changing Hong Kong into an 
independent or semi-independent political entity subject to 
Britain's influence. After all these tricks failed, Britain 
finally put forth the "constitutional reform package." 
  As the old saying goes: Reviewing the past helps one 
understand the present. In modern world history, each time that 
Britain was forced to withdraw from one of its colonies, it 
consistently sowed discord and created conflicts and 
confrontation by playing the trick of pseudo-democracy, thus 
placing the new regime under the control of pro-British agents 
so that it would be able to retain the political and economic 
advantages that it enjoyed in its former colonies. The British 
side has been trying to do this again with regard to the Hong 
Kong issue. Back in 1946, as the British felt that their rule 
over Hong Kong might not last long, then Hong Kong Governor Mark 
Young made a statement on transforming Hong Kong's political 
framework and planned to set up a "municipal council." In June 
1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army was heading south, 
and the liberation of all of China was within sight. Under such 
a circumstances, then Hong Kong Governor Alexander Grantham 
gazetted the "municipal council" program. This was in fact the 
very first "constitutional reform package" set forth by Britain 
for Hong Kong. According to this package, Britain would withdraw 
from Hong Kong only nominally but would actually maintain 
British influence in Hong Kong through a British-style political 
framework. New China did not send troops across the Shenzhen 
River to expel the British out from Hong Kong, however. Britain 
realized that it was possible for it to continue its rule over 
Hong Kong without withdrawing from the territory. This being 
the case, the introduction of a "constitutional reform" in 
preparation for withdrawal from the territory would obstruct the 
British Hong Kong authorities' rule over Hong Kong. Therefore, 
without hesitation, Britain gave up Mark Young's plan for 
establishing a "municipal council." The Churchill 
administration even announced: "Introducing any more 
far-reaching political reform in Hong Kong would not be 
appropriate." We are now getting closer and closer to 1997, 
when Hong Kong is to return to China, and the British will soon 
terminate their colonial rule in Hong Kong forever. So we see 
Britain playing its old trick again, sending Chris Patten to 
Hong Kong to launch his "constitutional reform package" 
characterized by the "three violations." If we compare what is 
happening today with historical facts, Britain's covert 
intentions will become obvious. 
  The Chinese Government today is different from the Qing 
Government of the past, however, and the Chinese people of today 
are no longer the "sick men of East Asia" that they used to be. 
China's sovereignty brooks no infringement by anybody. As 
pointed out by Deng Xiaoping: "The question of sovereignty is 
not one which can be discussed." China will never barter away 
principles. China hopes that the Sino-British talks can achieve 
positive results and that China and Britain can cooperate with 
one another since it will be beneficial to Hong Kong's stability 
and prosperity. Nevertheless, this does not imply that it will 
not be possible for Hong Kong to maintain stability and 
prosperity without Britain. Even if the British side shows no 
sincerity in reaching an agreement through negotiations and 
persists in undermining Sino-British cooperation, China will 
still be able to ensure a stable transition and long-term 
prosperity in Hong Kong.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- China supports the 
Angolan Government's policy of national reconciliation and the 
effort it has made to achieve that goal, said Chinese 
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen here today. 
  In a talk with visiting Foreign Minister of the Republic of 
Angola Venacio da Silva Moura, Qian said that the peoples of 
China and Angola have enjoyed traditional friendship, adding 
that China is willing to further enhance cooperative relations 
with Angola. 
  Qian said that China has been paying close attention to 
Angola's peace process and sincerely hopes that the talks in 
Angola will reach final agreement at an early date and realize 
domestic peace and stability. 
  He noted that China has never interfered in the internal 
affairs of African countries and has dedicated itself to 
contributing to the development of Africa as much as possible. 
China hopes that African countries enjoy peace and stability 
and develop good-neighborly ties of friendship, Qian said. 
  Qian pointed out that big countries, instead of interfering 
in the internal affairs of African countries, should let African 
nations build their countries according to their own situations. 
  If big powers really care about Africa, they should not 
write 
out a prescription and force Africa to accept it, Qian said. 
They should offer aid to Africa to promote the development of 
African economies. 
  Moura briefed Qian on the current situation in Angola. He 
expressed thanks for China's long-term political and economic 
support of his country. 
  He noted that in Angola's struggle for national 
independence, 
the peoples of Angola and China stood on one side. After 
drastic changes in the international situation, the two peoples 
still stood together. 
  The Angolan foreign minister reaffirmed that his country 
firmly insists on a "one-China" policy and will not develop any 
official ties with Taiwan. 
  He expressed the belief that economic and trade relations 
between the two countries will be further enhanced after Angola 
realizes internal peace.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, vice 
premier of the State Council and foreign minister, held talks 
with visiting Angolan Foreign Minister Angola Venacio da Silva 
Moura at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today. The two sides 
exchanged views on bilateral relations and international issues 
of common concern. 
  Qian Qichen said: The Chinese and Angolan peoples have 
enjoyed a traditional friendship. Since the two countries 
established diplomatic relations, their relations have developed 
smoothly. China is willing to further enhance friendly relations 
and cooperation with Angola. China has always paid close 
attention to Angola's peace process, and supports the Angolan 
Government's policy of national reconciliation and the efforts 
it has made to achieve that goal. China sincerely hopes that 
the peace talks in Angola will produce a final agreement at an 
early date and will help realize domestic peace and stability. 
  He said: China has never interfered in Africa's internal 
affairs and has done all it could to contribute to Africa's 
development. China hopes that African countries will realize 
peace and stability and develop good-neighborly and friendly 
relations. 
  Qian pointed out: Big countries, instead of interfering in 
Africa's internal affairs, should let African nations build 
themselves according to their own situations. If big powers 
really care about Africa, they should not fill out a 
prescription and force Africa to accept it. They should offer 
aid to Africa to promote its economic development. 
  Moura briefed Qian Qichen on the current situation in 
Angola. 
He expressed his thanks for the long-term political and 
economic support that his country has received from the Chinese 
Government and people. He said: During Angola's struggle for 
national independence, the Angolan and Chinese people stood on 
one side. Following major changes in the international 
situation, the two peoples have continued to stand together. 
  Moura reaffirmed that Angola firmly adheres to its stand 
that 
there is only one China, and that it will never develop any 
official relations with Taiwan. He expressed the belief that 
economic relations and trade between the two countries will be 
further enhanced after Angola has realized peace.

Minister 'Ali al-Baghli will pay a visit to China in mid-May, 
XINHUA learned here today. 
  Well-informed sources here told XINHUA that Al-Baghli's tour

  Earlier, the Kuwaiti Arabic newspaper "AL-WATAN" said that 
Kuwait wants to enhance its oil-related cooperation with China. 
  The daily quoted a high-ranking official in Kuwait Petroleum 
Company as saying that his company is seeking to sign with China 
long-term contracts to supply it with crude oil and other 
petroleum outputs. 
  The daily said Kuwait had already supplied China with some 
oil, but the two countries had not yet signed long-term 
contracts.

cooperation in the economic field, especially in the oil and 
petrochemical field.

  [Text] Khartoum, March 27 (XINHUA) -- Sudan has asked the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reconsider its decision on 
requesting Sudan to withdraw its membership from the IMF, 
Minister of State for Economic Planning Mohammed Khayr al-Zubayr 
told XINHUA. 
  The decision was made by the IMF board of governors on 
February 14 for Sudan's delayed repayment of its debt to the IMF. 
  The minister of state said the Sudanese Government has 
formed 
a committee representing the Ministries of Finance and Foreign 
Affairs and the Bank of Khartoum to draft a memorandum as a 
reply to the IMF decision. 
  He pointed out that the memorandum, which will be submitted 
to the coming session of the IMF board of directors, involves 
Sudan's relationship with the IMF and the economic performance 
and the government's endeavors to rectify the economic course in 
Sudan. 
  Sudan, al-Zubayr explained, needs 15 percent of the votes of 
members of the IMF board of governors to revoke its the decision 
on requesting Sudan to withdraw its membership from the IMF. 
  Sudan has announced comprehensive economic programs aimed at 
liberalizing its economy, yet the IMF has continued to impose 
sanctions on Sudan, al-Zubeir said. 
  He complained that the IMF gave Sudan nothing in the course 
of the year 1993, but Sudan has managed to overcome the 
difficulties arising from this by relying upon itself, adding 
that the Sudanese economy has secured a high growth rate over 
the past three years. 
  The minister of state expressed hope that the IMF member 
states would understand Sudan's standpoint and help Sudan tackle 
the problems arising from its foreign debts. 
  Sudan has more than once assured the IMF that it is ready to 
pay a token part of its foreign debts in order to prove that it 
is willing to continue to deal with the IMF. 
  The debts owed by Sudan to the IMF total some 12 billion 
U.S. 
dollars, 58 percent of which are interest and service charges 
and the rest is principal.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said here today that Sino-U.S. 
cooperation is in line with history's trend of development, and 
China was fully confident about the prospects for bilateral 
relations. 
  Li made the remarks when meeting with a U.S. delegation of 
the committee of 100, headed by 76-year-old renowned architect 
I.M. Pei, the committee's governor. 
  Li said that both China and the United States are big 
countries and their relations have an impact not only in various 
fields of both countries, but also on the peace, development and 
stability of the world as a whole. 
  Therefore, he said, leaders of both China and the United 
States should carefully handle relations between the two 
countries, with a highly responsible attitude. 
  He said that both China and the U.S. share common 
understanding and cooperation, and also have differences. 
  Yet from the viewpoint of the process of the development of 
bilateral relations, differences and opposition are reducing in 
a winding way, while the common understanding and cooperation 
are growing though in a difficult way, he said. 
  To develop bilateral ties is the will of the peoples of the 
two nations and is in accordance with the trend of history as 
well, he said, adding: "We are fully confident about the 
prospect of the Sino-U.S. relations." 
  Li noted that many members of the committee are well-known 
Americans of the Chinese origin. "There is no doubt that you 
expect a powerful China, and of course a powerful United States 
since you are living there," Li said, adding that he believed in 
their sincere hope for a closer Sino-U.S. relationship. 
  The CPPCC chairman also voiced appreciation and thanks for 
the great efforts that the committee has made for the promotion 
of Sino- U.S. relations, and hoped that it will continue to do 
more for the further development of such relations. 
  I.M. Pei said that they are delighted to see China's 
achievement in its reforms and opening up, and that his 
committee is willing to make contributions to the development of 
Sino-U.S. relations.

  [Text] At the third plenary session of the provincial 
discipline inspection commission held on 25 March, Sun Weiben, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed out: Party 
committees, governments, and discipline inspection and 
supervision organs at all levels should conscientiously 
implement the plans of the central authorities and of the 
provincial party committee on anticorruption work, and on the 
basis of consolidating the achievements we have made, conducted 
this year's anticorruption struggle in a sustained, in-depth, 
and more effective manner. 
  The third plenary session of the provincial discipline 
inspection commission held second meeting on the afternoon of 25 
March. Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
gave a speech, entitled: "Submit Ourselves to and Serve the 
Overall Situation of the Whole's Party's Work and Conduct 
Anticorruption Struggle in a Sustained, In-Depth, and More 
Effective Manner. 
  Provincial Leaders, including Shao Qihui, Zhou Wenhua, Ma 
Guoliang, Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Li Qinglin, and Yu 
Jingchang attended the meeting. 
  Sun Weiben pointed out: Constantly and deeply fighting 
corruption is a strategic policy decision made by the party 
Central Committee after correctly appraising the previous stage 
of work, the further demand of deepening reform and accelerating 
development, the important guarantee for political and social 
stability, and the current strong desire and demand of cadres 
inside and outside the party. To this end, our party and 
government leading comrades at all levels must be soberly minded 
in this aspect. 
  Sun Weiben pointed out: This year the general demand of our 
province's anticorruption work is to comprehensively fulfill the 
three central tasks, to consolidate the achievement, and to 
carry it out in an in-depth and more effective way. To 
consolidate achievements means that we must grasp the 
anticorruption work which we started last year until good 
results are achieved; places which have achieved good results in 
this aspect should continue to improve their work. To pay 
attention to in-depth work means that we must resolutely 
straighten out and handle the problems which have been 
discovered and step up efforts to formulate and improve the 
relevant management regulations and preventive measures. To pay 
attention to effective results means that we must sum up and 
popularize the experiences and lessons gained in the previous 
stage of work and improve and strengthen work measures in an 
effort to achieve greater achievements. 
  Sun Weiben said: The current anticorruption struggle must be 
carried out in the course of accelerating the establishment of 
the socialist market economic structure. The work of fighting 
corruption and promoting honesty must be combined with the 
implementation of the major reform measures. In addition to 
providing conditions and a guarantee for the implementation of 
the four reform tasks through anticorruption struggle, we should 
also fundamentally check the appearance of corrupt phenomena by 
deepening reform and building systems so as to achieve results 
in bringing about a temporary solution and in getting at the 
root of the problem. Sun Weiben stressed: Taking a two-handed 
approach and being tough with both is a strategic principle and 
leadership method which our party has persistently upheld. 
According to the past experiences and lessons, the phenomenon 
of being tough with one hand and soft with the other hand will 
easily occur when the reform and economic work tasks are 
arduous. This year more reform measures will be issued, the 
reform strength will be strong, and risks will appear. Under 
such circumstance, we should all the more persist in taking a 
two-handed approach and be tough with both, and should 
strengthen leadership over the anticorruption struggle. 
Therefore, we should continue to implement the responsibility 
system in anticorruption work, strengthen supervision, 
inspection, and work guidance, and earnestly support discipline 
inspection and procuratorial organs to exercise their duties. 
  Provincial leaders, including Li Genshen, Xie Yong, Sun 
Kuiwen, Zhou Tienong, Yang Zhihai, and Ma Shuji, comrades of the 
leading group for building party style and administrative 
honesty of the provincial party committee, and principal 
responsible comrades of various provincial-level departments 
also attended the meeting.

  [Text] At a provincial construction work meeting which 
ended yesterday [4 March], it was decided that the construction 
work of the whole province this year would ensure key projects 
and would strengthen infrastructure projects on the basis of 
furthering emancipating our minds, deepening reform, and 
speeding up development. Provincial CPC Secretary Yan Haiwang, 
Construction Minister Hou Jie, and Vice Provincial Governor Guo 
Kun attended the meeting and spoke. 
  The meeting stressed: This year, our province will continue 
to implement the system of inviting and submitting tenders, will 
fully carry out construction according to the construction 
projects law, and will speed up the development of the 
construction industry. It is necessary to concentrate funds on 
the completion of 26 key construction projects so that they can 
display their investment efficiency as soon as possible. In 
view of the fact that urban capital construction facilities in 
our province are generally backward, it is imperative to arouse 
the enthusiasm of the localities to raise funds through various 
channels to speed up the pace of urban capital construction 
projects. It is necessary to vigorously promote housing 
construction projects to speed up the pace of solving housing 
difficulties in towns and cities. It is necessary to formulate 
rational plans to properly implement experimental construction 
projects in villages and towns, so that village and town 
construction can scale new heights.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Xiao Rong Says Deng Xiaoping Will </F>
Give Jiang Zemin a Hand When Necessary"] 
  [Text] This month, Deng Xiaoping's daughter Xiao Rong went 
to Tokyo to promote the Japanese version of her book, My 
Father Deng Xiaoping. When asked by two KYODO reporters if 
she felt Jiang Zemin lacked power, she replied: "If he (Deng 
Xiaoping) gives a hand, he will become more powerful." 
  She added: "To put it more specifically, if he (Deng 
Xiaoping) says a word, it may have better results than others." 
  "Therefore, when necessary, he will appear." 
  On Deng Xiaoping's southern tour, Xiao Rong said that his 
purpose was to help the incumbent leaders implement policies and 
principles, because at that time Deng Xiaoping thought he was 
experiencing a good opportunity for development. He wanted to 
do some leaping [tiao yue yi xia 6426 6460 0001 0007], so he 
appeared to help Jiang Zemin et al. 
  Xiao Rong stressed: Deng Xiaoping is not suffering from any 
illness and he has no trouble speaking for a half hour, but 
during television appearances his voice is not broadcast. 
  She continued: Deng Xiaoping does not have a new idea or a 
new proposal on the country's reunification. "One country, two 
systems" is a major policy. Hong Kong's and Macao's sovereignty 
will be recovered in 1997 and 1999 respectively. On the 
reunification of the two sides, Xiao Rong said that there is no 
time table, but a time table can be worked out at will. 
  On appraising Mao Zedong, Xiao Rong said: My father does not 
agree with the complete negation of Mao Zedong, because he knows 
the complete negation of Mao could mean the negation of the 
Communist Party's history. Therefore, viewed from the angle of 
personal feelings or from the overall political situation, Mao 
Zedong should not be completely negated. 
  Xiao Rong indicated that Deng's family does not agree with 
the idea of building a Deng Xiaoping memorial hall.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing, Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] A group of dissidents in Shanghai has sent a 
petition signed by 54 activists to the National People's 
Congress, demanding a multi-party system, freedom of the press, 
and independent unions. It was the fourth pro-democracy letter 
sent to the Chinese authorities since the beginning of March 
amid the most serious challenge to communist power since 1989. 
State-security and police in Beijing, Shanghai, and other 
cities have tightened surveillance on the campuses and 
individual dissidents. 
  Speaking in Shanghai yesterday, Bao Ge, a veteran activist, 
said the 19-point petition was sent last Friday to the reception 
office of the Chinese parliament. Called "Blueprint for the 
Political Democratisation of the State and Society in 1994" the 
petition was signed by people "from all walks of life in 
Shanghai intellectuals, academics, artists, peasants, workers 
and private businessmen", Mr Bao said. The names include 
prominent dissidents Yang Zhou, Wang Fucheng and Li Guotao, who 
are members of the Chinese Human Rights Association, based in 
Shanghai, he said. 
  The list of demands in the petition include adoption of a 
law 
on press freedom and on a multi-party system, the authority to 
create independent unions, and abolition of the notion of 
"counterrevolutionary crime" in the penal code. The petition 
also demands an end to "re-education through work," imposed 
without trial by the police. 
  It calls for a law to punish corruption and the opening of a 
national inquiry into the chain of events leading to the June 4, 
1989, Beijing massacre. "It is our first signature campaign and 
we are going to extend the movement nationwide," Mr Bao said. 
"Several influential personalities have announced they share 
our point of view and are contemplating joining our movement," 
he said. 
  Mr Bao said the petition is "the continuation" of the "Peace 
Charter" launched in mid-November in Beijing by several human 
rights advocates. "But the charter has limits because it calls 
for democratisation under the leadership of the Communist 
Party," he said. "We think that without party leadership, we 
can also reach democracy." 
  Activist Mr Yang said signatories had discussed the points 
in 
the petition "in private" and had refrained from holding 
large-scale gatherings so as not to give police an excuse to 
crack down. However, sources close to the security establishment 
said both the Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of 
Public Security had deployed extra staff to keep tabs on the 
dissident community. They said at least one state security unit 
had been stationed in every major college in Beijing and 
Shanghai. 
  Security in Beijing successfully prevented the holding of a 
gathering to mark the 15th anniversary of the arrest of Wei 
Jingsheng, the country's most prominent dissident. Wei, who was 
pressured into leaving Beijing on March 6, has not returned to 
the capital and it is understood the authorities were determined 
to keep him out of the way during the anniversary, which also 
marks the last day of his parole. 
  A group had reportedly planned to hold a party in Wei's 
honour yesterday but police got wind of the scheme and 
intensified security in the capital accordingly. Former student 
leader, Wang Dan, said a group of police officers had been 
stationed outside his apartment building yesterday morning, 
while other dissidents said they too were being watched more 
closely than usual. The heightened surveillance of dissidents 
is expected to continue over the next few months.

<F P=106> [By reporter He Delai (0149 1795 0171): "At a PLA </F>
Delegation Panel Discussion, Liu Huaqing Stresses That the Army 
Should Set a Good Example in Building Spiritual Civilization"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--Liu Huaqing, 
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 
CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, attended a panel discussion of the People's 
Liberation Army delegation this afternoon. During the 
discussion, he pointed out: The PLA should set an example and 
spur on the masses in building spiritual civilization and thus 
make due contributions to social stability and promoting the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization. 
  When a deputy from the Guangzhou Military Region, which is 
situated in the forward place of reform and opening up, and a 
deputy from the army unit served by Xu Honggang, a heroic 
fighter ready to take up the cudgels for a just cause, talked 
about how the troops should do something in building spiritual 
civilization, Liu Huaqing said: General Secretary Jiang Zemin 
called on the PLA to set a good example in building socialist 
spiritual civilization. What should they do to set a good 
example? In my view, it is first necessary to understand this 
is an important responsibility entrusted to the people's army by 
the party and the people in the new historical period and is the 
great expectations of the masses of the people. All officers and 
men in our Army should understand the importance of taking the 
lead in doing a good job of building spiritual civilization and 
consciously cultivate this habit, starting bit by bit from 
ourselves. If the Army does a good job in building spiritual 
civilization, a soldier will become a propagandist or an model 
who can play an active, promoting role in building spiritual 
civilization. Xu Honggang is just such a model. 
  Speaking on the need for the troops to set a good example in 
developing good social conduct, Liu pointed out: Unhealthy 
practices and evil phenomena should be resisted and held in 
check. We should be concerned about the weal and woe of the 
masses, do more good work for them, help them solve 
difficulties, and help the masses in garrison areas get rid of 
poverty and become rich. When the interests, life, and property 
of the masses are harmed, servicemen should step forward bravely 
and take up the cudgels so that the people can see hope from the 
fine image of the troops and heighten their confidence.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- The State Council, 
China's cabinet, has decided to try out the shareholding system 
in 100 major state-owned enterprises this year, according to a 
senior government official. 
  He Guanghui, vice-minister of the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy, said that governments of various 
province-level areas have also decided to choose a number of 
local enterprises this year to try out the joint-stock system in 
an effort to invigorate them. 
  Experimentation with the shareholding system is part of the 
Chinese Government's effort to institute a modern enterprise 
system, he said. 
  China will continue to try out the shareholding system this 
year, but will not introduce the system on a large scale, he 
said. 
  He said: "The shareholding reform is still in the 
experimental stage because China lacks experience in this 
respect." 
  Furthermore, as China has a large number of state-owned 
enterprises, it is both impossible and unnecessary to turn all 
of them into joint-stock companies, he said. 
  The vice-minister described the shareholding system as an 
"important form" for the introduction of the modern enterprise 
system, adding that joint-stock companies serve as a major 
channel for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned 
assets. 
  With progress in instituting a modern enterprise system, 
there will be more and more shareholding companies in China, 
mostly limited-liability ones and limited-liability joint-stock 
ones, he added. 
  "I think there should be a small number of listed companies 
in China, as in developed Western countries," he said. 
  The Chinese Government will continue to control the number 
of 
businesses issuing shares to the public, and listed companies. 
  When companies issue stocks in China or in other countries, 
priority will be given to major state-run enterprises involved 
in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw materials 
industries, he said. 
  "Meanwhile, we shall continue to restrict the number of 
financial institutions and real estate agencies issuing stocks, 
and we do not encourage large numbers of commercial businesses 
to issue shares to the public," he said. 
  Government statistics show that shares issued by listed 
companies were worth five billion yuan in 1993, and the value of 
shares to be issued this year is projected to rise moderately. 
  The vice-minister said that the Chinese Government will 
encourage more enterprises, including large state-owned 
companies, to issue stocks in Hong Kong and the United States 
and to be listed there, he said. 
  Last year, six shareholding companies, including the Qingdao 
Brewery in Qingdao, Shandong Province, and the Shanghai 
Petrochemical Corporation, issued shares in other countries. 
  Since China began to try out the shareholding system in 
1984, 
the number of joint-stock companies has risen to 11,560, with 
shares totalling 314.7 billion yuan in value. 
  Of these, 3,261 are limited-liability shareholding 
companies, 
with total shares valued at 259 billion yuan; and 8,299 are 
limited- liability companies, with shares totaling 55.6 billion 
yuan. 
  Of these, 63 percent are collectively-owned enterprises and 
22 percent state-owned companies. 
  According to He Guanghui, shareholding companies are ahead 
of 
other enterprises in transforming the enterprises' operational 
mechanism. 
  He said that the joint-stock system has enabled companies to 
operate independently and assume full responsibility for their 
profits and losses. 
  Under the shareholding system, companies have introduced a 
new labor system and performance-based wage system, and have 
improved their economic returns markedly, he added. 
  To facilitate the introduction of the shareholding system, 
it 
is necessary for government departments to change their 
functions, improve the country's securities market structure and 
reflect the state industrial policies, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (CNS)--Four financial laws and 
regulations including a "Law for the People's Bank of China" 
will come into force, according to a meeting held by the 
People's Bank of China on work on national financial laws and 
regulations. 
  The Vice President of the central bank Mr. Yin Jieyan said 
that the draft laws and regulations namely the "Law for the 
People's Bank of China", a "Banking Law for the People's 
Republic of China", an "Insurance Law" and a "Law on Notes", all 
of which were drawn up by the central bank have been submitted 
to the State Council for appraisal and discussion before going 
for deliberation and approval by the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress. It is expected the laws and 
regulations will come into force in the second half of this year. 
  The "Law for People's Bank of China" is aimed at 
safeguarding 
the stability of the currency and ensuring smooth operation of 
the financial market in a bid to improve the financial system to 
serve economic development. The law states that the central 
bank will set up a committee for monetary policy in order to 
stabilize the value of the currency and prevent inflation. The 
"Banking Law for the People's Republic of China" is aimed at 
governing the commercial banks in a bid to make them operate 
smoothly.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (AFP)--China and Taiwan ended a 
heated fourth round of talks here Wednesday failing to reach any 
agreement on sensitive issues such as aircraft hijacking, 
negotiators said. 
  "We haven't reached agreement on the main points, but we 
have 
made some progress," said Sun Yafu, vice general secretary of 
the semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS). However, he indicated that this progress 
amounted to little more than going "into greater detail on our 
differences." 
  Sun's counterpart in Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation 
(SEF) Xu Huiyu said his team had proposed holding the fifth 
round of talks as soon as possible in Taipei. The Chinese side 
has yet to respond to the proposal. 
  Both stressed the need to deepen the discussion at the next 
round of talks. 
  The five-day talks -- which focused on repatriation of 
aircraft hijackers and stowaways -- appeared on the brink of 
collapse earlier on the weekend as the result of deep 
differences over the issue of jurisdiction, according to Taiwan 
newspapers. The SEF and ARATS negotiators reportedly shouted 
and accused each other of breach of trust and of failing to live 
up to promises made at earlier meetings. 
  Taiwan insists the hijacking issue be solved within the 
framework of the repatriation of all "criminals," such as 
illegal immigrants and sea-pirates, while China wants the matter 
to be dealt with separately. The two sides began to talk 
seriously about the hijacking issue following a spate of such 
incidents which saw 15 asylum-seeking Chinese people hijacking 
11 Chinese airliners to Taiwan since April 1992. The teams have 
already reached an agreement in principle on the matter, but it 
has since become bogged down in jurisdiction and sovereignty 
issues. Taiwan insists it has the right to try the hijackers, 
while China demands they be sent back to the mainland 
immediately. 
  China and Taiwan's Red Cross societies also have an 
agreement 
already on repatriating tens of thousands of illegal immigrants 
that have sneaked into Taiwan in recent years but Beijing has 
been slow in taking them back, with disputes arising from who 
should foot the bill. Some 2,223 illegal immigrants remain in 
Taiwan detention centres. 
  Beijing has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province since 1949, 
when the Nationalists fled to the island after losing a civil 
war with the communists.

<F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China should go it alone and name its line-up of 
principal government officials for the Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) before the 1997 changeover, according to the 
Preliminary Working Committee's (PWC) political sub-group. 
  The mainland co-convenor of the sub-group, Professor Xiao 
Weiyun, said after it met yesterday that there was no way for 
the Chinese and British Governments to discuss the appointments 
of principal officials for the first SAR government following 
the collapse of the Sino-British talks on political reform. 
"Under such circumstances, there won't be any talks on the 
civil service as the talks on the Legislative Council electoral 
arrangements have broken down," he said. 
  The statement came despite repeated calls by Governor Chris 
Patten and Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang for China to 
discuss with the British side the through-train arrangements of 
principal officials. The decision is set to add further to 
uncertainty in the civil service, where many senior and middle- 
ranking officials already feel anxious about their future. 
  Some officials privately are understood to be worried that 
China may set up a "second stove" for the civil service and 
allow only officials who have toed Beijing's line to serve after 
1997. 
  The Governor's spokesman, Mike Hanson, said last night he 
was 
not prepared to comment on PWC meetings. But in Beijing, 
Professor Xiao said the chief executive-designate of the SAR 
would name candidates for the positions of principal officials 
before the changeover to ensure that the SAR government could be 
formed on July 1, 1997. 
  The precise timing of nominations had yet to be discussed, 
he 
said, but suggested the search for the right people could take 
some time. "It may take three months, six months, or 12 
months," he said. 
  The political sub-group decided in its previous session that 
the chief executive-designate could be named as early as 1996 
when the Preparatory Committee for the SAR would be in place. 
  Although the PWC said China should refuse to talk to Britain 
on the transition of the civil service, Professor Xiao stressed 
that committee members hoped that most civil servants would stay 
beyond the changeover. 
  Before the souring of Sino-British relations there had been 
on the British side an understanding that Britain could consult 
with China to draw up a list of senior civil service officials 
to serve beyond 1997. The list would then be taken by the chief 
executive who would nominate the candidates and report to the 
central government for appointments. But the latest position as 
spelt out by the PWC would mean that the chief executive, who 
will be appointed by the central Government, could choose the 
senior officials on his own. 
  However, PWC member Lau Siu-kai said it was unlikely that 
there would be a major reshuffle among the key government 
officials after 1997. "The number of potential candidates to be 
major government officials is small. There won't be much choice 
for the chief executive-designate," he said. 
  Defending the PWC's position, Professor Xiao insisted that 
the Basic Law did not allow for any consultation with Britain on 
the through-train for civil service officials. The line-up for 
the SAR government officials should be decided in accordance 
with the Basic Law. 
  The Hong Kong co-convenor of the sub-group, Leung Chun-ying, 
said that there was no way for China to discuss possible 
candidates with Britain until the chief executive-designate was 
named. 
  The political sub-group also decided that to ensure a smooth 
transition in the civil service, China would invite the entire 
civil service to indicate before 1997 their willingness to stay 
in the service after the changeover. Quoting Article 100 of the 
Basic Law, Professor Xiao said public servants in the pre-1997 
government might all remain after 1997.

  [Text] Beijing, March 31 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean and 
Chinese presidents agreed in their recent meeting in Beijing 
that they do not want any pressure put on North Korea over the 
nuclear question, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin 
said on Thursday. 
  In a routine press briefing for both Chinese and foreign 
press members, Wu said Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Jiang Zemin 
agreed on a three-point principle in connection with the Korean 
situation. 
  The principle was the maintenance of peace and stability on 
the Korean peninsula, resolution of the North Korean nuclear 
question through dialogue, and non-use of pressure against North 
Korea over the nuclear issue. 
  Reiterating China's opposition to any resolution by the U.N. 
Security Council, spokesman Wu said, "since dialogue alone will 
be the only means of resolving the question, Security Council 
president's statement containing considerate contents would 
implant patience for constructive dialogue among the parties 
involved and would thus make it possible to resume dialogue." 
  He said the summit between Presidents Kim and Jiang did not 
discuss the issues of the Team Spirit and Patriot missiles. 
  "But, China's policy is against any acts of threatening 
stability and building up tension on the Korean peninsula, such 
as the staging of a military exercise and deployment of Patriot 
missiles," Wu said. 
  Stating that President Kim's visit to China was highly 
successful, the spokesman said South Korea and China will 
closely cooperate in the economic and trade areas based on the 
mutual understanding made through a series of meetings between 
President Kim and Chinese leaders.

  [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here today that the Chinese side 
sincerely hopes that the civil servants working in various 
departments of the Hong Kong Government will rest assured and 
will continue to render service for the Government of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and for the local 
people after 1997. 
  The spokesman made the remarks at a press confernece when 
asked to comment on a statement of the British side which 
proposes to discuss with the Chinese side a list of principal 
Hong Kong officials transcending 1997. 
  He said that there are clear stipulations in the 
Sino-British 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR, 
namely, candidates for the principal officials of the Government 
of the Hong Kong SAR shall be submitted to the central 
government for appointment upon normination by the SAR chief 
executive. 
  Therefore it is clear that the right to nominate and appoint 
the principal officials of the Hong Kong SAR Government rests 
with the SAR chief executive and the central government, 
respectively, rather than a case in which the candidates for the 
principal officials will be nominated by the British side and 
then submitted for consultation with the Chinese side, he said. 
  He reaffirmed that the Chinese side will act in strict 
accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. 
  "The Chinese side sincerely hopes that the civil cervants 
working in the various departments of the Hong Kong Government

number of activities, including a nationwide conference on 
social development, drafting the national report on China's 
social development, formulating the outline of China's social 
development, an exhibition on the achievements in social 
development after the founding of the People's Republic of China 
and an international symposium," he said.

active and constructive cooperation with other countries and 
will work hard for positive results of the summit, the spokesman

  Asked to comment on the recent aggravation of violence in

security in the Korea peninsula, he said.

  [Text] Moscow, March 30 (XINHUA) -- President Boris 
Yeltsin today met with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown, 
who arrived here on Monday [28 March] seeking greater access to 
Russian markets. 
  The meeting was attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Vladimirovich Kozyrev, presidential aide Dmitriy Pyurikov and 
U.S. Ambassador in Moscow Thomas Pickering, according to the 
INTERFAX NEWS SERVICE. 
  On Tuesday, Brown met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  Chernomyrdin told Brown that some import tariffs would be 
revised, mostly concerning previously agreed contracts whose 
implementation may be affected by the government's plans for the 
introduction of new import duties. 
  Chernomyrdin added that the import duties on leasing two 
U.S. 
Boeing planes and various technologies will also be liable for 
revision. 
  And he revealed that large quantities of inferior foodstuffs 
had been delivered to Russia, which has resulted in hundreds of 
poisoning cases. 
  However, despite the change in tariffs Chernomyrdin called 
on 
foreign investors not to be afraid of the Russian market, as 
there is potential for considerable, and beneficial, joint 
activities. 
  He explained that Russia is prepared for foreign investors 
to 
operate in its market place and that supporting legislation was 
being prepared. 
  The prime minister also discussed with Brown broader access 
for Russian products to the West and said that Russia could 
guarantee delivery. "The recent decision to allow a delivery of 
Russian uranium to the United States was a breakthrough," he 
added. 
  In reply Brown said that both the U.S. Government and the 
country's private sector are keen to support Russian reforms, 
but stressed that at the same time Russia should provide 
legislation to protect potential investors and iron out tax and 
tariff problems. 
  Brown's visit to Russia comes at a time when trade exchanges 
between the two countries are expanding; U.S. exports to Russia 
reached 3 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, 40 percent more than the 
previous year, while last year U.S. imports from Russia grew by 
262 percent to 1.7 billion dollars. 
  Nevertheless, U.S. investment in Russia is still relatively 
very small, currently running at only one billion dollars. But 
according to Brown the United States believes there is great 
potential for increased capital investment, especially in the 
oil and gas industry. 
  During his five-day stay in Moscow, Brown is expected to 
sign 
four trade documents with Russia. 
  They include regulations for setting up a committee on the 
promotion of Russian-U.S. business cooperation, regulations for 
the establishment of U.S. funded business centers, a joint 
statement on bilateral trading relations, personnel training and 
standardization, and an agreement on making U.S. medicines 
available to the Russian market.

<F P=106> [News Analysis by Wang Nan: "U.S. Commercial Interests in </F>
China: The Lure and The Drag"] 
  [Text] Washington, March 30 (XINHUA) -- From wheat to oil, 
from aircraft to software, from jeans at fashion stores to 
transformers at Toys `R' Us, the whole truth of U.S. commercial 
interests in China is coming out. 
  The pros and cons of doing business in the world's most 
populous country and the fastest-growing economy were again at 
Washington's spotlight as the debates over China's trade status 
heated up. 
  With the commerce department keeping secret on the 
classified 
document - "U.S. commercial interests in China to the year 
2000", outside the beltway, traders could barely wait to ride 
the oriental express. 
  "China is now defined by great expectations," "Beyond MFN", 
a 
new book on China's most favored nation status, noted in its 
preface. "the (U.S.-China) relationship is of rapidly increasing 
importance to Americans." 
  Then, where are the real commercial interests of the U.S. in 
China, which, according to some projections, will be the world's 
largest economy in 20 years and which, among other handicaps, 
lack modern infrastructure? 
  Over the years, U.S. exports to China, according to official 
sources here, have been led by aeronautic equipment, power 
generating machinery, fertilizer, electric machinery, medical 
equipment, grain and chemicals. 
  Among the U.S. imports from China were, in line with imports 
value, apparel, toys and games, electronics, footwear, leather 
goods, power generating machinery and plastics. 
  "In the future, Mainland China will certainly be the center 
of a web of investment and trade relations because of its vast 
population and market potential," said Claude Barfield, director 
of trade studies at the American Enterprise Institute, at a 
symposium today. 
  The area of China, China's Taiwan and Hong Kong is the 
America's fourth largest export market and third largest 
supplier. "The overwhelming amount of U.S. sales is in 
manufactured goods," Jeff Garten, undersecretary of commerce, 
said in a recent speech in Tokyo. 
  Over the past five years, U.S. imports from China have been 
increasing at a rate of five times faster than exports. While 
U.S. exports to Japan have remained unchanged since 1990, its 
exports to China have risen by 55 percent. 
  According to the U.S.-China Business Council, China plans to 
spend over 200 billion U.S. dollars on imports from 1993 to 
1995. Many of these imports are in the areas in which U.S. 
industries are particularly strong. 
  Among other things, China's import markets in the next two 
years of power-generating equipment, aerospace, computers and 
telecommunications will be respectively 100 billion, 40 billion, 
40 billion and 30 billion dollars. 
  Apparently, there are worries. 
  While every other western country has rearranged programs to 
actively promote exports to and investment in China, "the U.S. 
Government has not," wrote Jerome Cohen, a China expert at New 
York University School of Law. 
  Actually, U.S. private direct investment in China, as 
percentages of the total amount of such investment in the 
people's republic, has dropped from 4.6 percent in 1991 to 2.8 
percent in 1992. 
  "As the greatest industrial power in the world and the 
destination of fully one-third of China's exports, the U.S. has 
received only a paltry share of the huge China market, a cause 
for some concern," he stressed. 
  The book "Beyond MFN-Trade With China and American 
Interests", meanwhile, noted that in China and Asia, there had 
been "diminishing dependence" on the U.S. as the major purchaser 
of their products. 
  What's worse, the U.S. consumers, buying some 30 billion 
dollars of goods from China and Hong Kong last year, have to pay 
seven to 10 billion dollars more if China's MFN status was 
revoked by the white house. 
  Jobs and profits in the U.S. companies doing business with 
China, observers here noted, will be jeopardized. 
  Noting that U.S. businesses are at "a significant 
disadvantage" in competing for China's favor, Jerome Cohen 
stressed that "one should not underestimate the importance of 
favorable U.S. policies for promoting U.S. business interests." 
  Said a senior Chinese official last spring, "if (the U.S.) 
come into the Chinese market too late, it will be occupied by 
others. It is a big cake. Come early and you get a big piece."

  [Text] Washington, March 30 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton signed a federal buyout bill into law today aimed 
at cutting federal government bureaucrats by 272,900 employees 
over five years. 
  Under the law, the federal government offers a lump sum of 
up 
to 25,000 U.S. dollars as a buyout to each of those who resign 
or retire provided he or she has completed 12 months of 
continuous service. 
  The U.S. President signed the legislation while vacationing 
in southern California. 
  The new law is part of the effort of the White House to slim 
the federal government which employs more than two million 
people. The law will help reduce the federal government 
workforce by 12 percent, bringing the figure below the 
two-million mark for the first time since 1966 and to the lowest 
level since 1950. 
  In a statement released by the White House, Clinton said 
that 
the law would help the government achieve goals of making 
government work better and cost less. 
  In a related development, White House Budget Director Leon 
Panetta announced that the Clinton administration had eliminated 
284 federal advisory committees, which are required by law, 
saving 17 million U.S. dollars a year. 
  Clinton had ordered a year ago that the 801 advisory 
committees that are not required by law be trimmed by a third to 
267.

<F P=106> ["Jottings on International Events" by Jian Mei (0494 2734): </F>
"`Whitewater' Becomes Terrifying Waves"] 
  [Text] It is now still hard to say whether "Whitewater" 
will inundate the White House, but it is certain that it has 
inundated the U.S. press and diverted the attention of the 
American people from politicians to ordinary citizens from more 
important domestic and international affairs. Not long ago, a 
White House official complained: "As long as the Whitewater 
case can be driven out of the first page of the newspapers, any 
bad news can now be regarded as good news." 
  An interesting fact was that on 17 March 1992, that is, two 
years ago, THE NEW YORK TIMES published a report on the event, 
but the report aroused no attention like a stone dropping into 
the sea. In late 1992, when Clinton and Bush contended for the 
presidency, the Department of Justice turned down the proposal 
of the department concerned on investigating the case for fear 
that this might be used by the Bush administration. In July 
1993, Vincent Foster, deputy counsel to the president on legal 
affairs who was in the know, suddenly committed suicide, and the 
relevant materials in his hands disappeared without a trace. At 
that moment, the case just stirred up some ripples. Five months 
ago, a reporter talked about his investigation of the 
"Whitewater incident" at a banquet in Washington, but the 
subject was still discussed by very few people. How come the 
"Whitewater incident" changed from minor ripples into monstrous 
waves in the spring? 
  "Whitewater" is the name of a business company. Fifteen 
years ago, Clinton and his wife, together with Mr and Mrs 
McDougal who later became Clinton's political ally, set up the 
Whitewater Development Corporation on the banks of Whitewater 
River in Arkansas, and the company was mainly engaged in trading 
idle real estate. In September 1991, Whitewater applied for 
bankruptcy after incurring business losses. The "Whitewater 
incident" was thus named after the company, and the incident 
itself developed into an extremely complicated 
economic-political case. The scope of investigation extended to 
Clinton's personal life as governor of Arkansas State for 12 
years and his wife Hillary's main economic activities as well as 
Clinton's personal involvement in such activities. At present, 
it does not seem important to find out whether the Clintons 
underpaid Whitewater Corporation income taxes, and people have 
also paid less attention to the financial details of the case. 
People's interest is now focused on the conclusion: Did the 
Clintons use the influence of Bill Clinton's governorship to 
illegally transfer any funds of a state-run savings and loan 
bank to Whitewater Corporation for real estate investment? Was 
any money from the bank used to repay Clinton's $50,000 debt he 
owed when campaigning for the governorship, thus causing losses 
to taxpayers in Arkansas? Was any government loan offered 
through a certain company, or was any favorable administrative 
decision made in exchange for funds for campaigning for the 
governorship and the presidency? In one word, did the Clintons 
abuse their official power in pursuit of private gains? 
  A major reason the "Whitewater incident" was highlighted by 
the press in such a frenzied way was that almost everyone made 
his or her own vague conjecture about this enigma. 
  This year is a Congressional by-election year. The 
Republican Party hopes to make a comeback, so it is taking 
advantage of this case to make an uproar in order to add fuel to 
the flames and to damage Clinton's reputation. Clinton and many 
leading Democrats angrily call the Whitewater incident a 
"Republican conspiracy." On the other hand, while promising to 
give "full cooperation," the White House still tried to 
equivocate and pry into the process of investigation. Many 
political allies and long-time cronies were forced to quit 
government posts one after another. In addition, some 
Democrats' intention of drawing a "line of demarcation" between 
the Democratic Party and Clinton, the different assessments of 
Clinton's performances and administrative principles inside the 
Democratic Party, the resentment of the East Coast forces 
against the upstarts from the West spreading in the White House 
and inside D.C., and the different comments of voters about 
Hillary's role as both First Lady and major policy-maker 
responsible for formulating the increasingly controversial 
medical-care reform program..., all played a certain role in 
increasing the seriousness of the "Whitewater incident." 
  Recently, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed 
a motion on holding separate Congressional hearings on the 
"Whitewater incident" by a unanimous vote and by an overwhelming 
majority respectively. Clinton also agreed to make public his 
tax returns between 1977 and 1979. Fiske, the special federal 
counsel responsible for handling the case, is busy issuing 
summons to more and more senior government officials. If the 
conclusion is "yes," Clinton will become another Nixon and 
"Whitewater" will really wash the White House away. The recent 
opinion poll showed that in a period of one month, Clinton's 
support declined by 11 percentage points; and this also showed 
that the American people believed there are no waves without 
wind.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- The president of U.S. 
fertilizer giant Cargill said here today that the United States 
should extend the most-favored-nation trade status (MFN) toward 
China this June. 
  Speaking at a seminar on international trade of agricultural 
commodities, Cargill president Fritz Corrigan said China and the 
United States have close economic and trade relations. He 
expressed hope that Sino-U.S. economic relations would be 
maintained and strengthened. 
  He told XINHUA that during his meeting with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor in Washington last February, he 
strongly advocated the renewal of China's MFN status. 
  Kantor was generally in favor of the extension of MFN 
status, 
Corrigan said. 
  He said that withdrawing China's MFN status would be 
unhelpful to Sino-U.S. cooperation and would definitely harm the 
economic and trade relations between the two countries. 
  According to John Crawshaw, president of Cargill 
Fertilizer's 
Southeast Asian branch, the U.S. fertilizer giant shipped the 
first batch of American wheat to China in 1972 when the then 
U.S. President Richard Nixon made his first China visit. 
  Cargill Fertilizer's business volume in China has topped 25 
million tons over the last two decades, including the purchasing 
and selling of over 20 varieties of agro-products. 
  Crawshaw said that Cargill has determined to invest more in 
China and would seek more partners. He anticipated that his 
company could complete the necessary procedures to be registered 
in China by the end of this year. 
  Cargill Fertilizer, with more than 70,000 employees 
worldwide, specializes in agro-business. The company's 
fertilizer sales volume worldwide exceeded seven million tons in 
1993. 
  Today's seminar was sponsored by China's Ministry of 
Agriculture, Cargill Fertilizer and the Potash and Phosphate 
Institute of Canada.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Moscow and Beijing will act jointly to prevent 
crimes and illegal business activities perpetrated by the 
increasing number of Chinese and Russians travelling to and 
staying in the neighbouring countries. In an interview, the 
Russian Ambassador to China, Igor Rogachev, also denied 
speculation that Moscow recently had sold new weapons to its 
erstwhile communist ally. 
  The ambassador, who worked in China during the Cultural 
Revolution, said he was optimistic about the development in 
Russian Chinese relations. He said that in 1993 there had been 
2.5 million crossings of Chinese into Russia, and 1.5 million 
crossings of Russians going the other way. "Neither side had 
anticipated the massive flow," Mr Rogachev said. "Both Russian 
and Chinese authorities have detected problems of law and order. 
Delegations have been exchanged on the subject and new ways of 
containing crimes will be spelt out soon." 
  He said among the Chinese who stayed in Russia were workers 
on legitimate contracts for building houses, hotels, or 
highways, but he hinted that some Chinese travellers had 
overstayed. A major problem was "speculators," or Chinese 
private-entrepreneur wheelers and dealers who did not abide by 
commercial and other business codes in the country. 
  But Mr Rogachev denied knowledge about a press report that 
as 
many as 2,000 Russian scientists, including those with expertise 
in weapons, had been recruited by China. He said Moscow was 
working on "some measures to monitor the outflow of Russian 
experts," not just to China but to other countries. They now 
would have to go through set procedures before permission would 
be given them to work abroad he indicated. 
  On military co-operation and the sale of weapons, Mr 
Rogachev 
said they were within the framework of the general improvement 
of bilateral ties and conducted on a "commercial basis." "Both 
sides have agreed that there will be no return to the military 
or political alliance of the 1950s," he said. "In the export of 
weapons (to China), we fully observe our international 
obligations as well as the national interest of our country." 
  The ambassador said there had been no recent "breakthrough" 
in military cooperation, denying reports of new sales of Su-27 
fighters or nuclear submarines. This might be due partly to 
China's caution in using hard currency, he hinted. 
  On the subject of economic cooperation, Mr Rogachev said two 
economic zones for bilateral cooperation would soon be set up: 
One near the cities of Manzhouli and Zabaikalsk and the other 
near the cities of Blagoveshchensk and Heihe. 
  Teams of Russian experts would soon be going to China to 
help 
modernise the 156 plants that had been built in the 1950's with 
the help of Soviet experts, he said. 
  Eighty percent of bilateral trade was now done between 
regions or companies.

set up pickets around the federal government building in Moscow 
this morning calling for the repayment of debts to help the 
industry survive. 
  The miners, representatives of nearly all the coal mines in 
the country, arrived in Moscow on Tuesday [29 March]. 
  Shouting slogans "Repay our wages!" and "Our families on the 
verge of starvation!", the miners demanded that the government 
repay long standing debts to the coal industry and provide 
appropriate subsidies. 
  The angry miners told reporters that they had sent a letter 
to President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin calling them to a meeting with their 
representatives. 
  The picket protest action is scheduled to last until Friday.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhang Tiegang: "Nazarbayev's Moscow Trip </F>
Fruitful"] 
  [Text] Moscow, March 30 (XINHUA) -- Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev today ended his three-day official visit to 
Russia, which was described by his Russian counterpart Boris 
Yeltsin as "very successful" and "very important." 
  The president arrived in Moscow on Sunday [27 March] for his 
first official visit to Russia. 
  In Moscow, Nazarbayev held a one-to-one summit meeting with 
Yeltsin and met with Russian parliament leaders Vladimir 
Shumeyko, the speaker of the upper house, and Ivan Rybkin, the 
speaker of the lower house. 
  The two countries signed 23 bilateral documents including 
agreements on cooperation in political, economic and military 
areas. The most important was the signing of the agreement on 
the disputed Baikonur Cosmodrome, a major missle-launch site of 
the former Soviet Union, now located in Kazakhstan. 
  This document provides for leasing the cosmodrome to Russia 
for 20 years, with provisions for a 10 year extension. Russia 
will pay Kazakhstan 115 million U.S. dollars a year, and the 
cosmodrome will be considered Russian territory and Russian laws 
will be applied exclusively for the full duration of the leasing 
period. 
  The accord is generally viewed as beneficial to both sides. 
Kazakhstan cannot afford to operate Baikonur alone, because it 
has neither the money nor the specialists to do so. For Russia, 
it will be years before its new cosmodrome is operational for 
manned missions. 
  The Baikonur, also the largest space center in the world, 
was 
jointly built by the former Soviet republics. The first launch 
was made there on October 4, 1957. Four years later, on April 
12, 1961, the space center sent the first manned spaceship into 
orbit. 
  Dispute over the future of Baikonur began in earnest last 
summer, when Kazakhstan expressed its readiness to transform the 
cosmodrome into an international space port. This idea left no 
room for Russia to service and maintain the complex for all 
space launches. 
  In a speech in Moscow, Nazarbayev also urged the CIS nations 
to create a "Euro-Asian Union" with a single currency and 
supra-national bodies to coordinate economic, defense and 
foreign policy. 
  "If this fails to gain broad support within the CIS, it 
could 
be formed by Russia and Kazakhstan," he said in a veiled warning 
to other CIS members not to dismiss his initiative out of hand. 
  Nazarbayev, whose huge country is one of the most powerful 
in 
the CIS because of its vast untapped energy reserves and its 
political stability, fist floated the idea of a Euro-Asian Union 
two years ago when the CIS was in its infancy. 
  Observers here believe his revival of the idea now, just 
over 
two weeks before a scheduled CIS summit in Moscow on April 15, 
assumed greater weight given Kazakhstan's growing profile and 
the CIS's failure to forge any common policies. 
  However, Russia's attitude towards the proposal was not 
immediately known. Up to now, most former Soviet republics have 
rejected any proposal for creating supra-national bodies. 
  The Kazakh leader told reporters on Tuesday that Yeltsin had 
responded "positively" to the idea of a Euro-Asian Union during 
their talks. 
  Commenting on the results of Nazarbayev's Moscow trip, a 
Kazakh diplomat working in Moscow said that "both presidents 
expressed their satisfaction" over the visit.

  [Text] Moscow, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev has proposed setting up a "Eurasian Union," 
which he describes as an absolutely new grouping for members of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
  "If this idea fails to gain broad support within the CIS, it 
could be formed by Russia and Kazakhstan," Nazarbayev stressed 
at a meeting in Moscow's State University today. 
  The union, in his opinion, should be based on principles 
different from those of the CIS, although he added that he was 
not calling for the restoration of the old Soviet Union or the 
formation of an empire. 
  Nazarbayev said that the new union should have 
supra-national 
bodies to coordinate the economic, defense and foreign policies 
of the member states with a council of heads of state and 
governments to discuss strategic matters. 
  "This should be followed by direct elections to a common 
parliament, which would coordinate the legislative activities of 
all the member states," Nazarbayev explained. 
  He added that a council for defense ministers should be 
formed to create an effective military bloc along with a foreign 
ministers' council to coordinate members' joint activities in 
the world arena. 
  He said the Eurasian Union should stipulate the introduction 
of a single document or citizenship for all members, compulsory 
concerted economic reform programs and the establishment of a 
supra-national currency. 
  However, Nazarbayev said that membership of the union should 
not interfere with any bilateral relations with third countries. 
  "The union should be based on the principle of equality, 
respect of sovereignty and independence of states, guaranteed 
rights of every man and woman and individuality of every state," 
he added. 
  Nazarbayev, who arrived in Moscow for his first three-day 
official visit to Russia, signed a "record number" of bilateral 
documents with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, including 
agreements on political, economic and military cooperation 
between the two former Soviet republics.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Tokyo by LIAOWANG contributing </F>
reporter Zhang Huanli (1728 3562 0448): "Dispersing the Clouds 
To Show the Blue Sky--Commenting on Zhu Rongji's Visit to Japan"] 
  [Text] In the early spring, when people were feeling 
warmer but the weather was still cold, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
paid a blitz visit to China's eastern neighbor Japan. His visit 
lasted nine days from 23 February to 4 March, which was not 
long, but he set off an upsurge, that is, a "China fever", in 
Japan. 
  Zhu Rongji's visit to Japan came at a period of historical 
transition. As the Cold War is over and the role of economic 
factors is getting more and more important, Japan is still 
exploring what kind of development strategy it is going to take. 
Moreover, in view of the latest situation, Japan is forced to 
make quick decisions. Trade friction between the United States 
and Japan is becoming increasingly acute, the United States has 
decided to impose sanctions on Japan and force the yen to 
appreciate to deal a blow against Japanese exports. However, 
the Japanese economy is in a state of recession, and, in the 
wake of last year's negative growth, the situation this year is 
grimmer. Japan must blaze a new trail if it wants to extricate 
itself from the dilemma. 
  The rapid rise of the Chinese economy gives Japan an 
historical opportunity. Although far-sighted Japanese 
enterprises identify the bright prospects of China, many people 
still have doubts and misgivings: Whether or not China can curb 
inflation to ensure social stability and healthy economic 
development. Whether or not China's monetary and foreign 
exchange reform will infringe on foreign business interests. 
Whether or not a developed China will become a competitor of 
Japan, thus infringing on Japan's economic interests. Such 
misgivings were reflected in the Japanese press prior to Zhu 
Rongji's visit to Japan. 
  During his visit, Zhu Rongji called on Japanese Emperor 
Akihito and met Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Vice 
Premier and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, and key government 
and public figures. The sides reached a consensus in many 
respects. Meanwhile, a noticeable characteristic of Zhu Rongji's 
visit was his extensive contact and profound exchange with 
figures of Japanese economic circles. When Zhu Rongji visited 
Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka, Japan's national as well as local 
economic groups, large financial groups, and major banks 
displayed unprecedented zeal in welcoming him and discussing 
with him issues of trade and economic cooperation between the 
two countries. Such a scene has seldom been seen in Japanese 
economic circles since Sino-Japanese relations were normalized. 
When a lecture by Zhu Rongji was jointly organized by NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN [JAPAN ECONOMIC NEWS], the Japan International 
Trade Promotion Association, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry, 
more than 2,700 people, mainly from Japanese economic circles, 
wanted to attend, but due to the limited space of the 
prearranged assembly hall, only 900 or so were given such a 
chance. At the lecture, the atmosphere was friendly and lively, 
and people constantly responded to Zhu's speech with warm 
applause. During his visit to Japan, Zhu Rongji met as many as 
280 leading figures of large Japanese enterprises, groups, 
corporations, and banks, and sometimes 12 such meetings a day 
were arranged, whereas over 1,500 people from Japanese economic 
circles directly attended Zhu Rongji's lectures or listened to 
his speeches. 
  Through contacts and informal discussions with figures from 
the Japanese economic circles, Zhu Rongji briefed them on the 
situation of China's reform and opening up, measures taken to 
curb inflation, policies formulated to protect foreign business 
interests, and so on. Moreover, he helped figures from Japanese 
economic circles understand that if Japan wants to get over the 
current economic recession, it must, apart from taking the old 
method of stimulating demand, lay stress on readjusting its 
industrial structure, that is, it must shift its focus away from 
manufacturing industries, turn to industries with higher surplus 
value, enhance its products' competitive power, and open up to 
the overseas market. Meanwhile, Japan must focus on the Asian 
region, particularly on economic cooperation with China, because 
the Asian region, especially China, is the most vigorous and 
most rapidly developing place in the present global economy. As 
proved by the facts over the past two years, such economic 
cooperation is the most effective means to reinvigorate the 
Japanese economy. 
  Once he arrived in the Kansai Region of Japan, Zhu Rongji 
immediately found that although Japan was in an economic 
recession, Kansai was still the most dynamic economic region in 
Japan. One of the reasons is that this region's economic and 
trade activities with China now accounts for 40 percent of its 
overall external economic activities. 
  With the rapid development of the Chinese economy, Zhu 
Rongji told Japanese economic circles, last year three records 
were broken on an unprecedented scale in terms of Sino-Japanese 
economic and trade relations. First, Sino-Japanese trade volume 
reached a historical record of $39 billion. Japan became the 
No. 1 trade partner of China, whereas China became the No. 2 
trade partner of Japan for the first time. Second, Japan's 
technology export trade to China accounted for 28 percent of 
China's technology imports, which ranked first. Another point 
is that the rate of realizable funds given by Japanese 
enterprises to China ranked first. Zhu Rongji stressed that the 
rapid development of Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations 
not only benefited China, but also contributed to the 
revitalization of the Japanese economy. Zhu Rongji told 
Japanese economic circles on many occasions during his visit 
that Sino-Japanese trade volume, which amounted to $39 billion, 
was not large enough and was even very small compared with the 
potential of Sino-Japanese cooperation. He reckoned that 
according to the present trend of development, Sino-Japanese 
trade volume may reach $390 billion within the next decade and 
China would become the No. 1 trade partner of Japan. Zhu Rongji 
added that Japan transferred its technology to China mainly 
through cooperation in production and setting up joint ventures, 
which would only enhance the competitive power of Japanese 
products in overseas market. He said that China and Japan, 
which cooperated with each other in developing the global 
market, were partners of equality and mutual benefit rather than 
competitors. These insider's remarks made by Zhu Rongji helped 
Japanese economic circles dispel their doubts. 
  During Zhu Rongji's stay in Japan, television stations, 
radio 
stations, and newspapers from all over Japan vigorously reported 
news related to his visit and, in particular, focused on 
reporting how his visit helped promote economic and trade 
relations between the two countries. 
  A commentary published by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said: "Vice 
Premier Zhu's convincing explanation and humorous wording helped 
dispel people's doubts." Keizo Tomiyasu, president of Japan's 
Shin Goyo Corporation, said after listening to Zhu Rongji's 
speech: "Last year, our company's trade volume with China was 
approximately 15 billion yen. This year, the trade volume will 
double, and in the next two years, we will strive to explore new 
fields of cooperation." Authoritative figures from Japanese 
economic circles predicted that within the next five years, 
investments made by Japanese enterprises in China would outstrip 
that of ASEAN. 
  The clouds have been dispersed and the blue sky is shown. We 
can expect that Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations will 
advance to a new stage of development soon.

<F P=106> ["Envoy's Remarks Touch Off Confusion on Seoul's Ties With </F>
Beijing"] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (YONHAP) -- An envoy's comments 
touched a raw nerve with the [ROK] president and his aides 
Tuesday, just when they thought they had finished the 
tension-packed duties of their visits to Japan and china. 
  South Korean Ambassador to Beijing Hwang Pyong-tae, a former 
lawmaker, apparently made two big mistakes -- he disclosed the 
contents of the Korea-China [summit] talks, and what he chose to 
reveal ran counter to what the president said. 
  President Kim Yong-sam refused to answer questions on the 
specifics of his talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng at a press 
conference Tuesday, saying only that his visits to Tokyo and 
Beijing had helped form a trilateral cooperation channel among 
the United States, Japan and China. 
  He said he hoped to include Russia in this chain to bring 
aboard all four regional powers in solving the North Korean 
nuclear problem. 
  Then came Ambassador Hwang, who arranged an evening press 
conference at the request of South Korean TV journalists. He 
suggested that while South Korean-U.S. coordination supplied the 
impetus for dealing with the nuclear question, it would be South 
Korean-Chinese coordination from now on. 
  "The discussion on the North Korean nuclear issue between 
South Korea and China has outgrown the past practice, where 
South Korea and the United States would only notify the results 
of their consultations (to others), changing to where South 
Korea and China would hold deep discussions from the beginning 
and take joint steps," the ambassador told the press. 
  Asked about Japan and Russia's role, he said Seoul would 
simply brief Moscow on the results of the negotiations, and 
"it's realistically difficult to expect Japan to play a role." 
  He went on to disclose the details of the Kim-Li meeting. 
"Premier Li Peng told President Kim that China would continue to 
try to solve the nuclear problem through dialogue if North Korea 
has no nuclear weapons. But if North Korea does have nuclear 
weapons, China would counter it ever strongly," he said. 
  The envoy then predicted that North Korea would soon resume 
negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
on additional inspections. 
  The news later reached Senior Secretary for Diplomacy Chong 
Chong-uk and Spokesman Chu Ton-sik, who belatedly tried to cork 
the story. 
  Chung, Chu, and Hwang came by the press center twice around 
midnight, saying the facts had been misrepresented and pleading 
that sensitive parts of the story not be published. 
  A close presidential aide insisted that Hwang's remarks do 
not reflect the Seoul government's official position: Nor is it 
true that the South Korea-China channel has reached the same 
level as negotiations between Seoul and Washington. 
  "All it means is that the channel with China was strengthend 
through the Beijing visit," the aide said. "It's also not true 
that North Korea will resume talks with the IAEA soon." 
  President Kim personally refuted Hwang's remarks in a 
breakfast meeting with the press Wednesday, emphasizing South 
Korea's affinity to the United States, its close cooperation 
with allies and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's "hasty" trip to 
Washington. 
  One official at the presidential office [Chongwadae] openly 
criticized the envoy, saying, "I don't know whether Ambassador 
Hwang is a diplomat or still a politician."

<F P=106> [By reporter Lai Chin-hung (6351 6930 1347): "Bohai Bay To </F>
Be Turned Into Economic Circle To Step Up Introduction of ROK 
Capital"] 
  [Text] While ROK President Kim Yong-sam is visiting 
Beijing, Chinese authorities are mobilizing economic and trade 
departments to step up the introduction of ROK capital and seek 
the ROK's help in building a Bohai Bay Economic Circle with 
Liaoning, Hebei, and Shandong as the primary destinations, to 
further promote economic cooperation in Northeast Asia. 
  According to a mainland official, the Chinese Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] and other 
relevant departments have made a long-term economic development 
strategy in a bid to attract more ROK enterprises to the Chinese 
mainland. They have also designated over 80 projects that show 
good potentialities as key projects for cooperation with the 
ROK. As for the distribution of ROK investors on the mainland, 
China wishes that they will focus on northeast and northern 
China. Currently, there are nearly 1,000 ROK enterprises 
investing in the mainland, with a total investment of close to 
$1 billion, most of which is concentrated in such regions as 
Shandong and northeast China. 
  The official said: There are many medium-sized and large 
enterprises in the ROK. If they effectively concentrate their 
investments in the coastal areas of northeast and north China, 
they will be able to inject a large amount of foreign capital 
into the thriving Bohai Bay economic zone. First of all, it may 
counterbalance the overexpansion of Japanese investors in 
Northeast China and avoid the danger of a "Japanese economic 
invasion," bringing about the same kind of economic benefits as 
Hong Kong and Taiwan investments do in southern parts of China. 
Secondly, the overseas Chinese in the ROK mostly originate from 
Shandong or Northeast China. It is therefore more convenient 
for them to make direct investment or help bring in investment 
by native Koreans. Thirdly, the ROK's economic development is 
running into a bottleneck in the course of transformation, as 
many of its economic indexes rank last among the "four little 
dragons." Faced with strong rivalry from East Asian nations, 
the ROK is actively seeking a way out. In this context, Beijing 
hopes to attract more ROK enterprises to Shandong, Hebei, and 
Liaoning, so that these provinces can obtain a large amount of 
ROK capital, energize their economic situations within a short 
time, and subsequently expand economic cooperation and ties in 
northeast Asia, truly turning Bohai Bay into an economic center 
of northeast Asia. 
  The official also said: Mainland authorities have not laid 
down any restrictions regarding where ROK enterprises are 
allowed to invest, but officials concerned from MOFTEC and 
Liaoning, Hebei, and Shandong will take the initiative in supply 
information on major projects in a bid to obtain capital from 
ROK. Since Beijing and the ROK established diplomatic relations 
over a year ago, such provinces as Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei, 
and Jiangsu have organized large economic and trade delegations 
to visit the ROK. As many as six or seven provinces have held 
economic and trade meetings in Seoul. More and more ROK 
officials and entrepreneurs have been visiting provinces in the 
Bohai Bay zone. 
  On another front, according to an official of Liaoning 
Province, the flow of capital from the ROK into northeast China 
used to be very slow due to misgivings about such matters as 
Sino-DPRK friendship. Now, because the central policy is "going 
all out to attract ROK capital," local officials may totally 
ignore the reaction from DPRK, giving rise to a rapid growth in 
ROK input. In some cities, ROK investments are even on a par 
with Japanese investments. 
  It is learned that during Kim Yong-sam's visit in Beijing, 
the foreign economic and trade officials of Liaoning, Hebei, and 
Shandong will be meeting with ROK counterparts through the China 
Council for the Promotion of International Trade to strengthen 
their relations of cooperation and hold further consultations on 
strengthening bilateral trade, economic, and technological 
exchange.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 30 (XINHUA) -- East China's port 
municipality, Tianjin, has played an increasingly important role 
in economic cooperation and contacts between China and the 
Republic of Korea (ROK). 
  This was underlined by yesterday's arrival of the economic 
delegation of Inchon city of the ROK consisting of 130 members 
with 60-plus from local business and industrial circles in 
Tianjin. 
  They will inspect the investment environment of Tianjin, 
hold 
trade talks with Tianjin's trade counterparts and attend the 
inauguration ceremony of an Inchon product exhibition. 
  Tianjin is one of the country's largest ports and also among 
the nearest to the ROK in geographical location. 
  After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the 
two countries in 1992, Tianjin has opened direct navigation ties 
for cargo transport to Inchon and airline service to the ROK's 
capital city, Seoul, thus effectively promoting the expansion of 
mutual economic contacts. 
  By the end of last month, there were 275 enterprises in 
Tianjin partly or totally funded by ROK investors, with capital 
exceeding 340 million U.S. dollars. The enterprises involve 
fields including industry, architecture, international trade, 
the service industry, agriculture and transportation. 
  Among them, Tianjin Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. has not 
only occupied a large share of the domestic video-corder market 
but also begun to export to other countries. 
  The construction in the Tianjin Development Zone of the 
1.2-sq-km industrial zone by Korea Land Development Corporation 
is in full swing. The zone is expected to attract 100-plus rok 
enterprises in the near future. 
  Along with the enlargement of the investment scale of ROK 
enterprises in Tianjin, ROK finance and banking circles have 
also begun to eye the Chinese municipality. 
  Korea Exchange Bank has set up a branch and Chohung Bank and 
Shinhan Bank have opened agencies in Tianjin. 
  In the year 1993, Tianjin's trade volume with the ROK topped 
100 million U.S. dollars with exports standing at 38 million and 
imports at 64 million. 
  Tianjin has mainly imported steel, fabrics, imitation 
leather, and auto spare parts from the ROK and exported clothes, 
shoes, textiles and elevators to it. 
  The ROK has become one of Tianjin's most important trade 
partners. 
  A sea postal route from Tianjin to Pusan in the ROK, first 
of 
its kind between the two countries, was opened to service this 
month.

  [Text] Paris, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- French National Assembly 
President Philippe Seguin met with Zhu Qizhen, head of the 
Chinese National People's Congress [NPC] delegation to the 91st 
session of the Interparliamentary Union Council and also vice 
chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, in Paris this 
evening. 
  President Seguin first acclaimed the French-Chinese joint 
communique announced by the governments of the two countries not 
long ago on restoring traditional friendship and cooperation. 
Seguin pointed out: Friendship between France and China is 
built on a solid political, historical, and cultural base. In 
the past when there was a bipolar contention in the world, both 
France and China opposed hegemonism. The governments of the two 
countries have similar or close viewpoints toward the current 
major international issues. Seguin said: Both France and China 
are important countries in the world and their cooperation at 
the UN Security Council plays an important role in protecting 
world peace. 
  Seguin praised the rapid economic development in China. He 
said that the economies of the two countries are complementary 
to each other, and hoped that the two countries would further 
strengthen cooperation in economic development and trade. 
  Seguin noted that the French National Assembly has attached 
particular importance to developing relations with the Chinese 
NPC, and so it has set up a France-China Friendship Group which 
is responsible for developing friendly contacts with the Chinese 
NPC. 
  During their meeting, Zhu Qizhen pointed out: Through joint 
efforts, Sino-French relationship has passed a difficult period 
and opened an important new page. He said: China and France 
have traditional friendship and the development of friendship 
and cooperation between the two countries are in accord with the 
common wishes of people of the two countries. 
  Zhu Qizhen also briefed President Seguin on Second Session 
of 
the Eighth NPC, which has just ended, 
  PRC Ambassador to France Cai Fangbo took part in the 
meeting.

and the United Nations representation office in Laos, and 
invited guests from various public and private sectors. 
  Attendees were presented with a report on the losses in rice 
farming throughtout the country during last year's rice 
production season. The losses resulted from natural disasters 
including drought, floods, and pestilence. According to the 
final assessment, last year's overall rice shortage throughout 
the country involved approximately 310,000 metric tons of paddy, 
or 185,000 tons of white rice. The four provinces mentioned 
above suffered an estimated shortage of 143,000 tons of paddy, 
or 86,000 tons of white rice. 
  The meeting answered questions from representives of various 
organizations and also reported on relief aid provided by the 
Japanese Government -- approximately 200 million yen worth of 
white rice. The meeting also called for various countries to 
consider relief aid for Laos, while the Lao Government will at 
the same time submit requests for the same purpose to various 
countries through the World Food Program representative office 
in Laos.

  [Text] The supreme commander has confirmed the plan to 
deport to Laos all Hmong who have taken refuge at Wat Tham 
Krabok in Sara Buri Province. Supreme Commander Air Chief 
Marshal Woranat Aphichari said the military has been 
coordinating with the Interior Ministry to identify the illegal 
immigrants who fled from refugee centers to Tham Krabok. 
Concerning General Vang Pao, the supreme commander said legal 
action will be taken if he returns to Thailand to pursue 
subversive activities. The supreme commander explained that the 
measure taken by the military followed a government order, which 
wants to preserve good relations with the neighboring country. 
  [Begin Woranat recording] We have filed charges against him. 
This is aimed at preventing Gen. Vang Pao from entering our 
country. He will be arrested at the immigration checkpoint if 
he tries to enter the country. Concerning the next steps we 
will take, I do not think we can reveal them because that would 
affect the efficiency of our plan. [end recording] 
  Asked about the attacks on Thai fishing boats by Burmese 
soldiers off Ranong Province which resulted in a number of Thai 
fishermen being killed, the supreme commander said officials 
concerned are gathering information about the incident for use 
at the next meeting of the Thai-Burmese border committee. 
Meanwhile, Thailand must try to solve its own problem by 
preventing Thai fishermen from encroaching into the waters of 
other countries.

  [Excerpts] Police Chief Gen. Prathin Santipraphop has 
pledged the police will take legal action against Gen. Vang 
Pao's fighters taking refuge in Saraburi's Wat Tham Krabok and 
other immigration centers. Gen. Prathin said 40 Lao out of 6,096 
living in Wat Tam Krabok were suspected to have military 
connections with Gen. Vang Pao's groups. 
  "I have ordered metropolitan and provincial police, 
including 
state agencies concerned, to inspect whether the Laotian 
anti-government members are living in the immigration centers in 
the northern and northeastern provinces," he said. "These people 
will be arrested and brought to court," said Gen. Prathin. 
"This includes Lao illegal immigrants." He said the illegal 
immigrants would be deported to their home country after being 
prosecuted. 
  The chief ordered police to search for more evidence to 
prove 
that Gen. Vang Pao and Gen. Thonglit Chokbengboun had been using 
Thailand as the base to mastermind subversive activities against 
the Lao government. Gen. Prathin's pledge to arrest the rebels 
came after the military filed charges against Gen. Vang Pao, 
claiming the movements of the Lao dissidents in Thailand had 
shaken national security and had affected the relationship 
between the two countries. 
  The military yesterday arrested three Lao believed to work 
for Gen. Vang Pao's group. They are identified as Pa Cha Pa, 
Cheu Yang, and Mai Jung Yang. Pa and Cheu hold American 
citizenship and Mai has Australian citizenship. 
  According to the police, after the civil war in Laos died 
down in 1975, the court of the then Lao government ruled that 
Gen. Vang Pao and Gen. Thonglit, now in exile in the United 
States, were war criminals. [passage omitted] 
  Based on last year's intelligence information, the Supreme 
Command Headquarters discovered some Hmong ethnic people 
allegedly belonging to the Lao anti-government forces had been 
active militarily along the Thai-Lao border.

  [Excerpt] A MATICHON correspondent reports from Nan 
Province that news about the movements of Lao rightist Generals 
Vang Pao and Thonglit Chokbengboun at the Thai-Lao border in Nan 
Province has created concern among local businessmen. They 
feared a negative impact on the economy of the province if the 
government fails to handle this problem effectively. Thailand 
is cooperating with Laos to open a permanent border point for 
trade in Ban Huai Kon, Thung Chang District, Nan Province. If 
the matter is not cleared up, Laos will be suspicious of 
Thailand, and this will delay the project. 
  According to a report from the provincial office, a Thai 
delegation led by Nan Governor Prawit Sisophon held a meeting 
with Lao officials of Sianghon-Hongsa special zone on 21-22 
February. An agreement was reached saying both sides will 
instruct officials to strictly check activities of the 
anti-Vientiane movements. They agreed to exchange information 
on a monthly basis so the authorities concerned could check the 
problem in time. 
  The report indicates that authorities of both sides agreed 
to 
step up control at border trading points. Each Lao national 
seeking treatment at hospitals in Thung Chang District and Song 
Khwae Subdistrict in Nan will not be allowed to have more than 
two persons accompanying him into Thailand. Hospital 
authorities must report admissions to their superiors in order 
to prevent cases of illegal entry. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The 26 February issue of the Thai papers 
MATICHON and KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT carry editorials on the Supreme 
Command's petition to the police to investigate former Lao 
Generals Vang Pao and Thonglit Chokbengboun on the charge of 
violating national security. 
  The 600-word MATICHON editorial, on page 2, entitled: "Vang 
Pao -- A Man in a Wrong Era," says: "The action by the Supreme 
Command can be regarded as sincerity on the part of the Thai 
Government in showing the Lao Government that it has not ignored 
rightist attempts to undermine the Lao Government. Efforts by 
these rightists to organize the overthrow of the Lao Government 
amounts to an anachronism. The Cold War, when ideological 
differences between neighboring countries led to their support 
of subversive activities against one another, is over." 
  The editorial continues: "The current world is one of 
cooperation for economic development and prosperity," adding 
that the situation between Thailand and Laos has developed into 
an era of cooperation for mutual benefit. 
  "Therefore, Gen. Vang Pao and his followers who continue to 
cling to building up an army to topple the Lao Government are 
living in the wrong world. It is odd that Vang Pao has chosen to 
live in exile in the United States surrounded by modern 
technology and thinking. Vang Pao was once a political pawn 
serving the United States. One wonders, however, if he is still 
serving in the same capacity or simply could not shed his past. 
  "The Thai Government must keep in touch with world 
developments. If Thailand wants to be the region's economic 
leader, the Government must show its sincerity in engaging in 
economic cooperation with its neighbors -- Laos, Burma, or 
Cambodia. So far, to its credit the Government has shown that 
it has not gotten involved with rebel groups opposing those 
governments. This will win their trust and eventually their 
economic cooperation." 
  The 600-word KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT editorial, on page 2, 
entitled: "The Stand Must Change With Time," says: "It is 
strange that the Thai Government did not take action against the 
Lao rightist generals itself, letting the Supreme Command do it 
instead. The government has direct responsibility here. It is 
possible that it does not have enough information, as in case of 
the arms cache in Chanthaburi Province. 
  "In any event, the action against the Lao rightist generals 
should have been taken long ago, when the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR] Government received the recognition 
of the international community, including the United Nations. 
The action was not taken earlier possibly because previous Thai 
governments nurtured the hope that the rightists would be able 
to overthrow the LPDR Government and return to power. It knew 
that the rightists remained active and used Thai territory as a 
sanctuary for their operations in Laos. At that time the LPDR 
Government accused Thailand of supporting the Lao rightists. 
However, the Thai Government ignored the accusation, and thus 
made the Lao rightists more bold in their subversive activities." 
  The editorial continues: "The publicized action by the Thai 
military against Vang Pao and his followers is necessary because 
Thailand has to show its clear stance toward the LPDR as 
diplomatic and trade contacts with that country become 
increasingly greater. The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge will be 
opened soon, and Thailand cannot afford to be unclear in its 
stand. Gen. Vang Pao and his followers ought to understand 
their own position and Thailand's new position and quickly cease 
subversive activities against the Lao Government."

  [Text] A Burmese man arrested three months ago on a charge 
of possessing war weapons and illegal entry into Thailand was on 
Thursday sentenced by the Criminal Court to four years and eight 
months in jail. The court initially sentenced Sun Naign to seven 
years but commuted the sentence because he had pleaded guilty. 
Sun Naign, 28, was among four Burmese arrested in November last 
year at a house in Bangkok's Ratthewi district. Police seized 
two sticks of TNT, two M-26 hand grenades, a detonator, electric 
wire and handgun cartridges in their rented house. 
  The four said they had planned to use suicide bombs to 
assassinate Gen. Khin Nyunt, the chief of Burma's military State 
Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), on Burma's 
Independence Day on Feb 4. Following their arrest, Thai 
authorities have tightened enforcement of laws to try to control 
the large number of Burmese illegally in Thailand. The move has 
been criticized by the international community over the human 
rights issue. 
  Sun Naign was previously arrested and imprisoned in 1989 
after he and another Burmese student hijacked a Thai Airways 
International flight from Rangoon to U-Taphao, in an action he 
said was to raise international awareness of the suppression of 
the democracy movement in Burma.

  [Text] The Thai-Cambodian `Caravan for Friendship' was 
turned back by Cambodian officials yesterday shortly after it 
was allowed to enter Cambodia, and the tour was eventually 
cancelled. 
  The caravan began moving into Cambodia at 1 p.m. after a 
day's delay caused by Cambodian officials refusing to let the 
caravan enter the country. The delay caused 11 cars to pull out 
of the tour to Angkor Wat. But when the caravan of 61 cars 
carrying 191 passengers arrived at a roadblock on Highway 5 
about four kilometers from the border, it was stopped by 
Cambodian officials who told all the Thai motorists to remove 
the Thai-Cambodian Caravan for Friendship stickers from their 
cars. 
  Cambodian officials, who offered no explanation, refused to 
let the caravan go further. The disappointed participants 
delegated representatives to file complaints with the district 
police against the organizer of the trip, Mrs. Prakaimat Wiara 
of the Goodtimes Entertainment Company. 
  Cambodian government forces were yesterday engaged in a 
fierce artillery and mortar duel with Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
near the Thai border yesterday. Thai military sources said the 
fighting, which lasted about four hours, caused Thai villagers 
living in Ban Khok Sabaeng to take cover in bunkers. Stray 
shells overshot and landed in uninhabited Thai territory. None 
of the Ban Khok Sabaeng villagers was injured. It was the most 
intense fighting since a lull began late last month, sources 
said. 
  Border patrol police sources said about 40 Khmer villagers, 
mostly children, fled into Thailand. Three were wounded and had 
to be taken to the district hospital. One of the three, Mrs. 
Pol Li, 29, said that before the artillery duel took place, a 
group of about 30 armed bandits believed to be Khmer Rouge 
surrounded their village and ransacked 15 houses. They later 
clashed with Cambodian government police at the village. A 
policeman and a civilian were killed in the clashes, Mrs. Pol Li 
said. A woman is missing and is believed killed.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 25 KYODO -- President Bill Clinton 
Friday [25 February] applauded the congressional move to impose 
U.S.-set import targets on Japan, saying it represents "the 
determination of the American people" to open Japanese markets. 
  Clinton was commenting on a new trade bill sponsored by 
House 
majority leader Richard Gephardt that requires the U.S. 
Government to retaliate against Japan unless it meets specific 
U.S.-set import targets. "I think that it shows the 
determination of the American people to improve our trade and to 
open the markets (in Japan)," Clinton said at a news conference. 
  Clinton singled out in particular the involvement of Sen. 
John Rockefeller of West Virginia in the proposed legislation as 
he gave tacit endorsement to the Gephardt-Rockefeller bill. 
  Rockefeller, a second-term Democrat who has had extensive 
contact with Japan, joined Gephardt Thursday in sponsoring the 
"fair market access" and blasted the Japanese Government for 
"locking out" American products and services in the Japanese 
market. Rockefeller "understands what is at stake here," 
Clinton said, noting that the Democrat senator "has actually 
lived in Japan and, I think, is thought of genuinely as a friend 
of Japan." 
  Rockefeller spent three years in Tokyo from 1957 to 1960 as 
a 
student at the International Christian University. 
  Clinton, however, stayed short of giving outright support to 
the Gephardt-Rockefeller bill, asserting that "we've taken no 
position on any particular legislation." The bill, which 
received support from both Democratic and Republican 
legislators, requires the Commerce Department to define 
"objective criteria" for what the U.S. feels would be a "fair" 
market share in Japan for U.S. products, using the competitive 
position of U.S. firms in other developed markets as a benchmark. 
  Japan will be subject to U.S. sanctions under provisions of 
the legislation if it fails to meet the U.S.-set targets. 
  Gephardt said the proposed legislation was in support of 
Clinton's efforts to open Japanese markets through the framework 
trade talks, which collapsed on February 11 over U.S. demands to 
set import goals in Japan. 
  Tokyo has since moved to defuse the growing friction with 
Washington, with the coalition government of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa pledging Friday to compile a "voluntary" 
market-opening package by the end of March. The Tokyo decision, 
announced by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, drew a 
cautious response in Washington. 
  White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the Clinton 
administration has no information about the details of the 
proposed market-opening program. "We look forward to the 
details of the proposal," Myers told reporters. 
  The plan includes encouraging imports and foreign investment 
in Japan, easing government regulations and procedures involved 
in government purchases and spurring competitive policies, 
Japanese officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- A senior Japanese trade 
official on Monday [28 February] rejected U.S. claims that 
Japan's markets are closed as "erroneous." 
  The difficulty of U.S. and European access to Japanese 
markets does not reflect the "peculiarity" of the Japanese 
market as widely argued, said Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice 
international trade and industry minister for international 
affairs. The trade imbalance between Japan and the United 
States, for example, is more the result of differences in supply 
and demand structures in each country than of the allegedly 
closed nature of the Japanese market, Okamatsu said in a speech 
at the Japan National Press Club. 
  He also said that trade among European Union (EU) nations 
should be classified as domestic rather than international trade 
in view of the integrated nature of their economic relations. 
The ratio of imported products consumed in the EU, currently at 
18.1 percent, would be only 4.9 percent if intrabloc trade was 
treated as domestic based on this concept, Okamatsu said, noting 
the figure is close to the 3.4 percent import ratio for Japan. 
  Okamatsu also dismissed U.S. claims that Japan's auto market 
is closed to U.S.-made automobiles by pointing out that until 
recently U.S. automakers did not sell a single right-hand drive 
car in the Japanese market where such cars command a 98 percent 
share. 
  A lower import share for a particular product does not mean 
that the country's market for the product is closed, he said, 
noting the U.S. aircraft industry, with almost no import record, 
is not branded as exclusive. 
  Any country with product competitiveness in a certain area 
tends to score a trade surplus in that area, he said, adding 
that the U.S. has much black ink with Japan in globally 
competitive service sectors. 
  Okamatsu, the chief negotiator in the recently collapsed 
Japan-U.S. trade framework talks, said the U.S. demand for Tokyo 
to set numerical trade targets is based on an erroneous 
evaluation of Japan's trade situation. 
  Japan adamantly rejects such targets in order to prevent the 
idea of managed trade from "spilling over into the global trade 
arena" in defiance of free trade rules under the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said. 
  Okamatsu said Japan will not repeat "the painful experience" 
it had following its semiconductor accord with Washington, which 
he claimed developed into a political issue after Tokyo failed 
to achieve "nonbinding expectations" of a 20 percent foreign 
market share in the Japanese chip market. 
  Tokyo will never sign an accord that "has a possibility of 
leaving trouble in the future," he said. But he added it might 
be better to map out an import plan on an individual and 
voluntary basis. 
  Okamatsu said it is "impossible" for the Japanese auto 
industry to extend its plan to expand purchases of U.S. 
components in 1995 and beyond, in view of the severity of the 
industry's slump. 
  The plan worked out by Japanese carmakers during then U.S. 
President George Bush's visit to Japan in 1993 called for an 
average annual growth of a sharp 20 percent in parts purchases 
from 1990 to 1994, Okamatsu said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa ordered government and ruling party leaders Monday to 
move up the implementation of voluntary market opening measures 
aimed at reducing Japan's bloated trade surplus, officials said. 
The officials said Hosokawa told a high-level meeting of the 
government and ruling coalition parties it is too late for Japan 
to work out such measures by the end of March. 
  Hosokawa told the session U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo March 9 while 
Washington will decide on March 17 whether to impose sanctions 
against Japan over a mobile telephone issue, the officials said. 
  Hosokawa predicted that U.S. President Bill Clinton will 
almost certainly reinstate Super 301, which allows Washington to 
impose sanctions against countries with unfair trade practices, 
ahead of off-year elections in November, they said. 
  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said 
Japan will bring the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade if the United States invokes Super 301.

  [Text] Frankfurt, Feb. 26 KYODO -- Japanese Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen discussed Japan's efforts to prop up its faltering 
economy and slim its colossal current-account surplus, a U.S. 
Government source said Saturday. 
  The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 
bilateral talks dealt with Tokyo's plans to further deregulate 
its markets and open them up to more foreign competition. 
  The United States is "very concerned" about Japan's actions 
to stimulate domestic demand and liberalize the market, the 
source said. 
  A Japanese official, meanwhile, said Fujii briefed Bentsen 
on 
the latest pump-primer that totals 15.25 trillion yen and said 
the 6 trillion yen tax reduction envisaged by the package is 
"but a first step toward a more full-fledged tax reduction in 
the future." 
  The talks, which will be followed by a meeting of finance 
officials from the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers here, 
mark the first ministerial-level bilateral talks between Japan 
and the U.S. since the "framework" trade talks broke down 
earlier this month. 
  The collapse of the framework talks, meant to reduce Japan's 
chronic current-account surplus with the U.S. that totaled 60 
billion dollars last year, has led to a series of tough trade 
actions taken by Washington in recent days. 
  A few days after the February 11 summit meeting between 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, Washington announced plans to impose sanctions on 
Japan for what it perceives as limited access for foreigners to 
Japan's cellular phone market. 
  In a bid to head off a U.S. trade tit-for-tat, the Japanese 
Government has started compiling voluntary plans to liberalize 
the market. The plans are scheduled to be unveiled in March.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- Japanese Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii claimed Sunday that Tokyo has won support from 
other Group of Seven (G-7) nations on its measures to boost 
domestic demand and open markets. 
  The largest-ever 15.25 trillion yen pump-primer unveiled 
earlier this month and a market-opening package scheduled to be 
announced in March have drawn much attention from other members 
of the G-7 club, Fujii told a news conference. Financial 
officials from these countries placed high expectations that the 
measures will help reduce Japan's swollen current account 
surplus, Fujii added. 
  He also said Tokyo has been able to secure G-7 cooperation 
in 
preventing excessive fluctuations in currency rates. 
  Fujii flew back from Frankfurt, Germany, where he attended a 
meeting Saturday of top finance officials from the seven leading 
economic powers. 
  Referring to talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen 
held prior to the G-7 gathering, Fujii said Bentsen listened "in 
real earnest" to his explanation on the latest Japanese tax cut 
plan designed to boost personal consumption. 
  Fujii said the media coverage so far made on the six other 
G-7 nations' assessment of the Japanese stimulus package does 
not accurately reflect "the real atmosphere" of the meeting. 
  The remark apparently shows his frustration over a barrage 
of 
newspaper reports that Japan was criticized by its G-7 partners 
in the Frankfurt suburb meeting for failing to make sufficient 
efforts to boost domestic demand and cut its huge current 
account surplus. 
  Reports also said Japan, despite Fujii's claim first made in 
his news conference immediately after the G-7 meeting, was not 
able to obtain firm G-7 commitment for taking 
currency-stabilizing measures following the yen's renewed surge 
against major currencies. 
  Finance ministers and central bank governors from Britain, 
Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United States appeared to 
have "a positive impression" of the latest pump-priming package, 
Fujii said. 
  He also said the G-7 club's shared stance against 
"speculative currency moves that may lead to the yen's rapid 
appreciation against the dollar" was well echoed in press 
remarks made by German Finance Minister Theo Waigel. Summing up 
the latest G-7 meeting as its Chairman, Waigel stressed the 
continuation among the seven countries of a process in which 
they have taken "appropriate" steps to arrest rapid currency 
rate movements, Fujii said. But Fujii withheld comment on 
whether or not the G-7 has agreed to refrain from currency rate 
manipulation. 
  The yen surged more than 6 yen against the dollar on 
speculation over U.S. comments tolerating a stronger yen, which 
were widely viewed as manipulation designed to guide the 
Japanese currency higher following the February 11 collapse in 
Japan-U.S. trade talks. 
  Fujii dismissed as groundless reports that Japan had been 
isolated from other G-7 partners in their latest meeting. News 
conferences held by each G-7 country clearly showed "what was 
the reality," he said. 
  Fujii said during his meeting with Bentsen he tried to wipe 
out "U.S. misunderstanding" that the 5.85 trillion yen tax cut 
envisioned in the stimulus package is a single-year scheme. The 
finance minister said he told Bentsen the tax cut is "a first 
step toward a more full-fledged tax reform expected to be worked 
out by the end of this year." 
  Fujii also said he briefed Bentsen on the recently 
inaugurated coalition council which he said is working toward a 
full-scale tax reform in line with the fiscal 1994 tax reform 
guideline. But Fujii refrained from saying whether or not 
Bentsen was convinced by his explanation. 
  Fujii said Japan is not considering formulating another 
economic package for now. He voiced hope the February 8 package 
will become a final one by pulling the Japanese economy out of 
its long slump.

  [Text] Frankfurt, Feb. 27 KYODO -- Russia got a warm pat 
on the back from seven leading economic powers Saturday [26 
February], while Japan largely got the cold shoulder from its 
Group of Seven (G-7) partners. 
  Meeting at a resort hotel in the Frankfurt suburb of 
Kronberg, G- 7 finance ministers and central bankers reaffirmed 
their support for aid to Moscow and for its economic reform 
efforts, while belittling Tokyo's attempts to curb its huge 
trade surplus. 
  Touting President Boris Yeltsin's efforts to tame inflation 
and privatize the behemoth Russian economy, and flush with their 
diplomatic moves to end the siege of Sarajevo, the Moscow 
visitors sought a seat at the global economic table from the G-7. 
  They were not disappointed. 
  The tone was signaled by a statement from the meeting's 
chairman, Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany, a country 
with close ties to the former Soviet Union. The conference 
closed with the G-7 agreeing to fully implement its 
comprehensive 43 billion dollar Russian aid plans, according to 
the statement. 
  But Japan, with the world's second biggest economy -- and 
the 
only trade surplus among the G-7 -- was told to do more to boost 
domestic demand and reduce its swollen current account 
imbalance, while not even getting a strong call for currency 
market stability. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii headed to Germany to 
reexplain Japan's recent 15 trillion yen pump-priming package, 
with its 6 trillion yen in tax cuts. He and bank of Japan 
Governor Yasushi Mieno sought reaffirmation that the G-7 frowns 
on the currency gyrations that again sent the yen soaring 
against the dollar this month after Japan-U.S. Trade talks 
foundered. 
  The G-7 welcomed Moscow's assurances of continued reform, 
reaffirmed the group's commitment to full implementation of 
support measures agreed to in Tokyo in April and July, urged 
Russia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to agree 
quickly on a loan accord and expressed a willingness to support 
a substantial new Russian debt rescheduling. 
  Japan apparently got little overt help from its G-7 
partners, 
which also include Britain, Canada, France and Italy. Also in 
Frankfurt were representatives from Moscow and the European 
Union. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Tokyo should "put 
in place a substantial and effective program to strengthen 
domestic demand, reduce its large trade surplus and open its 
markets" 
  The chairman's statement lacks the reaffirmation that Japan 
sought of the G-7's formulaic call for exchange rates to reflect 
economic fundamentals and against erratic currency movements. 
  Bentsen said currency issues got little attention at the G-7 
meeting or in his preceding talks with Fujii. 
  The yen surged after fruitless trade talks between President 
Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington 
on February 11 as currency dealers anticipated pressure from 
U.S. authorities for a higher yen, which hobbles Japan's 
export-reliant economy and theoretically blunts its trade 
surplus by pricing Japanese exports out of foreign markets. 
  U.S. officials have denied any intention to toy with the 
foreign exchange market, but the G-7 skirted exchange rate 
comments and focused more blandly on general cooperation. 
  Still, Fujii fell back on what he called the G-7's "long 
history of taking appropriate measures on rapid movements in 
currency rates with monetary authorities contacting each other." 
He told a press conference that Waigel "emphasized the 
continuation of this process." 
  Central banker Mieno, who has repeatedly said that no clear 
signs of a Japanese economic recovery have appeared, said global 
improvements since the last G-7 meeting in September will have 
"favorable effects on Japan." But Japan's economic stimulus 
steps, already labeled skimpy by Washington, received less than 
warm praise Saturday from the IMF, which said the package will 
have limited effect on Tokyo's current account surplus. 
  AP-Dow Jones said Managing Director Michel Camdessus 
presented an IMF report predicting that the surplus will dip to 
130.3 billion dollars this year from 131.4 billion dollars in 
1993, but then rise to 131.1 billion dollars in 1995, 140.9 
billion dollars in 1996 and ease to 140.0 billion dollars in 
1997. 
  The report suggests that Japan's black ink with the world 
would differ little from those expectations, even without the 
15.25 trillion yen pump-primer, AP-DJ said. 
  Some 5.4 trillion yen of the stimulus package -- such as 
land 
purchases for public works projects and housing and 
small-enterprise loans -- will not directly spur the economy, 
the IMF report says. 
  It says the package will nudge Japan's economy above what 
would have been no real growth this year but have minimal impact 
after that, with 1995 growth of 2.3 percent next year with or 
without the package. 
  Indeed, without the package, the report charges, Japan's 
1996 
growth would have been 0.6 percentage point more than the 
predicted 4.0 percent, while 1997 will see 5.0 percent growth 
either way. 
  Concerns also surfaced at the G-7 meeting over lack of 
Russian progress in stabilizing its economy, with the finance 
leaders urging Moscow to act to curb its fiscal deficit and 
inflation and promote credit creation.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata will likely visit Marrakech, 
Morocco, in April to sign a new global trade accord under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), ministry sources 
said Sunday [27 February]. 
  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai 
may 
also participate in a signing ceremony, the sources said. 
  The ceremony will take place from April 12 to 15, with 
representatives from the 118 signatory countries of the 
Geneva-based GATT and the European Union [EU] taking part, the 
sources said. 
  During his stay there, Hata is expected to make a speech and 
meet with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and other 
cabinet ministers of major Japanese trading partners. 
  The discussions are likely to center on Japan's fresh 
measures to boost imports the government of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa is planning to adopt soon. 
  Japan's current account surplus reached a record 130 billion 
dollars last year, the main factor behind its trade disputes 
with the United States and Europe. 
  On April 14, the sources said, participants at the ceremony 
will affix signatures to Uruguay Round agreements on 
agriculture, the mining and manufacturing sector, services, 
intellectual properties and the setting up of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), a successor to GATT. 
  These pacts are likely to take effect next January when the 
WTO is to be inaugurated, they said. 
  At the final session of the Uruguay Round trade talks, 
representatives from the 118 countries and the EU may adopt a 
declaration calling for freer global trade, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- The Bank of Japan (BOJ) sees 
no big impact on the currency market but some market dealers 
expect the yen to rise next week after no clear affirmation for 
stable rates at the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting, BOJ and 
currency market sources said Sunday. 
  Finance ministers and central bankers of the G-7 leading 
nations failed to produce a clear affirmation at their meeting 
in Germany Saturday of their past accord on stable currency 
rates reflecting economic fundamentals. 
  "This has been already factored in by the currency market, 
and is unlikely to have a big impact on the yen rate," said a 
central bank source. 
  But a market dealer said, "a stronger yen is expected next 
week as the U.S. side reiterated its hard-line stance" at a 
meeting between Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and 
U.S. Secretary Treasury Lloyd Bentsen. 
  "Speculations over the U.S. guiding the yen higher to solve 
the deadlocked issue of trade imbalance is receding," the BOJ 
source said. "A wild gyration is unlikely although the G-7 
failed to make an accord on stable currency rates." 
  Fujii reportedly called for reaffirmation of a past G-7 
accord favoring stable currency rates reflecting economic 
fundamentals, but U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and 
other finance ministers said currency issue was not discussed 
much at the G-7 meeting. 
  Bentsen told a press meeting in Germany that Japan must "put 
in place a substantial and effective program to strengthen 
domestic demand, reduce its large trade surplus and open its 
markets." 
  Meanwhile, the central bank maintained its cautious stance 
over a further cut in the official discount rate as Japan's 
stimulus action. 
  Speaking at a press meeting in Germany, BOJ Governor Yasushi 
Mieno stressed that the discount rate is at the "record-low 
level" of 1.75 percent. 
  With Japan's long-term rates already turning higher, the BOJ 
source said that effects of a discount rate cut on the economy 
will be limited.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno indicated Sunday Japan's monetary policy will stay 
on hold at least for now, noting interest rates are currently 
low enough to rev up the stagnant economy. Mieno gave the hint 
at a news conference held upon returning home from Frankfurt 
where he represented Japan at a meeting of top financial 
officials from the Group of Seven industrialized countries on 
Saturday, along with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. 
  The central bank cut its discount rate to a record low 1.75 
percent per annum last September. Mieno said the central bank 
will "keep a close eye on the effect of past rate cuts" for the 
time being. 
  Mieno said exchange rates had not loomed large at the G-7 
gathering but he quickly added the G-7 countries had reconfirmed 
the need for continued cooperation in currency and other 
questions. 
  The yen has soared against the dollar in the wake of the 
collapse of a February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton on trade issues. The 
current yen-dollar levels had not been taken up at a meeting of 
Fujii and his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Bentsen, which took place 
just before the G-7 meeting, Mieno said. 
  "The currency levels should be determined by market force 
and 
should not be manipulated," Mieno said. 
  Asked about press reports that Fujii had told the G-7 
meeting 
that the yen's rapid appreciation in value puts a damper on 
Japan's economic recovery, Mieno said the view seems to have 
been understood by financial officials from other industrialized 
countries although no clear-cut responses had been expressed. 
He also said other G-7 countries had expressed strong hope for 
Japan's economic comeback but had not sought any change in its 
monetary policy.

  "We are concerned," Kumano told reporters while commenting

industrialized nations. 
  Kumano said Japan's policy stance that its trade surplus 
should be slashed through expansion of domestic demand instead 
of foreign exchange adjustments was understood at the group's 
meeting. 
  The representatives from Germany and Italy supported Japan's 
appeal for a stable foreign exchange market, he said.

  Zhu predicted China's economy will grow at an annual rate of 
8 to 9 percent, with the inflation rate held to less than 10 
percent, the officials said.

  [Text] Osaka, Feb. 28 KYODO -- China is to liberalize 
price controls on coal and petroleum this year as part of 
efforts to switch to a market-oriented economy, Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji said Monday [28 February]. Zhu, who is in Japan on a 
nine-day visit, disclosed the plan at his meeting with heads of 
firms with business relations with Sanwa Bank, officials of the 
Osaka-based bank said. 
  Zhu, who is also head of the People's Bank of Japan, the 
central bank, added, however, that prices of farm products will 
be raised to encourage farmers. "All steps are in line with 
price reforms to create market-driven economy, which will be 
completed by the end of this year," he said. 
  He admitted that leaving prices to market forces would lead 
to double-digit inflation this year, but said inflation will 
slow to single figures next year. 
  Zhu is to leave Japan on Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria Trujillo said Tuesday [as received] his country wants to 
join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the 
future, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Gaviria, who arrived in Japan on Saturday for a five-day 
visit, expressed interest in joining APEC at a meeting with 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the officials said. 
  Gaviria also said he wants Japan to become a "bridge" in 
strengthening ties between Colombia and the Asia-Pacific region, 
they said. 
  Hosokawa told Gaviria Japan welcomes the strengthening of 
ties between Colombia and the Asia-Pacific region and that he 
thinks bilateral ties between Colombia and Japan will increase. 
  In the November APEC meeting in Seattle, Mexico and Papua 
New 
Guinea won membership to the forum, while Chile was named to 
become a member this year. The group froze further membership 
applications through 1996, however. 
  Ministry officials said Japan will take into account 
Colombia's bid and will convey the intention to other members of 
APEC. 
  Also during the 20-minute meeting at the prime minister's 
official residence, Hosokawa told Gaviria Japan has decided to 
extend yen loans to Colombia for an agricultural development 
project along the Ariari River, the officials said. 
  Japanese and Colombian officials are currently negotiating 
the amount of the loans, they said. 
  Hosokawa said Japan is considering sending a mission to 
Colombia within fiscal 1994 to study participation in a project 
to improve the traffic network in the capital city of Bogota. 
  Japan will also extend a cultural grant-in-aid of 45 million 
yen to Bolivar Memorial Museum for its purchases of audiovisual 
equipment, Hosokawa said. 
  Turning to economic relations, Gaviria urged Japan to import 
tropical fruits from Colombia and to have cut flowers 
quarantined in Colombia before exporting them to Japan, the 
officials said. 
  He also said Colombia wants to export coal and petrol in the 
future. 
  Japanese ambassador to Colombia Masaki Yagi, who accompanied 
Hosokawa in the meeting, said the matters concerning tropical 
fruits and cut flowers should be discussed when Colombia's 
agricultural minister visits Japan in April and that the coal 
and petrol issues should be discussed among the private sector.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan welcomed Monday [28 
February] the scheduled resumption of international inspections 
of North Korea's nuclear sites Tuesday but called on Pyongyang 
for further efforts to dispel allegations that it is developing 
nuclear weapons. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a 
press conference Japan welcomes the scheduled inspections of 
North Korea's declared nuclear facilities by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following an accord between 
Pyongyang and Washington last weekend. 
  Saito said the focal point now lies on whether the 
inspections, slated to begin Tuesday, will be fully carried out, 
whether North Korea "seriously" engages in dialogue with South 
Korea, and as a result, whether a third round of talks will 
resume between North Korea and the United States. 
  More important, he said, is to seek a drastic solution to 
North Korea's nuclear problem through Pyongyang's complete 
return to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), 
implementation of special inspections of its nuclear sites and 
carrying out a joint declaration with Seoul to denuclearize the 
Korean peninsula. 
  "We strongly expect North Korea to take positive measures to 
achieve that," Saito said. 
  Japan also welcomes the U.S. initiative leading up to now, 
Saito said. Tokyo will continue to maintain close contact with 
Washington, Seoul and other related countries and make efforts 
toward solutions to the problem, he said. 
  An IAEA inspection team left Vienna Sunday to inspect seven 
declared nuclear sites in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of 
Pyongyang. The seven-member group is expected to arrive in 
Pyongyang Tuesday. 
  But so far, North Korea has rejected pressure to allow 
inspections of two other undeclared sites at the nuclear complex 
that are suspected of being part of a nuclear weapons project. 
  The inspection will be the first in more than a year by the 
IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog. 
  North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear 
facilities in 1992, but threatened to withdraw from the NPT last 
March when pressed to open to checks of the two undeclared 
facilities.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata urged North Korea on Monday to take further steps to clear 
itself of allegations of covertly developing nuclear weapons, a 
government spokesman said. 
  Hata did not specify any actions, but he predicted that 
international pressure would mount on North Korea to open two 
undeclared nuclear sites to inspection, Deputy Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Yukio Hatoyama told a news conference. 
  Hata, speaking at a meeting of government and ruling 
coalition leaders, also said North Korea's decision to grant 
visas to international inspectors has helped ease international 
concern about its nuclear program, Hatoyama said. 
  An inspection team of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) left Vienna on Sunday to inspect seven declared nuclear 
sites in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. 
  But so far North Korea has rejected pressure to allow 
inspections of two other sites at the nuclear complex that are 
suspected of playing a role in an alleged nuclear bomb project. 
  North Korea issued visas to the seven-member inspection team 
Saturday after Pyonyang and Washington reached an accord on U.S. 
suspension of joint military exercises with South Korea. 
  The inspectors are expected to arrive in Pyongyang on 
Tuesday. 
  The inspection will be the first in more than a year by the 
IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog. 
  North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear 
facilities in 1992, but threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty last March when pressed to open to

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan urged Israel on 
Monday [28 February] to do its utmost to investigate last week's 
massacre of Palestinians in Hebron and take measures to prevent 
such occurrences in the future, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko 
Saito said. He said Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda 
met with Israeli Ambassador to Japan Amos Ganor at the Foreign 
Ministry and reiterated a statement issued Saturday by ministry 
spokesman Terusuke Terada. 
  Fukuda urged Israel to take measures to help ensure the 
creation of a trusting relationship with the Palestinians, Saito 
said. 
  The Japanese Government will also convey the statement to 
the 
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Governments of 
Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and tell them of the meeting between 
Fukuda and the Israeli ambassador, he said. 
  As many as 39 Muslim worshipers were killed and many more 
wounded when a Jewish settler armed with an automatic weapon 
entered the West Bank mosque on Friday and opened fire. 
  The ministry spokesman's statement said Japan "strongly 
condemns" the act of violence and hopes it will not have a 
negative effect on the current negotiations between Israel and 
the Palestinians over the withdrawal of Israeli military forces 
from Gaza and Jerico. It also said Tokyo strongly hopes that 
despite the massacre, not only those parties directly involved 
in negotiations but all Israelis and Palestinians will exercise 
restraint and continue to work toward peace.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- The Japanese Red Army, a 
radical group based in Lebanon's Bekka Valley, has sent a 
document explaining their operations to supporters in Japan and 
calling for more support, sources familar with the group said 
Saturday. 
  The document, titled "Let's Become Guerrilla Warriors," tell 
in detail about how the extremist group spend their daily lives 
and engage in training as guerrillas. The document is about 
140,000 words long. 
  The document was likely written before an agreement last 
September between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) on Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied 
territories. 
  The Red Army has been working under the Popular Front for 
the 
Liberation of Palestine, a more militant arm of the PLO. 
  The paper describes the group's military training and daily 
lives in camps where they said they can watch international 
satellite news programs such as Cable News Network. 
  They wake up at 6:00 A.M. and go to bed at 10:00 P.M. and 
when there is a holiday or a member has a birthday they make 
Japanese traditional foods such as rice balls and 
"kamaage-udon," the document said. 
  The extremists, always carrying handguns and wearing 
military 
uniforms mainly made in South Korea, live in block-like huts in 
the summer and winter and live in tents the rest of the year. 
  The group calls for more support from Japan, saying "the day 
will come when the world will be united as one. It depends on 
us, and your way of life and strife." 
  Japanese authorities, noting there is a plan by supporters 
in 
Japan to publish the document as a book, said the paper was 
written in a more gentle manner than previously done and that 
the group aims to appeal to a larger audience. 
  The Red Army, formed in 1971, was responsible for a series 
of 
hijackings and armed attacks in the 1970s, including the 1972 
massacre at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- Japan's 47 prefectural 
governments are expected to start supplying special 
standard-price rice, composed entirely of imported rice, in 
March to secure a stable supply of the staple food, according to 
results of a survey released Saturday [26 February]. 
  Of all of the prefectural governments, 46 have already 
decided to start supplying the rice, with the sole exception of 
Chiba Prefecture which is expected to make a similar decision 
Monday, the KYODO NEWS SERVICE questionnaire showed. 
  The survey also showed that the supply of such rice to 
consumers will lead to uniform rice prices across the nation and 
a 30 percent price fall from current levels. 
  Responding to the survey, local governments said they have 
no 
choice but to provide imported rice as special standard-price 
rice so as to ensure a stable rice supply following the worst 
postwar harvest last year. 
  The survey found that in almost all prefectures such rice 
will consist of 60 percent U.S. rice, 20 percent Chinese rice 
and the remaining 20 percent Thai rice. 
  The rice will be priced at 316 yen per kilogram, including a 
3 percent consumption tax. 
  The Food Agency had instructed prefectural governments to 
start supplying special standard-price rice from March in the 
form of either 100 percent imported rice or a blend of 70 
percent imported rice and 30 percent domestically produced rice.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0045 GMT on 20 February in its "Discussion" program 
carries a 15-minute live interview with Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] General Secretary Wataru Kubo on the cabinet 
reshuffle being planned by Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
Interviewers are NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and Tokyo 
University professor Takeshi Sasaki. 
  Asked about the SDPJ's position on Prime Minister 
Hosokawa-proposed cabinet reshuffle, Kubo says: "We believe the 
cabinet reshuffle should not be carried out if it weakens the 
centripetal force of the ruling parties. Therefore, it would be 
best not to reshuffle the cabinet during the current, crucial 
period in which the Diet is being held." 
  He adds: "I know the prime minister has the arbitrary power 
to reshuffle the cabinet. However, as we are a coalition 
government, he should get the full understanding of the 
coalition partners. As members of the coalition government, we 
are seriously concerned about the possibility the cabinet 
reshuffle will produce negative results." 
  Citing rumors the purpose of the cabinet reshuffle is to 
replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, Yamamoto asks for 
Kubo's view. 
  Kubo says: "If a cabinet reshuffle is done simply to change 
certain ministers, it should not be termed a cabinet reshuffle." 
  He adds: "I do not think the cabinet should be reshuffled if 
the purpose is just to remove certain ministers, and it is not a 
good idea to carry out a reshuffle at present because Diet 
deliberations on the supplementary budget are about to begin." 
  He says any reshuffle should be carried out after the 
immediate political issues have been solved. 
  Kubo is asked about current relations between Prime Minister 
Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura. He says their 
relations are not as bad as reported. 
  He says: "We cannot do anything about it if the prime 
minister decides to reshuffle the cabinet because it is needed 
to keep the ruling parties united, or if he believes that unless 
there is a reshuffle, it will be difficult to deal with the 
current ordinary Diet session and the many important political 
issues." 
  He is asked how the party will respond when its chairman, 
Murayama, is asked by the prime minister to join the cabinet as 
minister in charge of political reform in place of minister 
Yamahana, who is an SDPJ member? 
  Kubo says: "It's up to the chairman." 
  Yamamoto takes up the issue of political realignment and 
asks 
if the SDPJ has agreed with Sakigake and the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] to create a new political force. Kubo 
denies this, saying there is no behind-the-scenes agreement. 
  He also asks Kubo about the next general election, which 
will 
be held under the new electoral system. 
  Kubo says: "I think the ruling parties have to cooperate 
with each other as much as possible in the election. There is a 
feeling that the ruling parties should be unified into one party 
to win the election. I do not think it is right." 
  He says he feels it is impossible for the ruling parties to 
become one because of their differences in political ideals. He 
suggests, though, that Japan may enter an era in which 
politicians are divided into new conservatives and new 
reformists. 
  He is asked if it is inevitable that the SDPJ will split in 
the process of promoting realignment in the political world. 
Kubo says it is impossible to get along with party members who 
are negative about being part of the coalition government. 
  At 0115 GMT the interview ends.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0003 GMT on 20 February in its 75-minute-long 
"Discussion" program, which begins at 0000 GMT, carries a 
27-minute live interview with Komeito General Secretary Yuichi 
Ichikawa on the cabinet reshuffle Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa is said to be planning. The interview is conducted by 
NHK commentator Takashi Tamamoto and Tokyo University Professor 
Takeshi Sasaki. 
  Tamamoto first asks Ichikawa for his view on why Hosokawa is 
thinking of a cabinet reshuffle now. 
  Ichikawa says: "One reason is that with such major questions 
as the rice market, political reform, tax reductions and tax 
system reform, and budget formulation having been taken care of, 
the government thinks it has cleared a big hurdle. Another is 
the relationship between the top leader -- the prime minister -- 
and the chief cabinet secretary -- his housekeeper or assistant. 
Of course they are likely to have differences of view, they are 
only human. But if these differences are intentionally brought 
to the attention of the public, it causes friction within the 
government and the ruling coalition. The prime minister wants 
to bring unity -- or centrifugal power -- into the cabinet now 
that he has surmounted the big hurdle." 
  Ichikawa adds: "But Mr. Takemura is an intellectual man. I 
don't think he will threaten to quit the cabinet if someone else 
becomes chief cabinet secretary." 
  At 0006 GMT, Professor Sasaki says some senior coalition 
politicians doubt the wisdom of implementing a large-scale 
reshuffle with the Diet deliberations on the budget bill set to 
begin soon. He asks Ichikawa to comment on this point of view. 
  Ichikawa says: "I don't think the prime minister is thinking 
about effecting a big-scale reshuffle." 
  He adds: "This is a problem created by Mr. Takemura 
personally." 
  He is then asked if there is any possibility that Sakigake 
[Harbinger] might drop out of the coalition as a result of such 
a reshuffle. Ichikawa answers that it is not a matter over 
which the party should quit the coalition. 
  At 0010 GMT, Tamamoto refers to remarks Ichikawa has made 
that the coalition parties should merge and become a new party. 
He is asked if this is the only way the coalition can retain 
power at the next general election. 
  Ichikawa says: "Unless a new party is formed, there is no 
point in having worked so hard to adopt the new electoral 
system." 
  Tamamoto points out that the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan 
[SDPJ], Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party [SDP] appear 
to be considering a merger without Komeito or Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] and asks Ichikawa to comment. 
  Ichikawa says it is important for the SDPJ to decide its 
basic stand on policy on such matters as national security. He 
says it is meaningless to talk about forming a new party until 
such basic policy matters are decided. Once the policy matters 
are decided, however, he says they can be discussed within the 
framework of a new party combining all coalition partners. 
  At 0016 GMT, the moderator turns to rumors Komeito may 
cooperate with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] at the next 
general election. Ichikawa says: "We are not thinking about 
cooperating with the LDP." 
  At 0019 GMT, Tamamoto asks Ichikawa about the timing of any 
cabinet reshuffle. He says: "I would like to think it will be 
sometime after the political reform issues are cleared and 
before the Diet starts to deliberate the budget bills."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- Wataru Kubo, secretary 
general of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan--SDPJ], 
called on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa Saturday [26 
February] to quickly meet with his coalition partners to 
determine if a cabinet reshuffle is necessary. 
  Kubo, appearing on a Fuji Television program, reiterated his 
opposition to a cabinet reshuffle designed to remove specific 
ministers, alluding to a reported move by Hosokawa and Shinseito 
co- leader Ichiro Ozawa to dump Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Hosokawa and his supporters in the seven-party coalition 
have 
differences with Takemura over Hosokawa's plan to introduce a 
so- called "national welfare tax" to replace the consumption 
tax, the future of Japanese politics and other key issues, 
political sources say. 
  Kubo said the SDP, the largest force in the seven-party 
coalition, is against a cabinet reshuffle before the start of 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget program but that it will 
not part with the coalition government in protest against a 
cabinet shake-up.

  [Text] Matsumoto, Nagano Pref., Feb. 27 KYODO -- 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader and Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata urged Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Sunday 
[27 February] to swiftly reshuffle his cabinet if he really 
thinks it necessary. "It is a problem for us to continue 
lengthy discussions like this," Hata said, referring to 
Hosokawa's planned reshuffle expected to center on removing 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from that post. 
  Hata, also deputy prime minister, was speaking at a press 
conference in Matsumoto, central Japan, near his electoral 
constituency. 
  "It should be done as early as possible if Prime Minister 
Hosokawa judges it necessary at any cost," said Hata, head of 
Shinseito (Japan renewal party), a key ruling party that along 
with the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party] 
supports a cabinet shake-up. 
  Hosokawa's shake-up plan has hit a snag since early 
February, 
facing opposition from three of the seven ruling coalition 
parties -- the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], 
the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and Sakigake (Harbinger). 
  Hata's remarks came amid worries in the coalition that a 
prolonged crack over a reshuffle might adversely affect 
government efforts to address domestic and foreign policy 
matters, particularly a trade friction with the United States, 
coalition sources said. 
  In an earlier speech Sunday, Hata said that politics will 
remain stagnant and that Hosokawa should be brave to move 
"either one, two or 10" cabinet members if necessary. 
  Hata denied an intention of replacing Takemura as chief 
cabinet secretary, saying duties for a party leader and for the 
top government spokesman will necessarily be incompatible. 
  Hata criticized the SDPJ, the DSP and Sakigake for their 
moves toward uniting social democrats and liberals into a joint 
front. "Can we maintain the coalition if we are split into two 
groups?" he asked, noting a new election system for the House of 
Representatives. 
  The next general election is almost certain to be fought 
under the political reform legislation package, enacted last 
month, which introduces 300 single-seat constituencies plus 200 
seats chosen through proportional representation. The present 
511-seat lower house was elected through 129 multiseat districts 
to which two to six seats are allocated. 
  Many mass media surveys have predicted a victory for 
coalition parties against the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) if they are united, but a loss if they separately 
field candidates in the next general election. 
  Shinseito and Komeito, which are considered as the 
coalition's propelling groups, have called for establishing a 
two-party system under the political reform legislation, while 
the SDPJ, DSP and Sakigake oppose an immediate two-party system 
and favor a "moderate multiparty system." 
  Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP), at first voiced 
support for the moderate multiparty system. But earlier this 
month he instructed top JNP aides to consider uniting the seven 
coalition parties into one against the LDP to prepare for the 
next general election. 
  Labor leader Akira Yamagishi, whose Rengo labor organization 
provides the main base of support for the SDPJ and DSP, says he 
expects there will be three main parties in the future -- the 
LDP, a new conservative party, and a nonconservative one.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa intends to continue efforts throughout this week to 
pursue timing for a cabinet reshuffle that is expected to focus 
on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from that 
key post, political sources said Sunday. 
  Hosokawa said Sunday he will deliver a policy speech to the 
Diet probably on March 7 instead of Friday as earlier planned. 
  The remark appeared to mean that the prime minister will 
continue talks on a cabinet shake-up with leaders of seven 
coalition parties by the end of this week. 
  The Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ], the Democratic 
Socialist Party and Takemura's Sakigake, however, remain opposed 
to an early cabinet reshuffle. 
  Takemura, appearing Sunday on NHK-TV's "Political Debate" 
talk show, said he thinks a reshuffle is desirable around two 
months later from now after seeing the fiscal 1994 budget pass 
the Diet around early May. But Takemura said it is finally up 
to the prime minister to decide whether to shake up the cabinet 
and that he will not oppose Hosokawa's decision. 
  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), a core party in the ruling 
coalition, which has pushed for an early cabinet reshuffle, 
indicated having second thoughts on the reshuffle, political 
sources said. 
  On the same NHK-TV program, senior Shinseito official Kozo 
Watanabe said, "it's one idea that the present cabinet should be 
in office until the passage of fiscal 1994 budget through the 
Diet," expected in May. Watanabe, however, reiterated 
Shinseito's position to support Hosokawa if he decides to 
reorganize the nearly seven-month-old cabinet. 
  Shinseito leader and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, speaking 
at a news conference in the central Japan city of Matsumoto, 
Nagano Prefecture, said Hosokawa should swiftly reshuffle the 
cabinet if he really thinks it necessary. "It is a problem for 
us to continue lengthy discussions like this," Hata said. 
  Hata, also deputy prime minister, said, "it should be done 
as 
early as possible if Prime Minister Hosokawa judges it necessary 
at any cost." 
  Meanwhile, a top official of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan (SDP) said Sunday "a cabinet shake-up may be physically 
difficult" because of tight political schedules ahead. The SDPJ 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said "a reshuffle 
cannot be done in one day even if the prime minister wants to do 
so." 
  Hosokawa has said that he may reshuffle the cabinet after 
the 
passage of a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the 
enactment of amendments to political reform legislation. 
  The 2.19 trillion yen extra budget became law on Wednesday, 
while the amended package for political reform laws is expected 
to pass the Diet as early as Thursday. 
  On Friday, the cabinet will submit to the Diet the 73.08 
trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994. Hosokawa and three cabinet 
ministers will give policy speeches to both houses of the 
legislature on March 7. 
  Many sources in the coalition have said the planned cabinet 
shake-up is aimed at removing Takemura from the post of chief 
cabinet secretary which serves as the top government spokesman 
and chief of staff for the prime minister. 
  Since the close of last year, Hosokawa and Takemura have 
differed over several important political themes, first on the 
partial opening of Japan's rice market, then on the handling of 
political reform bills, and on the imposition of a 7 percent 
"national welfare tax" in place of the 3 percent consumption 
tax, political sources said. 
  SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking on "Political 
Debate" and on TV Asahi's "Sunday Project" talk show, called for 
a summit among leaders of the seven ruling parties before 
Hosokawa reshuffles the cabinet. "It is natural to seek 
consensus through talks among the parties to strengthen the 
foundation of the coalition government," Murayama said. 
  The head of the largest party of the coalition reiterated 
that a reshuffle targeted at a specific minister "smells 
something like a power struggle" and that "this is not the time 
to carry out a cabinet reshuffle."

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0000 GMT on 27 February in its weekly 75-minute 
"Discussion" program, carries a 25-minute live interview with 
Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and leader of 
Sakigake, by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and Tsukuba 
University Professor Ikuo Kawashima. 
  Asked by Yamamoto to explain his relations with Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Takemura says recent media reports 
are distorted, exaggerated, and one-sided. He says he is 
maintaining close and friendly ties with the prime minister and 
"there is no discord between us." Takemura admits, however, 
that he has a slightly different view from that of the prime 
minister over the issue of a future merger between the Japan New 
Party [JNP] and Sakigake: "I cannot deny that there is a subtle 
difference of opinion between Mr. Hosokawa, who thinks seriously 
about the future of the political world, and myself, who is 
representative of the new party Sakigake." Takemura says he and 
Hosokawa agreed to have frank discussions in the near future on 
whether or not the two parties should become one, as previously 
announced publically. Asked to comment on the report that the 
aim of the planned cabinet reshuffle is to replace the chief 
cabinet secretary, Takemura says: "The prime minister told me 
the day before yesterday that he is still undecided. He has 
still not determined whether he will reshuffle the cabinet. He 
said he would consult with me first if he decides to do so." 
Takemura adds: "I am determined to resign from my post if the 
prime minister asks me to. I have no intention of clinging to 
the post of chief cabinet secretary." 
  Asked by Kawashima if he will accept an offer to remain in 
the cabinet, Takemura replies that he has still not made up his 
mind. On the possibility of seceding from the coalition, 
Takemura says: "It is unlikely. We will support Prime Minister 
Hosokawa by all means as long as he remains in power." 
  Citing remarks by Komeito's Yuichi Ichikawa on the cause of 
the discord between Takemura and the prime minister, Yamamoto 
asks if there were differences of opinion between them on 
important issues, such as rice and political reform. Takemura 
says he never expressed opposition to the prime minister's 
policies regarding these important issues. Takemura reiterates 
that he fully supports and will continue to support the prime 
minister, saying: "I have never voiced protest against the 
prime minister." 
  Yamamoto then returns to the cabinet reshuffle issue and 
asks 
Takemura if he is against it. Takemura says it is difficult for 
him to comment on this issue because people will think he is 
insisting on remaining in the post of chief cabinet secretary if 
he says he is against a reshuffle. He says he has "no intention 
of opposing the prime minister's final decision at all." 
  Asked to comment on the possible formation of a new 
political 
force involving the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Sakigake, Takemura says 
nothing concrete has been decided nor is there a blue print. 
He says: "Discussions on the formation of a new political 
force have not progressed as yet." He adds: "I merely said 
that it is desirable for political parties or political groups 
that are close to each other, to cooperate in the next 
elections." 
  On the issue of a future merger, Takemura says: "Members of 
the two parties have been maintaining friendly ties. I heard 
they have deepened their relations. There is no need to hurry, 
but I hope we move in a good direction." Asked if Sakigake will 
cooperate with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in upcoming 
elections, Takemura says: "We cannot work with the old LDP. I 
hope the LDP will become a new party soon." 
  Asked what he thinks of Ichiro Ozawa, Takemura says: "As far 
as political reform is concerned, Mr. Ozawa and I share similar 
views. Although our personalities or political styles are 
different, I am sure we can cooperate with each other within the 
framework of the Hosokawa administration." 
  The interview concludes at 0025 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa is considering drastically reshuffling his nearly 
seven-month-old cabinet by the end of the week, political 
sources said Monday [28 February]. 
  Hosokawa's planned reshuffle is expected to center on 
removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from his 
post. The premier is likely to offer Takemura another 
ministerial post, the sources said. 
  The prime minister aims to change a number of ministers in 
his 20-member cabinet in order to tackle economic and 
administrative reform, they said. 
  Hosokawa formed his first cabinet in August to carry out 
political reforms, and he apparently thinks the cabinet will 
have accomplished its purpose when amendments to the political 
reform legislation are approved by the Diet on Thursday or 
Friday, the sources said. The legislation was enacted in 
January. 
  Hosokawa on Tuesday will begin hearing opinions of ruling 
party leaders on his reshuffle plan and he wants to complete the 
shake-up before he delivers his policy speech to the Diet 
probably on Friday, they said. 
  The seven ruling parties have split over Hosokawa's 
reshuffle 
plan, with the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], 
the Democratic Socialist Party and Takemura's Sakigake 
[Harbinger] opposed to dumping Takemura, while Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party] supporting 
the plan. 
  Since the close of last year, Hosokawa and Takemura have 
differed on several important political issues, first on the 
partial opening of Japan's rice market, then on the handling of 
political reform bills, and on the imposition of a 7 percent 
"national welfare tax" in place of the 3 percent consumption 
tax, the sources said. 
  Hosokawa is also likely to abolish the post of state 
minister 
in charge of political reform, now held by the SDPJ's Sadao 
Yamahana, but is considering installing new state ministers in 
charge of decentralization of power, deregulation, and external 
economy, they said. 
  The premier wants to retain Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki 
because the Tokyo district public prosecutors office has been 
investigating a series of bribery scandals involving 
construction companies and politicians, the sources said. 
  Hosokawa will allocate almost the same share of ministerial 
posts to the various coalition parties as they hold in the 
present cabinet, they said. 
  On Friday, the cabinet will submit to the Diet the 73.08 
trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994. Hosokawa and three cabinet 
ministers are expected to give policy speeches to both houses of 
the legislature the same day.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Sunday [27 February] he will deliver a policy 
speech to the Diet probably on March 7 instead of Friday as 
earlier planned. 
  Responding to a reporter's question if the speech will be on

  Hosokawa also said his government is likely to submit the

  The prime minister, foreign minister, finance minister and 
the economic planning agency director general usually give 
speeches in late January at the start of a 150-day ordinary Diet 
session. 
  Hosokawa and the three ministers have yet to deliver the 
speeches to the Diet because of a delay in the compilation of 
the state budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1. 
  The government usually compiles the budget at the year-end 
but this time carried compilation over to February because of 
prolonged deliberations on the political reform package, which 
was enacted in January.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa apologized Monday [28 February] for causing confusion 
over his repeated remarks that he will deliver a policy speech 
to the Diet on March 7. 
  He told reporters he does not know when he will make the 
speech, because the Diet's Steering Committees have the power to 
make the decision. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference that the coalition government will arrange for the 
prime minister to make the speech on Friday. 
  Hosokawa reiterated Sunday that he would make the speech on 
March 7, instead of this Friday as initially scheduled. 
  He said, "the government is scheduled to submit the fiscal 
1994 budget on March 4. It is being argued on the basis of past 
custom that the prime minister should make a policy speech on 
the day when the budget bill is submitted to the Diet." 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic 
Party, said at a news conference that it will be difficult for 
Hosokawa to reshuffle his cabinet prior to parliamentary 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget program if the premier 
delivers his policy speech on Friday.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television in Japanese at 
2230 GMT on 19 February in its "News 2001" program carries a 
live 39-minute interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, general secretary 
of Komeito, by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, 
political commentator Kennichi Takemura, and Keio University 
professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi at the FNN studios. 
  Kuroiwa asks Ichikawa about a realignment of the political 
parties and a cabinet reshuffle. Ichikawa responds: "I think 
it is nonsense to talk about a realignment of the political 
parties at the present stage. I have never consulted the prime 
minister about a cabinet reshuffle, but it is up to the prime 
minister." Ichikawa criticizes Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Takemura, saying: "At news conferences, the chief cabinet 
secretary has spoken of policy differences between the prime 
minister and his cabinet. The chief cabinet secretary has also 
spoken about important policy matters before the government and 
ruling coalition parties discuss them. His actions have created 
a rift within the ruling coalition parties, and this has been 
repeated on several occasions." 
  Commenting on the timing of a cabinet reshuffle, Ichikawa 
says: "I believe the cabinet will be reshuffled when the package 
of political bills are put into effect. There is a possibility 
the cabinet will be reshuffled before Diet deliberation of the 
1994 budget bill begins." 
  Discussing the scope of the cabinet reshuffle, Ichikawa 
states: "The cabinet reshuffle will not be confined to the 
replacement of the chief cabinet secretary. I believe many 
other cabinet members will be replaced." 
  Discussing the formation of a new party, Ichikawa states: 
"Currently there is the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP). We intend to fight in the elections by forming a new 
party which can take over the reigns of government." 
  Asked by Kuroiwa about the possibility of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), Sakigake (the Harbinger 
Party), and Komeito being merged into a new party, Ichikawa 
cites the difficulty involved in forming the present coalition 
government, but does not rule out the possibility, adding that 
the "SDPJ should have policies compatible with the key role it 
is playing in the coalition government." 
  Commenting on Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's statement 
that Sakigake, the SDPJ, and the Democratic Socialist Party 
should field unified candidates in the next election to counter 
candidates running on the Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and 
Komeito tickets, Ichikawa accuses Takemura of making such a 
statement, stating: "The chief cabinet secretary is in a 
position to hold the ruling coalition parties together. What is 
at issue is that he is going against the unity of the ruling 
coalition parties." 
  Asked by Kuroiwa about Ozawa's vision for building Japan 
into 
an ordinary nation, Ichikawa replies: "Ozawa's vision envisions 
the far future." 
  Discussing Japan's future contribution to the international 
community, Ichikawa says: "I believe Japan can make the 
contribution based only on the five principles of the PKO; this 
contribution can win the people's understanding."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Two Diet members who 
rebelled against their parties over political reform legislation 
formed a new parliamentary group aimed at protecting voters' 
choice on Monday [28 February], their aides said. Hideo Den, a 
former journalist who was expelled from the United Social 
Democratic Party (USDP), joined with Masao Kunihiro, formerly of 
the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] to establish 
it, they said. 
  The group, in the House of Councillors, is called Goken 
Liberal No Kai (Liberal Group for the Protection of the 
Constitution). 
  Both Den and Kunihiro had defied orders by their former 
parties -- members of the ruling coalition -- and voted against 
a package of political reform legislation that cleared the Diet 
on January 29. 
  The two, who now sit in the upper house as independents, 
said 
the reforms for the House of Representatives, featuring an 
electoral system of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 
proportional representation seats, will deny voters the chance 
to support those with minority views. 
  Besides the new group, the lineup in the upper house 
includes 
95 members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, 71 from 
the SDPJ, 37 from ruling coalition Shin-Ryokufu-Kai, formed in 
early February, 24 from Komeito, 11 from the opposition Japanese 
Communist Party (JCP), five from Niin Club and seven 
independents.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan's plan to extend a 
one- year tax reduction for fiscal 1994 is not an international 
commitment, a government source said Monday. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd 
Bentsen at their meeting near Frankfurt, Germany, that the 
planned income and residential tax cut is but a first step 
toward a more full-fledged tax reduction in the future. 
  The source said Fujii made the remarks "on an assumption 
that 
the ongoing debate over tax reforms will produce conclusion in 
one year." 
  "They're not an international pledge," the source said. 
  The government has been discussing a dramatic overhaul of 
the 
country's taxation system, with a more perpetual tax reduction 
on the agenda. The tax debate is scheduled to come up with some 
conclusions by the end of the year.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- Seventy percent of 300 
single- seat constituencies being set up under new political 
reform bills will be redrawn according to a 1991 plan presented 
to then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, according to a survey 
released Saturday [26 February]. 
  A KYODO NEWS SERVICE survey of politicians and people 
concerned in 47 prefectures found that more than 200 new 
single-seat districts will be invented according to the draft 
plan. 
  Only 60 to 70 districts, mostly in the densely populated 
Kanto and Kinki regions, will be newly created under legal 
procedures after the expected passage of an amendment of the 
package of political reform bills in early March. 
  The political reform bills, which were approved in January 
after a long battle in the Diet, calls for replacing the present 
511 multiseat constituencies for the lower house with a mix of 
300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional 
representation seats. 
  In about 45 new single-seat constituencies, the ruling 
coalition parties must single out their candidates since they 
have more than one incumbent lower house member in corresponding 
present multiseat districts. 
  The opposition LDP, which was ousted from power last August 
by the coalition government headed by Prime Minister Morihiro 
hosokawa, must make similar adjustments of their candidates in 
about 35 single-seat districts. 
  Totally new districts in which there are virtually no 
"incumbent" members will come into existence as well, with the 
number of such districts reaching more than 90 for the ruling 
parties and nearly 120 for the LDP. 
  The 8th Election System Council, a government advisory 
council, submitted the draft plan for redrawing electoral 
districts for the lower house in June 1991 to Kaifu, then prime 
minister and LDP president. 
  In drawing up the 300 single-seat constituencies, the 
council 
set 549,000 as an upper limit for the population of a voting 
district and 274,000 as a lower limit. 
  The population of six of the proposed constituencies will be 
allowed to remain below 274,000 as exceptions. 
  On the council's plan, many of those surveyed complained 
that 
it ignores regional history and geographical conditions, but 
some said another plan would cause problems such as 
contradiction of the weight of vote per voter. 
  Kaifu and his LDP successor Kiichi Miyazawa were dislodged 
from power due to their failure to achieve political reform. 
  Kaifu, speaking to the LDP's local convention in Nagoya, 
central Japan, said Saturday politicians should not intervene in 
redrawing the single-seat districts. 
  The government "should redraw (the electoral districts) 
fairly by entrusting the task with a third organization," he 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Private-sector economists 
are split over whether the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched 
Tankan business survey will show an improvement in the economic 
state, a KYODO NEWS SERVICE survey found Monday [28 February]. 
  Twenty-one economic research institutes surveyed put at 
average minus 56 the business confidence index for major 
manufacturers in the BOJ report, with predictions ranging from 
minus 51 to minus 60. The index stood at minus 56 in the 
previous BOJ report, published in December. 
  The quarterly report, based on a survey taken in February, 
will be issued at 2 PM Tuesday. 
  In the KYODO poll, nine of the surveyed institutes projected 
an improvement in the figure, while eight expected a decline. 
  Some of the forecasters who are relatively optimistic 
reasoned that the economy, already crawling at bottom, could not 
deteriorate further. 
  Others cited signs of recovery in durable goods sales, 
firmer 
showing of stock prices, and the yen's downslide in early 
February when the BOJ survey is thought to have been taken. 
  But even optimists are cautious because the signals of 
recovery that appeared in recent economic statistics may be 
affected by corporate efforts to make financial results better 
than they are before the book closing at the end of March. 
  An official with Okasan Economic Research Institute said, 
"maybe, the brightness is only for the January-March period. We 
want to wait for April figures before making any diagnosis on 
the economy." 
  Pessimists, meanwhile, attributed their forecasts to 
continuously depressed sales and political instability. 
  The research section of the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), 
regarded as one of the country's most reliable forecasting 
institutions, said, "the economy remains in poor shape with 
effects from higher share prices and a weaker yen limited." 
  The KYODO survey also found that 18 surveyed institutes 
predicted the confidence index for major nonmanufacturers at 
average minus 47, unchanged from the figure in the previous 
report. 
  Their forecasts ranged from minus 42 to minus 50, with eight 
seeing better results and six worse.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan's household spending 
in 1993 posted the first decline in real terms in 12 years, 
reflecting the prolonged recession, the government said Monday 
[28 February]. 
  Households spent an average 335,246 yen every month last 
year, down an inflation-adjusted 0.6 percent from the year 
before. 
  Family expenditures last fell in real terms in 1982, when 
average monthly household spending slipped 0.8 percent, the 
Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in a preliminary report. 
  Households of wage earners decreased their spending by a 
real 
0.4 percent to 355,276 yen for the first decline in 13 years, in 
line with a marginal 0.1 percent rise in their average monthly 
income in the year to 570,545 yen. 
  The barely perceptible rise in income, attributed to reduced 
bonuses and income from part-time work, was the lowest increase 
since 1981, when an oil crisis paralyzed the Japanese economy. 
  Expenditures by households of nonwage earners were down 1.1 
percent to 300,050 yen a month on average, the first fall in 
four years. 
  For all categories of households, spending was down last 
year 
on foodstuffs, housing, furniture, clothes and education. 
  Outlays increased on utilities charges, medical care, 
transport and communications, and entertainment. 
  For December, household spending rose 0.4 percent from a 
year 
earlier to 438,233 yen, the third straight month of gain 
following a 1.4 percent increase in November and 0.4 percent 
rise in October. 
  Despite the recovery in overall spending, however, wage 
earners' households spent less in the latest reporting month, 
with their income continuing to be depressed. 
  Those households spent an average 474,156 yen, down 0.2 
percent from a year earlier and the eighth consecutive month of 
decline from year-earlier levels, which is the longest losing 
streak since the agency started compiling the statistics under 
the current formula. 
  Income of wage earners' households in December was down 0.2 
percent to 1,213,090 yen, with the winter bonus paid in the 
month showing a 0.9 percent decline. 
  Spending by households of nonwage earners, in contrast, rose 
1.1 percent to 373,485 yen. 
  An EPA official said it is "uncertain whether the nation's 
household spending has really been picking up as long as wage 
earners' households keep their purse strings tight." 
  In December, spending on housing, durable goods, medical 
care, transport and communications, and entertainment increased, 
while outlays on foodstuffs, utilities charges, and clothing 
fell, the report said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan's industrial 
production edged up 0.9 percent in January from the previous 
month in a modest rebound from December's 1.9 percent decline, 
the trade ministry said Monday [28 February]. 
  The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and 
manufacturing sectors came to 88.6 against a base of 100 for 
1990, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
said in a preliminary report. 
  But despite the rise, the index was still at its 
third-lowest 
-- after December's 87.8 and October's 87.6 -- since the 1990 
base was introduced in May. 
  Production continues to slump, although a production outlook 
index for the manufacturing sector indicates rises there in 
February and March, MITI said, adding that coming movements in 
final demand must be closely watched. 
  Shipments rose 0.6 percent in January with the index at 
89.9, 
compared with the 0.7 percent decrease logged in December. 
  The inventory index dipped 0.4 percent to 107.9, adding to 
December's 0.9 percent decline. 
  The ratio of inventory to sales fell 3.2 percent in January 
to 122.0, slipping back from the record high set in December 
when the ratio rose 1.6 percent. 
  Monday's figures cap a half year of alternating ups and 
downs 
in Japan's industrial production, which saw a 2.2 percent gain 
in November in reaction to October's record 5.5 percent drop. 
That followed a 2.2 percent September gain and a 1.2 percent 
fall in August. 
  On an unadjusted basis, January's industrial production was 
down 3.1 percent from a year before, extending a record string 
of year- on-year declines to 28 months. 
  Patches of brightness are appearing, such as production and 
shipment of small cars, light trucks and computer equipment, but 
it is too early to say that the economy is bottoming out, said 
Koichi Yoshimoto, head of MITI's statistical analysis division. 
  With those gains helping the electric machinery and 
transportation equipment sectors, "the possibility seems high" 
that next month's projections for manufacturing production will 
show a third straight gain in April, he said. But he added 
there is not enough data to confirm a trend. 
  As the Bank of Japan has said in recent reports, Yoshimoto 
told reporters that Japan's corporate capital spending remains 
in a slump, while only isolated improvements are visible in 
personal consumption. 
  He cited a pickup in purchases of video cameras and discs in 
recent months. 
  Among production gainers in January were electric, general 
and transportation equipment, while precision machinery, 
ceramics and steel declined, the MITI report said. 
  Reporting higher shipments were transportation and electric 
equipment and nonferrous metals, while shipments fell in the 
metal products, general machinery and steel sectors, it said. 
  Despite its higher production and shipments, the 
transportation equipment sector also had higher inventories. 
  Inventories increased for oil and coal products, but 
declined 
for most other sectors, notably electric machinery, chemicals, 
and plastic products.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Ho Chong, deputy chief of the </F>
North Korean mission to the United Nations, by Washington-based 
correspondent Chong Yon-chu on 26 February in New York] 
  [Text] [Correspondent's note] Ambassador Ho, who began 
his post in the North Korean mission to the United Nations in 
May 1989, has been the North Korean representative in major 
talks with the United States. He has also played the role of 
spokesman for the North Korean mission because of his 
outstanding English. 
  [Chong Yon-chu] An agreement has finally been reached 
through the talks. How do you feel after the settlement? 
  [Ho Chong] We now can expect a third round of high-level 
talks and a package-deal settlement of not only the nuclear 
issue but also general issues between the DPRK and the United 
States in the third round of talks. In light of this, it is 
very fortunate that, although belatedly, the United States 
withdrew unfair [pudanghan] preconditions and an agreement was 
successfully reached. Now each of us has to exert maximum 
efforts so that peace on the Korean peninsula can be achieved 
through the package-deal resolution of the abnormal DPRK-U.S. 
relations. 
  [Chong] Why did the talks last longer than expected? 
  [Ho] Because the United States insisted on unfair 
preconditions. 
  [Chong] What were the preconditions? 
  [Ho] I cannot tell you concretely. The preconditions were 
unacceptable to us. 
  [Chong] Could you tell me about the contents of the 
agreement? 
  [Ho] The basic contents are as follows: "The DPRK and the 
United States, according to the principles of the DPRK-U.S. 
joint statement announced on 11 June 1993, have had several 
meetings in New York with the aim of exerting joint efforts to 
resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. 
  Based on the negotiations, the DPRK and the United States 
agreed to take the following four measures on 1 March 1994. 
First, South Korea and the United States announce the 
suspension of the Team Spirit exercise. Second, inspections for 
the assurance of the continuity of nuclear safeguards, which was 
agreed on 15 February between the DPRK and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, begin on 1 March. Third, a working-level 
contact for the North-South exchange of special envoys will 
resume in Panmunjom. Fourth, the DPRK and the United States 
will hold the third round high-level talks on 21 March 1994 in 
Geneva." 
  [Chong] According to the agreement, a working-level contact 
for the North-South exchange of special envoys will resume in 
Panmunjom on 1 March. 
  [Ho] If the South requests a working-level contact, it will 
be held immediately on 1 March. 
  [Chong] There were reports that you would be summoned home. 
  [Ho] I read from South Korean newspapers that I would soon 
leave. As a public official, I would leave if the government 
asks so. But I have not received such news. 
  [Chong] Will you be at the Geneva talks as well? 
  [Ho] We have to wait and see.

<F P=106> [By New York correspondent Nam Son-yon] </F>
  [Text] In a working-level contact resumed in New York this 
afternoon, the United States and North Korea agreed to start 
nuclear inspections on 1 March and to hold the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks in Geneva on 21 March. 
  Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state, and Ho Chong, 
deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the United Nations, 
held a contact today at the UN Headquarters and said they had 
reached a four-point agreement on simultaneous actions [negae 
hangui tongsi haengdong chochi], including the above. 
  The U.S. and North Korean representatives said: The United 
States will announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise 
when nuclear inspections begin on 1 March after visas are issued 
to the members of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
inspection team. They also said that North Korea will concede to 
a working-level contact for the South-North exchange of envoys 
if the ROK proposes it first. 
  Right after the U.S.-North Korean talks, North Korea's Ho 
Chong said: The nuclear inspections to begin on 1 March will be 
conducted at the level necessary for guaranteeing the continuity 
of nuclear safeguards, and this is appropriate for the 
particular situation of the temporary suspension of the 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] 
[haekanjon chochiui yonsoksong pojange piryohan sujunimyo inun 
haekhwaksan kumjijoyak taltoeui hyoryogul ilsi chungjihan 
tuksusanghwange mannun gosirago malhaessumnida]. 
  According to well-informed UN sources, the third round of 
U.S.- North Korean high-level talks, slated for 21 February, 
will endorse a package solution to the problems concerning North 
Korea's return to the NPT, its complete implementation of the 
Nuclear Safeguards Accord, the U.S. abandonment of its hostile 
policy toward North Korea and the cessation of nuclear threats.

  [Text] The government welcomed today the agreement between 
North Korea and the United States on the schedule for nuclear 
inspections and expressed its expectation that this will help in 
the fundamental resolution [kunbonjogin haegyol] of the North 
Korean nuclear issue. 
  In a comment released today, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Chang 
Ki-ho welcomed that, as a result of North Korean-U.S. contacts, 
nuclear inspections are going to be realized and said that this 
is the result of the fact that the ROK and the United States 
have had close consultations and kept their invariable position. 
  Spokesman Chang said: I consider this result the first step 
in resolving the nuclear issue [haekmunje haegyorui ilchajok 
chochoro pyonggahanda]. I hope this step will be helpful for 
the fundamental resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.

  [Text] Seven members of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] nuclear inspection team will depart Vienna for 
Pyongyang at 1040 [1340 GMT] tonight, in about an hour and 30 
minutes from now. Breaking its previous practice of issuing 
visas only in Beijing, North Korea issued visas through the 
North Korean Embassy in Vienna on the afternoon of 26 February. 
Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: 
  [Begin Cha recording] The North Korean attitude toward the 
inspection team, which has been somewhat leery, is gradually 
relaxing. Breaking its previous practice of issuing visas only 
in Beijing, North Korea promptly issued visas through the North 
Korean Embassy in Vienna yesterday. In the past, when the 
number of inspection team members exceeded three, North Korea 
has demanded that the group be reduced. This time, however, 
North Korea issued visas to all seven members as demanded by the 
IAEA. 
  The IAEA expressed satisfaction with the North Korean 
follow-up steps, although delayed, and expressed the hope that 
North Korea will actively cooperate with the inspection team's 
activities. 
  The inspection team will depart Vienna for Beijing at 1040 
tonight, Korean time, by Lufthansa, and will stay overnight in 
Beijing. The team will leave Beijing on 1 March by Koryo 
Airline and will arrive in Pyongyang at around 1730, Korean 
time. As soon as it arrives in Pyongyang, the inspection team 
will arrange the dates of inspection in Yongbyon and Pyongyang 
with relevant officials of the North Korean Ministry of Atomic 
Power Industry, and will launch a full-fledged two-week 
inspection of seven nuclear facilities beginning 2 March. This 
means that overall inspections of North Korea are revived and 
resumed nearly after a one year suspension. [end recording]

  [Text] Berlin, Feb. 27 (YONHAP) -- A team of International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts left for North Korea Sunday 
afternoon to resume inspections halted nearly a year ago. 
  North Korea issued visas for the seven-man team through its 
embassy in Vienna Saturday after a series of negotiations with 
the United States on a compromise deal. 
  Pyongyang was to allow unrestricted IAEA access to its seven 
declared facilities and hold working-level talks with Seoul on 
an exchange of presidential envoys. 
  In return, Washington agreed to suspend this year's "Team 
Spirit" military exercise held jointly with Seoul and to conduct 
high-level talks with North Korea next month. 
  The IAEA inspectors will arrive in Beijing on Monday and 
reach Pyongyang on Tuesday. They will spend about two weeks 
checking the seven installations and another three to four weeks 
producing inspection reports. 
  The last full-scale inspection in North Korea took place in 
January last year. Checks since then have been restricted to 
replacement of batteries and film in monitoring devices.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States will make it clear that a decision on South 
Korea-U.S. joint military exercise, Team Spirit '94, would be 
made on the premise that IAEA inspections of North Korean 
nuclear facilities and exchange of presidential envoys between 
Seoul and Pyongyang will be fully implemented, a high-level 
government source said Sunday. 
  If the conditions were not met, the source said, plans to 
stage the military maneuver will be pushed for again. The South 
Korean government is expected to announce the suspension of Team 
Spirit '94 on Tuesday, the same day the inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency are scheduled to begin their 
tasks on seven declared nuclear sites in North Korea, the 
official said. 
  The United States will announce Tuesday the terms of the 
Pyongyang-Washington agreement made last Friday in New York and 
fully agree to Seoul's position, the source said.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 27 (YONHAP) -- The United States 
is steadfast about not holding high-level talks with North Korea 
next month unless the two Koreas exchange presidential envoys 
first, sources here said Sunday. 
  Washington is expected to issue a statement supporting 
Seoul's announcement Tuesday suspending the South Korea-U.S. 
joint military drill "Team Spirit" this year, the same day that 
an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team 
arrives in North Korea. 
  Washington will also clarify its position regarding what was 
agreed with Pyongyang at the New York contact on Saturday and 
reaffirm that the exchange of presidential envoys is a 
prerequisite to the high-level talks, sources said. 
  The United States and North Korea ended grueling 
negotiations 
that ran past midnight Saturday, when the latter agreed to 
permit IAEA inspections and reopen talks with South Korea on the 
envoys' cross-visits in exchange for Team Spirit's suspension 
and North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue. 
  The date for the third-round meeting between Washington and 
Pyongyang, when they will discuss overall improvement in 
relations, was set for March 21 in geneva. But some diplomatic 
observers say uncertainty remains over whether the third round 
of high-level dialogue will start as planned or be delayed if 
the inter-Korean envoy exchange does not occur by March 21. 
  President Bill Clinton reportedly convened a meeting of his 
national security advisers at the white house Saturday to 
discuss the North Korean nuclear situation. 
  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci and deputy 
assistant secretary Tom Hubbard, both representatives at the 
talks with North Korea, will fly to South Korea early next month 
to coordinate a stance on the Pyongyang-Washington high-level 
meeting, sources said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 26 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government will propose to North Korea to meet at the southern 
side of the truce village of Panmunjom on March 2 to discuss 
exchange of special envoys in a telephone message on Feb. 28. 
Seoul's action comes after North Korea agreed to allow 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in its 
nuclear sites from March 1 in a working- level meeting with the 
United States late Friday. The North Koreans said they will 
resume inter-Korean dialogue if the South proposes it in the New 
York meeting. 
  Seoul's telephone message to be sent under the name of Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang to his North Korean counterpart Kang 
Song-sang will propose a working-level contact on March 2. If 
realized, South and North Korea would be resuming their first 
dialogue in four months after the third meeting last October 
broke down. 
  The government is likely to announce suspension of this 
year's Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit" if North 
Korea fully cooperates with IAEA inspections and shows sincerity 
in inter-Korean dialogue around the same time South and North 
sit down for working- level talks. 
  If the talks go smoothly, the first exchange of presidential 
envoys is expected to take place sometime in March 10-15 before 
the third round of high-level Pyongyang-Washington talks. 
  Seoul and Pyongyang have so far differed in the form, 
schedule, and content of discussions by their special envoys, 
but Seoul officials say they hope to sign an agreement on the 
exchange in the fourth or fifth contact.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to 
discuss not only the North Korean nuclear issue but also a 
summit between Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song and 
unification if the two Koreas agree to exchange special envoys. 
  The special envoys would also discuss problems related to 
implementation of the basic inter-Korean accords reached in 
December 1992, government sources said Monday. 
  The government plans to tell North Korea when working-level 
officials of the two sides meet at the truce village of 
Panmunjom on Tuesday that Seoul could show flexibility by 
sending a special envoy to Pyongyang first, around March 15, 
they said. 
  These decisions were made at a meeting Sunday morning of 
government leaders concerned with unification, who agreed to 
send an official letter in the name of Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang to his North Korean counterpart Kang Song-san. 
  Seoul's decisions would help break the impasse between the 
two Koreas since a series of three working-level contacts last 
October, they said. 
  In the previous contacts, Seoul proposed discussion of the 
nuclear question and implementation of the basic inter-Korean 
accords. But the North Korean side insisted on discussing Kim 
Il- song's "10-point" proposals for unification and an 
inter-Korean summit meeting. 
  With regard to the special envoy exchange, South Korea 
maintained that since it was initially proposed by the North, 
Pyongyang should be the first to send its envoy to Seoul while 
the North asked the South to send its envoy first to Pyongyang. 
  "Taking the date for a third round of high-level talks 
between the United States and North Korea into consideration, 
the (Seoul) Government position is that an exchange of 
inter-Korean special envoys will have to be realized around 
March 15," one government official said. 
  At Tuesday's meeting, problems with exchanging special 
envoys 
would be discussed, the official added. 
  The official said there has been no change in the U.S.-South 
Korean position that the envoy exchange must take place before a 
third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. 
  As long as that basic position was maintained, the official 
hinted, other issues such as whose special envoy should visit 
first could be flexible.

North- South contact for the exchange of special envoys, to the 
North Korean delegate Pak Yong-su this morning proposing a 
working contact in Panmunjom on the morning of 1 March for the

early date. He proposed that the fourth round of working 
contact be made at the House of Peace in our side's area in 
Panmunjom at 1000 [Korean standard time] tomorrow. 
  Delegate Song Yong-tae stressed that in connection with the 
issue of the exchange of special envoys, North and South Korea 
showed no differences except a couple of things, and hoped that 
the pending issues, such as the nuclear issue, which stand in 
the way of progress of inter-Korean relations, will be resolved 
through the exchange of special envoys at an early date.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korea 
realistically have just enough time for only one of the two 
sides to dispatch a presidential envoy, and this will have to be 
enough to meet the prerequisites for the third round high-level 
Pyongyang-Washington dialogue, an official here said Monday. 
  The official said Seoul's announcement on suspending South 
Korea-U.S. joint military exercise "Team Spirit" can be made 
only after the inter-Korean contact takes place at the truce 
village of Panmunjom. 
  North Korea said it will respond Tuesday to South Korean 
proposal for contact, clouding chances that the inter-Korean 
meeting can take place in the morning as expected. 
  If the meeting fails to open, then the Team Spirit 
suspension 
announcement would necessarily have to be delayed as well, the 
official said. 
  Pyongyang and Washington agreed on a small package deal 
where 
they and Seoul would announce on Tuesday the steps each would 
take. 
  North Korea is to accept an International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspection team and allow it to begin nuclear 
check from March 1. 
  South Korea, in return, is to announce Team Spirit 
suspension 
while the United States will announce the date and place of next 
round of high-level dialogue with North Korea. 
  Announcements by Seoul and Washington, however, carry 
conditions that North Korea must allow unrestricted inspections 
by the IAEA and must successfully carry out inter-Korean 
exchange of presidential envoys. 
  "We hope that both Seoul and Pyongyang would be able to 
exchange envoys before the North Korea-U.S. meeting. But 
realistically, time allows us to have only one side make the 
visit," the official said on condition of anonymity. 
  The Pyongyang-Washington dialogue is set for March 21 in 
Geneva.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- The deputy prime minister 
and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB) said on 
Monday that the government will press for reunions of dispersed 
families in South and North Korea at their working-level contact 
on exchanging special envoys. 
  Minister Yi Yong-tok told the National Assembly's committee 
on foreign affairs and unification that the urgent problem of 
separated families should be solved along with the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  North Korea, in talks with the United States on Saturday, 
agreed to permit inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) on March 1 on condition that South-North contacts 
on exchanging special envoys are held in early March. 
  During the 1950-53 Korean War, about 10 million people were 
separated from their families and have since not been able to 
meet with relatives on the other side of the divided peninsula. 
  Yi also said the government will strive to solve pending 
inter- Korean issues like the nuclear problem through direct 
talks, considering public opinion which holds that South Korean 
efforts alone have been insufficient. 
  The special envoys to be exchanged will deliver personal 
letters from their respective presidents and discuss major 
issues and the holding of an inter-Korean summit, according to 
the NUB minister. 
  In particular, the envoys will seek a breakthrough in the 
nuclear problem, normalized implementation of the South-North 
basic agreement and a joint declaration on denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula, Yi said. 
  On the possibility of an inter-Korean summit, he said: 
"There 
is no change in the government position that the nuclear problem 
should be solved first. The summit meeting will discuss broadly 
all issues including the nuclear problem, but this means basing 
such discussion on prior settlement of the nuclear problem." 
  Yi expected that the third round of high-level talks between 
North Korea and the United States may focus on North Korea's 
complete return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and 
Pyongyang's demand that Washington refrain from using nuclear 
weapons first. 
  "Conclusion of a peace treaty between Pyongyang and 
Washington and improvement of bilateral relations are also 
expected to be dealt with at the third round of talks," Yi added. 
  But North Korea, Yi said, will likely try to retain its 
"special position" of having suspended its withdrawal from the 
NPT while trying to use the IAEA's special and routine nuclear 
inspections and complete return to the NPT as negotiating cards 
at the talks with the United States.

<F P=106> [By Washington correspondent Chong Hae-yong] </F>
  [Text] Political circles in Washington speculate that a 
high-ranking ROK Government authority secretly visited Pyongyang 
around the end of January and met with high-ranking North Korean 
officials to discuss measures for the resolution of the nuclear 
issue, including the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, 
and pending issues including the exchange of South and North 
special envoys, and the possibility of South-North summit talks. 
  According to a Washington source well-informed of U.S. 
Government and North Korean affairs on 25 February, it has been 
learned that a high-ranking ROK Government official who is in 
the position to control North Korea-related intelligence, went 
to Pyongyang around the end of January to discuss measures to 
resolve the stalemate nuclear issue and follow-up issues after 
nuclear inspections. The source said that Ho Chong, deputy 
permanent representative of North Korean mission to the United 
Nations and who is the communication channel for the U.S.-North 
Korean contact in New York, was summoned to Pyongyang while the 
ROK "secret nuclear envoy" was in Pyongyang. 
  Noting that around that time, Rev. Billy Graham visited 
Pyongyang to play the role as a messenger for President Clinton 
and Kim Il-song, the source analyzed that there were 
behind-the-scene contacts between the ROK, United States, and 
North Korea to seek a breakthrough for the resolution of the 
nuclear issue. 
  The source also said that the reason relevant high-ranking 
ROK Government officials showed optimistic opinions that the 
inspections will be conducted soon and the nuclear negotiations 
will be settled while the United States expressed concern over 
the twisted nuclear talks early February was because of such 
secret contacts. 
  Asked about the secret visit to North Korea by a 
high-ranking 
ROK official at the end of January, a high-ranking government 
official denied the fact by saying, "It is absolutely not true."

<F P=106> [Interview with Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and </F>
national unification minister, by Yu Sung-u; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Yu] On 26 February, North Korea and the United 
States reached an agreement that will enable the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections to begin in Pyongyang. 
  Earlier this year in its report, the National Unification 
Board [NUB] envisaged that a breakthrough would be made into the 
nuclear issue sometime this year and, in turn, North-South 
relations would reach a turning point. Do you think such 
prospect has hit the target? 
  [Yi] I think it is fortunate that the North Korean nuclear 
issue is taking the road to peaceful settlement through dialogue 
and negotiation. However, this is only a first step and, 
depending on North Korea's attitude, there are various obstacles 
we have to overcome. Accordingly, the time is not ripe to have 
an upbeat view. Furthermore, we should remember that North 
Korea, in the New York contact, opposed until the end to 
committing itself in writing to the issue of realizing an 
exchange of special envoys. 
  [Yu] In a news conference marking his one year in office, 
President Kim Yong-sam said that he will push for an 
inter-Korean summit. Could you tell us about the background 
behind his proposal and do you think it is likely to come true? 
  [Yi] I think President Kim's recent proposal goes one step 
further from his previous stance that the summit would only be 
possible after the nuclear problem was solved. In other words, 
he showed a flexible and converted view on the issue. This 
reflects his will to promote North-South relations more 
positively on his own initiative at a time when the 
international efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue 
are heading toward a positive direction. Nonetheless, this has a 
condition that "only if it would help deter North Korea's 
nuclear development program." So, there is not a fundamental 
change in the government's stance stressing the solution of the 
nuclear problem above anything else. 
  [Yu] Sparked by the president's proposal on the summit, will 
there be a change in the special envoys' duties and the purpose 
of their exchange? There is speculation that the duties of 
special envoys will be detached from the nuclear issue and that 
they will only discuss the issue regarding preparations for the 
summit. Could you tell us more about this? 
  [Yi] As I have mentioned earlier, the government's stance 
stressing the solution of the nuclear problem above anything 
else has not changed. The president's will to go to a summit 
does not necessarily mean that the duties and tasks of special 
envoys would change. Accordingly, the nuclear issue should be 
dealt as a priority if the exchange of special envoys was 
realized before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. 
Along with this, I expect that the issues for promoting 
North-South relations, including the high-level talks and the 
operation of joint committee of each field, and the holding of 
summit will be discussed. 
  [Yu] Do you think there will be visible results in 
improving South-North relations during the exchange of South and 
North special envoys? 
  [Yi] We hope that discussions on ways to solve the issue of 
separated families can be held first. At the recent U.S.-North 
Korea contact, both sides agreed to hold the third round of 
high- level talks on 21 March. I believe that the exchange of 
South and North special envoys must be achieved before 21 March. 
It will take two to three weeks for the IAEA inspection team to 
finish the inspections, and another two to three weeks for it to 
analyze the results. I believe that a state of flux may continue 
even when the third round of talks is in progress. I hope that 
during this process both sides will want to meet with each other 
and reach an agreement on the issue of holding the summit talks. 
  [Yu] In what form do you plan to propose to the North Korean 
side regarding the separated families issue, which is one of the 
most important tasks the government is promoting? 
  [Yi] In connection with this issue, authorities in the past 
have repeated revealed that "it will be promoted first of all," 
and that "it will be promoted actively." No one said that the 
separated families issue will "be linked with other pending 
issues." There must be concrete and visible results regarding 
the separated families issue in the process of exchanging South 
and North special envoys I believe that reunion of separated 
families will be the first step in South-North reconciliation 
and exchange. However, we do not want to put a heavy burden on 
the North Korean side. I believe we can wait somewhat on the 
issue of exchanging visits between the South and North. 
Nevertheless, I hope that we will be able to at least confirm 
the life or death of our families, establish an office to 
exchange letters and a reunion office in Panmunjom, and work so 
that a limited number of people can meet with each other. This 
has already been proposed to the North Korean side. 
  [Yu] What other visible measures are there for us to take, 
other than the issue of separated families, in trying to induce 
North Korea to open up and show change? 
  [Yi] It can be human exchanges such as exchange of religious 
organizations and cultural organizations. If meetings between 
authorities such as the exchange of special envoys of the South 
and North start sometime in March, I believe that the exchange 
of people in the social and cultural fields will begin. The 
government has received applications for exchange between 
religious organizations such as the Chondoist in March and for 
the exchange between women organizations sometime in April. 
  [Yu] Some people point out that inflexible principles that 
linked the nuclear issue with economic cooperation have to be 
reconsidered. 
  [Yi] We are of the principle to flexibly deal with the 
economic cooperation issue in accordance with the progress in 
the North Korea's nuclear issue. The stage-by-stage scenario on 
economic cooperation is achieved by three stages taking into 
consideration the overall situation of the South-North 
relations. If we reach the third stage, I believe that the 
atmosphere will be that we will be able to solve all South-North 
issues. The success or failure regarding this matter is wholly 
dependent on the attitude of North Korea. 
  [Yu] Was there a concrete message indicating that North 
Korea wanted our economic cooperation? 
  [Yi] Up until now invitations sent by North Korea's 
responsible people to our businesses amount to 40 cases. 
Proposals came from North Korea to our prominent businesses to 
establish plants in such and such a place, and to take part in 
investment in infrastructure in the Najin-Sonbong area. 
  [Yu] Can you tell me your ambition and plan during your term 
of office? 
  [Yi] Economist Max Singer wrote in his book entitled, 
"Passage to a Human World," that Korea will have the second 
largest gross national product in the world in the year 2064, 
under the condition that reunification is achieved. I believe 
in this. I will work so that all the people can restore moral 
health, and persistently make efforts to foster democracy. 
Also, I will sincerely work so that the we can welcome with 
emotion the opening of the "era of putting into practice the 
joint declaration on denuclearization."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports and editorials from the ROK vernacular press published 
on 27 February on the agreement reached between the United 
States and the DPRK in a working-level contact in New York on 
the DPRK's acceptance of nuclear inspections. 
  The liberal daily TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,300-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun under the 
headline "Significance of the Settlement of the Inspection 
Schedule Agreed Between North Korea and the United States." 
  The article notes that when the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] inspection team starts the nuclear inspection on 1 
March, the ROK side will announce a "suspension" of the Team 
Spirit exercise for this year, and thus the road toward the 
third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be 
"opened." Assessing the current agreement as a step in removing 
another "stumbling block" to a solution of the North Korean 
nuclear issue, the article stresses that the "stalemate" in the 
past U.S.-DPRK talks was caused by a "lack of mutual trust" and 
by "difference in views" on designating the date of the third 
round of high-level talks and on the "issue of North-South 
dialogue." North Korea tried to "step up" the dialogue with the 
United States and to "exclude" the ROK while "delaying" the 
North-South dialogue, but finally agreed that the United States 
announce on 1 March its position that "it will not respond to 
the third round of high-level talks unless the exchange of 
special envoys between the North and the South is realized." 
Noting that this agreement was made on the condition that "if 
the South proposes dialogue for the exchange of envoys, the 
North will respond," the article pays attention to the North 
Korean attitude on North-South dialogue and to the "degree of 
progress" in the dialogue up until high-level talks are held. 
  The moderate daily CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word editorial entitled "This Is Only the Beginning of the 
North Korean Nuclear Issue." Noting the recent agreement as a 
"fortunate achievement" attained through dialogue, the editorial 
says that North Korea has been seized with "a sense of crisis 
and the sense of persecution" in view of its claim that "the 
IAEA put forward unreasonable demands" to North Korea. The 
editorial notes that the U.S. Government revealed its position 
that "missile export, terrorism, the human rights issue and even 
the conventional military power" of North Korea must be 
"discussed" before completely accepting the North Korean 
demands, and that "difficult problems," which may be raised in 
the future due to North Korea's act of "picking a quarrel," 
should be resolved through "patience" and "efforts." 
  The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,300- word article by reporter Pak Tu-sik under the headline 
"The U.S.- North Korea Agreement and Prospects for North-South 
Relations." Paying specific attention to the content regarding 
the exchange of North-South special envoys included in the 
recent U.S.-North Korea agreement, the article urges the holding 
of the special envoys exchange "for discussion of the nuclear 
issue" and "for realizing a North-South summit." Noting that our 
government called on the United States "absolutely not to 
concede" to North Korea on the principle on the exchange of 
special envoys during the talks in New York, the article 
predicts that the exchange will be realized even "as a matter of 
formality" because it is North Korea's "commitment" that should 
be fulfilled within a little over "20 days." However, the 
article concludes, "the visibility is still poor." 
  The moderate daily KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
1,200- word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim 
Hak-sun under the headline "North Korea-U.S. Negotiations Are 
Now on the `Political Table.'" Explaining the process in past 
North Korea-U.S. talks on the nuclear inspection issue, 
including the "highly strained" 25 February contact in New York, 
the article says that the two sides set "21 March" as the date 
of the third round of high-level talks, because at least "two or 
three weeks" are required for "proving the continuity of nuclear 
safeguards" even after the IAEA inspection starts, and because 
the ROK and the United States believed that this length of time 
is needed for "evaluating the sincerity in accepting the nuclear 
inspection" and for realizing the exchange of North- South 
special envoys. The article pointed out that both the ROK and 
the United States reportedly "have driven a wedge" on the road 
toward the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks so 
that the talks are "canceled" in the event that North Korea does 
not show "sincerity" in the nuclear inspection and exchange of 
special envoys. Therefore, North Korea will not carry out 
"harmful acts" to the third talks. The article concludes that 
the U.S.-North Korea agreement means that the two sides are now 
moving toward "the full-scale political negotiation stage." 
  The economy-specialized daily SEOUL MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 
publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word article by reporters Yi 
Tong-chu and So Yang-won, under the headline "Significance in 
the Settlement of North Korea-U.S. Working-level Contact." The 
article points out that at the contact, North Korea made a 
"somewhat unusual demand" that the content of the agreement be 
announced in the form of a "joint statement," noting this shows 
North Korea's persistent "adherence" to the third round of 
U.S.-North Korea talks. The article refers to remarks of a 
relevant government official that "the most serious stumbling 
block" during the U.S.-North Korea negotiations was "the issue 
of exchange of special envoys" and that North-South relations 
will be solved by the "parties concerned" prompted by President 
Kim Yong-sam's recent "summit proposal through the exchange of 
special envoys." The North and the South are expected to discuss 
concretely "the qualifications and missions of special envoys 
and the time and method of their exchange" during a 
working-level contact to be held "within this week." The article 
points out a government official's "optimistic view" that "the 
special envoy of either the North or the South will be able to 
visit the other side before 21 March, when the third round of 
U.S.-North Korea talks are held." However, the article notes 
that the North may come to the North-South dialogue "without 
attaching any importance to it" because North Korea only adheres 
to "dialogue with the United States." 
  The government-supported daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on 
page 
3 a 1,200-word editorial entitled "We Watch the Time After The 
U.S.- North Korea Nuclear Agreement." Pointing to people's 
"depressed feeling" despite "the sign of the situation moving 
toward the right direction" with the agreement, the editorial 
notes that this is because North Korea's "nuclear transparency" 
cannot be guaranteed by the forthcoming IAEA inspections alone 
and because the issue of "special inspection of two undeclared 
sites--the cause of commotions--" is left as a pending question. 
Therefore, the editorial stresses, the "task" henceforth is the 
implementation of "special inspection" of these facilities. 
  The editorial points out that "how sincerely North Korea 
will 
cooperate with the IAEA inspection; what the result of the 
forthcoming ordinary inspection would be, and what the North 
side's attitude on North-South working contact for special 
envoys exchange is, will be the "targets" of the people's 
attention in deciding North Korea's "true intention." 
Emphasizing that the North's acceptance of "special inspection" 
and "mutual inspection" would be an important evidence of North 
Korea's "good intention," the editorial hopes that with the 
acceptance of these two inspections, the North's "nuclear 
transparency" should be ensured. 
  The leftist-leaning daily HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 
3 
a 1,700-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong 
Yon-chu, under the headline "Road Opened for Full-scale North 
Korea-U.S. Political Talks." Noting an important "breakthrough" 
was made toward the nuclear inspection and the third round of 
high-level talks after the agreement was adopted, the article 
regards the agreement as an "important milestone" for 
full-fledged political talks between North Korea and the United 
States, and as a "qualitative change" in relations between the 
two countries, thus exercising "fundamental influence" on the 
Korean peninsula and its neighboring countries. The article 
points out that the U.S. position stressed the "insurance of 
transparency in the North Korean nuclear issue" and that North 
Korea attempted to "tightly hold" the nuclear card in an effort 
to improve "political and economic relations" with the United 
States. The article emphasizes that regardless of the remarks of 
some people that "nothing has basically changed in the North 
Korean nuclear issue," this issue is advancing toward a "smooth, 
positive solution" judging from "the overall situation." The 
article then refers to the remarks of North Korean Ambassador Ho 
that during the forthcoming third round of high-level talks, 
"the complete return of North Korea to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty; North Korea's implementation of the 
nuclear safeguards accord; the U.S. abandonment of hostile 
policy against North Korea and the suspension of its nuclear 
threat, and other overall political, diplomatic and economic 
issues" will be discussed. Pointing to some people's allegation 
on the "necessity" of the North-South summit, the article pays 
attention to how the North Korean side would "respond" to 
President Kim Yong-sam's recent summit proposal.

<F P=106> [From CHUNGANG ILBO: "Government Considers Allowing </F>
Defection of North Korean Loggers Who Escaped From Logging Camps 
in Siberia"] 
  [Text] The government has tentatively decided to accept 
North Korean loggers to seek asylum after escaping from logging 
camps in Siberia. It was learned that consultations over this 
matter will be discussed among related ministries soon to settle 
this matter. 
  A government official said on 27 February: "Considering our 
relations with Russia and North Korea, the government has not 
accepted requests to defect from North Korean loggers who escape 
from logging camps in Siberia. However, since the number of 
those who want to defect is over 100, this is a matter that can 
no longer be ignored. A meeting of related ministries will be 
held and a final decision made on whether to allow the North 
Korean loggers to defect." 
  This official also revealed: "The government has already 
held a meeting with the National Unification Board [NUB]; the 
Foreign, Home Affairs, and Justice Ministries; and the Agency 
for National Security Planning [NSP] to deal with this matter. 
They agreed to examine the possibility of their defection." 
  An official who participated in this meeting said: 
"Diplomatic problems with Russia and China could arise if the 
North Korean loggers are allowed to seek asylum and settle in 
the ROK. We have, however, generally agreed to allow them to 
seek asylum from a humanitarian perspective." 
  In the news conference on the first anniversary of his 
inauguration on 25 February, President Kim Yong-sam said: "The 
issue of allowing the North Korean loggers in Siberia to defect 
is a matter that must be examined at the international law 
level. However, basically, we will deal with this matter from a 
humanitarian and human rights perspective." An official said: 
"Director-level officials of the NUB; the Foreign, Home Affairs, 
and Justice Ministries; and the NSP will hold a meeting to deal 
with this matter. Before allowing the North Korean loggers to 
defect, discussions will be held on requesting Russia to issue 
exit visas and on how to deal with the problems that will arise 
if they settle in the ROK." 
  In addition to our embassy and consulate general in Russia, 
the North Korean loggers are seeking asylum at our embassies in 
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Recently, the Chinese Embassy there 
has also been flooded with defection requests. It is being 
pointed out that it is urgent to take measures regarding this 
matter.

  [Text] It has been learned that North Korea established a 
special military unit called "commando unit" [tukkong 
yukchondae] and secretly trains it. Recently acquired documents 
on North Korea show that North Korea selected members of the 
commando unit from the "Nampo Military and Political School" and 
gives them ideological education. The commando unit is composed 
of orphans who have no close relatives. North Korea divided the 
39 members of the commando unit (30 men and nine women) in two 
platoons and gives them spy training to send them to South Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States are currently discussing the matter of deploying 
Patriot missiles in the Korean peninsula, but now that North 
Korea has accepted to allow nuclear inspections, the two agreed 
to be flexible about the timing of deployment, Defense Minister 
Yi Pyong-tae said Saturday. The Patriot missile under 
consideration for deployment in Korea are Pae-II type, the 
latest operated by the U.S. military that has been advanced from 
the weapons used in the Gulf war, Yi told the National 
Assembly's National Defense Committee. 
  Considering that not only Seoul, but also as far as Suwon is 
within missile attack from the North, it is meaningless to 
operate the anti-missile weapon in the capital just to intercept 
North Korean Scud missile attack, he explained. Therefore, he 
added, Seoul and Washington are considering to use Patriots to 
defend airport, port, command post, and other military areas. 
  The U.S. Forces in Korea will be in charge of maintaining 
and 
operating the missiles and Seoul does not need pay any extra, he 
said. The defense minister said purchasing the missiles was 
another matter and needed to consider more over a long time 
before reaching that stage.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chae Hui-muk] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown has sent a 
letter to his Korean counterpart Kim Chol-su, asking for help in 
a lawsuit involving the top managers of two U.S. firms here, 
business sources said yesterday. 
  David D. Ussery, representative director and president of 
detergent retailer Amway Korea; Jason Li, general manager of 
health food seller Sunrider International Korea; and nine other 
persons working for the firms are on trial for alleged illegal 
retailing in the form of so-called multi-layer home-visit sales. 
This is pressure on the Korean government and its aim is to 
rescue the U.S. businessmen from the lawsuit although the courts 
are independent of the administration, a businessman said. 
  It follows an earlier American attempt by Defense Secretary 
William Perry to put pressure on his Korean counterpart Yi 
Pyong-tae to buy airborne radar jamming device manufactured by a 
U.S. firm, he said. 
  Late in December last year, Perry sent a letter to Minister 
Yi and the letter was disclosed early this month, causing public 
criticism against the United States. 
  An official of the Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry confirmed 
the reception of the letter, refusing to disclose details. He 
said, "The letter came late last month. But we cannot disclose 
the contents of the letter as it involves a sensitive trade 
issue." 
  Prosecutors arrested Ussery, Li and five other persons 
working for the two firms charging them with illegal retailing 
on July 1 last year. This was the first arrest of foreigners in 
violation of the law on home-visit sales. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed "concern" about the 
issue during his visit to Seoul July 10-11 last year. 
  Prosecutors filed a summary suit against the top managers of 
the two firms and nine others Nov. 16 to wind up the sensitive 
case quickly with a mere cash penalty. But the Nambu (southern) 
branch of the Seoul District Criminal Court ordered a formal 
rather than summary trial Dec. 9, refusing the summary 
indictment requested by the prosecutors. 
  Stating his reasons for ordering the formal trial, Judge Min 
Pyong-hun of the court said, "There has been a dispute about the 
legal interpretation of the law on home-visit sales. It also 
would have been hard to make a ruling based on the investigation 
records produced by prosecutors. As a result, a formal trial 
was needed where evidence and arguments can be brought forward." 
  The first trial will reportedly be held next month.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government on Monday called the recent killing of Palestinians 
in the West Bank "an unforgivable act of violence" and urged 
involved parties to exercise restraint. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho issued a statement 
deploring the killing, saying the Seoul government "believes 
that such an unforgivable act of violence is in no way of help 
to the on-going Middle East peace process." 
  The Korean Government calls upon all parties to prevent the 
recurrence of such a tragic and terrible incident, the statement 
said. 
  Seoul hopes that "they overcome this tragedy and continue to 
exert their efforts for early realization of the Palestinian 
self-rule and for settlement of permanent peace in the region 
through dialogue and reconciliation."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korean industries 
made direct investments totaling 41.7 million dollars in China 
last month on an approval basis, a Bank of Korea material showed 
on Friday. The investments were in 64 projects and represent a 
94.9 percent increase over last year's January. 
  Since November 1988 when Korean industries began to invest 
in 
China, South Korean industries' investments in China totaled 
999.6 million dollars in 1,104 cases as of the end of last 
January. 
  It accounted for 13.7 percent of the total investments of 
7,276.4 million dollars made by South Korean industries abroad 
during the same period. 
  The sharply increased investment in China in the recent past 
was owing to the fact that many industries have moved away from 
ASEAN countries to China attracted by cheap wages and improved 
investment climate there following diplomatic normalization 
between Seoul and Beijing. 
  In contrast, investment conditions in ASEAN countries have 
deteriorated lately due chiefly to sharp wage increase and 
cut-throat competition among Korean industries, a business 
source said.

  [Text] The government is in trouble in dealing with 
remnants of last December's GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade) world trade accord as the world's trading powers are 
holding back the submission of their country schedules. Korea 
was initially scheduled to submit its country schedule to GATT 
on February 15 but has since been delaying its submission as the 
United States and Japan locked horns over the issue of 
abolishing tariffs on some products. 
  While delaying the submission of its country schedule, Korea 
has come under strong pressure from opposition political parties 
and the general public to reopen negotiations on the concluded 
Uruguay Round trade accord. On the surface, the government 
rules out the possibility of reopening GATT talks, saying the 
U.S. and Japan will submit their country schedules shortly after 
resolving the tariff problem. 
  Government officials say the latest trade friction between 
Washington and Tokyo won't escalate into such a point where last 
December's GATT accord will be nullified. The trade friction 
between the two countries emerged as Japan backed down from its 
earlier promises in the Uruguay Round of trade talks by 
proposing withdrawing tariff concessions in its country schedule. 
  After Japan committed itself to withdrawing its earlier 
tariff concessions on imported wood products, the U.S. made a 
similar action by revoking its promise to abolish tariffs on 
some imported electronic products including semiconductors. 
  As the two countries are locked in a battle over the tariff 
problem, Korea is now withholding submitting its country 
schedule, keeping a close watch on how the U.S. and Japan act. 
But the government's "cautious action" has aroused public 
opinion urging the government to consider reopening talks on 
last December's GATT accord. 
  A call for reopening GATT talks is gaining strong momentum 
as 
last December's accord is accepted as unsatisfactory, especially 
in the field of farm trade in which Korea was obligated to open 
its rice market to imported goods for the first time in its 
history. 
  Reopening GATT talks has emerged as a political issue after 
Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang hinted at the possibility of 
reopening GATT talks at the ongoing extraordinary session of the 
National Assembly only on the condition that the world's 
economic powers withdraw their already-promised concessions. 
But officials at the Economic Planning Board [EPB] are 
skeptical about the possibility that the entire textbook of last 
December's GATT accord will be nullified. 
  "The latest trade battle between Washington and Tokyo is 
nothing but a tempest in a teacup and won't put the whole GATT 
accord at jeopardy," an EPB official said. The official said 
Korea will take similar action to what the other economic powers 
do. 
  "If the U.S. and Japan withdraw their tariff concessions, 
Korea will also revoke its earlier promise to abolish tariffs on 
imported semiconductors and copper," he said. But most 
government officials say it will be all but impossible to 
rewrite the textbook on world farm trade, an issue in which 
Koreans have keen interest. 
  "Only when other countries try to revise the farm trade 
accord, will we consider taking similar action, but at the 
moment no one is trying to do so," the EPB said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 26 
February publishes on page 5 a 1,300 word article on President 
Kim Yong-sam's remarks made during a news conference on 25 
February on the summit talks with North Korea and states that 
they are causing considerable confusion, particularly within the 
government departments in charge of North Korean relations. The 
article points out that the president's remarks will inevitably 
result in the adjustment of the repeated three conditions in 
resolving the nuclear issue: First, the retreat from the 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty; Second, 
acceptance of International Atomic Energy Agency inspections; 
and Third, agreement on mutual inspections between the South and 
the North. 
  The article goes on to say that the related government 
departments are embarrassed by the president's remarks deeming 
them as "spontaneous" rather than well studied and planned in 
advance. 
  The author of the article points out that although Chong 
Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for security affairs, 
tried to extensively explain that this does not run counter to 
the government's past North Korean policy, his effort only 
highlights the difference between the president's past and 
present remarks regarding the nuclear issue and summit talks. 
  Recalling President Kim's remarks made at the 100-day news 
conference on 3 June, 1993 when he said "We cannot shake hands 
with someone who possesses nuclear arms" and in his inauguration 
speech on 25 February, 1993 when he said "I could meet with Kim 
Il-song anytime, anywhere" the reporter notes that it could be 
said that there have been temporary changes in policy but that 
the president's philosophy of the national issue remains 
unchanged. However, he adds, what embarrassed officials in 
charge of North Korean affairs was that the remarks were made at 
a sensitive time when the North Korea-U.S. contacts in New York 
were ongoing. The article asserts that the president's remarks 
caused suspicion over the consistency of the government policy 
on North Korea and may affect North Korea's strategy on contacts 
with the United States. 
  The article notes that the concern over the consistency of 
the president's North Korean policy is also based on the 
president's contradicting remarks made on two occasions at the 
Asia Pacific Economic Council on 24 February and during the 26 
June interview with the BBC. The article says that in the 
former, Kim Yong-sam said "the North Korean issue should be 
resolved in the view of partnership for the prosperity of Asia 
Pacific," and in the latter, he said "the ROK is fully prepared 
for the potential of military conflict." 
  The author of the article explains that some believe that 
President Kim's frequent change of position is for "domestic 
use" but it will be difficult for the working-level officials to 
establish consistent policy if the supreme leader is shaken. 
  Finally, the article states that as far as the North Korean 
policy is concerned, the president should have a firm philosophy 
regardless of the public opinion and have frequent conversations 
with the senior presidential secretary for foreign and security 
affairs and reunification-related ministers so that they can 
properly assist the president.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- The Director of the 
Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], Kim Tok, said 
Monday the NSP plans to strengthen counter-espionage activities 
in order to protect national secrets and advanced technological 
information. Speaking before the National Defense Committee of 
the National Assembly, Kim said the NSP will also carry out a 
five-year intelligence-gathering plan to cope with "the era of 
information." 
  "We will consistently try to improve our ability to collect 
and analyze intelligence information while diversifying channels 
for exchanges of information as soon as possible," Kim told 
lawmakers. 
  With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, Kim said, 
"there is a long way to go before transparency of their nuclear 
program is objectively guaranteed." 
  "The agency will strengthen a 24-hour early warning system 
against North Korean provocation in view of the adventurous and 
provocative character inherent in the North Korean regime," Kim 
said. 
  At the same time, the agency will boost cooperation in 
exchanging information with international organizations and 
friendly nations, Kim said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 26 (YONHAP) -- The Ministry of 
Information on Saturday finalized its reorganization plan 
featuring the creation of a "New Media Bureau" to promote cable 
television, satellite broadcasting and multi-media. The 
ministry announced that under the revamp, a general information 
office will replace the existing public information policy 
office to better handle informative programs on state affairs. 
The general information office will also sample public opinion 
for speedy reflection in government policies. 
  Moreover, the existing Press Administration Bureau and 
Broadcasting Administration Bureau will be merged into one Press 
and Broadcasting Bureau tasked with supportive administration 
instead of regulation-oriented programs. 
  Under the plan, the Advertisement Promotion Bureau will be 
renamed as the Media Industries Bureau, and the Public Relations 
Bureau as the Public Opinions Bureau. The reorganization 
further envisages turning the Korean Overseas Information 
Service [KOIS] into a sort of national image center. As offices 
charged with collecting, analyzing and distributing various 
information at home and abroad, an information material division 
will be set up under the public opinions bureau for domestic 
data. 
  For data from abroad, an overseas information division will 
be established at the KOIS. 
  In addition, the national film production center will be 
reorganized into the national video production center, focusing 
on production of cable television and video programs instead of 
solely making motion pictures. 
  "Under the reorganization, our ministry's 
administration-oriented programs have been slashed sharply and 
instead we will have new duties to effectively support the 
development of new media and to help the nation better cope with 
market opening," a ministry official said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- Sinsegi Mobile of Pohang 
Iron and Steel Co. (Posco) will take the main stake in the 
soon-to-be-launched single consortium for the second mobile 
telephone network, the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) 
announced Monday. 
  Posco reportedly won because of its technology and capital, 
while Kolon pressed the argument that the steelmaker is 
semi-state-run and therefore cannot control the new private 
cellular phone network. 
  Second Mobile of the Kolon Group, Posco's sole competitor, 
will instead have to be satisfied with holding the second 
biggest share. 
  FKI was commissioned to form a single consortium for the 
multibillion-dollar project within this month by the 
Communications Ministry at the end of last year. 
  In their first chance to show unity, many business groups 
gave up the chase for the dominant stake in the consortium to 
avoid fierce competition. 
  The Sunkyong Group, whose chairman Choe Chong-hyon is also 
chairman of FKI, took the initiative by announcing his group's 
surrender of the second mobile phone project, which it won in 
August 1992 but was forced to give up amid alleged political 
favoritism. 
  Its Taehan Telecom instead vied for the main stake in Korea 
Mobile Telecom, the solid cellular phone monopoly that is to be 
privatized.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- The majority of South 
Koreans give a favorable assessment of President Kim Yong-sam's 
first year in office, but his approval rating has still slumped 
to around 50 percent from over 80 percent on the 100th day of 
his presidency last June, according to polls conducted Thursday 
by major vernacular newspapers to mark Kim's first anniversary. 
  A plurality say that Kim's top accomplishments were the 
implementation of the real-name financial system and his reform 
campaign, while criticizing his failure to stabilize prices and 
hammer out appropriate agricultural measures in the wake of the 
Uruguay Round accord. A large number believe Kim's 
determination to achieve reform has weakened from his early days 
in office. 
  Compared with 80.8 percent last June, just 50.1 percent 
applauded Kim's management of state affairs over the past year 
with 12.5 percent saying he did very well, according to a 
telephone poll by the TONG-A ILBO. His greatest achievement was 
hailed as the real-name system (70.5 percent), followed by the 
anti-corruption and discipline campaign (54.9 percent), military 
reform (54 percent) and improvement of public services (43 
percent). 
  Price stability was widely cited as Kim's top failure (87.6 
percent), trailed by agriculture policy (59.5 percent), 
revitalization of the economy (51.6 percent), environmental 
protection (38.4 percent) and anti-crime measures (37.5 
percent), according to the TONG-A poll. Some 69 percent say 
they hope to see the Kim administration do better in improving 
the economy, with 49.1 percent calling for price stability. 
  In the same vein, 40.4 percent think the economy has 
worsened, four times the 10.1 percent of last June. 
  Assessing Kim's determination to carry out reform, 44.7 
percent said it has weakened while 49 percent said the president 
remained equally steadfast. 
  Kim claimed a better approval rating of 62.3 percent in the 
poll by the CHUNGANG daily news, but that was still below the 
83.6 percent recorded last June. While a plurality voiced 
satisfaction with Kim's first year, 44 percent answered 
negatively in assessing the accomplishments of his reform 
policy, compared with a 42.6-percent positive response. 
  Kim's government failed again at attaining price stability 
(59.2 percent) in CHUNGANG's telephone poll, while a majority 
said the attitude of politicans and public servants had 
improved. But most were disappointed in the economy and 
inter-Korean relations. 
  Some 38 percent felt the president did well during his first 
year in office, while 16 percent said the opposite in a poll of 
1,200 men and women across the nation conducted by the 
KYONGHYANG daily news. However, 46 percent answered that Kim did 
just so-so. His greatest feat was implementation of the 
real-name system (51.3 percent) followed by revision of the 
public servants' ethics law (21.6 percent). Spiraling prices 
again ranked as Kim's worst failure, followed by the decision to 
open the rice market (23.8 percent) and the economy's lack of 
improvement (12.1 percent). 
  Meanwhile, 39.7 percent said Kim's reform policy did little 
to improve their everyday lives while 17.4 percent thought the 
opposite. A total of 46.8 percent said the economy was no 
better than last year while 25.8 percent said it has grown worse.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- The government pledged 
Friday to continue its fight against quasi-journalists until 
every last one of them is wiped out. 
  Vice Information Minister Yi Kyong-chae presided over a 
related commitee meeting that agreed to keep a close watch on 
articles in local newspapers regarding next year's elections for 
regional governors and mayors, and to take strong 
administratitve action against publishing violations such as 
advance election campaigning or defamation. 
  The committee, comprising directors-general of the Home and 
Labor Ministries, Prosecutor-General's Office, Office of 
National Tax Administration, National Police Agency and Office 
of Legislation, decided to act strongly against local dailies 
and weeklies carrying provocative and lewd articles and 
photographs. 
  It will conduct a national survey on quasi-media twice this 
year and a comprehensive study of weekly newspapers and 
magazines, as well as closely monitoring insolvent publishing 
companies and areas with frequent reports on quasi-journalists. 
  Through third-round surveys last year, the committee 
cancelled the registrations of two newspapers, stopped eight 
local papers from publishing and arrested 200 quasi-journalists.

  [Text] Dear Listeners: A cease-fire agreement was signed 
yesterday between the Burmese Government and the Kachin rebels. 
KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] spokeswoman Sam Raw 
expressed the KIO's view on this matter to the BBC by telephone: 
  [Begin Sam Raw recording] The KIO believes that all armed 
organizations who advocate the non-disintegration of the union 
will be able to cease fighting in the same way the KIO has 
ceased fighting against the SLORC [State Law and Order 
Restoration Council]. The participation of all these 
organizations is indispensable if the political problems are to 
be resolved at the table through discussions. That is why a 
nationwide cease-fire is necessary, as I have just mentioned -- 
to allow these organizations to participate in the discussions. 
We also strongly believe that, in resolving the political 
problems at the table through discussions, the problems can be 
resolved one by one if all organizations, all political 
organizations, and all national ethnic groups approach matters 
with good intentions and genuine goodwill. [end recording]

  [Text] Malaysia's decision not to award all 
government-related contracts to British companies could result 
in the British companies losing 3.5 to 4 billion pounds or an 
equivalent of 16 billion ringgit for projects over a six-year 
period. Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Annwar Ibrahim said the 
companies, which accompanied British Prime Minister John Major's 
visit to Malaysia in September last year and which had signed 
several memorandums of understanding (MOU) and intent letters, 
had yet to sign the actual agreements. 
  He said one of the companies is (Balfour Beckley), a British 
company which heads the British-Japanese consortium for the 
construction of the Kuala Lumpur international airport at Sepang 
at a cost of about 9 billion ringgit. 
  With the exclusion of Britain from the consortium, a new bid 
will be issued soon for the construction of the project. He was 
addressing a news conference to announce the cabinet's decision 
stating that the Malaysian Government will not award any new 
contracts to British companies. 
  The cabinet made the decision in view of the British media, 
which hurled unfounded criticisms at Malaysia and its leaders 
and also at the British leaders. The media reports indicated 
that most of the major projects involved British companies that 
embarked on dishonest agreements and the corrupt leaders of the 
two countries. 
  All British companies that had signed MOU's or intent 
letters 
were duly informed of the new ruling. However, the new ruling 
does not include services, administrative meetings, and 
education. 
  Mr Major's visit was aimed at boosting his country's 
economic 
relations with Malaysia. Five MOU's, which were signed with the 
British companies, could create 25,000 employment opportunities, 
which are badly needed by the sluggish British economy. 
  Meanwhile, British Government sources stated in London that 
a 
senior diplomat was expected to be sent to Kuala Lumpur soon to 
try to coax Malaysia into withdrawing its decision, which could 
make the British firms lose several million pounds. Malaysia's 
decision could also result in a huge number of workers losing 
their jobs. Chancellor Kenneth Clark pleaded with and urged 
Malaysia to understand that the British newspapers are not 
controlled by the British Government, contrary to the situation 
in Malaysia. The governments or trade deals had become the 
victims of what was published in the newspapers. He said trade 
with Malaysia is important, and economic relations between the 
two countries are also important to Malaysia. 
  Mr Clark told the BBC that Malaysia would return to its 
previous good and warm relationship with Britain.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 26 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Friday night Malaysia's 
decision to exclude British companies from government contracts 
was a form of economic arm-twisting which we learnt from Western 
countries. 
  He said if the West could threaten to withdraw the 
Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) purportedly because 
Malaysia did not respect human rights and the environment, 
Malaysia also could do likewise. He said it was unfortunate 
that the government's action would also affect several genuine 
British companies but then we cannot take action against them 
one by one, but he believed that there were companies which had 
hurled slander at Malaysian leaders, particularly against him. 
  Dr. Mahathir said this to reporters when commenting on the 
government's decision not to award contracts to British 
companies as announced by Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim 
earlier in the day. 
  If we give contracts to British companies, we'll be accused 
of all kinds of things, he said, adding that the government 
would not seek an apology or lodge a protest over the attitude 
of the British media which he felt had played a major role in 
slandering the Government of Malaysia. 
  He said the government's decision would not affect relations 
between Kuala Lumpur and London as the government did not have 
problems with the British government. 
  We are only responding to the action of the British media. 
Apparently their media still has the colonial thinking and 
believes that non-whites can be easily bribed and can be bribed 
at anytime, even for a sum of US$50,000, Dr. Mahathir said. 
  Asked until when the Malaysian Government would adopt this 
stand, he said we'll continue with this until the British media 
changes its attitude. 
  He said only contracts which had not been signed or were in 
the process of being signed would be affected by the 
government's decision while those which had already been signed 
would be honoured. 
  Probably, in view of this decision the Kuala Lumpur 
International Airport project will be affected a little but, 
never mind. Others can carry it out, he said. An Anglo-Japanese 
consortium is involved in the airport project. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the British High Commissioner met him this 
evening to persuade the government to review its decision but he 
felt that Duncan Slater's move came too late as the decision had 
already been made and announced. 
  He said Slater regretted the latest development. 
  Asked whether Malaysia was prepared for retaliatory action 
from the British Media, Dr. Mahathir said we'll wait and see 
further developments. 
  Dr. Mahathir said he felt that the government's action was a 
lesson to the free press of the West which, in the end, could be 
abused to the detriment of the nation. 
  He said the Malaysian Government supported press freedom but 
such freedom should go along with responsibility. He said that 
in Malaysia the press was very responsible. 
  The prime minister said that initially the government 
tolerated the attitude of the British media even in their 
attempt to topple the government of Prime Minister John Major 
but when it tried to involve Malaysia's interests, effective 
action had to be taken. 
  Initially we were patient, they tried to involve us with 
Pergau [Dam project], MOU [Memoradum of Understanding], BMF 
[Bumiputra Malaysia Finance] and others, more so with 
allegations of corruption to the extent we cannot accept it 
anymore, he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir said he felt that among the media involved in 
hurling such slander was that owned by Rupert Murdoch. 
  He said he wanted the British media to report only the truth 
and not twist their reports with nonsense. 
  This (reporting the truth) they cannot do because they do 
not 
understand what is meant by the truth, he said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb.26 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
companies which have teamed up with British contractors to 
undertake government privatised projects would have to cease 
their partnerships following the government's decision to stop 
awarding new contracts to British companies. 
  Stating this here Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar 
Ibrahim said Malaysian companies would now have to renegotiate 
with new contracting partners if they wanted to bid for such 
projects in future. 
  The government's move would not, however, affect existing 
two-way trade and investments between both countries, he told a 
press conference after chairing the National Finance Council 
meeting here. 
  The decision follows the government's concern over adverse 
reports in certain British newspapers which suggested that some 
Malaysian leaders were corrupt.

  [Text] Ipoh, Malaysia Feb. 26 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia's 
Transport Minister Dr Ling Liong Sik said Saturday British media 
reports of allegations that Malaysian leaders were corrupt must 
be addressed first above the question of whether the new Kuala 
Lumpur international airport in Sepang would be completed in 
time. 
  He said: The question of the RM8 billion [Malaysian 
currency] 
(RM2.7; U.S.$1) airport is irrelevant. Whether it will be ready 
in time is not the issue because the reports were very damaging 
to the nation and its leaders. 
  It is a very serious issue, especially when it involved 
leaders, including the prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed. 
  Dr Ling commenting on the cabinet decision Friday to stop 
giving new contracts to British companies, particularly those 
involving government aid or assistance. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who announced the 
decision, said that all agreements with British companies that 
had been signed would be honoured. 
  Dr Ling said it was very disappointing that the media in 
Britain acted in such an irresponsible manner towards the 
leaders of a friendly trading nation with which it had 
historical ties. 
  He said the government was right in imposing the sanction 
against British companies, especially when the reports were 
disgusting and untrue. 
  Asked about the future of the Anglo-Japanese airport 
consortium (AJAC) involved in the construction of the airport, 
he said: The A (Anglo) might be out while the J (Japanese) will 
remain. 
  The modern airport, equipped with the latest facilities, was 
scheduled for completion in 1997. 
  Dr Ling also noted that as far as his ministry was concerned 
British companies would not be offered projects.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 28 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia's 
decision not to award new government contracts to British 
companies continues to receive attention with several leaders 
saying that it will not affect the country's economy. 
  They felt that the current robust economy would enable 
Malaysia to continue to enjoy growth in investments from other 
countries. 
  They were also confident that the country's economy would 
remain strong even if Britain decides that Malaysia no longer 
qualifies for overseas aid schemes like the Pergau dam project. 
  Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Britain could do as 
it 
pleased, saying that the decision will not affect our economy. 
  Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim 
announced Friday the cabinet's decision not to award new 
contracts to British companies following British newspapers' 
allegation that certain Malaysian leaders were corrupt. 
  Energy, Telecommunications, and Post Minister S. Samy Vellu 
said the British companies stood to lose projects worth 1.5 
billion ringgit (about U.S.$555 million) from his ministry. 
  On Saturday, all the state governments expressed their 
support for the cabinet decision at a meeting of the national 
financial council chaired by Anwar. 
  At the meeting, all the state governments agreed to 
implement 
the decision. 
  British companies are expected to lose billions of ringgit 
in 
projects, including the 9-billion-ringgit (about U.S. $3.33 
billion) international airport construction project in Sepang, 
following the cabinet directive.

  [Text] The Malaysian Government's action to bar British 
firms from government-funded projects is not a trade barrier or 
sanction. International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Sri 
Rafidah Aziz said Malaysia had not imposed any trade barrier or 
sanction as had been misconstrued by the British press. She 
told reporters after attending her ministry's annual dialogue 
with trade and industry bodies in Kuala Lumpur that Malaysia's 
action mainly centered on not entertaining tenders from British 
companies for government tenders and this is its right. The 
action does not directly affect the normal run of business 
between private sectors of Britain and Malaysia. 
  As for transactions between the British and Malaysia's 
private sectors, this is proceeding well in the open market. 
She said Malaysia's action only pertained to British companies 
which intended to do business with the Malaysian Government.

  [Text] The ban on British companies in the awarding of 
government contracts is not expected to have any repercussion on 
trade between both countries. Primary Industries Minister Datuk 
Sri Dr Lim Keng Yaik said this to newsmen after opening the 17th 
council meeting of the Malaysian Timber Organization, MTO, in 
Kuala Lumpur. He pointed out that the move stemming from the 
irresponsible action of the British media is necessary, as 
Malaysia cannot go and fight head on with the British media. 
The British press have been making various insinuations against 
Malaysia's leadership, particularly the prime minister, Datuk 
Sri Dr Mahathir Mohamed. Such remarks could only come from 
people who are biased against Malaysia. Datuk Sri Dr Lim added 
that the West is [word indistinct] skeptical at the success of 
the East.

  [Text] The government's decision not to award contracts to 
British firms should be viewed as a move to protect the 
country's integrity and not in terms of the financial loss or 
gain that will arise from it. Deputy Home Minister Datuk Megat 
Junid Megat Ayob said the government will never compromise when 
it comes to defending the integrity of the country. The 
government's move has been prompted by the lies spread by the 
British media. 
  Datuk Megat Junid was speaking to newsmen after meeting 
trainees of the dadah [drugs] aftercare center in Kampung Gajah,

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Fri [25 February] -- Bilateral trade 
between Malaysia and Britain has been on the uptrend since 1988 
with the balance of trade in the latter's favour all the while. 
  In the first nine months of last year, two-way trade 
amounted 
to RM [Malaysian ringgit] 6.5 billion. Although statistics for 
the whole of 1993 are still not available, last year's total 
trade between the two nations may well surpass the previous 
year's figures. 
  In 1992, Malaysia's imports from Britain totalled RM4.14 
billion. Its exports were RM2.55 billion. 
  Malaysia buys electrical equipment, power generators and 
heavy industrial machinery from Britain. Malaysia on the other 
hand, sells primary commodities, machinery, telecommunication 
equipment, garments and apparel, accessories and sawn timber to 
Britain. 
  Statistics show that bilateral trade between Britain and 
Malaysia has been particularly strong in the past four to five 
years reaching its peak in 1991 with total trade surpassing 
RM4.4 million. 
  During the same period, British investments in Malaysia have 
also increased significantly to almost RM900 million in 1990 
compared to RM750 million in 1989. 
  Following stiff competition from other foreign investors, 
particularly Japanese, Taiwanese as well as American, British 
investors have taken a back seat -- resulting in a downtrend in 
investments since 1991. 
  British investments in Malaysia dropped to below RM300 
million in 1992. Nevertheless, Britain remained the largest 
European investor in Malaysia. 
  The current trade figures between the two countries are 
indeed a far cry from the days when Malaysia launched the "Buy 
British Last" policy in October 1981. 
  Although officials maintained that trade to and from Britain 
was not really affected during the period, there was only 
marginal increase in total trade. 
  For instance, bilateral trade was barely above RM2 billion 
in 
1981, 1982 and 1983. 
  This was because the private sector continued to purchase 
British goods as they were priced competitively amidst the 
depreciating pound sterling. 
  The "Buy British Last" policy was introduced following 
accumulative "irritants" that the country faced in its relations 
with Britain and British companies. 
  The breaking point was when the British Government announced 
a substantial increase in student fees which severely affected 
more than 15,000 Malaysian students in Britain. 
  Other factors which had triggered the policy included the 
failure of British companies to comply with the requirement of 
the National Economic Policy and the landing rights for Malaysia 
Airlines (MAS). 
  The policy called for all British contracts to be vetted 
thoroughly by the Prime Minister's Department together with the 
second choice non-British bidder. 
  Realising that the policy had caused British companies 
countless lucrative government contracts, the then British 
premier Margaret Thatcher personally intervened to patch things 
up.

  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Wed. [23 February] -- The army is 
planning to replace the present 1,500 Malaysian Battalion 
(Malbatt) troops serving under the United Nations Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the army had 
yet to identify which unit would take over the peacekeeping 
duties from the Third Royal Armoured Regiment, which was sent 
there in batches from last September 21. 
  He said the troops needed to be relieved after undergoing a 
lot of tension and stress for long periods at designated 
battle-zones. 
  Under the present arrangement with UNPROFOR, the troops are 
expected to serve for between a year and 18 months. But their 
stay could be prolonged depending on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He was speaking to reporters after meeting Canadian Minister 
for Industry, Commerce, Science, and Technology Gerald Tremblay 
at his office today. 
  Najib said two consignments of Hari Raya [end of Ramadan] 
gift parcels, army vehicles, and equipment would be sent to 
Malaysian troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia. 
  One consignment would be flown to the Malbatt troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on Sunday while the other consignment of army 
logistics would be shipped to Mogadishu tomorrow. 
  "Due to the lack of air flights between the countries, many 
of our soldiers in Somalia go to neighbouring countries for 
their holidays. The two most common places they frequent are 
Mombasa and Nairobi." 
  Najib also said the cabinet decided today to contribute U.S. 
$100,000 in clothes and medication for victims of last 
Wednesday's earthquake in Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake 
killed more than 200 people and injured 1,000. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Palestine Liberation Organization is 
recalling all its negotiators with Israel and Egypt, Paris, and 
Washington. The PLO leadership decided on this during a meeting 
in Tunis. The move follows the Hebron mass massacre by a Jewish 
settler, who killed over 50 people. [passage omitted] 
  Singapore has condemned the massacre. The Foreign Ministry 
called on Israel to immediately impose security measures to 
protect the population of West Bank from such criminal act by 
extremists. Singapore also adds that Israel and the PLO should 
not allow the act of violence to derail the Middle East peace 
process. Less fights would speed up progress at the peace 
talks. The spokesman said this is the best way to prevent more 
killings and the acts of revenge, which would only further 
inflame emotion and delay and complicate the peace negotiations.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 26 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The House of 
Representatives (DPR) on Saturday appealed to the world 
community to condemn the massacre of Palestinian worshipers at a 
Ibrahimi mosque in Al Khalil (Hebron) by a Jewish settler on 
Friday. "That's uncivilized and brutal act. It not only 
violates but also shrugs off human rights," said Theo Sambuaga, 
who is the deputy chairman of the House Commission I overseeing 
foreign affairs, information and defence and security. 
  Witnesses said a Jewish settler firing an automatic riffle 
killed at least 48 Palestinians and wounded dozens at prayer in 
Ibrahimi mosque on Friday. But the PLO claimed the death toll 
reached 103 and 270 people were wounded. 
  Sambuaga said all communities elsewhere in the world, 
including the United States, should condemn the masacre which 
was the biggest single killing of Palestinians since Israel 
captured the West Bank and Gaza strip in 1967. "The world 
community should thoroughly investigate Israel and should openly 
announce the result of the investigation to the world 
community," Sambuaga said. The mass killing of innocent 
Palestinians became cause for deep concern and apparently gave a 
blow to the peace accord reached by the two conflicting 
countries, he said. In fact, the peace accord had been the hope 
of the international community, he said. 
  Meanwhile, Agus Tagor, another member of the House's 
Commission I, is of the opinion that such tragic events have 
been occurring in the conflict involving the two countries so 
far. "However, we are hopeful for the peace process because the 
key for the solution is peace," he said. "We condemn the 
massacre. However, all sides must control themselves, moreover 
during the fasting month of Ramadan," he added. 
  Theo Sambuaga said he did not understand what Israel 
actually 
wants because every time there is a peace initiative, criminal 
acts which are contradictive to peace, always prevail. "Israel 
should be honest in dealing with the problem," He stated, adding 
that all countries including the United States should pressure 
Israel to open the case fairly. He is of the view that it is 
naive if the Israeli Government said that those should be 
responsible are individuals. 
  A spokesman of the PLO in Tunis said that the massacre was 
led by an Israeli army captain.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 28 (ANTARA) -- A legislator here on 
Monday called for rejection of any official invitations from 
Israel, saying the Jewish state intends to show only good things 
but hide the real situation. "Various official invitations from 
the Israeli Government should be reviewed or rejected because 
the aim of the visit is just to show good things," Aisyah Aminy, 
the House's Foreign Affairs Commission chairperson, said in 
response to the massacre of at least 43 Palestinians at a prayer 
at Ibrahim ar-Rahman mosque in Al Khalil (Hebron). 
  After the signing of the Israeli-PLO peace accord in 
Washington DC. in September last year, Israel has been active 
in launching approaches to a number of states, including 
Indonesia, to persuade them to open diplomatic ties with Israel. 
The Jewish state has invited certain professional circles 
including journalists, to visit Israel. A number of Indonesian 
journalists visited Israel recently at the invitation of Israel. 
Aminy said that Israeli invitations was an effort to break 
isolation of the Jewish state with the rest of the world 
communities. 
  She said that an invitation for journalists by Israel in the 
future has to be considered seriously before accepting it. The 
legislator said that recent massacre in Al Khalil is a result of 
the Israeli action which -- in violation of the United Nations 
resolutions 471 and 476 -- bans its citizens overseas to return 
to their countries of origin but to the occupied territories. 
  Baruch Goldstein who did the massacre is a Jewish immigrant 
who belongs to an anti-Arab organization. Among Jews resettling 
in the Palestinian land are anti-Arab extremists, including 
Goldstein who poured bullets on Palestinian at prayers last 
Friday. 
  "Indonesia must condemn the brutal act, and I believe the 
incident in the Ibrahim ar-Rahman Mosque will hamper the Middle 
East peace process," she said. 
  The shooting at the mosque was possible due to the fact that 
the Israeli Government allows its citizens to possess fire arms 
of various calibres. "Israeli civilians must be disarmed to 
prevent similar incident," The member of parliament said.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 26 (ANTARA) -- President Suharto in his 
capacity as chairman of Nonaligned Movement (NAM) has strongly 
rejected suggestions that would put Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
capital, Sarajevo under the UN administrative control. 
  "Such control would disregard the rights of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic to establish its sovereignty over 
its own capital," Minister/State Secretary Murdiono quoted 
President Suharto as saying here over the weekend. 
  When briefing UN Security Council Chairman Roble Olhay on 
the 
NAM chairman's attitude on Friday (25/2), the NAM chairman 
expressed deep concern over massacres, military aggressions and 
the ethnic cleansing program launched by Bosnian Serbs against 
the non-Serbian Bosnian people. He told the UN Security Council 
chairman that the continuation of the Serbs' military 
aggressions against the Bosnian people is a reflection of the 
world community's failure to implement every UN Security Council 
resolutions in the region. 
  The chairman also underlined that the UN Security Council 
should have been acting as the protector of the Bosnian 
territory and sovereignty. "The failure has even been worsening 
by the arms embargo resolution imposed on the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It meant that the Bosnians had been denied 
their very basic rights, that is, to self-defense," said Suharto. 
  The NAM chairman said that the international community 
should 
stay alert, even if the Serbs had withdrawn its artillery from 
Sarajevo following NATO's threat to launch air strikes. "We 
should stay alert till the Serbs fully withdraw from the 
besieged area," said the NAM chairman. 
  Suharto also urged the UN Security Council to hold a meeting 
on the latest development in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to take some 
concrete and effective steps to implement all relevant 
resolution on the region. In a letter to the UN Security Council 
chairman, President Suharto also touched on the need to convene 
an international conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
conference should have a streamlined structure to achieve a just 
and comprehensive solution to the issue. President Suharto and 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic last month in Jakarta 
discussed the idea of convening such an international conference. 
  Minister Murdiono said that after meeting with the UN 
Security Council chairman, President Suharto has asked the head 
of NAM Chairman Executive Board Nana Sutresna to order the 
chairman of NAM Coordinating Bureau at the UN to discuss the 
Bosnian issue with the NAM caucus at the UN Security Council. 
  Murdiono said that NAM would always be ready to take part in 
such an international conference or in a new round of talks on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Excerpt] After Harmoko was elected to the general 
chairmanship of the DPP [Executive Committee] of GOLKAR 
[Functional Group] at its Fifth National Congress and Megawati 
Soekarnoputri became the general chairman of the DPP of the PDI 
[Indonesian Democratic Party] last December, attention has now 
shifted to who will lead the PPP [United Development Party]. 
Will the PPP put forward someone new? Who will replace Buya 
Ismail and will he be capable of matching the agility shown by 
Harmoko and Megawati? 
  Although it is not yet clear what political tricks Harmoko 
and Megawati will put into action, we can make some quick 
guesses. Harmoko will probably raise the issue of poverty, which 
the Sixth Development Cabinet has made a priority. There is some 
evidence that this problem hurt GOLKAR in the eyes of the people 
in the last general election because the PDI took over the 
notion of the "little people," which is identical to poverty. On 
the other hand, Megawati might stir up the problem of 
democratization and human rights and also indirectly resurrect 
the romantic notion of her deceased father's greatness and 
advance the fervor of the "little people," something already 
brought up by Soerjadi. 
  Although the 1997 general elections are still four years 
away, they feel closer because conjecture is that the "festival 
of democracy" at the end of this century will be very intense. 
All that's left is the PPP. Will it grasp the best opportunities 
in this arena of struggle or will it allow the party to become 
smaller, trapped as it is between GOLKAR and the PDI? 
  It is clear that the appearance of Megawati on the scene is 
an indication that the current of political democratization is 
growing stronger and that the undercurrent can no longer be 
dictated to according to the will of the superstructure. The 
undercurrent is showing that it is winning and this, we can be 
certain, will burst out everywhere. We can be sure that the 
congresses to be held by the NU [Moslem Scholars Association] 
and by the PPP in 1994, for example, will be important political 
events. Various political observers have recently pointed out 
that 1994 will be a difficult year politically; this cannot be 
separated from those two events. At the same time, conjecture is 
that demonstrations on human rights, democratization, or cases 
of that kind will also continue to flare up. 
  Conjecture is that the NU congress will be very lively 
because up to now there have not been any candidates for the 
position held by Gus Dur (Abdurahman Wahid -- editor) who can 
equal the quality of his leadership. Although Gus Dur stated 
some time ago that he was not willing to be a candidate for the 
general chairmanship of the PB [Executive Committee] of the NU, 
the majority of NU's rank and file, especially the younger 
generation, still hopes that he will be prepared to lead them 
again. Things will be very lively if Gus Dur is willing to be 
put up again as a candidate on grounds that he is receiving 
strong support from the undercurrent, even if the superstructure 
seems less than willing to accept him. So it is thought that 
there will be a political clash. The problem is: Whether that 
clash will be as strong as the one in the PDI or not depends on 
how the government views it, especially as far as the interests 
of GOLKAR's political hegemony are concerned. 
  At the same time, projections are that the PPP congress will 
be even more intense because the strong current of 
democratization which is running through it will force the NU to 
reclaim its position in the PPP after having been dominated for 
such a long time by the MI [Indonesian Muslims]. It is quite 
possible that these two factions, which have been jockeying for 
position in the PPP for such a long time, are now setting up 
strategies for the upcoming congress. The NU is busy trying to 
figure out how to reclaim its dominance and the MI will make 
every effort to defend its position. Conjecture is that the 
clash will be intense and the slogan "fusion is now complete," 
promoted up to now by members of the PPP, will be tested again. 
The NU will claim its position as the PPP's largest shareholder. 
Political gamesmanship is a matter of the battle for and the 
distribution of power. Having learned from the Megawati case, 
the NU will probably not want to accept a candidate for its 
leadership who is just handed to it by the bureaucracy, i.e., by 
the MI faction, as has been done up to now. But this all depends 
on the level of NU's political independence within the PPP. Has 
it gotten to the point where it can think strategically in that 
way or can it still be easily manipulated, as it has in the past? 
  NU's desire to reclaim its position in the PPP is part of 
the 
nervousness felt by NU members at seeing the development of 
GOLKAR and of the PDI under the respective leadership of Harmoko 
and of Megawati. Only if the NU wholly returns to the PPP will 
the party be able to rise again, as when it was triumphant in 
the 1977 and 1982 general elections. 
  As is well known, the PPP has gone downhill since the 1987 
general elections, after the NU adopted the firm policy of no 
longer supporting the PPP. In fact, in the 1987 general 
elections NU figures stood shoulder to shoulder with each other 
to deflate the PPP's figures. This just shows that without the 
NU the PPP is actually just a toothless tiger, there is nothing 
in it. 
  The NU adopted a firm policy of no longer supporting the PPP 
because of the political actions of Naro, who is from the MI 
faction, towards NU figures within the PPP. It seems easy to 
ignore the fact that Naro was a government man who was 
infiltrated into the PPP to deflate that party's figures so as 
to guarantee GOLKAR's continued political hegemony as the 
"single majority party". It is quite clear that Naro's political 
maneuvers were intended to push the NU somewhat out of the PPP 
and over into GOLKAR. This is quite natural because GOLKAR needs 
strong roots and GOLKAR knows that no group has stronger 
underground roots than the NU. Isn't GOLKAR just a "banyan 
tree"--and note that this is NU's symbol--which, no matter how 
big it is, cannot be sturdy without fertile "soil"? 
  Before it merged with the PPP, the general elections of 1955 
and of 1971 proved that the NU was strong. In the 1955 general 
election, for example, the NU took third place with 45 seats, 
behind the PNI [Indonesian Nationalist Party] and Masyumi. In 
the 1971 general election the strong political forces which had 
been victorious during Bung Karno's time, such as the PNI and 
Masyumi (which became Parmusi [Indonesian Moslem Party]/MI), 
became weaker, except for the NU, which still held its own. 
Because of its sturdy roots, NU's power could not be shaken even 
though it was hit by various political crises. 
  On grounds of a program of political restructuring, the NU 
was forced to merge with the PPP together with other small 
Islamic political parties. It must be admitted that when the PPP 
was created, the NU was the dominant faction compared with the 
other parties. It is not an exaggeration to say that the keys to 
the PPP's strategic politics at that time were held by 
charismatic NU figures. 
  The NU was unable to face up to this program and was forced 
to merge into the PPP. Even though it was predicted from the 
start that the party would be dogged by internal conflicts, it 
turned out that the NU was able to smooth them over in order to 
face an even greater battle: winning the general election. But 
when Naro entered the picture, NU politicians could no longer 
continue to tolerate them. 
  The firm policy of not supporting a particular political 
party--the PPP--allowed NU members to make their own political 
decisions. In the 1987 general elections GOLKAR's spectacular 
rise was actually closely connected to the contributions made by 
NU rank and file, most of whom changed their political choice 
from the PPP to GOLKAR. NU politicians struggled to support 
GOLKAR in hopes that the NU, the largest mass organization in 
the country, would get a sufficient political reward. 
  But it seems that NU's strong support of GOLKAR in the 1987 
general elections was not welcomed in any significant way. It is 
clear that temporary use was made of the NU in the interests of 
the 1987 general elections and that afterwards it was disposed 
of again. Ironically, many NU figures were willing to be 
manipulated in that way when they sacrificed the support of the 
rank and file who made a large contribution to GOLKAR's victory. 
In turn, the break in GOLKAR-NU relations could no longer be 
avoided and it seems that the NU no longer fully supported 
GOLKAR in the 1992 general elections, which resulted in a drop 
in the number of votes for that party, especially in the NU's 
base, for example in East Java. 
  Conjecture is that the strained relationship between GOLKAR 
and the NU will mean that NU politicians, for example younger 
figures such as Slamet Effendy Yusuf, will not be among GOLKAR's 
leaders in the period 1993 to 1998. If NU politicians are not 
among GOLKAR's leaders in the period 1993 to 1998, conjectures 
are that the relationship between the NU and GOLKAR will become 
even worse. That is why it is possible that the NU's rank and 
file will return in droves to the PPP at the next general 
election. 
  It is clear that at the 1994 PPP congress the NU, as the 
largest shareholder, will reclaim its position at the top of the 
party leadership. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lhokseumawe [Aceh] 16 January, MERDEKA--Through 
basic agricultural reform during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the 
Regency of Aceh Utara [North Aceh] will try to improve the 
economic welfare of its 850,000 people. Regent H. Karimujddin 
Hasjbullah stated that agricultural reform is being considered 
to deal with a difficult period as collections under the PBB 
[Tax on Land and Buildings] from the agricultural sector decline 
when production from the Arun natural gas field comes to an end, 
about nine years from now. 
  The regent made this statement on 12 January at his first 
meeting with reporters in 1994. The statement was made in 
connection with the concern felt by a number of community 
leaders about how to deal with the situation after the natural 
gas deposits run out. He emphasized that Aceh Utara will 
certainly have difficulty obtaining development funds after the 
natural gas deposits in the Arun field dry up. At present this 
vital project in Aceh Utara provides about 25 billion rupiahs in 
PBB taxes annually. 
  Regent Karimuddin Hasjbullah stated that the first priority 
and central point of emphasis in future development will be 
agriculture, concentrating on horticultural and agricultural 
estate production, in addition to continuing to develop the 
output of paddy and soy beans. The production of these crops has 
increased since several technical irrigation projects have begun 
to function. What remains to be done, requiring attention and 
follow-through, is an effort to deal with the marketing of these 
crops. Until now this has always been a problem for the farmers. 
  According to the regent, half of the PAD (basic provincial 
tax income) has come from the payment of PBB taxes by vitally 
important companies in the Lhokseumawe industrial zone, such as 
Mobil Oil Indonesia (MOI), Parun Natural Gas Ltd., PT Pupuk 
Iskandar Muda (PIM), PT [limited company] ASEAN Aceh Fertilizers 
(several types of fertilizer), and PT Kertas Kraft Aceh (KKA) 
[Aceh Kraft Paper Company]. He said: "When the natural gas 
deposits dry up, provincial income will decline. Until now gas 
production has supported the steady implementation of 
development activity. However, we should not be too pessimistic." 
  Karimuddin continued that, in view of the natural resource 
potential of the area, it is only the agricultural sector which 
could bring in new resources to replace declining PBB tax 
revenue from the mining sector, which will be forced to halt 
operations altogether. However, to strengthen the economic basis 
of the agricultural sector, the regional government must 
stimulate agricultural development, beginning now. To do that, 
large amounts of money and hard work will be needed. 
  Most affected by the drying up of the natural gas wells is 
the Regency of Aceh Utara. Meanwhile, nine other regencies in 
Aceh and the Aceh provincial government itself will also lose 
PBB tax revenues from the mining sector. However, the other 
regencies have become used to shortages and limitations 
affecting their budgets, and the consequences will not be 
particularly felt. 
  Dr. M. Djakfar G. Hatta, a staff assistant of the regent for 
the economic sector who was formerly chairman of the North Aceh 
Regional Development Board, said that Aceh Utara will be very 
seriously affected because about half of the budget, which at 
present ranges between 55 billion and 62 billion rupiahs 
annually, will be lost. Meanwhile, the Aceh provincial 
government still has rather large additional sources of revenue, 
such as city taxes, the motor vehicle tax, and tax receipts from 
other large industries. 
  In fact, Aceh Utara has a rather large amount of 
agricultural 
land. However, since the Arun natural gas field was discovered 
in 1972, all groups have concentrated on gas and easy money and 
have not paid attention to what must be done for the good of the 
regency. No one thought that the natural gas wells would dry up 
in 20 years or so. Agricultural fields were forgotten, and 
agricultural development was delayed for 10 years. 
  Djakfar G. Hatta supported the regent's view that Aceh Utara 
must rebuild the economic strength of the agricultural sector to 
what it once was. However, he went on to say, this effort will 
be increasingly difficult because the majority of the farmers 
have abandoned their agricultural fields, and some of the land 
has been sold. The farmers now work as laborers. Meanwhile, 
thousands of hectares of rice land have been used for the 
industrial zone. 
  Regent Karimuddin Hasjbullah stated that in the large 
agricultural plantation subsector Cot Girek Plantation IX is 
carrying on an overall diversification program, converting some 
of its land planted to sugar cane and rubber to oil palms. At 
present the estate agricultural company is building a modern 
factory for processing palm oil which is expected to go into 
production in 1994. In addition to planting its own oil palm 
area Cot Girek Plantation also needs oil palm seeds produced by 
individual farmers and under the PIR [Smallholder Nuclear 
Plantation] program. 
  According to the regent, the District of Kuta Makmur is now 
moving quickly to become an oil palm plantation area. Many small 
and medium-sized businessmen are establishing oil palm 
plantations. Meanwhile, local people are also beginning to plant 
oil palm trees. He said: "Efforts like these will support an 
improvement in community economic welfare."

  [Text] Jakarta, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA--Minister of Finance 
Mar'ie Muhammad has stated that, if state receipts for the 
1993/1994 fiscal year are not as large as were estimated in the 
1993/1994 budget, reductions in expenditures will be made, so 
that the budget will remain in balance. 
  He had just finished speaking at a symposium on increasing 
the role of BEPEKA [state financial supervisory board] during 
the Second Development Era, held in Jakarta on 25 January on the 
47th anniversary of the establishment of BEPEKA. Later on, the 
minister of finance told reporters that state receipts must 
equal expenditures for the budget to be in balance. It is now 
estimated that the petroleum price will not reach its goal. 
Therefore, to resolve this problem, the government will make 
reductions in the budget. 
  He stated: "At present reductions have been made in several 
government departments, for example, by reducing official 
travel. The BPEN [National Exports Development Board] is 
reducing the number of trade missions sent abroad." 
  According to present estimates, the average petroleum price 
during the 1993/1994 fiscal year will be $16.64 per barrel, 
whereas in the 1993/1994 budget it was estimated at $18 per 
barrel. 
  As is known, the budget for fiscal year 1993/1994 is 62.322 
trillion rupiahs. Some time ago the minister of finance stated 
that every decline in the petroleum price of $1.00 per barrel 
results in a loss of $600 million in state receipts. As a 
result, if the average price of petroleum is $16.64 per barrel 
during fiscal year 1993/1994, whereas the budget estimate was 
$18 per barrel, the decline in the petroleum price of $1.36 
means that state receipts will decline by $16 billion. 
  When he was asked about the possibility of using funds from 
the Development Reserve Budget, Minister of Finance Mar'ie did 
not answer. He said: "I will speak about all of that in 
Parliament." 
  Meanwhile, in his speech at the symposium Mar'ie said that 
if, as a result of investigations, it is learned that there are 
indications that criminal acts have been committed, the matter 
should be reported directly and without prior permission to the 
police and the public prosecutor for further steps to be taken. 
He said: "It is not necessary to ask for permission. That is the 
law. If no action is taken by the individual's superiors, he 
should report the matter to the director general. If action is 
still not taken, he should report the matter to the minister 
concerned or even to the president. In this matter we must be 
absolutely correct," he said. Reports to intermediate level 
supervisory officials are made only for their information. 
  The legal basis for this problem is quite broad, both in the 
Constitution as well as in the basic explanatory section of 
Paragraph 23 of the Constitution of 1945. The matter of 
reporting indications of criminal actions is referred to in the 
explanatory section of Paragraph 3. 
  Mar'ie said that, to obtain the desired results, more 
harmonious cooperation is needed between BEPEKA and supervisory 
authorities. He remarked: "I am not saying that BEPEKA must 
start its investigations from zero. However, we must stand on 
the principle of effectiveness, except for very large-scale 
projects. BEPEKA must investigate matters from the beginning. I 
do not wish to reduce the authority of BEPEKA. I am only saying 
what I think." He said that we must also keep in mind that we 
have limited powers and facilities. 
  He said that, in addition, there must be good cooperation 
between government agencies. He stated: "Even what is 
investigated must be open and aboveboard, and there must be 
`full disclosure.' If the PAN [state administration 
investigative body] has completed its investigation but 
Parliament does not clearly understand the matter, Parliament 
can ask for a clarification from BEPEKA, because the agency that 
conducts the investigation is better informed about it." 
  Meanwhile, in connection with increasing efficiency, 
Minister 
of Finance Mar'ie gave the example of the establishment of a new 
office in a given department. He said: "BEPEKA must investigate 
whether the new office is really necessary and whether its 
functions do not `overlap' those of another office." 
  At the same time, in a discussion in the corridors, J.B. 
Sumarlin, chairman of BEPEKA, said that the function of BEPEKA, 
among other things, is to collect more complete evidence. This 
places BEPEKA in the position of investigator of state financial 
responsibility. He said: "If BEPEKA functions properly, it can 
optimize the use of public funds." Furthermore, BEPEKA also 
investigates the use of state financial resources to determine 
whether they are properly and effectively employed in carrying 
out approved programs. Regarding the view that only smaller 
projects should be investigated, Sumarlin said that this is not 
true. He stated: "It is not true that large-scale projects are 
not investigated. Investigations of these projects have not been 
completed, and the government is sufficiently open." 
  He said that state financial investigations use the device 
of 
an audit. At present state financial investigations in countries 
overseas cover 30 percent of budget volume, whereas in Indonesia 
only 10 percent is covered by BEPEKA, while the remaining 90 
percent is handled by other institutions, such as the BPKP 
[Finance and Development Supervision Board] and other agencies. 
  On this occasion Kwik Kian Gie, an economic observer, said 
that BEPEKA should conduct state financial investigations of 60 
percent of the budget volume. 
  The role of BEPEKA as an investigative body should be 
considered from its technical ability to handle cultural 
questions, such as overcoming "embarrassment" in pursuing its 
inquiries. It must have the courage to say what is true and to 
discuss corruption as a whole, even if what it reviews under the 
law causes the financial foundations of the state to shake 
because of the amount of money involved. 
  Meanwhile Aberson Marle Sihaloho, a member of the Committee 
on the Budget in Parliament from the FPDI [Indonesian Democracy 
Party Faction], said that to strengthen the role of BEPEKA, it 
must be an "independent" agency. It must be separated from the 
functions of investigation and supervision. 
  Investigation of state financial management is handled by 
BEPEKA. The authority of BEPEKA only covers formal truth. 
Meanwhile, Parliament, which examines the substance of truth, 
has no function in this matter. He said: "This is because what 
BEPEKA investigates is only a sector or subsector and is not an 
entire program and activities under it." 
  Hamzah Haz, a member of the Committee on the Budget from the 
PPP [United Development Party] Faction, stated that in approving 
the state budget the position of Parliament is stronger than 
that of the government. Parliament is the supreme budget 
authority. Therefore, in this matter Parliament truly exercises 
the authority of the MPR [People's Consultative Council]. This 
function of Parliament is different from that of BEPEKA, 
however, in carrying out its duty separately from the 
government. However, BEPEKA does not stand above the government. 
  Recalling the fact that BEPEKA is a budget supervisory 
agency 
established by Parliament to work with the government, while the 
position of Parliament is stronger than that of the government, 
BEPEKA should be closer to Parliament than to the government.

<F P=106> ["Preliminary Roundup of Victory at Anlung Veng Battlefield"] </F>
  [Text] The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea and local 
people smashed and totally routed the attacking forces of the 
two-headed government and Vietnamese communist puppets on the 
battlefields around Anlung Veng at 1330 on 24 February. The 
preliminary results received on the afternoon of 24 February are 
as follows: 
  1. We seized a BM-13, a BM-14, and a BM-21 multiple rocket 
launchers; three 85-mm, a DK-30, and a 122-mm cannons; three 
DK-82 and three DK-75 guns; three 120-mm and 13 60-mm mortars; 
12 B-40, six 12.7-mm, 129 AK, and 12 M-15 guns. 
  2. We seized 12 60-mm mortar shells, two crates of AK 
ammunition, five crates of 12.7-mm ammunition, eight DK-75 
shells, and three B-40 rockets. This a small amount of large- 
and small-sized ammunition because the enemy ran out of 
ammunition. 
  3. We seized six trucks, set ablaze three T-54 tanks, killed 
49 attacking troops in the fight; captured 74 others who were 
too weak to flee because they suffered from a shortage of food 
for the past three days after their communication lines were cut 
off; and discovered 19 corpses scattered along a 12-KM stretch 
of road from Anlung Veng. 
  4. The attacking forces were cut off from their supplies for 
several days. They suffered shortages of ammunition, rice, and 
fuel. 
  5. We killed and captured 26 officers of the ranks of 
general and colonel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Khieu Samphan, head of the Party of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea by unidentified station correspondent; 
dated 25 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] My respects to your excellency Mr. 
Chairman. We, representatives of the Voice of the Great 
National Union Front of Cambodia [VGNUFC], are very happy that 
you have granted us this interview. As you know, the Anlung 
Veng Front's Command and the Democratic Kampuchean National Army 
[NADK]'s High Command have already informed our compatriots that 
on 24 February 1994, our NADK completely smashed the fourth 
large-scale military operation of the Vietnamese communist 
puppets and the two-headed government on Anlung Veng 
battlefield. Our entire compatriots are very pleased with this 
news. We would like your excellency to tell us about the future 
developments of the situation. 
  [Khieu Samphan] I would like to thank you, VGNUFC 
correspondents. Actually, this large-scale military operation 
to destroy Anlung Veng has been the military campaign of the 
Hanoi Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese communist puppets, 
the two-headed government, and the evil alliance to destroy and 
compel Democratic Kampuchea [DK] to accept their three points 
and thereby to destroy the five-point uideline of His Majesty 
the King, to oppose the king himself, to destroy the hope for 
national reconciliation, and to eliminate our Cambodian nation 
and people. They have already launched four large-scale military 
operations. The crushing of those four large-scale military 
operations, particularly the fourth on 24 February, is a very 
big defeat suffered by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese 
communist puppets, the two-headed government, and the alliance. 
It is a victory of our entire people and of the forces 
supporting the king's five-point national reconciliation plan, 
and of peace-loving countries in the world. 
  What will the future situation be? Will the Hanoi Vietnamese 
communists, the elements that they have installed, the 
two-headed government, and their alliance stubbornly carry on 
the Vietnamese war of aggression, continue to oppose the king 
and his five-point guideline for national reconciliation, and do 
their utmost to eliminate the Cambodian nation and people? 
  I am firmly convinced that if they continue to do so, they 
will certainly suffer even more serious defeats. This is 
because, it is very clear that the two-headed government's 
forces have suffered heavy casualties in the defeat at Anlung 
Veng. Presently, the two- headed government's troops routed at 
Anlung Veng, [words indistinct]. We do not know how many of 
them [words indistinct] in the jungle and died because of the 
lack of food and water, particularly at this time of the year 
when water sources become scarce. Most importantly, those who 
continue the Hanoi Vietnamese communists' war of aggression and 
who oppose national reconciliation will certainly be opposed and 
condemned even more strongly by the Cambodian nation and people. 
  At a time when the Vietnamese communists have amassed tens 
of 
thousands of square kilometers of Cambodia's territory from the 
Dragon's tail [area in Mondolkiri Province] down to Kampot 
Province, as well as her seas and continental shelf, at a time 
when they continue to send more Vietnamese settlers into 
Cambodia with numbers already reaching four million [words 
indistinct] a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory 
now in Vietnam], at a time when our people have to undergo 
hardship and suffering [passage indistinct], the two-headed 
government has done nothing to resolve these grave problems. It 
has instead tried hard to continue fueling the Vietnamese war of 
aggression to eliminate our nation and people (?and) DK 
resistance forces. 
  Can the Cambodian nation and people accept such a situation? 
Make no mistake about it. Our nation and people are not 
ignorant. They are fully aware of who is responsible for their 
current misery and suffering. No one can deceive them as they 
have seen with their own eyes and are the victims of such a 
hardship and suffering. 
  1. They can see clearly that the continued misery and 
suffering of our nation and people come from the fact that the 
aggressor Hanoi Vietnamese communists have continued their 
aggression and occupation of our country through the state power 
that they have installed since 1979. The aggressor Hanoi 
Vietnamese communists are behind this state power and have 
continued to control and guide this state power, carrying on 
their war of aggression through this state power, sending more 
Vietnamese nationals to Cambodia in line with their strategy to 
annex Cambodia through a demographic war, and so forth. 
  2. They also know that it is because some foreign powers 
together with the Vietnamese communists have attempted to 
eliminate the Cambodian people and oppose the national 
reconciliation and the king. 
  3. They know that it is because this two-headed government 
which is only the by-product of the aggressor Hanoi Vietnamese 
communists and their evil alliance and (?stays in the iron cage) 
of the Vietnamese communist puppets. 
  These are indeed the causes of the misery and suffering of 
our nation and people who can no longer tolerate them. 
  Look at the countryside, what is the situation there? The 
most outstanding development is that our people have risen up 
and mutinied against the Vietnamese puppets' village and commune 
administration to liberate their villages and communes. They 
have mutinied not just to seize back their farmlands, cattle, 
rice, and food, but also to oppose the war to eliminate the 
Cambodian nation and people. 
  In Phnom Penh and other provincial towns, students and 
teachers have staged demonstrations. The people whose land and 
houses were appropriated have also staged demonstrations. Those 
puppet troops and Para [Khmer People's National Liberation 
Frong] and FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] soldiers have also 
mutinied against the war to eliminate their own nation and 
people. They have turned their guns against the evil 
ringleaders and deserted their ranks, even hundreds at a time. 
Some who can no longer make a living have turned to rob traders 
and customers in markets. Some homeless soldiers have tried to 
settle anywhere they can. There have also been bloody 
repressions and so forth. 
  What does all these mean? Is this not a signal that our 
nation and people are no longer able to endure? 
  What are the causes of the defeat suffered at Anlung Veng by 
the Vietnamese communist puppets, the two-headed government, the 
Vietnamese communists, and their evil alliance? Are they [words 
indistinct]? 
  I think that it is necessary to give this matter very 
careful 
consideration. I do believe that after careful consideration, we 
can see that it is because the DK enjoys the participation of 
the entire nation and people in the struggle as it has always 
stayed with them. To fight against the DK is tantamount to 
fighting against the entire nation and people; therefore, the 
latter has to join in the struggle both in the countryside and 
in the cities. In such a situation, it is certainly not tanks 
or artillery that is decisive. 
  [Correspondent] We would like to thank your excellency Mr. 
chairman for this clear explanation to our compatriots. With 
such a situation, what do you think about its solution? 
  [Khieu Samphan] The DK party's stand is well-known to 
everyone, that is, national reconciliation in line with the 
king's five-point policy. On this matter, I would like to speak 
on the following two issues. 
  First: As far as the foreign powers who have interfered in 
Cambodia's internal affairs and opposed national reconciliation 
and the king's five-point policy guideline are concerned, is it 
not about time for them to reconsider their position? Is it not 
better to reach a solution that will enable Cambodia to regain 
peace and national reconciliation in line with the king's 
five-point political guideline, thus enabling Cambodia as well 
as the whole of Southeast Asia to live in peace and their 
relations to prosper on the basis of peace and mutual benefit? 
  Second: Concerning Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and 
the other FUNCINPEC leaders, I would like to sincerely propose 
that you reconsider your current stand. 
  Have your highness and the other FUNCINPEC leaders been 
aware 
of what our nation and people have thought about your activities 
in the recent past? People from all walks of life have 
expressed their deep regret and have been wondering why 
FUNCINPEC leaders have fallen into the bad policy of the 
foreigners, have become friends with the henchmen of the 
Vietnamese, have embraced the Hanoi Vietnamese communists, and 
have waged war against their own Cambodian nation and people. 
How have the FUNCINPEC leaders been misled by those with 
Vietnamese minds and the Vietnamese communists themselves into 
massacring their own fellow ANKI [National Army of Independent 
Cambodia] and FUNCINPEC forces? They regret this so deeply. 
  If you are now aware of the fact, will you continue to 
listen 
to the foreigners or will you instead turn to listen to the 
king's advice and heed the call of our nation and people? 
  I do believe that it is not too late yet. Our nation and 
people are waiting for you and will not fail to support you. 
Our nation and people want only peace and national 
reconciliation. 
  His Majesty the King has issued the five-point policy 
guideline because he is aware of the grave and explosive 
situation in our country at present both in terms of national 
and social issues. His five points come from his very careful 
consideration. As he himself has been very close to our nation 
and people, he understands the wishes of our nation and people 
better than anyone. 
  Our entire Cambodian nation and people support the 
five-point 
political guideline of His Majesty the King. They want to see 
all national forces reconciled and united both within the army 
and in the government. They want to see all national forces 
joined in one national army, that is within the framework of the 
Khmer Royal Armed Forces. They want to see a genuine national 
government so that there would be enough national forces to 
tackle national and social issues, small and big alike. 
  The DK party fully supports His Majesty the King's 
five-point 
political guideline. I would like to stress here again that the 
DK party does not want to eliminate any force or any 
personality. But, the DK party will never allow anyone to 
eliminate it. 
  The current situation clearly indicates that our nation and 
people will not allow anyone to eliminate Democratic Kampuchea 
or to continue to oppose national reconciliation. 
  In brief, I would like to say that the only way out is 
national reconciliation in accordance with the king's five-point 
political guideline. 
  [Correspondent] We would like to thank your excellency for 
your explanation to our compatriots. We wish you happiness and 
successes in your noble patriotic mission. Thank you.

  [Text] The Australian Government says it will take firm and 
prompt action against any former Australian spies who now speak 
out in public. The foreign minister, Gareth Evans, gave the 
warning when releasing the terms of reference for an inquiry 
into its overseas spy service, ASIS [Australian Security 
Intelligence Service]. 
  The inquiry follows a television documentary last week, in 
which two former ASIS agents claimed the secret intelligence 
service had harmed Australia's interests in Asia and the Middle 
East. But Senator Evans said purported revelations by former 
ASIS officers had the potential to compromise national security. 
He said that now that a judicial inquiry into ASIS had been set 
up, further public comment by former Australian spies should 
cease. 
  Senator Evans gave this response to opposition claims that 
he 
was threatening former ASIS personnel: 
  [Begin Evans recording] Might I simply say that the 
government has of course very serious and onerous 
responsibilities in the protection of national security, the 
protection of the national interest in this respect. We will 
carry out those responsibilities with full consciousness of the 
gravity of the issues that are involved. And it's just really 
again unfortunate the opposition should choose to trivialize to 
score points about something which is obviously an example of 
the government properly exercising the various very serious 
responsibilities we do have. [end recording]

effective measures to prevent the recurrence of similar acts and 
ensure the safety of live and property of the Palestinian people 
in the occupied areas'. 
  `The Vietnamese Government and people have resolutely and 
persistently supported the Palestinian people's just struggle 
under the leadership of the PLO for their sacred national 
rights', the spokesman stressed in conclusion.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
last night reaffirmed to Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and 
foreign minister, that Thailand will strictly abide by the 
principles laid down in the 1975 joint communique on the 
establishment of diplomatic ties between Thailand and China and 
will follow a one-China policy. 
  Qian Qichen expressed his appreciation for Foreign Minister 
Prasong's reaffirmation. He said that frank exchanges of views 
can help solve problems and create mutual trust, understanding, 
and respect. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking to reporters, Foreign Minister Qian said the two 
sides had discussed many issues, mostly bilateral issues. He 
said that China and Thailand have maintained good relations. 
The two countries have exchanged visits between high-level 
officials and developed economic and trade cooperation. 
Moreover, the two countries have cooperated well in tackling 
some international issues, especially the Cambodian problem. He 
said that the two sides should cherish these relations. The two 
sides should solve problems through frank exchanges of views 
that will help create mutual respect, understanding, and trust. 
  He said the two sides had exchanged views on the Taiwan 
issue. He appreciated Foreign Minister Prasong's reaffirmation 
that Thailand will strictly abide by the principles laid down in 
the joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic 
relations and will follow a one-China policy. 
  Asked whether Chinese President Jiang Zemin will attend the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] meeting in Indonesia 
late this year if the host country invites Taiwan President Li 
Teng-hui to join the meeting, Foreign Minister Qian said that 
China would like to see the Seattle model used for the APEC 
informal summit. Asked whether China or Taiwan would be the 
first to join GATT, Qian Qichen replied that China should be 
first. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong told reporters the two sides 
believe 
that the two countries should continue to cherish their 
long-standing good relations and further develop economic and 
trade cooperation. Prasong said that Foreign Ministry Permanent 
Secretary Pracha Khunakasem had briefed Qian Qichen on the 
upcoming ASEAN foreign ministers meeting to be held in Bangkok 
in July. In addition to its dialogue partners, ASEAN will also 
invite China, Russia, and some other countries to attend the 
meeting as observers. The Chinese foreign minister expressed 
his satisfaction with the briefing. 
  The Thai foreign minister stressed that Thai-Chinese 
friendly 
relations should be continuously developed. The Thai foreign 
minister also conveyed an invitation from Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai for Chinese President Jiang Zemin to visit Thailand at 
an appropriate time. 
  Squadron Leader Prasong said that the Chinese side also 
hoped 
that Thailand would help push for the implementation of the 
quadrangle development project. The third meeting for the 
project will be held in Laos soon.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- The Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Association will propose to the U.S. auto industry 
the setting up of a forum for talks in the private sector on 
U.S. auto imports to Japan, industry sources said Saturday [26 
February]. 
  The industry group's move reflects an effort to help bridge 
the gap between the United States and Japan on purchases of U.S. 
auto parts and sales of U.S. autos in Japan -- the most 
contentious issue in the failed bilateral "framework" trade 
talks. 
  Heads of the U.S. and Japanese auto industries agreed in 
1992 
to set up discussion groups, but the talks never materialized. 
  The establishment of talks in the private sector has become 
urgent now, however, with the deadlock in government 
negotiations, and the automobile association will try to find 
ways to enhance U.S. imports, the sources said. 
  In line with the Japanese Government's plan to liberalize 
the 
domestic market, the automobile association and major Japanese 
automakers have started drawing up their own measures to respond 
to the U.S. demands. 
  The measures could be ready for implementation as early as 
mid- March and include releasing the purchasing plans of auto 
parts at each Japanese automaker. 
  This proposal has met with strong opposition from the 
automobile industry, however, on fears that it could be taken as 
a commitment to setting numerical import targets -- a U.S. 
demand that Japan has strongly resisted throughout trade talks. 
  "That would run counter to our policy of never ever 
releasing 
figures," said an official at one major auto company.

<F P=106> [By Nam Song-hyon from New York] </F>
  [Text] A working-level contact between North Korea and the 
United States has resumed on the morning of 26 February [local 
time]. 
  Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for East 
Asia and Pacific affairs, disclosed before the meeting that the 
working-level contact was being held upon the request from the 
North Korean side, thus strongly hinted that the North Korean 
negotiators have received instructions from Pyongyang. Hubbard, 
head of the U.S. side, when asked what is the biggest stumbling 
block in the talks, said it is an exchange of special envoys 
between the North and South, a condition for the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  Prior to the working-level contact, an official of the North 
Korean mission to the United Nations revealed that something may 
happen and perhaps a conclusion may be reached today [local 
time], thus fueling speculations that a certain decision has 
been made in Pyongyang in connection with the exchange of 
special envoys. 
  Attention is now focused on how the two sides will narrow 
their differences in today's contact over the exchange of 
special envoys. 
  Diplomatic sources speculate that, if today's contact fails, 
chances are high that North Korea will buy time until 28 
February, the date that the International Atomic Energy Agency 
will convene the special Board of Governors' meeting, and try to 
meet the U.S. side once more to tug out the final agreement.

  [Text] New York, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States, resuming their working-level contact at UN 
headquarters on Friday to discuss Pyongyang's acceptance of 
nuclear inspections and other issues, failed to reach a final 
agreement. 
  After the meeting, Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North 
Korean 
mission to the United Nations, told reporters that he and U.S. 
officials had discussed taking four simultaneous steps but that 
they could not narrow their differences. Ho said a meeting 
would be held again later in the day, but U.S. representative 
Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian and 
Pacific affairs, had a doubt about the possibility. 
  Hubbard was unsure whether another contact would take place 
later that day, citing the U.S. position that this was 
unnecessary unless North Korea offered a compromise. 
  At Wednesday's contact, Pyongyang proposed that it and 
Washington take four simultaneous steps including joint 
announcement of a third round of high-level talks and suspension 
of this year's Team Spirit military exercise. The other two 
steps are North Korea's positive consideration of meeting with 
South Korea on an exchange of special envoys, and Pyongyang's 
acceptance of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspections, according to a North Korean official. 
  The U.S. delegation which attended Wednesday's contact 
returned to Washington on Thursday, but North Korean officials 
asked the Americans to resume their talks after receiving 
instructions from Pyongyang, according to sources. 
  Announcement of a final agreement had been expected at 
Friday's contact, but the two sides seemingly failed again to 
agree on an exchange of special envoys between South and North 
Korea, diplomatic sources said. 
  Pyongyang maintains that if Seoul proposed exchanging 
special 
envoys, it would agree to preparatory talks, while Washington 
asserts that the exchange must be realized. 
  Washington is saying that a decision on the schedule for the 
third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang and suspension of 
Team Spirit are possible only after the IAEA begins inspection 
of North Korea's nuclear sites. 
  North Korea, on the other hand, is insisting that all steps 
be taken simultaneously.

Secretary Kim Chong-il, who has not appeared at an official 
meeting for over a long period of time, is suffering from a 
serious disease of his psychoneurotic system [chongsin 
singyongkyetong]. 
  A source in China well-informed on North Korea reported on 
26 
February that as a result of pursuing various rumors regarding 
Kim Chong-il that he was in a traffic accident, that he was 
shot, and that he is about to lose his position, it was learned 
that all these rumors were false. This source however said: 
"It has been indirectly confirmed that it is almost impossible 
for Kim Chong-il to receive foreign guests or carry out official 
work because of the worsening of his disease of the 
psychoneurotic system."

brutal killing of Palestinians by an Israeli in Hebron. 
Indonesia reiterates that the incident -- which killed over 52 
Palestinians and injured over 200 others -- will have a negative 
impact on the overall peace process in the Middle East. 
  The statement says the Indonesian Government and people 
offer 
their deep condolences to the Palestinian government and people 
over the incident, which took place at Ibrahim Mosque in 
al-Khalil, Hebron on Friday. Indonesia also sends its 
condolences to the families of the 10 others who were killed in 
clashes with Israeli soldiers. 
  In line with Palestinian Liberation Organization leader 
`Arafat's request for assistance from the Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM], Indonesia -- as chairman of the NAM -- will immediately 
consider the necessary moves to call an emergency meeting of the 
UN Security Council. This will show our support for the 
Palestinians.

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, Feb 28 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
launched heavy counter-attacks against government troops at a 
major rebel base in northwest Cambodia which was captured early 
this month, government and military officials said Monday. 
"Since the February 19 the Khmer Rouge launched attacks against 
Anlong Veng, especially using artillery," Cambodian army General 
Chum Chheang said. "But our forces are still resisting the 
Khmer Rouge attacks." 
  Heavy guerrilla shelling, however, forced government troops 
to make "tactical retreats" from certain parts of the base which 
stretches for several kilometers, he said. The guerrillas were 
also splitting up into small groups and attacking government 
troops "from everywhere", he said. The general, however, denied 
reports that the Khmer Rouge had re-captured all of Anlung Veng. 
"It's not true. Our troops are still in Anlung Veng, we just 
move tactically around the area," he said. 
  A government minister, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
acknowledged there was a major guerrillla assault against the 
base. "The situation is still confusing," he said. "But we are 
building up new fighting forces to kick the Khmer Rouge away 
completely from the area." 
  Anlung Veng, which fell to the government February 5, was 
the 
Khmer Rouge's headquarters for all guerrilla operations in north 
and central Cambodia. The guerrillas retreated rather than face 
the 3,000-strong government force in a conventional battle. But, 
operating in small units from the hills and jungle around the 
base, the guerrillas have continued to stage hit-and-run attacks 
on the government forces. 
  Western military analysts said the government may be 
over-stretching its resources trying to maintain and supply 
large numbers of men in the remote and inhospitable area, and 
they warned that the conquerors could become targets for 
fast-moving teams of guerrillas. A high-ranking defence 
official, however, said the army was aware of the threat. 
"Anlung Veng may be a trap, so we have to prepare for 
everything," he said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists have run amok in aerial espionages against the 
northern half of Korea by massively mobilizing strategic and 
tactical reconnaissance planes of different types, according to 
military sources. 
  In the period from February 21 to 24 strategic 
reconnaissance 
planes committed aerial photographing and electronic 
reconnaissance on the areas of the North as a whole repeatedly 
making flights between Kangnung and Tokjok Islet in the West Sea 
of Korea. 
  On Feb. 25, twelve reconnaissance planes including RV-1 and 
RC- 12 made day-and-night cross flights between Tokjok Islet and 
Chunchon, between Chunchon and Kangnung and between Yonchon and 
Kanghwa Island for photographing and reconnaissance on the 
frontline and the eastern and western coastal areas of the North. 
  U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane committed 
photographing and electronic reconnaissance on the depths of the 
North on 29 occasions in February. 
  The U.S. imperialists' aerial espionages against the North 
via high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes, Army and 
Airforce tactical reconnaissance planes and early warning planes 
number more than 190 cases in February. 
  All these aerial espionages clearly show that the U.S. 
imperialists are desperately stepping up their preparations for 
another war of aggression against the northern half of Korea.

  [Text] The Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society 
released a statement on February 24 denouncing the recent scheme 
of the South Korean authorities to move Korean compatriots in 
Sakhalin, Russia, to South Korea in conspiracy with the Japanese 
Government. 
  The statement reads: 
  The South Korean authorities have recently been working 
insidiously in conspiracy with the Japanese Government to take 
Korean compatriots in Sakhalin, Russia, to South Korea. It has 
been learned that in mid-January, the South Korean authorities 
met with the delegations of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and 
Red Cross in Russia to open a deal to move Korean compatriots in 
Sakhalin, Russia, to South Korea. Under the name of "Site 
Inspection Delegation," they attempted to seize applicants to 
return and settle in South Korea. 
  The South Korean rulers, absurdly contending that the issue 
of Korean compatriots in Sakhalin, Russia had once been 
political, but is now a purely humanitarian issue, revealed 
their intention to settle this issue by receiving a small amount 
of money from the Japanese Government as traveling expenses for 
the Sakhalin residents. 
  As the whole world knows, the Korean compatriots came to 
this 
totally strange land of Sakhalin because they were forcibly 
brought there by Japanese imperialists during the illegal 
occupation of Korea under the outrageous "general mobilization 
order" and were driven like mules before being abandoned in 
Sakhalin. 
  Therefore, it is not a mere humanitarian problem but a 
serious political issue. How can the problem suddenly lose its 
political nature and change into a purely humanitarian problem, 
when the Japanese Government has neither officially apologized 
to the Korean people nor compensated for past crimes? 
  The attempt by the South Korean authorities to settle the 
issue of Korean compatriots in Sakhalin with a small amount of 
travel expenses by the criminals while ignoring the political 
nature of the issue is an absolutely intolerable crime not only 
in terms of our nation's dignity and interest but also from the 
lofty humanitarian point of view. 
  The Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society brands 
this crafty and insidious scheme of South Korean rulers to move 
Korean compatriots living in Sakhalin to South Korea as a 
treacherous and hostile act selling the dignity and interest of 
the nation for a pittance, and as shameless political fraud 
cheating and fooling our compatriots, and resolutely denounce 
this by the name of the whole nation. 
  There are nearly 500,000 Koreans, who were forcibly taken to 
the Far East by the Japanese imperialists, and their descendants 
are scattered in Russia and in the former Soviet Union. 
Therefore, the problem of Koreans taken to the Far East by the 
Japanese imperialists is not a matter restricted to some 40,000 
Koreans residents in Sakhalin but a serious matter which can be 
solved only when the Japanese Government apologizes and 
compensates all Koreans who live in the former Soviet Union. 
  Our nation has the right according to international law to 
receive an apology and claim compensation from the Japanese 
Government for the national misfortune and sufferings 
experienced by all the Koreans overseas, not to speak of the 
500,000 Korean compatriots who reside throughout the former 
Soviet Union, for nearly one whole century. 
  This notwithstanding, the South Korean rulers are trying to 
settle the issue with Japan by deceiving a small percentage of 
Sakhalin-resident Koreans and ignoring and sacrificing the 
interest of the majority of Korean compatriots scattered in the 
former Soviet Union. This is merely a shallow trick motivated 
by sinister intentions. 
  The South Korean rulers, under a humanitarian mask, 
launched a deceptive "charity" offensive among the 
Sakhalin-resident Koreans motivated by the sinister intention to 
establish an antirepublic base in the Far East of Russia and to 
foster discord and confrontation within the nation by winning 
them over, thus perpetuating the division of the country. 
However, our compatriots in Sakhalin who aspire for the 
reconciliation and unity of the nation and long for the 
reunification of the fatherland are not ones to be deceived by 
the shallow tricks of the South Korean rulers. While the South 
Korean rulers had their stooges distribute a false list of 
Sakhalin compatriots who applied to move to South Korea, most 
compatriots said they had never applied, nor were aware of such 
a fact, and those who did apply, regretted having been deceived 
and withdrew and gave up the applications. This stern reality 
straightly indicates the foolishness and shamelessness of the 
scheme of the South Korean rulers to snatch the national 
conscience and dignity of compatriots in Sakhalin with a meagre 
amount of money. 
  As all overseas Koreans who visited South Korea have 
confirmed, South Korean society is a corrupt and ailing society 
where the rich get richer and the poor poorer, and where no 
political and economic guarantees are provided for the life of 
those who return from foreign countries. 
  We believe that all the Koreans in Russia and other areas of 
the former Soviet Union will rise up as one in the staunch 
struggle to reject the insidious and crafty moves of South 
Korean and Japanese authorities to bring them to South Korea and 
defend the dignity and interests of the nation. 
  Our nation will settle scores to the last for all the crimes 
committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and will 
never pardon the traitors who are courting favor by selling the 
interests of the nation to Japan. 
  The South Korean rulers must act with discretion and 
immediately stop its antinational maneuvers to fool and cheat 
compatriots in Sakhalin by making them move away at a dirt-cheap 
price. 
  The Japanese authorities must earnestly apologize to the 
Korean people for all the crimes they committed, and provide 
acceptable compensation not only for Koreans in the former 
Soviet Union and overseas, as well as for our nation, and stop 
any act to block the reunification of Korea. 
  The South Korean and Japanese authorities must be mindful 
that if they persistently ignore our solemn warning to resort to 
base plots to move Sakhalin-resident Koreans to South Korea, 
they will by no means be able to evade the crime of insulting 
and abusing the noble humanitarian idea and will bring greater 
disgrace upon themselves in the eyes of the world.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- A South Korean 
puppet radio recently spread a groundless rumor that forestry 
workers of the DPRK in the far eastern region of Russia asked 
for "asylum" in South Korea. Japanese, French, British and 
other reptile Western media accepted the false report and are 
working with extra zeal to spread the fiction of "defection" of 
DPRK's forestry workers. 
  The rumor is an unfounded propaganda and sheer fabrication, 
a 
mere intrigue to do harm to the DPRK. This is a malicious abuse 
and slander against the DPRK, a dignified country, and an 
unpardonable insult to the Korean working class who are masters 
of the country. 
  The DPRK Government bestows all solicitudes upon the Korean 
forestry workers who are now working devotedly in the Far East 
with a single resolve to contribute to the development and 
prosperity of the country, so that they may feel not the 
slightest inconvenience in their life. And it grants many state 
benefits to their families in the homeland. 
  It is unimaginable for the Korean forestry workers to turn 
their back on the beloved homeland and ask for "asylum" in the 
cursed society of South Korea, the workers who are devoting 
themselves to timber production with burning patriotic zeal, 
encouraged by the good benevolence of the socialist system. 
  The rumor about "defection" of forestry workers spread by 
the 
South Korean puppets is a preposterous fabrication that could be 
invented customarily by two-bit shysters accustomed to telling a 
lie. 
  It is only too clear that the rumor spread by the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique as well as the persistent clamor about 
"nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK is aimed at tarnishing the 
international image of the DPRK, doing harm to the cause of 
anthropocentric Korean-style socialism and frustrating joint 
timber production in the Far East at any cost. 
  It is not hard to gather that also lurking behind it is the 
ridiculous intention of the puppets to divert elsewhere the 
people's attention in a bid to extricate themselves from the 
dilemma in which they find themselves now, hit hard at the 50th 
meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights now open in Geneva 
for the devastated human rights issue of South Korea. 
  Deserving attention is the despicable move of Japanese and 
Western subsidized means of propaganda which readily accepted 
the false report and are misleading the public opinion. They 
have made no scruples of false propaganda, paying no heed to the 
authenticity of their news, for their sinister political aims 
and money-making. The unbiased public opinion cannot but be 
angry at such filthy and base behavior of theirs. 
  Whatever intrigues the South Korean puppets and seditious 
forces of the West may hatch up, they cannot break the Korean 
people's singlehearted, rockfirm unity, nor can they destroy the 
socialist system of the DPRK which is demonstrating its 
invincible might. It is as foolish as trying to break a rock 
with eggs to make an attempt at destroying the socialist system 
of the DPRK with intrigues. 
  The South Korean puppets and seditious forces of the West 
must look straight at the trend of the times and immediately 
stop their false propaganda aimed at harming the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- An opposition 
"member of the National Assembly" of South Korea, in data 
presented recently to "the 166th extraordinary session of the 
National Assembly," said the Defence Ministry had included 
Patriot missiles in the missile purchase program. MBC (Munhwa 
Broadcasting Corporation) reported the Defence Ministry 
"explained in camera" to the "assemblymen" of the "Defence 
Commission of the National Assembly" that the purchase of 
Patriot missiles was under way. 
  Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today views this as another 
clear sign that the Kim Yong-sam group has become rabid in war 
preparations against the North. 
  The analyst says: 
  What our nation wants now is to put an end to confrontation 
and division and achieve peace and peaceful reunification at an 
early date. 
  Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam group is dancing to the drum- 
beating of the United States which is hastening the deployment 
of Patriots in South Korea, while scheming to arm the puppet 
army with these missiles. This is aimed at slaying the fellow 
countrymen in the North in league with outside forces. 
  If the puppets' war moves are overlooked, the 70 million 
people of Korea would not be spared of a nuclear war disaster. 
  Their reckless acts to overpower the North will lead them to 
destruction. We are keeping close scrutiny over the Kim 
Yong-sam group's war provocation moves and will never tolerate 
any provocation.

<F P=106> ["Disgusting Tirade of Fool" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong- sam, a puppet, at a "press conference with home and 
foreign reporters upon the lapse of one year since his 
assumption of office" on February 25 prided himself on his 
"achievements", saying he has "devoted his body and soul" for 
something and has "done his utmost" during his term, and made 
quite a noise as if he would accomplish "something great" in the 
future, a Seoul-based radio reported. 
  Such rigmarole of the traitor Kim Yong-sam is nothing but a 
disgusting jargon of a political mountabank aimed at prettifying 
his disgraceful records woven with arch crimes of flunkeyism and 
treachery, fascism and repression, division and confrontation 
and, at the same time, at dampening the unyielding fighting 
spirit of the South Korean people who decisively rose in 
struggle to topple the "civilian" regime, and at maintaining at 
any cost the colonial puppet regime now driven to the crisis of 
destruction. 
  The traitor openly revealed his wicked intention of division 
and confrontation when he took issue with the fictitious 
"nuclear problem" of the North, arguing in a far-fetched manner 
that "the North's nuclear problem is a stumbling block in the 
way of reunification". 
  This time he made a gesture as if he were intending to bring 
about any change in the North-South relations, saying "the North 
has no nukes" and he "would promote summit talks when the talks 
could be considered helpful to checking the North's nuclear 
development". This means, in the final analysis, that he 
admitted of his own accord that his clique's criminal "policy 
against the North" in the last one hear was wrong. 
  His attempt to find a solution to the North-South relations 
by taking issue with the North's "nuclear problem" cannot be 
construed otherwise than a mode of thinking of a stupid fellow 
running about like a headless chicken, lost to reason. 
  The Korean nation will never pardon the foolish Kim Yong-sam 
group, the source of national disaster which is nonspiring with 
outside forces to harm and stifle the same fellow countrymen, 
engaging itself in fascism, suppression, division and 
confrontation.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 28 February commentary: "Appeal of a Fool </F>
Who Fell in a Pit"] 
  [Text] The traitor Kim Yong-sam held a so-called news 
conference on 25 February marking the first anniversary of his 
inauguration. 
  Taking the podium, traitor Kim Yong-sam made preposterous 
absurd remarks for an hour and 30 minutes by reading a prepared 
statement and by reciting answers for prepared questions. His 
utterances as the so-called president were immature and were not 
even worth consideration. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam, first of all, frantically 
propagandized 
the achievements he made for the past one year since he came to 
Chongwadae [presidential office], and put forward five so-called 
issues. They were merely his confession, appeal, excuses, and 
remarks intended to evade responsibility for the row of failures 
in reform and opening of the past one year. 
  As South Korean publications reported, although traitor Kim 
Yong- sam frantically carried out a propaganda campaign on the 
civilian government, on reform, on changes, and so forth, 
nothing has changed in South Korea whatsoever. 
  South Korea still remains a U.S. colony, just as one year 
before when the civilian government came to office. A South 
Korean professor said with a jeer that the Kim Yong-sam regime 
invited a man called the United States into the living room and 
served him in the nude. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam talked as if he would eradicate the 
fascist rule. The society has been suffocated by the civilian 
government's rule for maintaining public peace and human rights 
have been cruelly infringed upon. This is a solemn reality in 
South Korea. 
  The South Korean people assess that the rule of the new 
authoritarian civilian government is more atrocious than that of 
the military dictatorship. 
  Let us examine public welfare problems. Because of the 
pressure to share pains enforced by traitor Kim Yong-sam by 
raving about reform, the workers are suffering greater burdens 
and farmers will completely lose their means of living due to 
the poorest harvest since 1980, and to make the matters worse, 
by the opening of the rice market. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to shift the responsibility 
for the catastrophic situation prevailing in South Korea onto 
his predecessors. He also tried to lay blame on his inferiors by 
raving about the easy-going attitude and slackened discipline of 
government officials and so forth. However, his mean trick did 
not work. 
  As long as traitor Kim Yong-sam implements the antinational, 
nation-selling flunkeyist rule by relying on outside forces and 
being deprived of sovereignty -- the life of a nation -- he 
cannot avoid failure, no matter how frantically he may 
propagandize civilian government and wage reform and opening. 
Traitor Kim Yong- sam should have frankly admitted this. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to find a way out of the 
prevailing crisis through declaration of a fascist rule, 
including violent remarks that lawlessness and violence will not 
be tolerated under any pretext, and through the policy of 
dependence on outside forces for so-called internationalization 
and globalization. This will work only as a means for expediting 
the final downfall of traitor Kim Yong-sam and the civilian 
regime. 
  What one should not overlook in the remarks made by traitor 
Kim Yong-sam at the news conference that day is the portion 
pertaining to North Korea. 
  As has been exposed, since traitor Kim Yong-sam came to 
power, he has pursued North-South confrontation on the pretext 
of the nuclear issue in the North; severed North-South dialogue, 
which existed even in the era of previous military dictatorship; 
froze all North-South relations; and drove the situation to the 
brink of war. 
  In fact, this is antinational high treason that cannot be 
pardoned. That day traitor Kim Yong-sam talked about summit 
talks, exchange of special envoys, suspension of the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise, joint economic development, and so 
forth. He raved as if he would show a certain change in 
North-South relations. His remarks, however, only served as 
self-acknowledgement of the erroneous policy that has been 
implemented toward North Korea for the past year. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam's position on relations with the North 
is still erroneous [paruji mottada]. This was proven by the fact 
that the traitor put forward, again, the nuclear issue as a 
condition for development of North-South relations. 
  The so-called nuclear issue of the North is a product of 
antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers persistently pursued 
by the United States. The South Korean ruling bunch brought U.S. 
nuclear weapons into South Korea, generated the nuclear problem 
on the Korean peninsula, and is providing its own nuclear 
mushroom [chacheui haek posotkkaji chariuda] under the U.S. 
nuclear umbrella. Thus, the South Korean ruling bunch is not 
entitled, nor has the face, to mention the nuclear issue of the 
North. 
  Moreover, at the news conference that day, traitor Kim 
Yong-sam said that he cannot find proof showing that the North 
has nuclear arms. Nevertheless, he tried to continually blame us 
for the nuclear issue, and even said that the nuclear issue in 
the North is a stumbling block that may hinder reunification 
forever. 
  In fact, his remarks only revealed the criminal intention to 
continue the confrontation policy on the pretext of the nuclear 
issue, to pursue permanent national division, and to constantly 
maneuver to harm [haechida] us in collusion with the imperialist 
reactionaries. 
  Setting reunification in the nineties as their firm goal, 
all 
fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas have 
joined a gigantic reunification march toward great national 
unity. 
  National reunification will be achieved, regardless of what 
the Kim Yong-sam group wants. That the Kim Yong-sam group 
pursues confrontation on the pretext of the nuclear issue in 
collusion with outside forces by betraying the nation, and 
advances in the direction of disturbing reunification, can be 
only regarded as the way of thinking by a stupid person who lost 
his sense and who cannot find the correct direction to advance. 
  It is clear to everyone that traitor Kim Yong-sam held a 
news 
conference on the occasion of the first anniversary of his 
inauguration in an attempt to repress the people's heightened 
antigovernment struggle and to evade the crisis in his rule. 
However, this is the same as shopping for wool and coming home 
shorn. The puppet confessed by accident that South Korea was 
fallen into a swamp of stagnation, but failed to put forward any 
alternative policy for rescuing the people from the swamp, thus 
disappointing the people. 
  The puppet also made gibberish as if he receives so-called 
reports from the United States pertaining to DPRK-U.S. talks and 
as if he controls the talks, in spite of being unqualified even 
to join the talk table. He even described the people's slogan 
for overthrowing Kim Yong-sam and heightened spirit of 
protesting against the civilian government as the result of 
democratic development. Even with a prepared text for answers to 
expected questions, he could not find a proper answer in the 
text, thus speaking in ambiguities. All this showed the 
puppet's shamelessness, cunning nature, and ignorance. 
  All of traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks and acts that day 
evoked only the people's disappointment. With rascal Kim 
Yong-sam, one cannot achieve independence and democracy of South 
Korean society, nor can the rights of existence be guaranteed, 
and one can never expect peace and reunification from 
North-South relations. This is the conclusion drawn again by the 
people after seeing the news conference. 
  The sooner such a foolish national traitor like traitor Kim 
Yong- sam is removed, the better. The South Korean people will 
rise in the struggle to overthrow Kim Yong-sam's traitorous 
regime and to establish an independent and democratic government.

<F P=106> ["Heinous Sword-Brandishing Against Anti-War, Anti-Nuke </F>
Struggle" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique, together with the United States, schemes to 
introduce Patriot missiles into South Korea and stage 
large-scale nuclear war exercises against the fellow countrymen, 
raising a hue and cry over the "nuclear issue" of the North, 
according to a report. 
  This is a grave military provocation inciting North-South 
confrontation and bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula 
to an extreme pitch of strain. It is an unpardonable criminal 
act against the dialogue partner. 
  South Korean people and students are now staging fierce 
demonstrations urging a stop to the introduction of the Patriot 
missiles and "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. Even the 
opposition Democratic Party expresses strong opposition to this. 
  The anti-war, anti-nuke movement in South Korea is a very 
just struggle based on the patriotic stand to achieve peace on 
the Korean peninsula, and, accordingly, it can never be a target 
of suppression. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group, however, is brutally suppressing the 
just anti-war, anti-nuke struggle of the South Korean people. 
This eloquently proves that the puppet clique is desperately 
trying to light the train of another war against the DPRK by 
introducing U.S. destruction weapons into South Korea at 
whatever cost. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam must not run amok, clearly mindful 
that to crack down upon the just patriotic struggle of the 
people at the point of bayonet and rush headlong along the road 
of division and confrontation will eventually precipitate his 
own destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- The 70 million 
fellow countrymen, who love the country and the nation and hope 
for national reunification, must vigorously wage the common 
struggle of the nation to overthrow the anti-national, 
anti-democratic and anti- reunification Kim Yong-sam puppet 
regime and establish a genuine government, independent and 
democratic. 
  This call was made by the Central Committee of the 
Democratic 
Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland in its appeal to 
the compatriots at home and abroad Friday to launch a nationwide 
noble struggle for settling scores with the Kim Yong-sam 
traitorous clique for its monstrous crimes against the country 
and the nation in the last one year and overthrow this 
despicable group. 
  Recalling that the traitor Kim Yong-sam recently decided to 
allow the United States to deploy Patriot missiles and attack 
helicopters in South Korea and invited infamous U.S. state 
intelligence agents to South Korea, offering the land as an 
intelligence base of the U.S. imperialists directed against the 
North, the appeal said: 
  The traitor signed the treacherous "special agreement" for 
largely increasing South Korea's burden share for the 
maintenance of the U.S. troops in South Korea and induced the 
United States to pigeonhole the "program of the phased reduction 
of the U.S. troops." He is really a pro-U.S. traitor who has 
totally opened the rice market to U.S. surplus agricultural 
products. 
  Branding the traitor Kim Yong-sam as a "civilian" fascist 
overshadowing his predecessors, the appeal said his clique has 
turned down with violence the South Korean workers' demand for 
wage hike and the means of suppression has become all the 
craftier and harsher. 
  Saying the traitor is a most despicable national separatist 
and warmaniac, it said: 
  He has stalled all the North-South dialogues, which had been 
held even in the period of the "fifth and sixth republics" and 
has staged such joint military manoeuvres with the United States 
as "Team Spirit," "Ulchi Focus Lens" and "Kfoal" "Agpe" [names 
as received] and other war games, crying for a "military 
reaction", to the north. 
  The one year hkoverebvby the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is a 
year of pro-7 [as received] pro-Japanese flunkeyist treachery 
and "civilian" fascism and a year of crimes and disgrace run 
through with confrontation, division and war moves. It has 
become all the more obvious that with him left alone, neither 
the independence and democratisation of the South Korean society 
nor the peace and peaceful reunification of the country can be 
expected. 
  Today the attitude towards the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is 
a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from treachery. And 
whether one joins in the anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle or not is a 
yardstick showing whether he wants independence and democracy of 
the South Korean society and peace and peaceful reunification of 
the country, or not. 
  All the Koreans, whether they be in the North or South or 
abroad and whether they be communists or nationalists, must 
unite with each other [words indistinct] nation and invigorate 
the struggle for national reunification, regarding the 10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation as a common 
guideline of the nation.

<F P=106> ["CPRF Exposes Crimes of Traitor Kim Yong-sam in His First </F>
Year in Power" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- The Committee for 
the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] released an 
indictment Thursday exposing the crimes committed by the traitor 
Kim Yong-sam in his first year in power. 
  The indictment, citing detailed materials, roundly exposes 
the fact that he has resorted to flunkeyist treacheries, fascist 
dictatorship, schemes to perpetuate the division of the country 
and war moves in a more crafty and vicious way than the 
preceding military fascist dictators in last one year after he 
came to power under the "civilian" mask. 
  According to the indictment, it is one of the blackest 
crimes 
he committed during the year that he has impaired and sold off 
the interests of the country and the nation, persistently 
pursuing the flunkeyist and treacherous policy. 
  In his "inaugural address" he said that no allies "can be 
better than the nation." No sooner had he held all the strings 
of power, however, than he left South Korea lock, stock and 
barrel as an aggressive military base of the United States, 
opened the domestic rice market to the United States and turned 
South Korea into a market of Japanese goods. 
  Worse still, he invited Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa to Seoul in November last year and told him that the 
issue of "comfort women for the army" and other monstrous crimes 
committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people 
in the past should be buried in oblivion and South Korea and 
Japan should develop new "relations" and flung open the door to 
Japan for its economic comeback to South Korea. 
  Since he took office, the traitor has stooped to any infamy 
in his efforts to "isolate and reject" the North in the 
international arena, rehearsing the rumor about "the North's 
nuclear arms development" spread by the imperialist 
reactionaries. 
  Another blackest crime of the Kim Yong-sam group is that it 
has harshly suppressed the just, patriotic struggle of the South 
Korean students and people for independence, democracy and 
reunification, reducing South Korea to a theatre of fascist 
rowdyism, a waste land of the nation and a graveyard of human 
rights. 
  The group has kept intact all the legal and institutional 
mechanisms such as the "National Security Law," the "Security 
Planning Board" and the "secret affairs command," which the 
preceding military fascist regimes regarded as the foundations 
for their existence. It has bloodily suppressed the struggle of 
the South Korean people by dint of them. 
  By October last year the fascist clique had imprisoned more 
than 200 students and intellectuals by invoking the "National 
Security Law." This number is 2.5 times that in the 
corresponding months of the early period of the power of the No 
Tae-u puppet clique. 
  Entering this year, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's 
suppression has become all the more outrageous. 
  In early February when peasants and students demonstrated to 
protect the farm market, the puppet clique brutally suppressed 
them with the mobilization of more than 15,000-strong riot 
police of 130 companies and arrested no fewer than 400 of them, 
branding their patriotic struggle as "violence." 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam is a thorough-paced 
anti-reunification element who has driven the North-South 
relations from bad to worse and opposed peaceful reunification 
of the country. 
  Even after he received the 10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation sent by the North, he, turning down 
the magnanimous proposal of the North for reconciliation and 
unity, has totally frozen inter-Korean high-level talks and 
foiled the exchange of special envoys between the North and the 
South. He also perpetrated such inhuman and anti-reunification 
criminal acts as blocking the Seoul trip of a mourners' group of 
the North to participate in the funeral of the Rev. Mun Ik-hwan 
in January and not allowing a Panmunjom contact between 
delegates of the chondoists of the North and the South for the 
joint commemoration of the centenary of the peasants' war in 
1894. 
  The anti-reunification nature of the traitor was graphically 
illustrated by the fact that he brought forward a "three-stage 
unification formula" based on "institutional unification" which 
may foster confrontation and spark off a war between the fellow 
countrymen, motivated by the "concept of uselessness of 
unification" the keypoint of which is that "unification which 
fails to ensure liberal democracy and market economy is no 
better than division." 
  It is an intolerable high treason that after taking power, 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has zealously schemed to provoke 
a war against the fellow countrymen in the North, following 
outside forces. 
  From the beginning of the year, the puppet clique has staged 
war exercises with the United States against the North, 
increasing military tension. It openly stated that if the "Team 
Spirit" nuclear war exercises were suspended this year, joint 
military manoeuvres equivalent to them in scale would be staged 
in August. 
  Getting off into war hysterics, the Kim Yong-sam group has 
brought into South Korea various types of military equipment 
including ground-to-ground missiles and fighter planes of next 
generation by increasing military expenditures. It has also put 
spurs on nuclear arms development, openly claiming that "nuclear 
right must be secured." In actuality, such comprador 
enterprises of South Korea as the Chang Won Machines, the 
Nuclear Fuel Corporation, Ltd. the nuclear fuel plastic 
processing factory and the Atomic Energy Technology Corporation, 
Ltd. have separately manufactured in secrecy accessories and 
materials necessary for nuclear bombs, labelled as ordinary 
goods or with ciphers. 
  The facts clearly show that with the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
wearing the "civilian" veil left intact, neither national 
reconciliation and unity, nor the reunification in the '90s 
which the whole nation eagerly hopes for, nor the independence 
and democratization of the South Korean society can be achieved 
and only the confrontation will be fostered and war caused 
between the fellow countrymen.

<F P=106> ["They Must Not Put Brakes on Solution to Nuclear Issue of </F>
Korean Peninsula" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- Japanese 
reactionaries are these days making thoughtless remarks throwing 
a wet blanket over the agreement on an inspection for 
guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards which was reached 
between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
according to reports. 
  At the Japan-U.S. summit, Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa showed "a responsible reaction" over the "nuclear 
issue" of the DPRK and, at the the budgetary committee of the 
house of representatives recently, he urged "a special 
inspection" of military sites in the DPRK. And he did not 
forget to cry for "continued pressure on North Korea" whenever 
an opportunity presented itself. 
  In an article contributed to THE WASHINGTON TIMES, former 
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said that "economic 
sanctions" must be imposed on "North Korea" if it refuses to 
accept "a special inspection." And Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata also vociferated about "special inspection" at a 
recent press conference. 
  Such remarks of Japanese reactionaries are dastardly 
utterances intended to bar the progress of the agreement reached 
between the DPRK and the IAEA with much difficulty. What they 
seek in this is to force unreasonable "special inspection" upon 
us, disarm us and stifle anthropocentric socialism of Korean 
style. 
  Considering that the "special inspection" is one of the 
fundamental reasons that compelled our republic to declare its 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to call for 
this inspection is an act designed to force us out of the 
treaty. In that case, a very dangerous critical situation will 
be created on the Korean peninsula, and it will not bring good 
results to Japan, either. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, looking 
squarely at the current trend, and stop putting brakes on the 
progress of the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] There has been a substantial improvement in 
Australia's trade position with figures for January showing a 
welcome fall in imports and rise in exports. 
  Seasonally adjusted trade deficit for the month was $1.26 
billion [Australian dollars]. That is in line with market 
expections and well down on the revised December result which 
blew out to $1.6 billion. 
  Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show the 
balance of merchandise trade turned around from a deficit in 
December to a surplus in January. There was a seasonally 
adjusted 4 percent rise in exports during the month while 
imports fell 5 percent, helping to quell market fears that the 
economic recovery was running too fast. 
  The fall in import was despite the purchase by Qantas of a 
new aircraft -- the first civil aircraft imported since October 
of last year.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Trade ministers from Australia and New Zealand have 
held their first meeting since last December's agreement in the 
Uruguay Round of world trade talks. The two countries have 
agreed the Cairns Group -- the Australian-led group of 
agricultural trading nations -- will have an important future 
role in monitoring the commitments given in the Uruguay Round. 
  New Zealand also backed Australia's concern over the 
approach 
taken by the United States in its trade dispute with Japan. 
Camille Funnel spoke to Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan, 
who is in Auckland, and asked him about the future of the Cairns 
Group. 
  [Begin recording] [McMullan] We agreed today that there is a 
very big role for the Cairns Group. It played a big part in 
getting the agriculture enhancement through the Uruguay Round 
that will be so important for Australia over the next few years. 
We think the two big jobs that we have in front of us at the 
moment are, one, to make sure that those agreements are actually 
implemented and, secondly to work in the body that is going to 
be established next year called the World Trade Organization to 
make sure that those of us who are involved in fair trade in 
agriculture -- us, New Zealand, Latin American countries, many 
of our friends in ASEAN, and others -- that we work together in 
that group to make sure that it continues as a forum that puts 
pressure on the unfair trading practices of some of the bigger 
players in agriculture so that we can build on the good 
achievements we have made to get a better deal for our farmers 
in the world market. 
  [Funnell] How can the Cairns Group effectively monitor 
whether other countries stick to the letter of the Uruguay 
agreement? I mean, you have no sort of big stick you can wield, 
have you? 
  [McMullan] Well, the World Trade Organization does give us a 
mechanism and a body of rules within which agricultural trade 
should be implemented, and it does give us that capacity to take 
disputes about whether people are complying with the treaty to 
that organization through its dispute-settling mechanism. 
  That is why apart from the immediate benefits that will flow 
to particular industries, the other benefit for Australia of a 
multilateral agreement on trade is that it sets up a body of 
rules that can protect the small and medium-size players from 
what could otherwise be unilateral action by the bigger 
countries and trading groups, like the European Union and the 
United States. 
  [Funnell] And what about the future of APEC [Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation]? Did you discuss that with your New 
Zealand counterpart? 
  [McMullan] Yes, we did. APEC is probably the biggest issue 
for 1994 because of the very important leaders' meeting that is 
going to be held in Jakarta toward the end of the year. And it 
is important that it continue its momentum. 
  What we did discuss today was that when people launched the 
APEC initiative four or five years ago, I think they would not 
have envisaged it coming as far as it has as quickly as it has. 
But we need to maintain that momentum and start to get some of 
those benefits that start to make it easier for business to 
trade in the region -- the trade facilitation, the things that 
mean that more economic success and more jobs are generated by 
activity in the region. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] PHNOM PENH, March 1 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas forced Cambodian troops to retreat from the major 
rebel base in northern Cambodia they captured early this month, 
but the military officially denied that the base had again 
fallen into rebel hands. [passage omitted] 
  "We strongly deny that the Khmer Rouge recaptured the base. 
The news...is exaggerated," Cambodian military spokesman 
General Nhean Manou said. "The Khmer Rouge have shelled us every 
day with 300 to 400 rounds since February 19 and we have 
withdrawn some men from the frontlines at Anlung Veng," he said. 
But another military official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said government troops were under heavy pressure and 
were forced to withdraw to positions up to 10 kilometers (six 
miles) to the south and west of the base. The 10-kilometer line 
is the position where the government troops launched their 
offensive last August. 
  Western diplomats said they could not confirm that the Khmer 
Rouge had taken the base but said it was possible as it was 
difficult for the government to send supplies to the men 
stationed in the remote and inhospitable area.

<F P=106> ["Article": "The Presence of Nearly Four Million Vietnamese </F>
Settlers in Cambodia Must Not Be Legalized; All Vietnamese 
Settlers Must Be Gathered in Camps and Sent Back to Vietnam"] 
  [Text] Puppet Chea Sim, the out-and-out lackey of the 
Vietnamese communists, will soon go to Hanoi according to a 
report from a group of National Assembly members. The report 
added that in this trip to Hanoi, puppet Chea Sim will seek 
approval for a draft immigration law from the Vietnamese 
communists before presenting it to the two-headed government and 
puppet National Assembly for endorsement into law. 
  It should be recalled that during his visit to Phnom Penh 
from 16 to 18 February, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh 
Cam instructed the two-headed government and his puppets to 
draft an immigration law to legalize the presence of nearly four 
million Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia. 
  The issue of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia is a national 
problem linked to the survival of the entire Cambodian nation 
and people and of every Cambodian and family. Since 1979, 
Vietnamese settlers kept flowing into Cambodia at will with the 
permission of the Vietnamese puppet administration to serve as a 
prop for the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese aggressor 
troops. 
  After the signing of the Paris agreement in October 1991, 
Vietnamese settlers came to Cambodia through UNTAC [UN 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia] and all the Vietnamese 
puppet administrative networks maintained by UNTAC. After the 
UNTAC-organized elections, more Vietnamese settlers continued to 
flow into Cambodia through the two-headed government of which 
ninty-nine percent of the Phnom Penh-based power and 100-percent 
power in the provinces, districts, communes, and villages are in 
the hands of the Vietnamese communists' puppet administration. 
  The issue of Vietnamese settlers must be resolved in 
accordance with international law, which clearly states the 
status of foreign settlers entering other countries during a war 
of aggression, and according to the rules and regulations 
applied and being applied in various countries, such as Hong 
Kong and some other countries in this region. That is, all 
Vietnamese settlers must be gathered in concentration camps and 
then repatriated in an orderly manner. 
  The two-headed government must be held fully responsible for 
the Cambodian nation, people, and history in approving the 
presence of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia, thus enabling them 
to turn Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom through legal 
means.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP March 1 -- There remain in Cambodia 
two major problems to be settled, according to Cambodian first 
and second prime ministers, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh 
and Samdech Hun Sen. 
  In a meeting on Friday, 25 February, with Japanese 
delegations led by Mr. Shozo Azuma, vice minister for foreign 
affairs, and Mr. Eisei Ito, vice minister for construction who 
had come here to attend the inaugural ceremony of the 
Cambodia-Japan Friendship Bridge, the Cambodian prime ministers 
said although the Royal Government had made a number of 
concessions the Khmer Rouge were still continuing to resort to 
their military activities. 
  "However the royal government is capable and optimistic to 
solve this problem because Cambodia has got legitimate 
government, Constitution, National Assembly and political unity 
among the two biggest ruling parties, and the support from the 
people," they said. Another problem to be settled is, according 
to them, the rehabilitation which they said would prevent the 
return of Khmer Rouge if successfully done. 
  The Cambodian prime ministers called on the Japanese 
investors [words indistinct] ventures in Cambodia especially in 
the agricultural field and in the restoration of hydro-electric 
station in Prek Thnaot, which, they viewed, are the basic 
factors for the development in Cambodia. 
  The Cambodian leaders expressed thanks to the Japanese 
delegations for having visited Cambodia and attended the 
inaugural ceremony of the Cambodia-Japan Friendship Bridge built 
by Japan. The bridge is the vivid proof of good relations of 
friendship between the two peoples, they said. 
  They thanked the Japanese Government for having invited them 
to attend the international conference on the reconstruction of 
Cambodia (ICORC) to be held in Tokyo in March this year. 
Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Shozo Azuma, who 
will preside over the ICORC, pledged to explain to the donor 
countries to address the basic needs of Cambodia in its 
rehabilitation.

Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs

charge d'affaires of the French embassy in Cambodia, signed two 
cooperation agreements in Phnom Penh on 25 February. 
  The first agreement is on the restoration and 
reorganization, 
with France's assistance, of the Phnom Penh Royal Administration 
School, which has ceased functioning since the interruption of 
war in the country in 1970. The French side will provide 
necessary materials to the school and send French professors to 
help restart its operation. 
  The second accord concerns the cooperation between the two 
governments in the military field, including the presence of two 
French experts in insuring the country's security. Moreover, 
France will also grant scholarships to Cambodian military 
personnel and supply the Cambodian Army with materiel.

  [Excerpts] Phnom Penh -- The adoption of a French 
accounting system here will be a disincentive to much needed 
foreign investment and an unnecessary administrative burden for 
local companies, local businessmen have alleged, according to 
the Government news agency AKP. "It is a waste and totally 
unnecessary. No trading company here is going to present their 
accounts like this," it quoted a businessman as saying. 
  The Finance Ministry has recently announced that the French 
system would be the official accounting system to be used by 
local and foreign companies. Under the former government, there 
was no centralised tax collection system. [passage omitted] 
  The main difference between the French and 
Anglo-international system is the way assets and liabilities are 
classified and how depreciation is treated, an investment 
consultant said. 
  The decision has brought about protest from local companies 
who claim that their accounts will have to be double-booked in 
two systems, new software and the retraining of current 
accounting staff. At the most, eight to 10 companies, which are 
all French, will benefit from this system while the others will 
suffer. A businessman has predicted widespread chaos in the 
local business community as Singapore, Taiwanese and Hong 
Kong-based companies, the biggest investors here, are only 
familiar with the Anglo international accounting system. 
[passage omitted] 
  The decision to adopt a French accounting system follows a 
dispute last year over the decision to retain French as the 
country's second language. Students had protested against this 
move at the University of Technology as they claimed that 
English was being widely accepted here, especially amongst the 
business community and that English, not French, would benefit 
them better.

<F P=106> [Article by T. Mohan and Ouk Kimseng: "Arbitration System </F>
To Be Established Soon for Trade Disputes"] 
  [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Ministry of Justice is studying 
the possibility of establishing an arbitration system here to 
tackle trade and commercial disputes. This is a concerted 
attempt to give confidence to businesses dealing with trading, 
especially international businesses and contracts. 
  Senior Minister Chem Snguon, in a wide ranging exclusive 
interview with The Cambodia Times, said: "This arbitration 
court and system must be adopted soon. Concerning the Ministry 
of Justice, we want only to give confidence to investors and 
businesses dealing with this country to show that if there is 
any conflict, they could rely on the local justice. That is why 
the arbitration system must be adopted very quickly. Contrary to 
common notion, the courts here in the city have heard several 
commercial cases pertaining to contracts and international 
investments and judgement has already been given." 
  "Our courts are competent to judge all conflicts arising 
from 
contractual disputes from commercial courts," said Chem Snguon, 
who is also the Minister of Justice. "The Ministry of Justice 
would like to introduce the system of arbitration to hear 
contractual disputes. In this respect, I would like to study 
the problems arising from the establishment of such systems 
elsewhere in neighbouring countries, so that the system when 
established and enforced here will be coherent and effective," 
he pointed out. 
  "In the field of commerce and economics, the Justice 
Ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance and Trade, is 
looking into the possibility of adopting the common law system." 
  Chem added that the judicial field in this country was 
presently based on the French judicial system. "The Ministry is 
now studying the common law way of procedures to see how we can 
borrow some elements and possibilities which could help us solve 
all the cases more quickly and efficiently." 
  "We have requested the assistance of UNDP [United Nations 
Development Program] to provide expertise on the common law 
system to help improve the system. There has been a court in 
existence in all the provinces since 1982. There are a total of 
21 courts at the provincial level, one Appeals Court, one 
Supreme Court and one Military Court," Chem said. 
  "The Ministry of Justice and the judicial system here does 
not have enough means to face all the cases we receive. 
Nevertheless, we are striving hard to revive the judicial 
system to a level which will enable our task (to be carried out) 
efficiently, quickly and independently. It is the responsibility 
of the Ministry of Justice to reorganise all judicial systems in 
this nation to guarantee independence of Cambodian courts, 
judges, prosecutors and magistrates. The Ministry of Justice 
must give priority to legal formation and jurisdiction formation 
to have more judges and prosecutors at all levels and at all 
areas. We aspire to have between three to five judges per court 
and two to four prosecutors."

  [Text] The Nusantara Aircraft Industry (IPTN) needs about 
500 billion rupiahs in order to expand its plant in Bandung by 
500 hectares. However, making that project a reality is hampered 
by the problem of procuring land. A BISNIS source at IPTN 
revealed that the funding would be used to expand the plant area 
and to procure equipment and general facilities, including 
employee housing. "Due to growth in the demand for aircraft and 
in the number of employees the present site is no longer 
sufficient," he said here yesterday. 
  However, he believes that making the project a reality will 
be hampered by the difficulty of finding 500 hectares of land in 
Bandung. IPTN Inc Director of Planning Yuliswar said that 
Minister of Research and Technology J. B. Habibie has requested 
the 500 hectares. As of now, he said, IPTN management has only 
gotten about 300. He denied that it is difficult to find land 
because of land speculation. "Procuring land is not a problem. 
It's true there's a problem of price. The price of land in 
Bandung is certainly higher." 
  B.J. Habibie, Managing Director of IPTN Inc, has expressed 
his concern about increased land speculation. He said that the 
problem is how to find additional sites for IPTN Inc expansion 
in Bandung because of speculation. "That's why I'm asking 
provincial heads to stop it. Speculation clearly hampers 
investment and economic development," he said at the end of last 
year. 
  Even though land speculation throws a shadow over the site 
problem, Yusliswar is optimistic that it can be solved. The IPTN 
Inc expansion will occupy an area adjacent to the old site. 
"This project will be carried out in stages, in line with 
production of the N-250 aircraft, due to start in 1995," he told 
BISNIS and REPUBLIKA yesterday. 
  Plans are for a first-year production capacity of six N-250 
aircraft. Capacity will be increased to 52 per year in line with 
growth in demand. Due to additional capacity and the number of 
employees, now 15,000, the present 70-hectare site is no longer 
sufficient. 
  Yuliswar also revealed that although the allocation of PMP 
[Government Capital Participation] funds for BUMNIS [Strategic 
Industry State-Owned Corporations] is decreasing, the government 
has guaranteed that R&amp;D funds and initial working capital 
will 
be made available to develop the N-250. "I don't know exactly 
how much. It will clearly support IPTN Inc's production 
operations, especially for first deliveries of the N-250 in 
1997," he said. He did not say whether funds for changing the 
aircraft's design are included in the R&amp;D funds which the 
government has guaranteed. 
  At the same time, Hari Laksono, Director of the Universal 
Maintenance Center (UMC-IPTN), said that as part of the effort 
to increase local content, IPTN Inc is pioneering the production 
of aircraft engine components.

  [Excerpt] Bandar Lampung, Feb 26 (ANTARA) -- The government 
has assigned PT [Private Limited] Duma Na Napu in cooperation 
with Southern Electric International to construct the 200 
megawatts steam-power plant (PLTU) worth U.S.$300 million in 
southern Lampung. President/Director of PT Duma Na Napu Soy 
Martua Pardede said Friday his company is currently preparing 
the proposal to be handed over to the Ministry of Mines and 
Energy director-general for electricity. Pardede, after his 
meeting with Lampung's deputy-governor Man Hasan, said here 
Friday that the proposal is expected to be submitted in May. 
  The steam-power plant will be built on a 50-hectare site, a 
land that has been relinquished by the state-owned electricity 
firm PLN [National Electricity Board]. "We are obliged to pay 
PLN for compensations only," Pardede said. 
  In constructing the steam-combined-cycle-power plant, PT 
Duma 
Na Napu will also cooperate with local contractors such as 
Bakrie Brothers and the Wirataman consultants, a consultancy 
firm also hired by the Paiton PLTU in east Java. 
  The Southern Electric International is a giant American 
company and manages a number of electricity-generating projects 
with a combined capacity of 36 million megawatts, Pardede said. 
This capacity is three times the size of PLN's electrical 
capacity, he added. 
  The Lampung project construction will begin late 1995 and is 
expected to be operational in 1998. The power-plant will get 
its coal supply from Bukit Asam, a coal mining area in the same 
province. The location of the plant is adjacent to the Bandar 
Lampung Tarahan coal port that has so far served as terminal for 
coals being transported to Suralaya's PLTU in west Java. The 
Tarahan coal port is able to accommodate 10 million tons of coal 
annually, and will be expanded to accommodate at least 12.5 
million tons yearly. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Manila, Feb. 25 KYODO -- A high-level Japanese 
economic mission Friday [25 February] ended talks with Filipino 
counterparts assuring Manila that Tokyo will continue to support 
its bid for self-reliance. 
  But the mission headed by Ambassador Yasue Katori emphasized 
the need for "transparency and accountability" in implementing 
official development assistance (ODA) extended to the 
Philippines. 
  Hideaki Ueda, a member of the mission, said reports of 
corruption in the use of ODA in the Philippines have triggered 
criticism in Japan. He said, however, no particular case was 
discussed during the talks. 
  Japan is the Philippine's biggest foreign donor, providing 
37 
percent or about 2 billion dollars of all ODA to the country 
last year. 
  In a joint press statement, the mission also said the 
philippines should continue to further "self-help efforts," 
particularly in the areas of tax reform and agrarian reform. It 
also expressed Japan's desire for the Philippines to "pay full 
consideration to the environment impact of development projects." 
  Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said the Philippines 
responded by expressing its intention to continue "self-help 
efforts," particularly in raising counterpart funds related to 
ODA projects. 
  Manila also said it "recognized the need for greater 
transparency and accountability in the implementation of ODA" 
and pointed to parallel efforts toward environmental 
conservation. 
  The two sides agreed that future Japanese assistance will be 
channeled to economic infrastructure, support for the 
restructuring of industries and development of agriculture, 
poverty alleviation and environment conservation. The mission 
also expressed support for grass-roots projects in these fields. 
  Ueda said the philippines will be a major recipient of 
future 
Japanese aid but could not say how much of Tokyo's 70-75 billion 
dollar outlay for 1993-1997 Manila would be getting. He also 
said an early agreement between the Philippines and the 
International Monetary Fund would make discussions on future 
assistance easier but said this was not a "precondition" for the 
grant of Japanese ODA.

<F P=106> [Article by Hisahiko Okazaki, former ambassador to Thailand, </F>
from the "Seiron" column: "Pessimistic Prospects for Japan-U.S. 
Relations" ] 
  [Text]Economic Prospects Remain Uncertain 
  I am absolutely unable to remain silent about what is 
happening. 
  The economic framework talks have broken down, and the 
United 
States is preparing to impose sanctions against Japan. The yen 
is also appreciating. While the yen exchange rate is determined 
by the economic fundamentals on the long term, the United States 
has no intention at all to restrain yen appreciation, and there 
are reports that it is even secretly applauding Japan's 
predicament as a result of a strong yen. 
  The Japanese economy, which has just shown feeble signs of 
an 
upturn at the beginning of 1994, is now faced again with total 
uncertainty. The breakdown of the framework talks will surely 
bring enormous damage to the national economy and the people's 
livelihood. 
  Who is to blame for what happened? In the first place, was 
such a scenario really inevitable? I believe it could have been 
avoided. 
  The framework talks are not a venue for discussing numerical 
targets alone. There are three areas of negotiation: 
macroeconomic policy (that is, economic stimulation measures), 
microeconomic policy (that is, numerical targets for specific 
sectors), and Japan-U.S. cooperation in global issues, such as 
environment and population. 
  With regard to global cooperation, although this has only 
been reported on in an obscure section of the newspapers, Japan 
and the United States were able to reach a satisfactory 
agreement. 
  As to microeconomic policy, there was little possibility of 
reaching an agreement. This issue derived from the fact that at 
the Miyazawa-Clinton talks in 1993, the two leaders had somehow 
hammered out a rhetorical compromise although they really had 
different things in mind. Nevertheless, the U.S. argument was 
not persuasive under the principle of free trade. Even in the 
United States, economic experts were mostly opposed to the U.S. 
position. During the bilateral negotiations up to late 1993, 
the USTR was the only one taking a tough position, while the 
other economic departments in the U.S. Government were even 
embarrassed to say such things to Japan. They thought Japan 
would never compromise under the circumstances. The 
negotiations were going nowhere. However, in January, after the 
United States consolidated its position on the negotiations with 
Japan, naturally, it adopted a unified tough line. At that 
point, even if an agreement could be reached in the 
microeconomic field, it would have amounted to nothing more than 
Japan sharing the pains with the United States. 
  Therefore, the only way to save the framework talks was in 
the macroeconomic area. In fact, the Japanese and U.S. 
negotiators I contacted were saying, "If only Japan can satisfy 
the United States in the macroeconomic aspect...." I had 
believed all along that Japan would do something in this area. 
I am not really an expert in economics, and it was not an area 
that I should be meddling in. Moreover, I thought, saying that 
economic stimulation measures were necessary in consideration of 
relations with the United States might have the wrong effect. 
So I refrained from saying anything. 
<H5>  Large-Scale Tax Cut Could Have Been the Way Out </H5>
  Specifically, at that time, Japan was talking about a tax 
cut 
of from 5 to 7 trillion yen. Even if this was not increased to 
8 trillion yen, 7 trillion yen plus something extra would 
certainly have enabled the United States to boast of winning a 
major concession from Japan. 
  If an agreement could be reached in both the macroeconomic 
and global aspects, it would have been possible to put off the 
microeconomic area for future discussion. Since the U.S. 
economy has entered a recovery period, it was fully reasonable 
to expect that in six months' time, the United States would be 
in a mood of "not taking such a tough stand against Japan." 
Furthermore, since even U.S. economists are divided on the 
numerical targets, Japan could expect that the momentum for 
pursuing these targets would be lost. In addition, Japan would 
be given six months' time to actively campaign in such a 
direction. To say the least, since there was no hope for 
solving the microeconomic issues, it was the only strategy left. 
  I thought that was what the government would do because that 
was the only possible way. In fact, even now, when I ask the 
officials involved in the negotiations, they reply that, "Since 
it was impossible to agree in microeconomics, there was supposed 
to be a solution in macroeconomics." In other words, the proper 
strategy was not implemented even though everybody knew about it. 
  But why? The original plan to implement 6 trillion yen tax 
cuts for three years was 100 percent the Finance Ministry's 
idea, and there was not a trace of any effort to save Japan-U.S. 
relations with a little extra policy measures. This could have 
been because the political authorities were not fully aware of 
the seriousness of the problem, or because the lack of awareness 
on the part of the bureaucrats made them resist any such 
measures. The fact is, the United States was dissatisfied 
because "this was 1 or 2 trillion yen less than expected." 
  Nevertheless, the United States decided to see the tax 
cut plan as "one step forward." With that, it was at least 
possible, despite serious reservations on the part of the United 
States, to lay the groundwork for avoiding an open breakdown in 
the framework talks. The Social Democratic Party of Japan 
eliminated even this possibility. Similarly, the Liberal 
Democratic Party could have opted to forget party interests and 
political maneuverings for a while and support the government, 
but it chose to just laugh at the Hosokawa administration's 
failure. 
<H5>  A Mistake Not To Be Repeated </H5>
  Thus, Japan was forced into a confrontation with the United 
States with nobody taking the responsibility. This reminds us 
of the Pacific war. 
  If Japan had obtained the United States' blessing with an 
8-trillion-yen tax cut, and rid itself of the fear of yen 
appreciation, the mood prevailing in Japan today would have been 
entirely different. Under the existing circumstances, we can 
expect more corporate bankruptcies and unemployment. Who will 
take the political responsibility for the victims of this? 
  It is hard to say what Japan should do next. It depends on 
what the United States will do. Yet, for sure, the prospects 
are not bright at all. One lesson we should never forget is 
that in the future, if changes in the international situation 
again call to question the true worth of the Japan-U.S. 
alliance, Japan should never again pass over the chance to 
restore the relationship of trust between Japan and the United 
States.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Neighboring Countries Are Increasingly </F>
Concerned About an Economic Showdown Between Japan and the 
United States"] 
  [Text] Following the rupture of the Japan-U.S. summit, it 
seems that both countries are moving toward an economic 
showdown. In this regard, Japan's neighboring countries -- 
including East Asian nations, Canada, and Australia -- are 
increasingly worried about the situation. They are concerned 
because their economic reliance on Japan and the United States 
is high and they will be affected significantly should the 
relations between two major economic superpowers fall into a 
critical situation. Japan and the United States should remain 
calm and consider the possible impact of their economic ties on 
wide ranging areas in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  All of the neighboring countries are critical of the numeric 
target, which the United States is demanding Japan accept. They 
say that the establishment of such a target is linked to managed 
trade. They are also very cautious about the possibility that it 
may give a rise to bilateralism [nikokukan shugi]. Newspapers 
in Hong Kong and Australia are also critical of the United 
States. They say that "it was only recently that following the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round, the GATT member nations finally 
confirmed to maintain multilateralism [takokukan shugi]." 
  They are not saying this to express sympathy toward Japan. 
The newspapers are sharing the same view that "Japan can 
certainly afford to open up its market and ease regulations a 
little more." Their true feeling is that "it is not enough to 
say no to the United States." 
  However, these countries feel uneasy about the hard-line 
attitude of the United States toward Japan. East Asian nations 
heavily rely on the U.S. market. Many of them have huge amount 
of surplus trade with the United States. Therefore, the East 
Asian nations feel that the United States may assume the same 
hard-line attitude toward them. Of late, the U.S. Government, 
by using the issues of human rights and working conditions as an 
excuse, is trying to take a protectionist stand toward China and 
Indonesia. However, the newspapers (including ASIAN WALL STREET 
JOURNAL and FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW) are strongly 
criticizing this U.S. move. 
  Some people think that the Clinton administration's 
hard-line 
stand toward Japan is the same as "brinkmanship," a strategy the 
United States assumed to deal with the Soviet Union during the 
Cold War period. This is a strategy designed to force an 
opponent to give in by assuming hard-line policies until the 
last minute while knowing that there is a high risk (in this 
case, an increase in anti-American sentiment in Japan). 
  It is said that President Clinton is aiming to strengthen 
his 
stand at home. He "began to take psychological retaliation 
against Japan" to reverse the economic situation in which the 
United States "has always been beaten by Japan," and thereby 
ease American people's distorted feelings, (according to 
WASHINGTON POST reporter Hoagland). 
  It was pointed out that such an attitude of the U.S. 
administration toward Japan indicates that, in the long run, the 
United States may take the same stand toward the entire East 
Asia in the future, (according to INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE 
reporter Bowling). 
  Last fall, President Clinton hosted a summit, attended by 
Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation Minister Conference members 
in Seattle. At that time, it was pointed out that mutual 
relations between Japan, China, and the United States were 
important to the Asia- Pacific region's stability and 
prosperity. The United States expressed its intention to attach 
importance to multilateralism. 
  However, the Asia-Pacific region's future will become gloomy 
if Japan and the United States remain at loggerhead. We are 
certain that the neighboring countries will suffer hardship as a 
result of the dispute between Japan and the United States. Its 
impact may be felt in the security area too. We must not let 
the Japan-United States confrontation tear apart the 
Asia-Pacific region.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Relations Between Japan and the United States </F>
Must Be Seen From a Broad Perspective"] 
  [Text] Relations between Japan and the United States have 
again become stormy. In view of their importance to the people 
of the two countries, that is a worrying and regrettable fact. 
  The immediate cause of the situation is the rupture of the 
recent talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
President Clinton on the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations. 
Some argued that the breakdown of the talks was a sign of 
"maturing relations" between the two countries. 
  Given the subsequent chorus of criticism of Japan by the 
U.S. 
Government and Congress, as well as the fact that Japanese 
Government officials were upset by that criticism, however, it 
is difficult to see the "mature relations" between the two 
countries that the prime minister talked about. 
  It is also of concern that arguments hailing Japan's saying 
"No" to U.S. demands are tinged with nationalism. 
  Nobody will deny that the relations between Japan and the 
United States must mature further. That is all the more reason 
why we must have a sense of balance and think of the current 
trade frictions in the context of the total Japan-U.S. 
relationship. We must be coolheaded and not lose sight of the 
mid-and long-term trends. 
  Both the Japanese and the U.S. Governments consider the 
partnership of the two countries on three levels: "political 
and security matters," "economy," and "cooperation in tackling 
worldwide problems." They have also agreed that the economic 
link is the weakest among the three. The economic framework 
talks were arranged precisely for the purpose of strengthening 
such a weak link in bilateral relations. 
  Many Japanese and American people who had expected the two 
leaders to have talks from the broad perspective of turning 
point in world history -- even though the talks were part of new 
economic consultations -- must have been bewildered that their 
talks were like trade negotiations. 
  Nor can it be overlooked that the present Japan-U.S. 
relations reflect the nature of the U.S. administration. The 
Clinton administration gives the highest priority to putting the 
U.S. domestic economy on track and has no qualms in targeting 
American diplomacy at creating jobs in the United States and 
promoting its exports. It has also been pointed out that the 
American President does not have insightful and influential 
advisers who make up for his inexperience in diplomacy. 
  After the end of the Cold War, the Americans became inward- 
looking, and Congress, trade unions, and the industry tend to be 
protectionist-minded. Under such circumstances, the President 
may have thought he would lose nothing in domestic politics by 
adopting a strong attitude against Japan, which racked up a 
trade surplus with the United States amounting to nearly $60 
billion a year. 
  On the other hand, Prime Minister Hosokawa did not show any 
willingness to rise to the occasion by implementing deregulation 
and economic pump-priming measures to meet the wishes of the 
people here and abroad. The rupture in the talks, which at 
first glance looked as if it were the outcome of hard decisions 
made by the two leaders, really resulted from Clinton and 
Hosokawa evading the more difficult choice of exercising 
leadership from a broad perspective in their respective domestic 
politics. 
  To open the domestic market, put the economy on a road 
toward 
growth driven by domestic demand, and build a consumer-oriented 
nation are policy options that were not adopted to please the 
Americans or any other people. Those are choices made to usher 
in a brighter future for the Japanese themselves and are aimed 
at building the "nation with substance" that the prime minister 
propounded. 
  What is important is not to make a fuss over responses to 
immediate problems, but to steadfastly take measures that are 
meaningful in the medium and long-term. 
  If we take a little broader view, we find the Americans have 
begun to regain confidence in themselves as the economy has 
started to recover. At the state level, Japanese investment in 
the United States has been favorably evaluated. The Americans' 
understanding of the mutual dependence between Japan and the 
United States has gradually been gaining ground, though the 
trend is slowing. 
  Immediately before and after the summit talks between the 
Japanese and U.S. leaders, there were noticeably levelheaded 
arguments in the U.S. media that "the Japanese had a good case." 
And an opinion poll published by the Prime Minister's Office in 
Japan showed that the Japanese who thought that "the Americans 
were also partly right" in the trade frictions between the two 
countries outnumbered those who thought the friction resulted 
from the Americans' emotional response. 
  Signs of "maturity" should be sought in such aspects of 
Japanese and American opinion. 
  What is most needed now is a reasonable attitude so that the 
mutual mistrust and impatience exhibited by political leaders 
and bureaucrats will not widen and create mutual distrust at the 
grass- roots level.

<F P=106> [Article entitled "Inspection of Rupture of Negotiations </F>
Between Japan and U.S.; Foreign Ministry's 'Internal 
Disruption'"] 
  [Text] When the talks between Tsutomu Hata, foreign 
minister and concurrently deputy prime minister, and Mickey 
Kantor, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), were called off at 
0400 on 11 February immediately before the Japan-U.S. summit 
talks held in Washington, Takakazu Kuriyama, Japanese Ambassador 
to the United States, offered his resignation to Hata, saying "I 
shall resign." It was a moment when a de facto decision was 
made to announce the rupture of the comprehensive economic talks 
at the summit, which was to start a few hours later. 
  Foreign Minister Hata, who arrived in Washington on 10 
February to break the negotiations deadlock, started the final 
negotiations at the USTR Office. The first meeting started in 
the morning [of 10 February] followed by two more meetings. 
They lasted seven hours in total. However, the third meeting 
between Hata and Kantor started at 0100 on 11 February, but both 
sides were unable to reach an agreement over the numerical 
target issue. 
  At 0300, USTR Kantor called for a meeting with Foreign 
Minister Hata alone. Only Hata and Koichiro Matsuura, deputy 
vice foreign minister of foreign affairs who is in charge of 
working-level negotiations, remained at the negotiation table. 
Other negotiators of the Foreign Ministry, Finance Ministry, 
and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry left the 
room. Heated debate continued between USTR Kantor, W. Bowman 
Cutter -- deputy assistant to the President -- Foreign Minister 
Hata, and Matsuura. 
  Japanese bureaucrats were worried that "Hata may resign" 
because Kantor's demands were very severe. Foreign Minister 
Hata returned to Blair House, where he was staying, after the 
heated debate and explained the outcome of the one-hour debate 
to the negotiators of the three ministries. 
  Sad-looking Ambassador Kuriyama drew the negotiators' 
attention. He called after Foreign Minister Hata, who was on his 
way to his room after the explanation session, and asked the 
latter if he should resign. Foreign Minister Hata strongly 
dissuaded Kuriyama from resigning, saying that "there is no need 
for you to resign." 
  Some concerned people point out that the United States took 
the strong stand at the final phase of the negotiations because 
it though that Japan would change its mind and compromise. This 
idea had taken a hold on the United States due to the fact that 
Foreign Minister Hata arrived in Washington one day earlier than 
originally scheduled. 
  When he talked with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale 
in Tokyo in the evening of 7 February, Foreign Minister Hata 
said: "It is necessary to make a compromise to conclude the 
negotiations." The United States took this as an indication that 
Japan would compromise regarding the numerical target issue. In 
addition, Foreign Minister Hata came to Washington one day early. 
  The foreign minister himself did not like the idea of 
visiting the United States. He did not think the negotiations 
would be successfully concluded if he went to the United States 
without a compromise plan. It was Deputy Foreign Minister 
Kunihiko Saito who asked Foreign Minister Hata to visit the 
United States. 
  Opinions were divided in the Foreign Ministry. At a working- 
level meeting held in mid-January in Washington, Ambassador 
Kuriyama insisted on his view that "since the United States is 
becoming flexible, Japan should not smear salt on a wound." He 
was saying that Japan may need to flexibly deal with the issue 
of numerical target. However, the negotiators took an opposite 
stand. 
  In late January, Ambassador Kuriyama came home and met with 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and advised the latter to make 
a compromise. Around this time, the Foreign Ministry was 
divided into a group that supported a compromise plan and one of 
hard-liners. Deputy Foreign Minister Saito's view was getting 
close to Ambassador Kuriyama's. A senior Foreign Ministry 
official, who was of the opinion that Japan should refuse to 
accept the numerical target, disclosed to a senior official of 
other ministries that "we are being attacked by other members of 
our ministry." 
  Some people analyze the situation thusly: "It is possible 
that the Foreign Ministry group in favor of making a compromise 
sent Hata to Washington, secretly hoping that Japan would accept 
the numerical target." We cannot deny that the Foreign Ministry 
"split" had some impact on the negotiations.

  [Text] It was disclosed on 25 February that the United 
States unofficially delivered requests which the United States 
expects Japan to incorporate into voluntary market opening 
measures it has started to map out. Among other things, the 
main points of the U.S. requests are: 1) to significantly 
increase the budget for the fundamental 10-year project for 
public investment; 2) to voluntarily set a goal designed to 
reduce Japan's huge trade surplus; and 3) to front-load a plan 
to implement agreements, reached at the Japan-U.S. comprehensive 
trade talks, regarding priority areas of negotiations. 
  The United States is assuming a stance of "watching the 
situation because Japan is voluntarily preparing measures," 
(according to a U.S. Government source). Because of this, the 
United States did not make an official request in writing. 
However, it is said that the United States unofficially 
informed Japan, through several channels, including the Japanese 
Embassy in the United States, that the United States is "very 
much interested in Japan's voluntary measures." On 25 February, 
the Japanese Government decided to prepare market opening 
measures before the end of March by holding meetings, which will 
be attended by the appropriate ministers. However, since the 
United States conveyed the requests, the focal point has moved 
to how many of the U.S. requests the market opening measures 
will reflect. 
  The fundamental plan for public investments, which the 
United 
States is interested in, is designed to spend 430 trillion yen 
over the 10 year period starting in fiscal 1991. However, the 
United States wants Japan to significantly increase this amount, 
saying that it is not enough to reduce Japan's trade surplus. 
According to a U.S. Treasury Department calculation, the rate 
of public investments in the GNP will become lower than the 
current rate should Japan keep the 430 trillion yen. The same 
department also says that the current public investment rate 
will be maintained if 100 trillion yen is added. 
  The United States has not disclosed the actual amount of 
increase it wants Japan to make. However, on the basis of the 
calculation by the Treasury Department, it seems that the United 
States thinks that an increase of 100 trillion yen is needed.

"Japan and the United States Should Cool Themselves"] 
  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Kantor's stern face, 
which was reminiscent of a bird of prey, was more reddish than 
usual: "Please take a look at this chart. The market shares of 
Japanese and U.S. companies where Motorola Inc. can carry on 
free competition, in areas of Japan other than Tokyo and Nagoya, 
are fifty-fifty. However, the same company's share in Tokyo and 
Nagoya is only 1.17 percent." "This is the result of nine 
years' negotiations and of three agreements. This is the fact 
which is most illustrative of why we have adopted new economic 
framework talks which emphasize results." 
  The two line graphs on the chart clearly illustrated the 
difference of the shares: one graph showed that the number of 
users of NTT's [Nippon Telephone and Telegraph's] cellular 
telephones exceeded 300,000, while the other showed that the 
number of users of Motorola's cellular telephones did not reach 
13,000. 
  Concerning the opening of markets for automobiles and 
cellular telephones, Trade Representative Kantor stated on 15 
February that sanctions would be imposed on Japan on the grounds 
of violations of an agreement reached between Japan and the 
United States in 1989. That was four days after the breakdown of 
the new Japan-U.S. economic negotiations. 
  The yen rate, which was 108 yen to the dollar on 10 February 
in the Tokyo market before the consecutive holidays, rose to 103 
yen to the dollar on the European and U.S. markets on 14 
February and to 101 yen to the dollar temporarily on 15 February. 
  The line graph, "which is close to the ground," was shown on 
television and it disarmed the criticism within the United 
States that the U.S. Government intends to enforce managed trade 
on Japan, as Representative Kantor, who delivered a fervent 
speech, had expected 
  President Clinton repeatedly said at a news conference that 
"it was a mere accident that Kantor's speech coincided with the 
summit," but the miraculous timing is not "a mere accident." 
  At the end of last year, the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative suddenly moved up consideration of the agreement 
between the two countries, originally scheduled for March this 
year, to immediately after the summit. 
  On 10 January and on 13 February, the U.S. Government and 
Motorola Inc. leveled a new demand with punitive provisions that 
"unless improved measures are implemented, the license of JMCC 
[Japan Mobile Communications Company] -- a firm which handles 
Motorola's cellular telephones along with NTT's cellular 
telephones -- will be confiscated. Thus they have cut off 
Japan's retreat, creating a situation in which nothing is left 
but imposing sanctions. 
<H5>  Everything Went as Planned by the U.S. Government </H5>
  At a Japan-U.S. joint news conference held on 11 February, 
President Clinton twice suggested: "The exchange rate may be 
used as an index of objective criteria." The dealers twice 
received "a signal leading to a higher yen," and it was natural 
for the yen to rise. 
  Huge uproars, which lasted for several days following the 
breakdown of the talks, were merely the results of a series of 
explosions of time bombs carefully planted by the U.S. 
Government up to that time. Everything went as planned by the 
U.S. Government. 
  There are more "gambits" in store for shaking Japan. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Kantor said: "We will make a list 
of sanctions reaching the scale of several hundreds of million 
dollars and will announce the list. The targets of sanctions 
will not be confined to the field of telecommunications." There 
is a strong possibility that a wide variety of items will become 
targets, in addition to automobiles and auto parts. If a list 
of sanctions is actually announced, it is inevitable that the 
industries thus designated will scream. 
  The United States expects the displeasure of Japan's 
industrial community and the Japanese public to be vented on the 
bureaucrats of the Finance Ministry who formulated a 
comprehensive package of economic measures -- which was 
criticized sharply by Vice President Gore as "disappointing" -- 
and on the bureaucrats of the International Trade and Industry 
Ministry who "were prepared for a breakdown in the negotiations." 
  The Super 301 clause, which is soon to be reinstated by 
executive order, is "very effective" as a tool for shaking 
Japan. In principle, on the basis of reports which are compiled 
by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative at the end of 
March every year, countries and sectors engaging in unfair trade 
practices will be specified, and if negotiations break down, 
sanctions will be imposed. 
  Under Article 301 of the Trade Act, investigations can be 
initiated following a complaint of the business community, but 
under the Super 301 clause, the government can periodically 
investigate and expose unfair trade practices. Therefore, it is 
easy to make political use of Super 301. 
  First of all, the mere fact that Super 301 "has been 
revived" 
is a threat to Japan. In addition, by setting specific 
deadlines for trade partners or practices prior to the next 
Japan-U.S. summit in July, pressure can be brought to bear on 
new economic conferences. 
  Toward the end of March, the shares of foreign products in 
the Japanese market for 1993 will be determined on the basis of 
the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement. It is certain that the 
share for 1993 will drop below the 20 percent figure for 1992; 
this situation can also trigger sanctions according to the 
intention of the United States. 
<H5>  The Interest of the U.S. Public Is Not in the Trade Deficits </H5>
  Richard Gephardt, a Democratic floor leader in the House of 
Representatives who takes a hard-line attitude toward Japan, is 
exerting pressure by saying, "We are preparing a law affecting 
Japan, under which sanctions can be imposed on the basis of the 
market share of foreign products." A banking law, which is 
aimed at imposing sanctions against Japan, is expected to pass 
Congress soon. 
  However, Director Kurobushi [name as published] from the 
Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation looks at the 
situation in this way: "Such an upsurge is confined to part of 
the government and Congress and has rather lost the support of 
the whole." Because of an economic recovery, the interest of 
the U.S. public is not in the trade deficits. Compared to the 
times when radio-cassette recorders produced by Japanese 
companies were destroyed, "pressure on the government and 
Congress is almost nil." 
  The imposition of sanctions will inevitably affect related 
industries in the United States. It is necessary to show in 
detail at public hearings how to reach an estimate of damages 
due to unfair trade practices, or how to tell what effects the 
imposition of sanctions will have on domestic industries. 
  Further appreciation of the yen will dampen the Japanese 
economy. This appreciation is capable of thwarting the Clinton 
administration, which is attempting to increase employment and 
maintain economic growth through the promotion of exports. 
Furthermore, if Japan's current account surplus, which is a 
matter of great concern, increases due to a decrease in imports, 
which in turn is a result of recession, there will be more 
difficulties. 
  Threats are not effective unless they are seen as serious. 
Elaborately planted time bombs and a host of laws providing for 
sanctions will have no effect unless they are seen as serious.

  [Text] Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy minister of the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry [MITI], held a news 
conference at the Japan Press Club in Uchisaiwai-cho, Tokyo, on 
the afternoon of 28 February. Touching on the Japan-U.S. 
economic friction at the news conference, Mr. Okamatsu said: 
"For Japan, the biggest issue is to achieve the economic growth 
driven by domestic demand." He also indicated that Japan needs 
to adopt a new macro policy to cut its current account surplus 
in addition to the four-point measure including deregulation 
under consideration by the government to open the Japanese 
market. 
  Referring to the automobile and auto parts sector on which 
both Japan and the United States have negotiated under the 
Japan-U.S. framework talks, the MITI deputy minister said: "The 
time has come for Japanese enterprises to make their own 
judgment to address trade imbalance between Japan and the United 
States." In this way, he urged the Japanese enterprises to work 
on their own to boost imports.

  [Text] Both Japan and the United States have been 
discussing the resumption of vice ministerial negotiations on 
the automobile and auto parts sector to be held under the 
Japan-U.S. framework talks. A senior official in the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, however, made clear on 28 
February that it has become difficult to hold the vice 
ministerial negotiations. 
  Japan has asked the United States to hold the vice 
ministerial negotiations when U.S. Commerce Undersecretary 
Jeffrey Garten visits Japan on his tour of Asia, but it has 
replied to Japan that "he would have no time to hold the 
negotiations."

  [Text] Tokyo -- Ichiro Yoneyama, director general of the 
Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA], will visit the 
United States for 10 days from 26 February to discuss 
realignment and reduction of U.S. military bases on Okinawa with 
senior U.S. Government officials and top U.S. military leaders. 
  This is the first time that a DFAA director general visits 
the United States for the sole purpose of discussing the base 
issues in Okinawa. Yoneyama noted three particular pending 
issues -- the return of the Naha military seaport, the return of 
the Yomitan Auxiliary Air Base, and the stopping of 
live-ammunition firing artillery exercises over the Prefectural 
Highway 104 -- "are long- pending issues, which the prefectural 
residents strongly hope to be resolved, and the DFAA also wants 
to have settled." He thus indicated the solution of these three 
issues was one of the important purposes of the visit. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who had received a report 
on the purpose of Yoneyama's visit to the United States, on 17 
February sent through his secretary a message of encouragement 
saying, "I would like you to do everything to have some of the 
issues of the bases on Okinawa settled." He thus expressed hope 
that Yoneyama will press on the U.S. Government to resolve the 
Okinawa base issues which were also a subject he had intended to 
take up at the recent Japan-U.S. summit meeting. 
  Director General Yoneyama said at a news conference on 25 
February: "The purpose of the visit to the United States is to 
exchange views with the senior officials of the Defense 
Department and the State Department primarily on the reduction 
and realignment of U.S. military facilities and areas on 
Okinawa." He noted he was looking forward to the meeting with 
U.S. Government officials and military commanders concerned with 
the U.S. bases in Okinawa, adding, "I would like to follow up on 
what has been discussed between Japan and the United States on 
the reduction and realignment of the bases on Okinawa." He will 
have Kenichi Sakamoto, liaison officer in charge of the U.S. 
bases in Okinawa, on his entourage in order to be able to 
discuss and exchange views on details. 
  According to his schedule, Yoneyama will arrive in 
Washington 
on 27 February, and is due to meet with Assistant Secretary of 
State Winston Lord, Ambassador Thomas, and Assistant Secretary 
of Defense Freeman while in Washington. After touring U.S. 
military bases, he will head for Hawaii, and will meet with 
General Larson, commander- in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command 
in Hawaii on 3 March, and then with General Stackpole, commander 
of the Marine Corps forces in the Pacific, Admiral Fitzgerald, 
deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet, and General Rutherford, 
commander of the Pacific Air Force Command -- to exchange views 
on the realignment and reduction of the U.S. military bases on 
Okinawa. 
  In the past, there have been instances of DFAA directors 
general visiting the United States in company with Defense 
Agency chiefs, but (according to the DFAA) there has been "no 
precedence" of a DFAA director general visiting the United 
States on his own to negotiate on specific issues and exchange 
views with senior government officials and military leaders 
personally.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "High Hopes Pinned on Visit by Defense </F>
Facilities Administration Agency Director General To the United 
States"] 
  [Text] Ichiro Yoneyama, director general of the Defense 
Facilities Administration Agency, an official charged with 
handling problems involving U.S. military bases in Japan, left 
Japan on 26 February for the United States to discuss with 
American officials the issue of streamlining and scaling down 
U.S. military bases on Okinawa. Mr. Yoneyama is due to meet 
with high-ranking U.S. Government officials in charge of 
overseas American military bases and leaders of the U.S. 
military. So far, working-level officials have visited 
Washington to discuss the issue with their American 
counterparts, but this is the first time that a top Japanese 
Government official in charge of handling the issue of 
streamlining and scaling down the U.S. military bases on Okinawa 
visits the United States to discuss the issue with American 
officials. 
  Everyone acknowledges that the key stumbling block impeding 
Okinawa's development is the existence of huge U.S. military 
bases on the island. Nobody can argue against the 
acknowledgement. The Okinawan people have thus far persistently 
pleaded for the streamlining and scaling down of the huge U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa. In response to this plea, however, 
the Japanese Government has not tried to work aggressively to 
resolve the issue. Although 22 years have passed since 
Okinawa's reversion to the Japanese rule, the return of Naha 
military port, which has been agreed upon between Japan and the 
United States, has yet to be materialized and the huge U.S. 
military bases still remain as they have been on Okinawa. 
  Upon Leaving Japan for Washington, Director General Yoneyama 
indicated that three issues -- the return of Naha military port 
and Yomitan auxiliary airfield and a halt to live-firing 
exercise by U.S. forces across National Highway No. 14 -- will 
be important objectives of his visit to the United States. Now 
that the director general specifically mentioned his intention 
to discuss those issues with American officials, we believe that 
he left Japan for Washington with a firm resolve. We hope that 
the visit by Director General Yoneyama to Washington will make a 
major headway in resolving the issue of streamlining and scaling 
down the U.S. military bases on Okinawa. 
  On 25 February when Director General Yoneyama held a news 
conference prior to his visit to the Untied States, a "liaison 
meeting on various problems at the U.S. facilities and their 
areas on Okinawa" (the liaison meeting attended by officials 
from the Okinawa Development Agency, the Foreign Ministry, and 
the Defense Facilities Administration Agency) was held. 
  During the meeting, Okinawa Development Agency Director 
General Uehara strongly asked that the liaison meeting not only 
exchange views on the three issues -- the return of Naha 
military port and Yomitan auxiliary airfield and halt to the 
live-firing exercises by U.S. forces across National Highway No. 
14 -- but discuss specific ways to resolve them. 
  The discussion of working-level officials alone cannot 
fundamentally resolve the issue of U.S. military bases on 
Okinawa. If government officials say they will "study," this 
means that they will do nothing. The discussion of working-level 
officials cannot resolve the issue fundamentally, but "they can 
only discuss how to build soundproof walls." The discussion of 
working-level officials will leave the issue of U.S. military 
bases on Okinawa unresolved forever. 
  Now that 50 years have passed since the end of World War II, 
the Japanese Government has perhaps begun to think seriously of 
ways to resolve the issue. Some are asserting that Japan should 
make international contributions while others are saying it is 
an economic power. They, however, cannot say so in a situation 
where more than 1 million of their compatriots have been 
hindered by huge foreign military bases to develop their economy 
and society and have suffered great inconvenience in their daily 
lives. 
  Fifty years have passed since the end of World War II. The 
time has come to resolve fundamentally the issue of U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Go Back to the Essentials of International </F>
Coordination and Accelerate Efforts To Reduce the Surplus"] 
  [Text] In a sense, international coordination is a 
mechanism for mutual interference in internal affairs. The 
recent conference of G-7 finance ministers and central bank 
governors became an occasion to demand that Japan boost its 
domestic demand and reduce its surplus. It was a matter of 
course that the Western countries should make strong demands on 
Japan because Japan is still unable to extricate itself from the 
worst recession in the post-war period, and its current accounts 
surplus continues to grow. 
  The Hosokawa administration has no recourse but to go back 
to 
the essentials of international coordination, exert efforts to 
expand domestic demand and open up the market, and reduce the 
surplus. That should be Japan's option, and this will contribute 
to an expanded equilibrium in the world economy. 
  Although the main item on the agenda of this G-7 meeting was 
supposed to be aid to Russia, the Western nations' interests 
were focused rather on the expansion of domestic demand and 
surplus reduction in Japan. The G-7 made it clear that "this is 
not a problem only for Japan and the United States" (according 
to German Finance Minister Theo Waigel). 
  With regard to the focal issue of tax cuts, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said that these will not only be limited to one 
year, but Japan intends to continue with tax cuts even beyond 
1994. The recent Japan-U.S. summit broke down not just because 
of the contention on numerical targets. The United States had 
also perceived Japan's tax cuts to be limited to one year. 
Fujii's statement on continuing with the tax cuts was, of 
course, aimed at dispelling such a "misunderstanding." But the 
question of why this had not been declared at the Japan-U.S. 
summit remains. If Fujii's statement was a hasty deviation from 
the original plan in view of the Clinton administration's 
attitude toward Japan after the summit, then it was indeed a 
clumsy act. 
  Some people might think that it is impertinent for foreign 
countries to meddle even in tax cuts in Japan. However, time 
and again, Japan has asked the United States to reduce its 
financial deficits at past G-7 meetings. On the other hand, 
Germany has consistently been asked to ease its monetary policy. 
If policy coordination among the advanced countries is 
indispensable for the world economy's development, then it is 
important to listen to what foreign countries have to say. 
  However, the prerequisite for such coordination is to know 
each other's economic management well. The Hosokawa 
administration was incredibly inadequate in explaining Japan's 
economic stimulation measures, while the Clinton 
administration's lack of understanding was also appalling. 
  The attitude of the Clinton administration, which condemned 
Japan's pump-priming measures as being ineffective from the very 
beginning, was not any better, if not worse, than the Japanese 
bureaucrats, whom the United States calls stubborn. 
Unfortunately, the two countries cannot be said to have 
narrowed such a perception gap at the recent G-7 meeting. 
  The Japanese monetary authorities wanted to work for stable 
foreign exchange rates at the G-7, but it seems that the foreign 
exchange issue "was not a focus of the discussion" (according to 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen). Under the floating 
exchange rates system, monetary strategies do not work unless 
accompanied by financial policy coordination and large scale 
intervention [in the foreign exchange market]. The vague G-7 
declaration, and rhetorical intervention by the monetary 
authorities can only influence the information-oriented market 
temporarily. After all, the foreign exchange rate reflects 
economic fundamentals. 
  Looking at the fundamentals, for instance, the difference in 
the economic climate and the gap between interest rates in Japan 
and the United States, there will probably not be any rapid 
appreciation of the yen despite the tension in bilateral 
relations. Even the Clinton administration would like to avoid 
any excessive appreciation of the yen because this may lead to 
the depreciation of the dollar, and consequently, a rise in 
interest rates. 
  Stability of the exchange rate all depends on whether Japan 
will be able to correct the trade imbalance through the 
expansion of domestic demands and market liberalization.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Naoya Tsujiya] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt, 27 Feb -- The rest of the G-7 [Group of 
Seven] industrialized nations expressed strong discontent with 
Japan's management of its economy at the meeting of the G-7 
finance ministers and central bankers, leaving the impression 
that a siege has been laid to Japan. European nations, which 
have supported Japan's position of rejecting the U.S. demand of 
introducing objective criteria at the Japan-U.S. framework 
talks, did not conceal their irritation at Japan's unshrinking 
current account surplus at the meeting. Japan has to speedily 
work out a specific program to reform its economic structure to 
avoid being isolated by the rest of the G-7 industrialized 
nations and stand in step with the policy coordination of the 
G-7 industrialized nations. 
  A Finance Ministry official lamented at the meeting room, 
"We 
have come here with a package of stimulus measures totalling 
more than 15 trillion yen, but ...." He said tax cuts amounting 
to more than one percent of the gross national product, though 
they will last for only one year, can be expected to stimulate 
the Japanese economy. But requests from the rest of the G-7 
industrialized nations to Japan were difficult to address. 
  European nations have highly praised Japan for checking the 
United States from moving toward protectionism by rejecting the 
U.S. demand for introducing internationally criticized objective 
criteria at the Japan-U.S. framework talks. Their praise has 
led Japan to hope that it would be able to win support from 
European nations at the meeting, but Japan's hopes were found to 
be overly optimistic. 
  In a bid to reduce Japan's current account surplus, the 
United States has so far attempted to strengthen the yen against 
the dollar, but its efforts have left an impression of Japanese 
strength. The United States is about to take a new approach: 
that the Japanese market is different from those of the rest of 
the G-7 industrialized nations because Japan has not increased 
imports. 
  The Japanese Government plans to map out a package of 
measures during March to open the Japanese market. The package 
can be considered the first step in a specific program to reform 
Japan's economic structure. Japan will be asked to make efforts 
not only to open its market, but to revamp the conventional 
bureaucrat-led system of policy formulation. 
  At the latest Japan-U.S. framework talks, the United States 
expressed strong apprehension about the Finance Ministry's plan 
to cut income taxes for only one year. Prime Minister Hosokawa 
is said not to have mentioned a plan to cut taxes for many years 
at the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks. At the G-7 meeting, 
Finance Minister Fujii said that "Japan would continue to cut 
taxes in the future." Taking into account the contradictions in 
Japan's responses, other nations appear to have felt a sense of 
incongruity regarding Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership. 
  The meeting of G-7 finance ministers and central bankers 
failed to reach a clear agreement on exchange rate stability in 
the face of opposition from the United States. The U.S. 
Government had no choice but to oppose such an agreement, for 
which Japan has hoped to placate hard-line members of Congress 
who do not want the U.S. Government to make any concessions for 
Japan. Following the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework 
talks, the present situation in the United States is such that 
it is difficult for the U.S. Government to take any measures 
considered by Americans to be soft on Japan. 
  The U.S. Government is neither giving up on exchange rate 
stability nor trying to seek a strong yen. A steep rise in the 
value of the yen and a correspondingly sharp fall in the value 
of the U.S. dollar may lead to even higher interest rates on 
long-term loans. High interest rates on long-term loans are 
keeping stock prices low in the United States. Any fluctuation 
in the currency exchange rate may shake financial markets, and 
this would be a undesirable situation for the U.S. Government. 
  European nations, which have had bitter experiences 
regarding 
a currency crisis, have no reason not to hope for the stability 
of the exchange rate. The G-7 finance ministers and central 
bankers appear to have decided not to discuss the exchange rate 
issue at their meeting out of consideration for the U.S. 
domestic situation.

  [Text] At talks with the United States, North Korea agreed 
to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to 
inspect its nuclear facilities starting on 1 March. The 
government spoke highly of this decision and said: "The 
decision prevented the current situation from intensifying and 
no economic sanctions will be taken against North Korea," 
(according to a Foreign Ministry source). However, to earn time, 
North Korea has been taking various measures such as delaying 
the issuance of visas to IAEA investigators, even after the 15 
February agreement with the IAEA on accepting inspections. 
Because of this, the government intends to watch future 
developments on the nuclear issue carefully. 
  The focal points at issue will be the shift to high-level 
U.S.- DPRK talks and DPRK-ROK negotiations to be held in the 
future. However, at the Diet session Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa stressed: 1) Special inspections by the IAEA on the 
two facilities which were not included in the DPRK's list of 
nuclear facilities; and 2) implementation of a North-South joint 
declaration on denuclearization, are indispensable. Therefore, 
the government has not changed its stance, saying: "It is far 
from a complete settlement and Japan will keep watching the 
situation to ensure North Korea fulfills its responsibilities," 
(according to a government source). 
  Since there is no prospect of resuming Japan-DPRK 
negotiations on the normalization of diplomatic ties, which 
Japan has been calling for, the government may make efforts to 
solve the problem with "indirect support," and ask for China's 
cooperation while maintaining contact with both the United 
States and South Korea.

  [Text] Security dialogue between Japan and China, as well 
as Japan and Russia, will successively start among defense 
officials. Senior officials from the Defense Agency [DA] and the 
Chinese Ministry of National Defense [CMND] will hold talks in 
Beijing on 1 March. Officials of the Russian Ministry of 
Defense [MD] will visit Japan on 28 March for exchanges on 
defense studies with Japanese officials. Because Japan and 
China have not held regular security consultations before, they 
intend to take the opportunity to build a regular and continuous 
framework for exchange of views. 
  Among those who will attend the Japan-China security talks 
are: Ken Sato, DA's defense councilor; Toshimasa Fujiwara, chief 
of the fifth section of the DA Joint Staff Council; and senior 
CMND officials. They will exchange views on the whole situation 
in the Asia-Pacific region, including the DPRK's (North Korea's) 
suspected nuclear development. The prevailing view within the 
DA is that "China will become the largest unstable factor in the 
Asian region from a medium-to-long perspective," (as stated by a 
senior DA official). At the time of the upcoming talks, the DA 
intends to establish a stage for dialogue with Chinese military 
authorities to promote mutual understanding. 
  Defense study exchanges between Japan and Russia are hosted 
alternately by DA's National Institute for Defense Studies and 
the Military Strategic Center under the Russian General Staff 
Office. The upcoming exchanges will be the third case and will 
also be the first since February last year. Russian officials 
who will visit Japan include: Lukyanov, acting chief of the 
International Treaty Directorate of the General Staff Office, 
and Zolotorev, chief of MD's Information Analysis Center.

  [Text] The fourth meeting of the "Consultative Council on 
Political Reform," created to discuss details of joint 
amendments to the political reform laws based on an earlier 
agreement between the ruling coalition parties and the Liberal 
Democratic party [LDP], was held on and off at the Diet building 
on 22 February. The ruling parties basically agreed to accept 
the LDP's proposal that an upper limit for official subsides to 
political parties be included in the Law on Subsidies for 
Political Parties. However, the ruling parties opposed another 
LDP proposal that "corporate status be given to political 
parties" to clarify responsibilities of political parties which 
will receive subsidies. They failed to reach an agreement. They 
will discuss again this issue and also the issue on the upper 
limit of subsides on 24 February. 
  Regarding the issue of setting a limit on public funding for 
political parties, both sides basically agreed on the LDP's 
proposal that the amount of subsidies for political parties 
should be limited to less than two-thirds the amount of income 
in the previous year, excluding subsidies received. Concerning 
the issue of giving corporate status to political parties, they 
failed to reach an accord because a number of participants from 
the ruling parties said: "Giving corporate status to political 
parties would invite intervention by the administration and 
restrain their activities. There is a possibility that 'the 
freedom of association' will be violated by restricting 
political parties' activities. This issue should be discussed 
cautiously."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with former Japanese Prime Minister </F>
Yasuhiro Nakasone by correspondent Hiroyuki Miyano in London on 
24 February] 
  [Text] London, 24 Feb -- Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro 
Nakasone granted an interview to SANKEI SHIMBUN at a London 
hotel on the morning of 24 February. During the interview, he 
noted that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] should respond 
flexibly to the future political realignment while considering 
forming an alliance with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] so that 
the party will be able to open the way to recapturing power. 
  Concerning a possible alliance and cooperation between the 
LDP and Shinseito, Nakasone said: "When forming an alliance 
with other parties in the political realignment, the LDP should 
first take into account (the similarity of) basic policies. It 
should allow minor policy differences and join with forces based 
on a general similarity. It should be agreed between alliances 
that any possible obstacles to forging mutual agreements will be 
eliminated." In this way, he noted that the LDP should decide 
whether to form an alliance with Shinseito based on a similarity 
of policies and that the decision should not be affected by 
emotional discord. 
  He also said: "The LDP should deal with the Hosokawa 
government with the principle of being fair and just. It cannot 
take power unless it approaches the government as close as 
possible. Just like in sumo wrestling, the LDP will grab the 
government by the arm and push it out." 
  His remark indicates that at this stage, the LDP needs to 
consider not only forming an alliance with Shinseito but also 
maintaining a position equidistant between Shinseito and other 
forces, such as Sakigake [Harbinger], which have had 
confrontations with Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government 
Party]. By doing so, it will be able to form an LDP-led 
coalition government, Nakasone suggested. 
  Commenting on similar remarks made by former Foreign 
Minister 
Michio Watanabe on the alliance with Shinseito, Nakasone said, 
"Mr. Watanabe has acted based on the same idea as mine," thus 
giving support to Watanabe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi </F>
Takemura by unidentified reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Would you describe your opinion 
on prospects for a realignment of political parties? 
  [Takemura] Political circles are being urged to catch up 
with 
the new election system, and a realignment of political parties 
is becoming a realistic and vivid topic. In the next general 
election, we must not simply seek the majority power or 
quorum-oriented alliances. I think that in the next election we 
should take the first step based on our own judgment of Japan's 
future and the direction of its politics. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] In a recent speech, you noted that a 
regrouping of parties should be carried on in view of three 
factors: the perception of the times, political ideals, and 
political style. Could you explain these a little? 
  [Takemura] Each party must have a clear political ideal or 
basic policy. I think that an interparty alliance should be 
discussed according to how distant a party is from others in 
such official positions. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you mean exactly by the 
perception 
of the times? 
  [Takemura] Unlike the period of rightist-leftist antagonism 
under the cold war structure, we now can afford to choose 
political partners from a wide range, from the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] to the Social Democratic Party of Japan. 
This is the time in which we have to find appropriate partners 
to hammer out new goals. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Could you define the political ideal? 
  [Takemura] Basically, it is a party's stands toward the 
Constitution, the direction of the nation, and the 
implementation of democracy. Individual subjects include 
education, welfare, and the environment. Of course, security 
policy is also an important subject. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Then, what is your description of 
political style? 
  [Takemura] The public is strictly observing in what manner 
parties collect and spend money, and in what manner they manage 
their own personnel and organization. So, I think a policy is 
not enough for a party to win the public's confidence. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you say this to clarify a gap between 
your party and the Shinseito-Komeito [Japan Renewal Party-Clean 
Government Party] team? 
  [Takemura] I do not want to believe that the two parties 
have 
clear problems in their styles; however, some specific persons 
may have such problems. Probably, one of the most important 
points is (in what manner) the parties makes decisions (on their 
courses of action). 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your stand toward the "ordinary 
nation" proposal made by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa? 
  [Takemura] Mr. Ozawa described that idea in various ways, 
but, generally speaking, the proposal for being an ordinary 
nation is being discussed in connection with Japan's military 
role in the world. I guess that advanced Western nations look 
normal to him, and he wants to make Japan play a military role 
equal to that of their levels. But it is impossible for Japan 
to achieve that objective without a revision of the 
Constitution. I think that the public takes a negative stand 
toward such an idea because the Japanese people still continue 
their regret over their nation's behavior during the war. The 
most urgent question for the international community is how 
human beings can jointly solve contradictions in various 
nonmilitary fields. As a matter of fact, coping with regional 
conflicts is a very important subject, but global environmental 
problems are even more critical. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your comment on Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's proposal for a unification of the 
parliamentary groups of all the coalition parties? 
  [Takemura] It is hard for me to see whether this is needed 
for managing the current Diet session or for a party realignment 
in preparation for the next general election. I cannot go for a 
drastic idea like that. Because each coalition party has its 
unique standpoint, it is too reckless to merge all of them into 
one parliamentary group or party all at once. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the prime minister's 
proposal affects your plan for a merger of Sakigake [Harbinger] 
and the Japan New Party [JNP]? 
  [Takemura] I am seriously worried about that. We have been 
dealing with each other with much respect concerning an 
engagement to the JNP. I would like to have a serious talk with 
Mr. Hosokawa as soon as possible. This issue affects the very 
foundation of my party. I feel that the proposal ruins our 
steady steps up to now. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] There is an opinion that the next general 
election should be fought between the LDP and the anti-LDP 
group. What is your comment on that? 
  [Takemura] I am skeptical over an election under such an 
artificial bipolar framework. It is theoretically possible to 
form a new party only for one's survival in the next election, 
but we would lose the public's confidence if we dissolve the 
party immediately after the election. Two-party politics is not 
a necessary condition for a single-seat constituency system. In 
particular, Japanese politics is undergoing a transitional 
period. For the time being, sound development would be ensured 
under the multiparty system, rather than under the two-party 
system.

  [Text] With regard to the issue of a cabinet reshuffle--a 
focal point in current politics--a leader of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] said on 25 February: "I think 
a reshuffle has become difficult. Since Prime Minister Hosokawa 
has stated the issue has now been taken back to the drawing 
board, he will not take the trouble to start a new cabinet." 
The SDPJ leader thus stated that an early cabinet reshuffle 
prior to the Diet approving the fiscal 1994 national budget bill 
has become difficult." 
  Citing the reason, he said: "If the fiscal 1994 national 
budget bill is presented to the Diet on 4 March, policy speeches 
will be delivered on 7 March. It would be physically difficult 
to change cabinet members at that time. The cabinet reshuffle 
is a different argument." He added: "Representatives from 
three parties and one parliamentary group told the prime 
minister this was not the time to reshuffle the cabinet. It 
might be appropriate for a cabinet reshuffle to take place 
following passage of the budget bill or after the current 
ordinary Diet session closes." The SDPJ leader stressed that an 
agreement has not been reached among the ruling parties on the 
necessity of a cabinet reshuffle. 
  Chairmen of the SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party, as 
well as a representative of the Democratic Reform Party, met 
with Prime Minister Hosokawa on 24 February to ask him to 
cautiously deal with the issue of an early cabinet reshuffle. 
They expressed growing opposition to prime minister's idea of 
forming a large, unified parliamentary group as well as to a 
cabinet reshuffle. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
also attended the meeting. There is an intensifying 
confrontation among the ruling parties over the issue of a 
cabinet reshuffle. The SDPJ leader indicated it has become 
objectively difficult for the prime minister to carry out a 
cabinet reshuffle, probably because the leader judges the 
handling of the issue of ousting Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Takemura from the cabinet has now become more difficult under 
these circumstances.

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroshi Magami: "A Study of Morihiro Hosokawa: </F>
The `Alien' Prime Minister"] 
  [Text] Tadateru Konoe, vice president of the Japan Red 
Cross Society and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's younger 
brother, clearly remembers the occasion when he and Morihiro 
Hosokawa were invited to dinner by Ryoich Sasagawa. It was in 
1971, just after Hosokawa was elected a member of the House of 
Councillors. He ran for election for the national constituency 
against Shintaro Ishihara and could win by having some of the 
votes from Reiyukai [a religious group]--Ishihara's 
supporters--allocated to him. 
  After dinner Sasagawa reportedly made the following comment 
about Hosokawa: "He will never become a cabinet minister." 
  However, Morihiro Hosokawa, whom Roichi Sasagawa declared 
"unable to become a cabinet minister", has risen to the highest 
rank and become prime minister. 
  Konoe reflects that "Sasagawa, a politician who could become 
a cabinet minister, would have been capable of handling matters 
through haragei [implicit signaling], and would also have been 
capable of persuading people by intimidation." For example, 
Kakuei Tanaka might have been an ideal politician for Sasagawa. 
However, Kakuei Tanaka no longer exists, and the current age 
seems to refuse such politicians. 
  On the afternoon of 21 January 1994, Sakigake's [Harbinger] 
Shusei Tanaka, special assistant to the prime minister and a 
close associate of the prime minister, was summoned by Prime 
Minister Hosokawa. Though the prime minister wanted to see him 
at 1300, Tanaka happened to be out, and it was almost 1400 
before he returned to the official residence and reported to the 
prime minister's office. Reportedly, the prime minister 
received Tanaka standing in front of his office desk. 
  On this day, the political reform bills which would 
determine 
the fate of the cabinet were scheduled to be put to a vote at 
the House of Councillors's plenary session to be held at 1500. 
  According to Tanaka, the prime minister asked in a quiet 
manner: "When will be the proper time for, and what will be the 
proper contents of, our news conference?" 
  The prime minister's intention was to express his 
determination that "this is a very regrettable result 
considering the encouragement toward political reform grows 
stronger day after day. Under this situation, I would like to 
exert myself toward achieving political reform by employing 
every possible measure allowed under the Constitution." The 
prime minister conveyed his intention to Tanaka, asking for 
Tanaka's consent. 
  Later, it turned out Prime Minister Hosokawa actually made 
the same statement at the news conference. 
  Though the prime minister himself tried to persuade 
opposition Diet members over the telephone until late in the 
previous evening, by this time he had already foreseen the 
result of the vote at the House of Councillors plenary session. 
  As far as we know from close associates, the prime minister 
always deals with these situations in a quiet manner, with very 
few fluctuations in his attitude. We have never heard of him 
shouting with excitement, grieving, or being upset. 
  Even during the final phase of the situation where his own 
political life was at stake depending on the fate of the 
political reform bills, he quietly consulted with his assistant 
on how to proceed with the news conference in which he admits 
defeat. His attitude makes us feel he might be a monstrous 
fellow who is superior to the broad-minded politicians 
symbolized by Kakuei Tanaka. 
  According to a public opinion survey conducted by a 
commercial broadcasting station just after the political reform 
bills were disapproved by the House of Councillors, the opinion 
that the forcible attitude of the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP], the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] were to blame accounted for as 
much as 30 percent respectively, whereas the opinion that the 
cabinet should be held responsible was less than 10 percent. It 
has become a pattern that, should an important bill be 
disapproved, the government which proposed the 
bill--particularly the prime minister--was supposed to be held 
responsible. However, as regards the recent case, there was no 
opinion at all that the cabinet should take responsibility and 
resign as a body. 
  Hosokawa's popularity has not declined at all. 
  He is a man of good breeding, being the 18th master in 
descent of a former princely family. He is a modern young noble 
and is not inferior to the President of the United States when 
it comes to being a good dresser. He offers a "clean" image, 
which appears totally different from that of ex-Prime Ministers 
Kakuei Tanake and Noboru Takeshita, ex-LDP Vice President 
Kanemaru, and others. 
  However, do such television images conveyed to the people 
reflect the real image of our prime minister? 
  People are gradually beginning to doubt him because of his 
willfulness to change the interior design of the prime 
minister's official residence, spending over 10 million yen; the 
internal troubles revealed by the fact that his comrades who had 
been with him since the formation of the Japan New Party [JNP] 
are leaving him one after another; and his association with 
Sagawa involving the political funds scandal. However, there 
have only been imaginary stories and rumors about him, and no 
positive study has been made so far. That is the reason I felt 
it necessary to study in detail the real image of Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
<H5>  Relations With Kiyoshi Sagawa </H5>
  Since last year, Hosokawa has been severely accused by the 
Diet of borrowing 100 million yen from Sagawa Kyubin. To be 
related to Kiyoshi Sagawa does not fit the image of a Hosakawa 
who claims: "I am going to conduct clean and clear politics" 
("Reform With Responsibility - JNP"). What is the truth? 
  To tell the conclusion first, the relationship between 
Kiyoshi Sagawa and Hosokawa seems to be particularly close when 
compared to Kiyoshi Sagawa's relationships with other 
politicians around him. 
  For instance, we can see an exceptionally close relation 
between them just by visiting the Hosokawa home built on a vast 
site of 1400 tsubo [4600 square meters] near Nanzenji Temple in 
Kyoto. This home has become popular because Hosokawa is charged 
with accepting a 100-million-yen loan from Sagawa. 
  On the front gate, with thick board fences on both sides, a 
name plate has been put up which reads: Hikaru Sagawa. 
  Hikaru Sagawa is the second son of Kiyoshi Sagawa as well as 
representative director and vice president of Sagawa Kyubin. 
Hikaru Sagawa lives in this Kyoto house owned by Morisada 
Hosokawa, father of Morihiro Hosokawa. Before Hikaru Sagawa 
came to this house, Masaaki Sagawa, the first son, lived in 
Hosokawa's Kyoto house. 
  According to the contract, the Kyoto house is being rented 
by 
Morisada Hosokawa to the former Seiwa Shoji (with Kiyoshi Sagawa 
as chairman), a control company of the Sagawa Kyubin group. 
However, originally it was Morihiro Hosokawa--who was in his 
second term as a memeber of the House of Councillors--who 
proposed renting the Hosokawa house to Sagawa. 
  His younger brother Konoe testifies: "We have had trouble in 
maintaining the Kyoto house following the war. We could barely 
pay the real estate tax through the monthly income earned by 
renting the house to the prefectural people's association and 
others. Then we rented to a tenant connected with gangsters, 
and were not allowed access to the house. It took us 10-odd 
years of lawsuits to take back the house. However, the house had 
been terribly ruined while bieng occupied by the tenant. Being 
financially weak, we were unable to repair it. It was while 
suffering such a situation that Sagawa proposed to us, through 
Morihiro, to rent the house. Sagawa said: `We will repair the 
house and pay for it'." 
<H5>  Providing 1 Billion Yen </H5>
  In 1979 Kikuzo Komoto, a member of the House of Councillors, 
was living next door to Kiyoshi Sagawa's house. Komoto was a 
Diet member from Shiga Prefecture who belonged to the Tanaka 
faction. Kiyoshi Sagawa, who wanted to rent the Hosokawa house, 
asked Komoto to recommend him to Morihiro Hosokawa. JNP Bureau 
Director Ryozo Nagata states: "Komoto asked, `Mr. Hosokawa, 
please rent your father's house,' to which Hosokawa answered, 
`Alright, let me talk to my father.' At that time, both 
Hosokawa and Komoto belonged to the Tanaka faction." 
  Concerning the problem of "Sagawa's paying the expenses to 
repair the Hosokawa house" as revealed by Konoe, we questioned 
Sagawa's close associate. It is clear that as far as he has 
confirmed, it cost one billion yen to repair and remodel the 
interior of the house. This person is a Sagawa Kyubin former 
executive officer who at the time controlled the accounting 
related to the lease of the Hosokawa house; he affirms the 
figure was definitely one billion yen. 
  JNP Bureau Director Ryozo Nagata also admitted that the 
repair expenses were paid by Sagawa, though he did not confirm 
the amount. 
  It is exceptional that a tenant should repair the building. 
Although presently the lease with Sagawa is renewed every two 
years (at a rent of 1.8 million yen), the house is to be 
returned to Hosokawa sooner or later. Actually, in January 1993 
a request for termination of the lease was submitted to Sagawa 
by Hosokawa through an attorney. 
  It means Hosokawa had his residence repaired by the one 
billion yen donated by Kiyoshi Sagawa. 
  Since around 1980, when the lease for the Kyoto house was 
concluded with Sagawa, Morihiro Hosokawa was seen from time to 
time in the company of Kiyoshi Sagawa. No. 105 [September 1980 
issue] of the Sagawa Kyubin group's in-house organ "Fureai" 
reports Hosokawa was the only Diet member invited to the opening 
ceremony of the high-class resort "Hawaii Ezansu" [as published] 
which Sagawa Kyubin opened in Hawaii in September of the same 
year, and that Hosokawa celebrated the opening of the golf 
course with Mr. and Mrs. Sagawa. 
  Then Morihiro Hosokawa was frequently seen visiting Kiyoshi 
Sagawa at the completely repaired Kyoto house. 
  A former executive officer of Sagawa Kyubin testifies: 
"Since the Kyoto house was rented, Hosokawa visited Chairman 
Sagawa four times every year. On New Year's Day in particular, 
he seldom failed to visit Sagawa. After he became governor he 
visited Kyoto alone, not taking his secretary with him, when he 
visited Osaka on official duties. The chairman hated to wear a 
tie (it is customary to wear a tie when people meet 
politicians), and though he may meet a politician once, in many 
cases he let others take care of his guests. It is considered 
an exceptional case if the chairman personally meets a 
politician more than twice. Although it might have been partly 
because Hosokawa owned the rental house, the chairman viewed 
Hosokawa as a politician whom he met more often than usual. It 
was not that the chairman invited Hosokawa to Kyoto. Their way 
of meeting was Hosokawa first notified the chairman of his 
visit, and then the chairman invited Hosokawa to the Kyoto 
house." 
  The two men dined together at the Kyoto house, with Sagawa 
Kyubin's executive officers often joining in, and sometimes 
hired "maiko" [dancing girls] from Miyagawa-cho (Gion). Then it 
was customary for them to go together to club "Ezansu" in Gion, 
which Sagawa owned. 
  Around this time the Sagawa group began to make political 
contributions to Hosokawa. According to Hosokawa's comment, 
contributions by the Sagawa group began around 1982 and 
continued until 1992. Reportedly, the amount of contributions 
totaled approximately 25 million yen. It has been confirmed 
that in 1992 a donation of 1.3 million yen was made by Tokyo 
Sagawa to the Hosokawa political group Shin-Showa Kenkyukai 
(with Masatoshi Miyama in charge of accounting). 
  For Hosokawa, 1982 was a turning point. After serving as a 
member of the House of Councillors for two terms, he was 
determined to run for the governorship of Kumamoto Prefecture, 
the land of his ancestors. At about that time, Hosokawa 
proposed a 100-million-yen loan to Kiyoshi Sagawa. The Diet 
members of the nongovernment parties are focusing their charge 
against Hosokawa, saying this 100 million yen might have been 
used as a maneuvering fund to win nomination for the Kumamoto 
governorship race. 
  At that time, the LDP's Issei Sawada (presently a member of 
the House of Councillors) had been scheduled to run for the 
governorship for his fourth term. There was an extremely keen 
competition to win the nomination, with Hosokawa entering the 
race. Hosokawa is being accused of using the 100 million yen as 
a campaign fund to win nomination--that is, as a maneuvering 
fund to bring the prefectural assembly members into his camp. 
  A former executive staff member of Sagawa Kyubin, who is 
very 
familiar with the situation involving the election, testified: 
"What I can say for sure is that, concerning Hosokawa's election 
for the governorship, Sagawa offered full support both 
physically and spiritually." 
  Yet it is not possible to fight the election for 
governorship 
with 100 million yen. Sagawa Kyubin owns over 300 operation 
offices throughout the country. If the company collects one 
million yen per office, it could easily collect an illegal fund 
of 300 million yen. Such an amount is not big money for Sagawa. 
  Hosokawa claims that "by all means, the 100 million yen was 
not a contribution but a loan which I have already repaid." 
Submitted as evidence to the Committee on the Budget of the 
House of Representatives was a receipt for 10 million yen from 
Sagawa. However, this receipt is a cheap one, such as you can 
buy at a stationery shop, with a revenue stamp missing. It 
raised a laugh among the Diet members of the opposition parties. 
  A former Sagawa executive staff member guessed the 
riddle: "Though it may take the form of a loan, the chairman 
never thinks the money will be repaid. It is true that at first 
politicians come to him saying, `Please lend me money.' 
However, they have no intention of repaying it, and the 
chairman himself does not expect the money to be repaid. We do 
not require receipts for money delivered to politicians, and it 
is impossible for Sagawa to issue receipts even if the money is 
repaid." 
  At any rate, following a keen competition with former 
Governor Issei Sawada to win the nomination, Hosokawa won the 
LDP's nomination and was elected governor of Kumamoto Prefecture 
in February 1983. 
  After that, Sagawa Kyubin began to rapidly expand its 
business in Kumamoto. In 1985 alone, the company opened 
operation offices one after another--the Kita-Kumamoto office in 
March, the Yatsushiro office in April, and the Hondo office in 
October, as well as a plan to build a truck terminal. 
  In 1987 when Hosokawa entered his second term, the Sagawa 
Advanced Science and Technology Foundation was established in 
Kumamoto. Though this foundation was reportedly established for 
the purpose of providing assistance to the study of the 
"Technopolis Plan" which Hosokawa had been promoting as a key 
project of his policy, the full amount of its capital--310 
million yen--was borne by the Sagawa group. With Kiyoshi Sagawa 
as chairman, prefectural personnel at the director level 
together with persons related to Sagawa Kyubin--such as Masaaki 
Sagawa, Hikaru Sagawa and others--have been appointed directors; 
Nobuhiko Sekigami, who was Hosokawa's private secretary, and 
Hiroshi Ando, one of Hosokawa's advisers (an ex-reporter for the 
ASAHI SHIMBUN) assumed the posts of chief secretaries. 
  The foundation is supposed to tenant a building owned by 
Diaauto Co., Ltd. [as published] in which Namio Yatsuka, 
Hosokawa's secretary, and his clan work as directors. In other 
words, the rent paid by the foundation flows back to the company 
owned by Hosokawa's secretary and his family. 
  We understand Hosokawa is a most beloved politician for 
Sagawa as evidenced by the payment of the repair costs in the 
amount of one billion yen; the 100 million yen loan; the 
material and moral support at the time of his election for 
governorship; and the establishment of the Sagawa Advanced 
Science and Technology Foundation. Why then did Kiyoshi Sagawa 
lavish such a large amount of money on Hosokawa who was merely a 
young member of the House of Councillors? What compensation did 
Sagawa expect by making such a large offer? 
  At the national Diet held at the beginning of last year in 
which the Sagawa scandal was charged, the JNP also got into the 
act by requesting witnesses be summoned. However, the witnesses 
the JNP requested to be summoned were Shin Kanemaru, Kanemaru's 
secretary Masahisa Ikuhara, Fukushima Kotsu Company's Chairman 
Rekiji Kobari, and others. Kiyoshi Sagawa, a key person, was 
not included. However, it was not a benefit Sagawa expected. 
  Kiyoshi Sagawa's motive to approach Hosokawa seems to be 
closely related to Hosokawa's personal image. I will hereafter 
explain Hosokawa's profile in detail. 
<H5>  Hosokawa's Financial Manager </H5>
  At the close of my story involving the Sagawa money, let me 
relate the story of Hosokawa's ex-secretary Masatoshi Miyama, 
who is now Hosokawa's financial manager. 
  At the House of Councillors' Committee on the Budget held on 
15 December of last year, the LDP's Minao Hattori asked the 
prime minister: "In 1982, did you put all of your private 
properties-- stocks, savings deposits, time deposits, and 
others, including your registered seal--under the care of 
Secretary Miyama?" 
  Hosokawa replied: "I kept the registered seal myself. 
However, Secretary Miyama took care of all other clerical work." 
  The Japan Communist Party [JCP] is requesting Masatoshi 
Miyama, a close attendant to Hosokawa who controlled the flow of 
money, be summoned to the Diet as a witness. 
  According to an explanation made by Hosokawa himself at the 
Diet, Masatoshi Miyama is supposed to have resigned as secretary 
in March 1991 when Hosokawa started his under-the-surface 
activities to form a new party. 
  However, it has been revealed through recent research that 
Masatoshi Miyama had been scheduled to resume his office from 1 
January this year to take charge of the accounting of Hosokawa's 
political group. This has also been confirmed by JNP Bureau 
Director Nagata. A friend of Miyama explains: 
  "With the JNP rapidly becoming a major household, it is 
difficult to operate the party relying solely on contributions 
from portions of the Diet members' annual allowances. From 
around the end of last year, when people were beginning to feel 
the Diet might be dissolved, it became difficult for the party 
to get along unless helped by Miyama, who was well-known as a 
capable financial manager. That was the reason Miyama resumed 
his office as explained by Miyama himself. He resigned from a 
company where he had been working and was ready to return to his 
former job. However, in the meantime the problem of borrowing 
the Sagawa money surfaced in the Diet, and Hosokawa ordered that 
`you do not have to come to the office'." 
  To my question to Nagata about what became of his salary, 
Nagata answered ambiguously: "It has not been paid yet." 
  Hosokawa may have thought he had better keep this financial 
manager within his control for if left free he might disclose 
undesirable facts. 
  According to Miyama's friend I referred to previously, after 
reading the "Declaration of the Founding of the `Liberal Social 
Alliance'"--which appeared in the June 1992 issue of "BUNGEI 
SHUNJU"--Miyama said: "What is being described here is totally 
different from what I have been doing. Hosokawa might be 
involved in trouble if I stay with him." He resigned from his 
post. It is an ironical incident. 
  Miyama worked for a long time as director of Hosokawa's 
Tokyo 
Office, taking charge of the financial management. When 
Kesatoshi Tsuru (an ex-assembly member from Takamori) visited 
the office in Tokyo, he noticed on the front wall a sun flag of 
a mosaic design in a gorgeous golden frame. 
  "To the question `You have a gorgeous item. Whose present is 
this?' Miyama answered, `Ah! It is from Sagawa.' When I said 
"Sagawa is a great man," Miyama replied, "The amount of Sagawa's 
contribution is enormous. Tsuru-chan [an intimate expression to 
call one's friend], it is money. Money. Money is everything in 
the world of politics." At least according to Kesatoshi Tsuru. 
  Incidentally, in the declaration of formation of a new 
party, 
Hosokawa wrote: "Contributions by enterprises shall be 
abolished, with contributions to be made by individuals. The 
duty to report both income and expenditures shall be 
strengthened to increase transparency." 
<H5>  Relation With Yoshiaki Tsutsumi </H5>
  Graduating from Sophia University in 1963, Morihito Hosokawa 
entered ASAHI SHIMBUN and was assigned to the Kagoshima Branch 
Office. In the branch office were Masataka Ito, who later 
became the chief editor of ASAHI (presently an editorial 
committee member of ASAHI SHIMBUN), and Hiroshi Ando, who later 
displayed his extraordinary shrewdness as a financial editor. 
While these ASAHI connections formed a strong brain support 
during the time Hosokawa founded the new party, Masataka Ito 
contributed an essay entitled "`The 30 Years of Hosokawa' That 
Only I Know" to the magazine "PRESIDENT" (May 1993 issue). 
  "Hosokawa disclosed his intention. `I want to form a new 
political party.' When asked if he had comrades, he gave the 
names of several LDP politicians. He also gave the names of 
several people from business circles who were ready to help him. 
One of them was Yoshiaki Tsutsumi of the Seibu Group. 
  As is made clear by Ito, who has been Hosokawa's friend 
these 
30 years, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi constitutes another pillar of 
Hosokawa's line of connection comparable with Kiyoshi Sagawa. 
  It will be easier to understand his relation with Yoshiaki 
Tsutsumi if we view it on the merits and demerits to the 
Kumamoto Prefecture administration as carried out by Morihiro 
Hosokawa after winning the governor's seat with Sagawa's 
assistance. 
  During his two-term eight-year tenure as governor, Hosokawa 
approved two Seibu resort plans. One is "Aso Kogen Resort" 
consisting of a hotel, a golf course, and a ranch for tourists, 
to be constructed at the foot of Mt. Aso. The other is "Amakusa 
Kaiyo Resort" consisting of a golf course, a hotel, and a marina 
to be constructed on the coastal area extending over Itsuwa and 
Hondo. 
  At that time, Governor Hiramatsu of Oita was being widely 
spotlighted for successfully introducing high-tech enterprises 
and manufacturing industries one after another. The dream-like 
resort plans framed by the "Great Seibu" introduced via 
connections with Governor Hosokawa, who replaced Governor Issei 
Sawada, made the people of Kumamoto feel as if they were 
dreaming. 
  Such exalted feelings are vividly conveyed to us if we read 
several editions of KUMAMOTO NICHI SHIMBUN issued in those days: 
  "The Seibu Railway is to create a large recreation center in 
Aso; a tennis court and a ranch for tourists will be 
constructed...; 20 billion yen will be invested; we aim to be a 
Karuizawa in Kyushu; an agreement to promote the project will be 
signed tomorrow." (21 June 1984) 
  "Seibu comes; the project will prime Aso tourism; the 
project 
appears promising to the local people." (22 June 1984) 
  "Construction begins; the Aso Recreation Resort--a hotel and 
a golf course--are to be constructed." (1 December 1987) 
  "President Tsutsumi visited Kumamoto in June last year. 
After inspecting the spot with Governor Hosokawa aboard a 
helicopter, he was determined to construct a comprehensive 
resort." (21 June 1984) 
  However, few people knew at the time that behind these showy 
performances, Hosokawa was taking special administrative 
measures for Seibu. 
<H5>  Addition of the "Resort Clause" </H5>
  Under his authority as governor, in April 1986 Hosokawa 
established the "Corporate Subsidy Code." Originally the code 
was established for promoting the introduction of 
enterprises--such as the manufacturing industries, software 
industries, and related research facilities--by granting 
prefectural subsidy. 
  Construction of the Aso Kogen Resort was begun in December 
1987, and four months later the clause "a resort which makes 
large investments" was abruptly added to Article I of the "code" 
which provides for a qualification of the enterprises to be 
subsidized. Further, as a qualification for "a resort which 
makes large investments," a clause was added to Article II 
reading "a resort located outside of this prefecture which plans 
to locate its new business office within this prefecture, and 
which makes investments for its facilities, etcetera, for over 
10 billion yen." 
  In short, these requirements were meant for Seibu. 
  In accordance with this resort clause, Seibu applied to the 
prefecture for a subsidy. A subsidy for the maximum amount of 
100 million yen was approved, and in March 1991 the 100 million 
yen was paid out of the tax of the prefectural people. 
  When Governor Joji Fukushima took over the prefectural 
government, this newly added "resort clause" was promptly 
terminated "according to Governor Fukushima's intention" 
(Corporate Location Section, Kumamoto Prefecture). The reason 
for the termination as announced by the prefecture was that "no 
prefecture in Japan grants a subsidy for resorts." Seibu 
happens to be the first and last corporation which received the 
subsidy by virtue of this "resort clause." 
  In the case of the Aso Kogen Resort, the project was not a 
total failure as it managed to begin operations in August 1990, 
and promoted employment in the region. "The Amakusa Kaiyo 
Resort" was deadlocked without any prospects of purchasing land. 
Because of the "unequal" agreement concluded between the 
prefecture and Seibu when Hosokawa was governor, the 
self-governing body is on the verge of going bankrupt. 
  Based on the relation between Hosokawa and Tsutsumi, an 
agreement was concluded in 1987 among the four parties--Kumamoto 
Prefecture, the city of Hondo, the town of Itsuwa, and 
Seibu--and "The Amakusa Kaiyo Resort Plan" was begun. 
  According to the agreement, it was agreed that necessary 
land 
was to be purchased by the city and town, not by Seibu; it was 
also stipulated that Seibu would purchase the land and begin 
construction of the resort when it is confirmed "there is no 
obstacle in applying for approval of the development project" 
and that "necessary lands are being secured." 
  Staff members from the city and the town were sent on loan 
to 
the development corporation; they exerted themselves in 
persuading the landowners. In the case of Itsuwa, even the 
staff members of the town office having no relation with the 
project were mobilized to persuade the landowners. 
  However, in December 1990, when about 80 percent of the 
land was finally secured, the agreement was abruptly modified. 
Article 15 of the modified agreement signed by Governor Morihiro 
Hosokawa, the president of the Seibu Railway, and Hondo's Mayor 
Yoshito Kuguyama stipulated: 
  "I. Party C (Seibu) may suspend this project in the event 
that it becomes clear that Party A (the city of Hondo and the 
town of Itsuwa) is unable to complete the purchase of land 
within the prescribed period; in the event there is a 
considerable change in the circumstances involving the 
development project; and in the event it is considered difficult 
to carry out the project due to a considerable change in social 
conditions. 
  "II. Suspension of this project shall not create any claim 
among Seibu, the prefecture, and the city of Hondo and the town 
of Itsuwa." 
  The intention of the modification becomes apparent if we 
compare the modified article to the same article before 
modification. 
  "Seibu, the prefecture, and the city of Hondo and the town 
of 
Itsuwa shall, upon consultation, review the project with regard 
to the disposal of the lands and the framing of the plan, 
etcetera, in case it is considered impossible to carry out the 
project due to the delay of the purchase of land and a 
considerable change in social conditions." 
  In short, according to the former agreement, Seibu was 
required to start the project by "reviewing the project plan" 
even if the necessary land was not secured. However, under the 
modified agreement Seibu can suspend the project entirely if the 
land is not secured. Even if land is secured, Seibu can suspend 
the project "in the event there is a considerable change in the 
circumstances involving the development project or in social 
conditions." It means a modification of the agreement--worse 
than the unequal treaty which existed in the last days of the 
Tokugawa Shogunate--was made with Hosokawa as witness. 
  The purchase of land was making little progress, being 
severely resisted by the landowners. In addition, "a 
considerable change in the social conditions" was created one 
month after the modification of the agreement, with the Japanese 
economy entering into a long-lasting depression as the price of 
stocks declined heavily and the price of land began to decline. 
For Seibu, there was now no reason at all to stick with Amakusa. 
  So far, Hondo and Itsuwa have borrowed 457 million yen and 
978 million yen respectively to purchase land. In addition, 
they have invested 30 million yen each in the Development 
Corporation. Personnel expenses for the staff members mobilized 
to purchase land totaled 100-odd million yen in the case of 
Mitsuwa, and approximately 50 million yen in the case of Hondo. 
  In the event the land for golf courses cannot be purchased 
within the prescribed period, the self-governing bodies will be 
brought to a deadlock, shouldering the loan of as much as 1.435 
billion yen in total and holding the mushikui land [description 
of a land with owners other than the self-governing bodies 
scattered here and there]. Particularly in the case of Itsuwa, 
the amount of the borrowing accounts for 20 percent of its 
annual budget, which is a little over 5.4 billion yen. When I 
talked to Itsuwa's Mayor Masato Nakamura, he was exhausted from 
successive negotiations and anxiety as the time of the payment 
drew near. 
  JPN Bureau Director Ryozo Nagata insisted they have not 
received any political contributions from Seibu. 
  But one week after 1 April 1988, when the "resort clause" 
was 
added to the "corporate subsidy rules," Hosokawa's family 
enterprise bought a resort house from Seibu in Karuizawa at a 
bargain price. 
  In April 1988, Kiko Enterprise [as published] (presently 
named Hosokawa and Associates), which is represented by 
Hosokawa's wife Kayoko, bought a summer resort of about 600 
tsubo [1,983 square meters] from Seibu Real Estate in 
Chigatake-Nishiku [as published] at the food of Mt. Asama. 
  Hosokawa bought the lot for 90 thousand yen per tsubo. 
However, a local real estate expert says: "At that time, the 
price of land around the area was about 200 thousand yen per 
tsubo. At minimum, the price cannot be below 140 thousand yen 
per tsubo". 
  It means Hosokawa gained about 30 million yen at least, even 
if the unit price per tsubo would have been 140 thousand yen. 
  Besides, the resort assigned to Hosakawa was a special 
division which was not open to the general public. Hiroshi 
Kumagai, minister of International Trade and Industry, and 
others besides Hosokawa have also bought lots within this 
special division at bargain prices. 
  This resort lot was not accounted for when the assets of the 
cabinet ministers were disclosed in September last year. It is 
unnatural that this resort lot, which Hosokawa himself was 
using, was not included in the list of disclosed assets, while 
other assets in the name of his family were disclosed. 
<H5>  Public Relations Expenses Were Doubled </H5>
  Hosokawa's predecessor--Governor Issei Sawada--exerted 
himself to improve the financial conditions of Kumamoto, which 
was in need of financial reconstruction. In order to emerge 
from financial difficulties, he drew up a reduced budget and 
reserved the end-of-year surplus as a financial adjustment fund. 
By the time of Sawada's retirement, the amount of the fund 
totaled over 48 billion yen. 
  However, by the end of 1989 when Governor Hosokawa retired, 
the reserve had been reduced by about 10 billion yen, making the 
balance 38 billion yen. In short, it means there was an 
excessive annual expenditure when Hosokawa was governor, making 
it necessary to make frequent withdrawals from the fund to 
adjust the year-end budget. 
  Ex-Governor Sawada points out: "Though it is all right that 
the financial adjustment fund has been reduced, the question 
will be asked `What is being left behind for the prefectural 
people to justify the reduced fund?'" During the Hosokawa 
administration, it was public relations expenses which showed an 
excessive increase. 
  Let us take a look at the trend of Kumamoto Prefecture's 
annual spending on public relations. 
  When Sawada was governor, Kumamoto Prefecture's annual 
spending on public relations was approximately 160 million yen: 
157 million yen in 1980, 165 million yen in 1981, and 170 
million yen in 1982. However, when Hosokawa assumed the post of 
governor, expenses suddenly rose by 60 percent, totaling 266 
million yen. Thereafter, during the period 1984 to 1990--the 
year of his resignation-- Hosokawa spent about 300 million yen 
on public relations, about twice as much spent when Sawada was 
governor. Kumamoto Prefecture's budget for public relations 
suddenly rose to rank first in Kyushu and 11th in the country. 
  Tetsushi Sakamoto (presently Kumamoto prefectural assembly 
member), who was a correspondent for KUMAMOTO NICHI SHIMBUN, 
describes the situation as follows: "Mass media came to 
Kumamoto from all over the country. 
  Correspondents from weekly and monthly magazines whom we 
never met before began to visit the Public Relations Division. 
Governor Hosokawa began to appear on the photogravures of 
weekly magazines playing motorcross and tennis, or at times 
stuffing his mouth with a rice ball. In the pictures he 
appeared as if he were a singer or actor. The basic idea of his 
performance was "to advertise Hosokawa and simultaneously 
advertise Kumamoto." 
  The Planning Section, which prepares data about Kumamoto to 
be offered to the mass media, also became quite active. While 
past data was prepared mostly in figures, they were now to be 
prepared using cartoons, illustrations, and photographs. Also, 
the traditional administrative methods were avoided in using 
figures, and the way of taking statistics was changed so as to 
be welcome to the mass media. 
  Dentsu Inc. was the organization which monopolized public 
relations for the prefecture. Through his association with 
Dentsu, Morihiro Hosokawa had gradually mastered the art of 
public relations as to how to make himself appear attractive. 
  When asked about Hosokawa's impression during his two-term 
eight-year tenure as governor of Kumamoto, the prefectural 
people said: "He was flowery, and seemed as if he displayed 
fireworks." He brought with him from Tokyo the Seibu's 
distribution and railway groups. He organized "Kumamoto's 21st 
Century Round-Table Conference" as the governor's private 
consultative organ, and had a fine array of celebrities such as 
Kisho Kurokawa (architect), Keizo Saji (then president of 
Suntory Ltd.), Seiji Tsutsumi (then chairman of The Seibu 
Department Stores Ltd.) Kenzo Uchida (then professor of Hosei 
University), and others join the conference. He proposed the 
"Technopolis Plan" and the "Campaign to Make Japan No. 1." The 
interest of the central mass media was focused on Kumamoto 
Prefecture, making the prefectural people feel as if they were 
on Main Street. 
  According to Tetsushi Sakamoto: "When he goes to Tokyo, the 
governor meets celebrities. The news is conveyed to the local 
people. Then the celebrities come to see the governor. There 
came Shigeo Nagashima and Ikuma Dan. Chieko Akiyama talks to 
personnel of the prefectural office during lunch breaks. To see 
such people visit the prefectural office one after another makes 
the people feel that the governor's connections are splendid." 
  Hosokawa left the governor's seat behaving nicely until the 
last moment, saying "one should not stay in power more than 10 
years." He challenged the central political world by founding a 
new political party. However, when the fireworks were over and 
the prefectural people awakened from the dream, the scene before 
them was really bleak, as was symbolized by the miserable 
failure of the "Amakusa Kaiyo Resort." 
  A landowner of the opposition said: "Our life will be 
destroyed if we lose the land inherited from our ancestors. 
Land is the basis of life. A politician like Hosokawa may 
appear gorgeous by displaying fireworks one after another. We 
have to take the responsibility of living in our home town." 
<H5>  Hosokawa Likes Memoirs </H5>
  Anybody who has ever talked with Hosokawa says without 
exception that "he has a memo-taking mania." With whomever he 
may be talking, he eagerly takes notes. Although it is easy to 
assume that it may be his experience as a correspondent which 
makes him do so, according to old acquaintances he takes notes 
whenever his partner makes a witty comment. He murmurs 
something like: "That comment may be useful". 
  According to Tadateru Konoe, from childhood Hosokawa showed 
strong interest in politicians. He loved to read Churchill's 
memoirs and others. When he became a university student, every 
member of his family was aware he wanted to be a politician. 
Strangely, Konoe does not remember discussing practical matters 
with him. A young man whose intention is to become a 
politician, but who will not make discussions--such is the 
distant view of Hosokawa in his younger days. Since then, he 
persistently followed the path to becoming a politician. 
Reportedly the motive of his taking the entrance examination to 
Kyoto University, and of his working for ASAHI SHIMBUN, was to 
prepare to be a politician. 
  Reportedly Hosokawa told Takayuki Suga, his classmate at 
Gakushuin University: "In Kumamoto we have a strong blood 
relationship, such as old retainer groups and others. If I run 
for governorship, it is definite I will win." There are a 
number of friends who remember hearing similar comments. 
However, none of his friends ever heard him say what he was 
going to do after becoming a politician. When his friends 
talked about Sartre and Camus, and discussed the possibility of 
applying existentialism to politics, Hosokawa did not join the 
discussions. In framing JNP policies, Hosokawa also leaves the 
discussion to others. During the founding of the JNP, the 
people who took charge of framing the party's policies were the 
academic group consisting of Kenichi Kayama and others; the 
ASAHI SHIMBUN group consisting of Hiroshi Ando and others; 
Shinano Namikawa and others from the Gyokakushin [administrative 
reform council] group; and Tetsuhisa Matsuzaki and others who 
hurried to join the formation of the new party. Since the new 
party was just being formed, there were heated discussions. 
Hosokawa not only refrained from taking part in these 
discussions, he seldom expressed his own opinions. 
  As a result, it turns out each participant appealed to 
Hosokawa that his is the appropriate opinion. For the time 
being, Hosokawa accepts those opinions. However, he does not 
have any firm standards of his own, so his statements and 
policies tend to sway from right to left. 
  That he does not have a firm standard is not the only reason 
his opinion sways. For example, it is an everyday experience to 
see the following instance take place within the JNP: When 
Kayama delivers his own policy plan to Hosokawa, Hosokawa 
conveys it to Ando without adding his own comments. Thinking 
Hosokawa is asking him to review the plan, Ando returns it to 
Hosokawa after pointing out problems and adding corrections. 
Instead of giving his own judgment, Hosokawa again returns the 
plan untouched to Kayama. Kayama becomes angry because the 
modified plan does not reflect his opinion. A reversed 
situation takes place the next time, and this time it is Ando's 
turn to become angry. A similar instance occurs involving all 
the members who take part in policy-making. The policy sways 
largely to both sides each time such an instance occurs. 
  This is called a "you-may-decide-it-as-you-like-it 
constitution." In short, it seems to be Hosokawa's intention 
that if the lord asks for opinions, those who have been asked by 
the lord are supposed to discuss the matter and make decisions 
as they please. 
  People who work for the JNP secretly say Hosokawa also 
possesses "dialogue-mania." Though the name implies he will 
talk to anybody, what it really means is he tends to make the 
same request to several persons. Since everybody is working 
toward a separate goal, it causes trouble when several orders 
are issued for the same item. Yet the person issuing several 
orders does not care. 
  Michio Akiyama, a media-producer contracted for the naming 
of 
the party and other business at the time of the JNP's 
initiation, was requested by Hosokawa to create a party image as 
a strategy to fight the House of Councillors' election; he even 
held a news conference. However, Hosokawa had issued the same 
order to Naoe Wakita [as published] of Dentsu EYE, and despite 
the fact he even had Akiyama hold the news conference, Hosokawa 
fired Akiyama and his group. 
  As we have seen so far, Hosokawa does not have a definite 
opinion and only accepts the opinion of the person whom he met 
last. Yet at a glance, he seems to be following a determined 
straightforward course without hesitation. This is because 
Hosokawa believes there is a more important quality for a 
politician than having a definite opinion. 
  Konoe analyzed Hosokawa's liking for "memoirs" as 
follows: "He always remembered that European and American 
politicians wrote memoirs once they retired, and he himself 
wants to follow the same path; thus he is always concerned about 
how the things he does now will be recorded by history. 
Therefore he is serious in everything he does, indulging in an 
imaginary world. Take his speech, for example. He knows for 
sure that a collection of his speeches will be issued. Then he 
becomes particular about his words to be recorded in the 
collection. Apart from whether he has intentions to advertise 
his book, it may be his idea that in order to be remembered he 
should not follow the customary pattern of making speeches, and 
he should not miss the valuable opportunity of leaving his 
unique speeches." 
  It is a well known fact Hosokawa is a follower of Kennedy, 
and reportedly since he assumed the post he has been hoping to 
directly talk from his office to the people through television, 
just like the President of the United States. Though at the New 
Year's news conference this year he expressed his hope to do so, 
his hope was not realized, being opposed by the correspondents 
assigned to the cabinet on the grounds that it is not acceptable 
to hold a news conference in a form totally excluding them from 
asking questions. 
  According to a staff member of the advertising agency which 
was asked for advice, Hosokawa first proposed following the 
example of the President of the United States and using a 
teleprompter, which he did at the news conference in which he 
announced the rice market was to be opened. As to the idea of 
the prime minister standing during the news conference, while 
the platform for that purpose had already been prepared by this 
advertising agency when the LDP was in power, the idea was 
realized for the first time with the birth of the Hosokawa 
government. There was also a plan to have Hosokawa appear on a 
disk jockey program of a commercial radio station on New Year's 
Eve and talk with Yumin [a singer]. Though the plan was not 
realized, Hosokawa was reportedly very enthusiastic about it. 
  As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, Hosokawa 
was 
preparing his statement to be delivered at the news conference 
even while the political reform bills were about to be 
disapproved, threatening his political life. He seems to place 
his first priority on talking to the people, particularly on 
talking to people personally. In that sense, Hosokawa's 
behavior should not be considered a mere performance, but should 
be considered to be his earnest attitude as a politician. 
  Here is Konoe's comment again: "To my brother, the scene 
with people talking to each other around a fireplace appears to 
embrace the fundamentals of the European and American democracy 
during the good days. Basically he cannot help longing for such 
a style." 
  Hosokawa seems to be firmly self-confident about his 
attitude 
of being particular with his words and style. We can even see 
his self-confidence in his attitude to stubbornly defend his own 
image. A staff member of the advertising agency says: "He 
stubbornly refuses our proposals to have him attended to by a 
stylist and to change his hairstyle. While all JNP members are 
being unified by an image color, he alone dresses like a 
salaried man. He has his own style. It is not that he is 
consciously exhibiting his performance, but he does not want to 
spoil his own style." 
  Referring to Hosokawa's way of appearing before the mass 
media, some people say he is good at handling the media. A JNP 
staff member was told by Hosokawa: "You should feed the news to 
the mass media a little at a time." He meant that by so doing, 
you can have the news appear frequently even if it is minor. 
  However, there was a person who expressed severe criticism. 
A producer who participated in establishing a strategy to 
create a party image at the time of the formation of the JNP, 
analyzed the Hosokawa style as follows: "We feel no reality in 
what he says, and we cannot see anything natural in what he 
does. He does not appear natural because he is not honest. 
From a creator's point of view, he seems to be fond of image 
control. By image control I mean creation of an image to defend 
himself." 
  Formerly the JNP won the grand prix at a radio commercial 
contest. The commercial runs as follows: "Here is the list of 
taboo phrases in the JNP: 1) I do not remember. 2) There is no 
such precedent. 3) Please grant me your patronage. 4) Everything 
was done by my secretary. 5) I sincerely regret... 6) I am not 
involved at all. 7) Well, I do not know what I should say. 8) I 
have been somewhat uninformed. We are here to change political 
language. We are the JNP." 
  Each of these phrases tends to automatically remind us again 
of Hosokawa's answers at the Diet concerning his relation with 
Sagawa! 
<H5>  About Kiyoshi Sagawa Again </H5>
  Why did Kiyoshi Sagawa approach Morihiro Hosokawa? 
  Tadateru Konoe explains: "Formerly, being asked by my 
brother, `Please have dinner with Mr. Sagawa', my wife and I had 
the opportunity of having a dinner with him. While I imagined 
he may be a very tough person, he was (in our presence) very 
tense and serious." 
  The wife of Tadateru Konoe is the eldest daughter of Prince 
and Princess Mikasa, and though she is now a private citizen, 
she was directly connected to the Imperial Family. 
  Hosokawa also helped arrange a trip (as testified by Mrs. 
Hosokawa to the mass media) to Sagawa Kyubin Headquarters in 
Tokyo by Prince and Princess Takamatsu in 1981. The house organ 
"Hikyaku" [The Courier] published a special issue describing the 
situation at that time on a large scale under the title 
"Honored, Impressed, the Best Day Ever." It conveys to us how 
very touched Kiyoshi Sagawa was. 
  Sagawa Kyubin is a company which has grown rapidly by 
operating its business without a license, by repeatedly 
violating the Labor Standards Law, and by frequently causing 
accidents. Consequently, the company has been frequently 
involved in troubles with right-wing groups and gangsters. It 
is highly effective to make people think that the company is 
closely related to the Imperial Family. 
  Most of all, Kiyoshi Sagawa was strongly yearning for 
Hosokawa's noble blood connected to the Imperial Family. 
  Kiyoshi Sagawa's devotion to the Imperial Family was an 
extraordinarily serious one. He ordered all Sagawa Kyubin 
Offices to hoist rising sun flags at half-staff when Emperor 
Hirohito died, and he also presented to the Shiogama Shrine 124 
portraits of the successive emperors painted by artist Hogen 
Mabori [as published]. 
  The Hosokawa family's Kyoto house was built in 1928 as part 
of the family's preparations for Prince Hosokawa's participation 
in Emperor Showa's enthronement ceremony, and in the past, the 
Akakura house was also used frequently for the entertainment of 
members of the Imperial Family. 
<H5>  Hosokawa Never Feels Timid Before Anyone </H5>
  We may say that it is because of his noble lineage that 
Morihiro Hosokawa never feels timid before anyone. 
  According to a news reporter who was assigned to the prime 
minister's official residence since Miyazawa was prime minister, 
and who has observed both Miyazawa and Hosokawa in detail, the 
attitudes of Miyazawa and Hosokawa toward dealing with people 
are totally different. Though Miyazawa tends to be haughty at 
times, Hosokawa never changes his attitude toward whomever he 
may be meeting. Hosokawa is never timid toward others, no matter 
whom he is meeting. 
  "Ex-Prime Minister Miyazawa became extremely tense in the 
Emperor's presence, but Hosokawa never appears tense and behaves 
in an ordinary manner," said the news reporter. 
  Hosokawa was not merely free from timidity, but, according 
to 
his friends, he keeps his distance from anyone with whom he 
associates. He treats his friends equally. Therefore, while he 
does not have a particularly intimate friend, he can speak with 
anybody. 
  According to Konoe, there were always about 50 people within 
the residence before the Hosokawa family moved to Kamakura. 
There was an office called "a public office" within the 
residence, and there were also many cooks and house maids. 
  "Those people were all from Kumamoto and, therefore, it was 
necessary to take their personal circumstances into account. 
The lord was on one side, and we were also there, though not as 
young lords. So we were not allowed to live in the world of 
children only. Some people might have thought we were conceited 
brats, yet they flattered us, as they knew they could not help 
but do this. Thus, we have often seen two sides of life. It may 
be that, being acquainted with a certain society from childhood, 
we tend to become sophisticated, eventually dealing with people 
with a somewhat unconcerned attitude. Our association with 
people becomes simple." 
  The two brothers, Morihiro and Tadateru, were bereaved of 
their mother in their childhood. According to Tadateru, when 
their mother died, they were just about the age when a child 
starts expecting his mother's love. Tadateru further explains: 
as we suddenly lost the person on whose love we were supposed to 
rely, and were brought up among many unrelated adults, both of 
us were afflicted with a feeling of loss. As a result, we 
always felt dissatisfied, thus forming Hosokawa's character 
"which cannot concentrate on reading and playing sports, and 
which cannot stick to one objective" (Konoe). 
  Konoe also said: "I think Kumamoto was a feudal clan 
favored with excellent retainers. It may be because of its 
stable history of sitting on such a hierarchy for generations 
that the Hosokawa people tend to be inconsiderate in taking care 
of their followers to a great extent." 
  Morihiro Hosokawa's unique sense of distancing himself from 
everybody may be a reflection of his consciousness of trying to 
remain on a higher level while dealing with his followers on an 
equal level. 
  One of the JNP's [Japan New Party's] staff members says: 
"Those who approach Hosokawa do so as if expecting something 
from him. But I think it is wrong to expect something of 
Hosokawa. He thinks it is natural for other people to do things 
for him. If they knew him, they would expect nothing from him." 
  Associating with everyone from the same distance means that 
he does not become intimate with anybody. It also means that he 
never fights with anybody. He does not expose himself, and 
maintains simple relations with everybody. Such a philanthropic 
person accepts persons from all backgrounds. Hosokawa might be 
a gift child born in the days of change, willing to accept 
various goals and expectations. 
  In the case of the coalition parties, there is an unlimited 
range of policies held within the seven parties and their 
factions. Now, we are apparently in the age of change. No one 
can take the initiative. [Hosokawa] can associate with everyone 
from an equal distance, and he does not have close 
relationships. It is because we are in the age of change, where 
strong personalities and all kinds of tactics are in conflict, 
that such an adhesive agent proves helpful. 
  A newspaper's leading reporter, who was assigned to the 
prime 
minister's official residence, attended the New Year's party and 
asked Mrs. Kayoko Hosokawa: "How is he? Has he changed after 
becoming prime minister?" Mrs. Hosokawa replied: "He first 
appeared to be the sort of person who would be prime minister a 
long time ago." In short, the lord seems to be a person who 
fits the current age well. 
  While both Ichiro Ozawa and Masayoshi Takemura are 
continuously fighting for the creation of an ideal nation based 
on their own policies, which they themselves believe ideal, 
Hosokawa is not as goal-oriented in this way. That is why his 
castle can become a place where brave warriors who are 
continuously dreaming different dreams can stay together. They 
are able to do so because we are in the process of destroying 
the 1955 structure symbolized by the creation of both the LDP 
and the SDPJ. 
  The pillars which have been supporting the 1955 structure 
are 
to be torn down through the opening of the rice market, 
political reform, and deregulation, and are to be restructured. 
When a crisis occurs, the people who are dreaming different 
dreams gather together in one castle to fight against a single 
enemy. For that purpose, the Hosokawa castle seems to be 
accommodating most comfortable beds for dreaming different 
dreams. 
  However, when a new castle is to be built after completely 
destroying the huge castle referred to as the 1955 structure, 
the brave warriors embracing different dreams will leave the 
Hosokawa castle, one after another. That will be the time when 
the historical role of the Hosokawa castle comes to an end.

<F P=106> [Article by Yasufumi Kawasaki, EPA, Research Bureau, </F>
Overseas Research Division deputy director: "High-Tech Industry: 
Strategic Trade Policy Has Little Impact on the Industry"] 
  [Text] 1. Advocacy for a new strategic trade policy 
is surfacing to protect high-tech industry. High-tech industry 
where research and development play a major role is susceptible 
to monopolies and is said to hold special significance for the 
economy of any nation. 
  2. However, it is neither a case where firms that were 
first in entering the high-tech industry realize permanent high 
profits nor a case where the economic impact of such industry is 
particularly significant. Accordingly, even if success were to 
be realized in the development of high-tech industry through 
strategic trade policies, we cannot say that such policies lead 
to significant advantages for industry as a whole of the nation 
in question. 
  3. Rather than a nationalistic approach responsive to 
strategic trade policies, there is a need to take action in 
terms of overall growth for the world economy. International 
cooperation is important in the attainment of such a goal 
through competitive policies, enhancement of market opening 
measures, protection of intellectual property rights, and 
research and development policies. 
<H3>  National Interests Are Being Pushed to the Forefront With 
Active Government Involvement </H3>
  Competition under free trade served as the engine for world 
economic growth in the postwar period. However, on the one hand, 
there was frequent trade friction with Europe and the United 
States and on several occasions controlled trade measures were 
taken through self-imposed export restrictions. 
  Of special note is that in recent years a new movement has 
surfaced in such nations as the United States in the form of 
proposals for "strategic trade policies" under which they demand 
the establishment of numerical goals under which they seek 
expanded imports by the target nation. 
  Strategic trade policies place special emphasis on high-tech 
industry and active involvement of the government in the 
protection and development of such industries. The economic 
premise for such policies rests with the belief that the rise 
and fall of a nation's economy are significantly influenced by 
the viewpoint that research and development play a major role in 
high-tech industry. 
  In essence, to begin with, fixed costs in the high-tech 
industry tend to be large because they require huge outlays in 
research and development, and the industry is affected by 
economies of scale in which average production costs are lowered 
through mass production (advantage of scale). Further, as is 
often said of the production of such items as semiconductors, 
sustained production processes lead to increased yields and 
lower production costs. 
  Because of such perceptions, it is thought that markets are 
susceptible to being monopolized, that importance should be 
placed on taking the initiative in producing high-tech items to 
establish international competitiveness, and that firms taking 
the lead will realize high profits as monopolistic suppliers. 
  Second, technology created through research and development 
can be leaked to sources outside the source firm without going 
through open market transactions in a variety of ways such as 
interchanges among researchers at academic conferences, 
departing technicians, and research based on reverse engineering. 
  As a result, rather than limited benefits derived by a 
single 
firm initiating any given research, it is felt that much greater 
benefits are gained by society as a whole through so-called 
external economic factors. Further, although we now address a 
feature that departs from the effects derived from technical 
peculiarities, we can mention the dynamic mechanism whereby we 
enjoy the economic ripple effect on related industries that use 
high-tech products as parts or production facilities as well as 
the development of new products leading to other new products 
and new technologies in other fields of manufacturing. 
  As an example, enhanced performance and price cuts in 
semiconductors have led to improved performance and lower prices 
for computers. The performance of automobiles and domestic 
appliances has also been improved through the use of numerous 
electronic parts. Further, progress in financial systems and the 
introduction of point-of-sale systems in the distribution system 
were both greatly dependent on developments in the computer 
field. 
  The question now arises of what advantages can be derived 
from the protection and development of high-tech industry. 
<H5>  Need for Prolonged Subsidies Accompanied by Negative Effects </H5>
  First, in addressing the monopolistic nature of the market, 
we note that in much of the high-tech industry, such as 
semiconductors and computers, 10 leading firms monopolize more 
than 80 percent of international markets. However, firms that 
took the lead in developing their respective industries do not 
necessarily maintain their high initial market share 
permanently. The rise and fall of new market participants occur 
rapidly, thus creating many markets where competitive forces 
clash intensively and dispelling any notion that early entry 
into the market place is the only way to ensure competitiveness. 
  When competition is intense, new market entrants or the 
threat of new market entrants bars the maintenance of high 
profits on a long-term basis. Even the sharp drop in prices in 
the semiconductor market, owing to expanded production and a 
competitive market environment that calls for a drop in prices 
and lower production costs, demonstrates that high profits 
cannot be sustained. 
  In other words, even if high profits are enjoyed in the form 
of creative profits by firms that succeed in developing new 
products, they cannot be sustained permanently; and we see the 
repetition of the cycle wherein efforts are made to create new 
technologies that provide innovative, creative profits. We can 
probably label the high-tech industry as one in which dynamic 
competition takes place in the form of "creative destruction" as 
coined by Joseph A. Schumpeter. Accordingly, even if a nation 
succeeds in developing a high-tech industry, nothing guarantees 
the long-term maintenance of such an advantage. 
  Further, some assert that the appearance of a competitor is 
inspired by protection and development of industries by other 
nations. However, maintaining long-term competitiveness in the 
high-tech industry calls for comparative superiority of 
production elements such as a good quality labor force, capital 
facilities, and research and development capabilities. 
  As an example, it is thought that the United States is adept 
at giving birth to creative new products because of its 
superiority in product innovation (new product development) and 
that Asian nations such as Japan are highly competitive in 
producing universal products because of their superiority in 
process innovation (improvements in production processes). If 
such production factors did not exist, development of high-tech 
industries would require subsidies forever and would negatively 
affect economic efficiency of nations concerned on a long-term 
basis. 
  Next, it is said that the social benefits of research and 
development by high-tech industry are significant, but one 
questions whether this is the case. If one were to assume that 
the leakage of new technology leads to the creation of similar 
technology in an identical industry, contributions made in terms 
of technical progress (comprehensive productivity growth) will 
be comparatively significant in terms of research and 
development investments made in a given industry, in those cases 
where the social benefits are especially broad. 
  No significant differences can be noted in research and 
development input and output between Japan and the United States 
in the areas of electronic, electrical, and precision equipment. 
This fact would indicate that neither nation necessarily enjoys 
any major social benefits in the area of research and 
development for high-tech industries relative to other 
industries. 
  And, as is evident in the higher utilization of high-tech 
products in other industries as reflected in charts showing use 
of such products among various industries, major benefits are 
being realized by other industries through economic ripple 
effects emanating from the use of manufactured products. 
However, such effects can be realized through imported products 
if low-priced, efficient products can be purchased from among 
imports. As an example, during the 1980's rapid improvements in 
financial systems were realized in Europe, which is relatively 
backwards in terms of its high-tech industry. 
  Further, a look at the magnitude of the macroeconomic 
influence of high-tech industry shows that the contribution made 
by the electronic, electrical, and precision equipment sector to 
economic growth during the 1982-1990 period was an annual rate 
of 0.71 percent for Japan (with an economic growth rate of 4.69 
percent), and 0.14 percent for the United States (with an 
economic growth rate of 3.31 percent), both relatively modest 
rates. Contributions in terms of job increases were even smaller 
because of the highly productive nature of the industry, 
standing at 0.13 percent for Japan and -0.01 percent for the 
United States. 
<H3>  Government Should Expedite Establishment of Provisions for 
Private Research </H3>
  Based on the foregoing discussion, one would have to admit 
that even if strategic trade policies proved successful and a 
nation's high-tech industry were successfully developed, the 
economic benefits would not necessarily represent a major 
economic advantage. Further, strategic trade policies represent 
nationalistic policy actions which have been repeated since the 
days of mercantilism which sought to deprive benefits 
from other nations and to seek benefits for one's own nation. 
  The problem areas associated with controlled trade have 
already been identified by various sources, but now that mutual 
relationships in the world economy have deepened, greater 
importance must be placed on the search for policy actions 
seeking growth in the overall global economy, i.e., economic 
efficiency through free competition. 
  In search of such a goal, it will be important for the sake 
of promoting a competitive market environment in response to the 
potential for monopolistic abuses 1) for all nations to 
reinforce their competitive policies while ensuring 
international coordination, and 2) for all nations to reinforce 
market opening measures while abandoning protective measures. 
  As an example, a look at the automobile market in the 
European Union (EU) shows that market concentrations of the 
respective nations are high because each nation has assumed a 
nationalistic policy, but such concentrations have diminished 
owing to expansion of trade and mutual market participation 
among regional nations accompanying progress made in EU 
unification. Such growth in market scale enables enhancement of 
competitiveness while conducting a search for the benefits of 
scale. 
  Further, it is difficult to predict which technical sector 
will produce major social benefits as a result of research and 
development. Globalization of business activities and 
international affiliations have increased the potential that 
technology will be leaked overseas. 
  Under such circumstances, it is important for government to 
assume a role in reinforcing and providing for conditions to 
alleviate risks in the development of human capital to be used 
in research and development efforts not restricted to any 
specialized field as a means to provide for positive research 
and development activities in the private sector. 
  Further, it is necessary to protect intellectual property 
rights to promote research and development in the private 
sector, but unreasonably prolonged protection in this area can 
result in obstructing growth in the business world. Accordingly, 
we should assume a balanced approach in coordinating the 
international protection of intellectual ownership rights. 
  Further, from the standpoint of delegating responsibility 
for 
applied research to the private sector for commercial products 
easily influenced by the profit motive, there is a need to 
reinforce research and development policies and international 
coordination among all nations. 
  Finally, in the area of international public interest such 
as 
academic research and basic research, governments of all nations 
should become actively involved for the sake of promoting the 
world economy and we should also think of the future in terms of 
an international institution to support efforts in this area.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 26 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- After 
accomplishing his official visit to India the president of 
Mongolia P. Ochirbat has granted an interview in the plane to 
the special correspondents of the MONTSAME news agency and the 
newspaper "ARDYN ERH". The president announces that he 
considers the outcome of his visit to India as very successful. 
  He particularly points out to the signing of the treaty on 
friendly relations and cooperation between Mongolia and India, 
noting that this treaty defines the basic principles of mutual 
relations of the two countries under new conditions. As the 
President P. Ochirbat says, during the visit signed was a number 
of other documents, defining the principles of cooperation of 
the two countries in concrete branches and directions. In the 
president's view, the sides have got an idea about mutual 
interests in the sphere of economic relations. 
  P. Ochirbat says that the Indian business circles have shown 
a great attention to the Mongolian businessmen, accompanying the 
president during his visit. 
  Answering the questions of the correspondents, P. Ochirbat 
especially points out to the statement of the Prime Minister of 
India N. Rao about coincidence of the open-door policy of 
Mongolia with the policy of India. Concerning financial 
assistance to Mongolia on the part of India, P. Ochirbat points 
out to readiness of the Indian businessmen to render financial 
assistance to Mongolia in realization of big projects. Projects 
will be made concrete during the pending visit of the Indian 
businessman sent to Mongolia in May.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 27. (OANA-MONTSAME) -- In an 
interview to the correspondents of MONTSAME and the newspaper 
"ARDIYN ERH" the president of Mongolia Punsalmaagiyn. Ochirbat 
expressed full satisfaction with the outcome of his visit to 
India. 
  In accordance with the new conditions we have defined the 
basic principles of our further mutual relations. Along with 
the treaty on friendly relations and cooperation signed were 
also a number of joint documents meant for development of 
relations in different spheres, noted the president of Mongolia. 
  As the president noted, the present agreements with India 
differ from the previous documents about development of 
bilateral relations of Mongolia with other states. The new 
documents signed with India are defining mechanisms of 
realization of principles of mutual relations. 
  Founded are also the government commissions to co-ordinate 
and exercise control over the efforts on realization of the 
reached agreements. 
  Besides that, the embassies of our countries have already 
got 
the corresponding instructions. In a word, we have managed to 
overcome our previous shortcoming, when all efforts have been 
often ended in signing documents and giving them a high 
appraisal, said the President P. Ochirbat. In this connection 
the president adduced the statement made by the Prime Minister 
of India Narasimha Rao "interests and principles are coinciding, 
mechanisms are created. It remains just to work". 
  The president's official visit to a number of countries of 
South Asia is continuing.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 28 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- On the 
occasion of his pending official visit to the LPDR [Lao People's 
Democratic Republic] the President of Mongolia P. Ochirbat has 
granted an interview to the central newspaper of Laos "PASASON." 
  Exchange of views on the issues of expansion and development 
of Mongolian-Lao friendly relations and cooperation under new 
conditions both at the international arena and in the two 
countries, definition of the new principles of mutual relations 
by signing a basic legal document treaty on friendly relations 
and cooperation between Mongolia and Laos is the main purpose of 
my visit to the LPDR. 
  At the invitation of the President Nouhak Phoumsavan says 
the 
President P. Ochirbat, answering the question of the newspaper 
correspondent. 
  As the president says, the Mongolian-Lao relations have 
longstanding traditions, owing to efforts of the two countries 
they have been tested by time. In 1976-1990 the bilateral 
relations have been developing actively in all spheres. In this 
period exchange of delegations at a high state level, the 
signing of the Joint Declaration on Friendship and Cooperation 
have been held. A policy of cooperation in the sphere of 
economy, science, trade, culture, education, communication 
between ministries and public organizations of the two countries 
on the long-term planned basis has started, being pursued [as 
received]. 
  Within the framework of her potentialities says the 
President 
P. Ochirbat, Mongolia has been rendering support for struggle 
and peaceful construction of the Lao people. A hospital of 60 
beds, a sheep breeding experiment pedigree station have been 
built and given as a gratis assistance to the Lao people. 
Besides that, the Mongolian specialists have been working in 
Laos, the Lao students have been studying in Mongolia. 
  In the last years, announces the head of the Mongolian 
state, 
mutual relations between our countries could not develop and 
expand because of some objective reasons. But, under 
conditions, when the similar objects on transition to market are 
being pursued in the two countries, when an atmosphere of 
cooperation has been created in the region and other positive 
changes are taking place, favourable opportunities for 
development of the Mongolian-Lao relations in a new direction 
and in a new form are opened before the two countries. 
  Answering the question of the newspaper about perspectives 
for the Mongolian-Lao relations, the President P. Ochirbat 
expresses confidence in development of the Mongolian-Lao 
relations in many spheres on equal mutually beneficial 
principles on the basis of a new general political agreement, 
which is to be signed during the visit. 
  Parallel with bilateral relations, notes the Mongolian 
president, there are good opportunities for cooperation within 
the framework of international organizations of the Gerion [as 
received], the UNO [United Nations Organization], the Group of 
77, the nonalignment movement. 
  The President P. Ochirbat regards cooperation in the sphere 
of private sector of economy development of cooperation in 
humanitarian sphere in the near future as the priority 
orientations of the Mongolian-Lao cooperation.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 24. (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
State Great Hural members from the Mongolian National Democratic 
Party (MNDP) and the Mongolian Social Democratic Party (MSDP) 
will not participate in the parliament work any more on behalf 
of their parties. A decision on this has been adopted by the 
coalitional council of the MNDP and the MSDP. 
  According some leaders of these parties in opposition, this 
means only refusal of the party representative in the 
parliament. An issue about recalling the parliamentarians 
members of these parties from the membership in the State Great 
Hural remains open. 
  The coalitional council, as it is said in its statement, has 
come to such a decision "apropos of the continuing crisis caused 
by disproportionate reflection in the parliament-supreme 
legislative organ of the real placing of political forces in the 
society, violation of the basic provisions of the Constitution, 
the basic principles of the parliament, state system".

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. Government is 
expected to postpone the announcement of sequence measures 
agreed with North Korea that was slated for March 1, timed with 
the commencement of the long-delayed nuclear inspections, after 
resumption of inter-Korean dialogue was rescheduled for Thursday 
[3 March]. 
  Washington and Pyongyang were to announce the agreements 
reached in New York last Thursday simultaneously on Tuesday. 
  Their agreements required North Korea to resume dialogue 
with 
South Korea and fully implement International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspections of its nuclear facilities in order to 
realize the third round of bilateral high-level talks. 
  Seoul proposed Pyongyang to meet on Tuesday and planned to 
announce the suspension of this year's South Korea-U.S. 
military exercise "Team Spirit", but cancelled the announcement 
until Thursday, a date the communist regime later proposed for 
inter-Korean dialogue. 
  The U.S. Government was to announce the Seoul government's 
decision to put off the 1994 Team Spirit drill and reopening of 
third round of talks with North Korea in Geneva on March 21 on 
Tuesday when the IAEA inspection team arrives in Pyongyang and 
inter-Korean working-level contact takes place, a senior 
diplomatic source in Washington said Monday. But North Korea 
broke its promise made in the New York meeting and did not 
response to Seoul's proposal of talks, the source said. 
  If South Korea postpones the announcement to suspend this 
year's Team Spirit, the United States is expected to follow suit 
and cancel announcement of sequence measures until Thursday, he 
said. 
  Washington reportedly will closely discuss Pyongyang's delay 
of inter-Korean dialogue with Seoul on Tuesday. But as State 
Secretary Warren Christopher is due to present himself to the 
Congress hearing on Tuesday, he may well announce the agreements 
reached with Pyongyang in last week's meeting and explain the 
U.S. position.

  [Text] Seoul, March 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will send a 
telephone message to North Korea on Wednesday, accepting North 
Korean proposal for working-level meeting on Thursday in the 
truce village of Panmunjom to discuss the exchange of 
presidential envoys. 
  In a government meeting Tuesday, Seoul decided to withhold 
the announcement of suspending this year's South Korea-U.S. 
military exercise "Team Spirit" until it actually sits down for 
talks with North Korea, Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae 
said. 
  Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi 
Yong- tok coordinated the government position with Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, National 
Security Planning Agency Director Kim Tok, and Senior 
Presidential Secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs 
Chong Chong-uk after North Korea rejected Seoul's earlier 
proposal for inter-Korean dialogue on Tuesday and instead 
rescheduled the date for Thursday in a telephone message. 
  The government decided to agree to the new date on an 
interpretation that the communist regime showed positive 
attitude toward exchange of special envoys despite its delay for 
talks. 
  In its telephone message on Tuesday morning, North Korea 
said 
it will send officials to the southern side of Panmunjom at 
10:00 a.m. Thursday. 
  It added that it was happy that the South proposed 
working-level meeting to discuss exchange of special envoys.

  [Text] The government held a strategy meeting of 
unification-related ministers chaired by Deputy Prime Minister 
Yi Yong-tok at the prime minister's official residence in 
Samchong-tong on 1 March, in which the participants agreed to 
positively consider to hold the fourth round of North-South 
working contact on 3 March proposed by the North Korean side. 
  The government has decided to inform the North side of this 
position around 1000 [0100 GMT] 2 March. Therefore, the fourth 
round of North-South working delegates' contact for the exchange 
of special envoys is expected to be held at the House of Peace, 
the meeting site in the South side area of Panmunjom, at 1000 on 
3 March, two days later than the ROK Government had proposed. 
  The unification-related ministers' meeting also decided to 
maintain the position that the South side will announce the 
condition-attached suspension of the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise for 1994 later if the North-South working contact is 
made, as the Ministry of National Defense has announced. 
Therefore, the South side may well announce the 
condition-attached suspension of the Team Spirit exercise when 
it confirms that the North-South working contact is made on 3 
March. 
  Prior to this, North Korea, in a telephone message in the 
name of Pak Yong-su, the North side delegate to the North-South 
working contact, said it agrees to the resumption of the working 
contact, admitting that the South side accepted the North side's 
demand for the suspension of the nuclear war exercise and the 
abandonment of the international cooperation system.

  [Text] While giving a report at the National Assembly 
National Defense Committee on 28 February, the director of the 
Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] denied rumors that 
there is a crisis on the Korean peninsula by saying that "there 
is no special situation." 
  In connection with the secret contact of envoys between the 
South and North upon President Kim Yong-sam's proposal to hold 
South-North summit talks, Director Kim Tok said that "this is a 
totally false report." 
  Regarding reports by the media that North Korean Secretary 
Kim Chong-il was in an accident, Director Kim said: "As far as 
I know, he just hurt his leg after falling while riding a horse." 
  It was learned that in a private meeting, Director Kim 
reported: "It is not clear if North Korea is developing nuclear 
weapons, but it is clear that it has reached a stage of 
completing nuclear development. It was learned that recently 
North Korea has been strengthening security at the Yongbyon 
nuclear facilities."

<F P=106> [By Pak Chong-mun] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu looked relieved and 
confident as he was giving his first exclusive interview to 
HANGYORE SINMUN. 
  This was because North Korea finally consented to the start 
of International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear inspections after 
delaying it during the ongoing negotiations with the United 
States. North Korea had accepted inspections on 15 February. 
Han Sung-chu was appointed foreign minister when the Kim 
Yong-sam regime was inaugurated February 1993 and has been 
entangled in the North Korean nuclear issue ever since. He 
could not help but be nervous whenever some progress was made in 
the North Korean-U.S. negotiations on nuclear inspections. 
  While watching the North Korean-U.S. working-level contact 
in 
New York, Minister Han worried that something may go wrong 
because North Korea has persistently refused to accept 
North-South exchange of special envoys as a precondition for the 
third stage of North Korean-U.S. talks. When it was pointed out 
the letter of agreement between North Korea and the United 
States, which was released on 25 February in New York, does not 
say the North-South exchange of special envoys is a precondition 
for the third stage of DPRK-U.S. talks, Minister Han flatly 
said: "We can say the U.S. position that no third stage of 
North Korean-U.S. talks can be held without an exchange of 
special envoys was implemented." 
  This means that even though North Korea opposed the 
inclusion 
of the special envoy issue in the letter of agreement to save 
face, it accepted this condition in actuality. 
  Asked why he thought so, he said: "The United States 
immediately notified us of the results of the discussions at the 
New York contact. In doing so, it asked us whether we consented 
to such a letter of agreement. After confirming the U.S. will 
for the special envoy issue, we expressed our approval on the 
letter of agreement." 
  Probably conscious of the domestic criticism that the United 
States took the initiative in the negotiations on the nuclear 
issue and that the ROK was detached from the negotiations 
between the United States and North Korea, Minister Han 
stressed: "I can say our government has taken the initiative in 
improving the situation. An example of this is that we have 
persistently pursued to resolve the issue through dialogue." 
Minister Han recently (from 9 to 19 February) visited the 
United States, where it was strongly demanded that sanctions be 
imposed on North Korea, and reconfirmed the ROK- U.S. basic 
position that the nuclear issue must be resolved through 
dialogue. Some people say this has affirmatively affected the 
negotiations between the United States and North Korea and led 
North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. 
  It is not clear, however, whether the minister's policy of 
resolving issues through dialogue led North Korea to accept 
nuclear inspections or whether North Korea accepted nu?lear 
inspections because it had no other choice. 
  North Korea accepted nuclear inspections while he was 
discussing the North Korean nuclear issue with U.S. leaders. As 
a result, his U.S. visit proved to be productive. In this 
sense, he was lucky. 
  When Minister Han returned home from the United States, some 
people alleged that he leaned toward the North. Maybe conscious 
of the allegation, he cautiously talked about the improvement of 
North Korean-U.S. relations. He said: "One can think of 
several interim stages in North Korean-U.S. relations between 
the present status and the establishment of full diplomatic 
relations. Such stages may include lifting the virtual economic 
embargo imposed on North Korea, allowing businessmen to visit 
North Korea, and opening liaison offices." He stressed that 
when the nuclear issue is resolved, the improvement of relations 
between North Korea and the United States and between North 
Korea and Japan is not unfavorable to the ROK. 
  He pointed out that North Korea must be cautious of its 
fixed idea of the zero sum game in reunification diplomacy. 
  Minister Han had said that we must face the fact that 
matters 
that concern North Korea, will also be matters that will concern 
us. His view stems from the common principle that consideration 
must be guaranteed if one is to convince the other side. This 
takes root in the work of Harvard University Professor Thomas 
(Schilling) entitled, "Strategy in Disputes," which he was 
deeply impressed with during his school days. Professor 
(Schilling)'s book developed the theory on methods for 
contemporary and international politics, such as the theories of 
games. 
  When asked if he had a hard-line view or moderate view in 
connection with the issues on North Korea, Minister Han said 
that he does not want to be classified as a hard-liner or 
soft-liner, but emphasized: "I believe that I am a realist." 
  It seems clear that when we examine his remarks on North 
Korean issues and on how he handles his work, he is a "realist." 
When the nuclear negotiations were in a difficult situation, 
Minister Han minutely adjusted the priorities in his remarks, 
and considering his status within the government and the 
president's position, he refrained from making unreasonable 
acts. We cannot say that he has complete command over the 
career officials within the Foreign Ministry, but it also does 
not mean that he is being dragged around by the officials. 
  When asked about the current reunification policy and the 
status of the National Unification Board, Minister Han refrained 
from making any remark by saying that it is not his field of 
work. He just said: "The Korean commonwealth reunification 
formula was announced in 1989. However, it seems that this 
formula does not sufficiently reflect the important changes that 
took place in the international environment since then." 
  After teaching at New York University until the late 
seventies, Minister Han returned to the ROK to teach at Koryo 
University. Since then he has taken part in the government's 
foreign policies by becoming a member of the diplomatic policy 
advisory committee of the Foreign Ministry and a member of the 
ROK-Japan 21st Century Committee. He also accumulated a 
considerable international reputation as a guest columnist of 
NEWSWEEK. He is recognized as the minister among all former 
foreign ministers who has the best command of English. This is 
attributed to the fact that he lived in the United States for a 
long period of time. Prominent press and publications in the 
United States sometime show unprecedented friendliness by 
publishing special reports on him. 
  The interview now changed to the subject of trade and 
pending 
economic issues, such as the issue of opening the rice market, 
NAFTA, and the issue of Russia repaying economic cooperation 
funds. In particular, the issue of opening the rice market and 
taking part in NAFTA are issues that remain a challenge to him. 
  He said: "I believe that it will be inevitable to hold 
negotiations again on agricultural products because the 
countries participating in the Uruguay Round did not attach 
conditions when submitting the letter of content in the 
agricultural product field." He is saying that it is agonizing, 
but we cannot but keep the promise on opening our agricultural 
products, such as opening the rice market. 
  There are pros and cons between the government and academic 
circles on our participation in NAFTA, which officially went 
into effect early this year. However, Minister Han presented a 
considerably clear countermeasure. Considering the pace of 
progress in our efforts to achieve internationalization, 
Minister Han thinks that the issue of joining NAFTA must be 
examined in the long-term, and that at the moment we must 
promote cooperation with NAFTA member countries--the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico. He said: "In July, the U.S. 
Administration is planning to submit to Congress a report on 
methods to operate NAFTA, including ways to establish relations 
with nonmember countries. After taking this into consideration, 
we must establish countermeasures regarding this matter. Rather 
than becoming an official member of NAFTA, we must try to 
utilize various forms, such as becoming an associate member or 
establish special cooperative relations." 
  In connection with Russia's proposal to repay economic 
cooperation funds by providing up-to-date weapons and carry out 
joint venture projects, Minister Han showed a prudent attitude 
by saying: "Since this is an issue directly related to economic 
cooperation and security, the government's overall view will be 
provided after discussing this matter with related ministries." 
  Minister Han has been criticized that he concentrates too 
much on diplomatic policy issues to the detriment of internal 
reform issues. This is because internal reform to resolutely 
improve irrational diplomatic manpower structures and revise the 
network of diplomatic establishments abroad are still at a 
standstill. Many diplomats observing him hope that rather than 
seeking a simply realistic attitude, he will join in the ranks 
of carrying out reform.

  [Text] The prospect of a South-North envoy exchange has 
dimmed as North Korea has failed to express its clear position 
on our 28 February proposal that South and North Korea hold a 
working-level contact on 1 March for the exchange of envoys. 
  This means that North Korea has broken the promise it made 
after a working-level contact with the United States in New York 
on 26 February. North Korea made an abrupt announcement of the 
delay in expressing its position after the South-North Liaison 
Office at Panmunjom closed at 1600 [0700 GMT] on 28 February, 
embarrassing our government. 
  The government analyzes that North Korea is delaying in 
expressing its position because it has not yet made a clear 
decision on its position on South-North dialogue. In the course 
of its negotiations with the United States, North Korea has 
insisted on resolving the nuclear issue through "an agreement 
between North Korea and the United States," trying to exclude 
South-North dialogue. 
  North Korea opposed the stipulation of the South-North envoy 
exchange up to the last moment in the DPRK-U.S. working-level 
contacts that were resumed in New York on 22 February and 
created a crisis in which the nuclear inspection team's entry 
into North Korea was doubtful. 
  North Korea is probably calculating that by making the South 
lose face on South-North dialogue, it will gain the upper hand 
in negotiations when working-level contacts are resumed. This 
can be one of the reasons North Korea is delaying in expressing 
its position. North Korea, however, is not likely to ultimately 
refuse South-North working-level contacts. 
  It seems that when working-level contacts are resumed, 
intensive discussions will be held on the subjects the South and 
North Korean envoys will discuss and the method of exchange of 
the envoys. South and North Korea failed to reach a complete 
agreement on this matter until they concluded the third 
working-level contact on 25 October 1993. In the third contact, 
they came to a virtual agreement on the level and mission of 
envoys by agreeing that "high-level envoys nominated by the top 
authorities" of South and North Korea will "deliver verbally 
each top authority's intent and personal letter" to the other 
side. 
  Our side proposed hypothetically [chusangjoguro] that "they 
discuss the nuclear issue and the implementation of the 
South-North basic agreement," while North Korea clearly 
suggested that they discuss the implementation of the 
declaration of denuclearization, measures for easing tensions 
and implementing the North-South agreement, the promotion of the 
grand unity of the whole nation, pending issues between the two 
sides, and the South-North summit talks. 
  It seems that there will be no problem with this matter as 
our side at a meeting of unification-related ministers on 27 
February expressed the position that the envoys "can discuss not 
only the nuclear issue and the issue of summit talks, but 
anything else." 
  North Korea's demand for the "suspension of the South's 
nuclear war exercise" and the "abandonment of the international 
cooperation system," which North Korea persistently raised in 
South-North working-level contacts last year -- no matter what 
the agenda items of each contact were -- cannot be a big 
problem, either, because it will be met automatically when the 
North Korean nuclear issue is resolved.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular dailies on 28 February 
carry editorials and articles assessing the recent development 
in the North Korean nuclear issue in which the United States and 
North Korea are reported to have agreed on four points: 1) The 
United States will announce suspension of the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise; 2) North Korea will allow the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, to inspect its nuclear facilities 
beginning 1 March; 3) the inter-Korean working contact for the 
exchange of special envoys will be resumed in Panmunjom; and 4) 
the United States and North Korea will hold the third round of 
high-level talks in Geneva on 21 March. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Progress Only on Procedural Matters." The 
editorial notes: "This progress in the North Korean nuclear 
issue is only in procedural matters. No real progress has been 
made. The so-called `full-scope inspection' to which North 
Korea has committed merely has the significance of including in 
the inspection `all of' the seven sites, including the 
five-megawatt nuclear reactor and the radioactive chemical 
laboratory. The `full scope' inspection entails only one 
examination to determine if there has been any change in the 
seven sites since North Korea rejected inspection one year ago. 
As a matter of fact, this is a very limited inspection. Real 
progress to ensure North Korean nuclear transparency remains 
only in our vague expectation that such progress can be explored 
in the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks." 
  The editorial notes North Korea unwillingly consented to the 
inter-Korean dialogue for the exchange of special envoys. The 
editorial notes the ROK Government's irresolute attitude to date 
in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, apparently out 
of the desire to induce North Korea to permit nuclear 
inspections, and stresses that in future talks on tackling the 
practical problems in talks with North Korea, we should take a 
tough, clear-cut position to ensure transparency in North Korean 
nuclear inspections. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 900-word 
editorial entitled "North Korean Nuclear Inspection -- This is 
Only a Beginning." The editorial notes: "Full-fledged 
negotiations will be begin at the third round of U.S.-North 
Korean talks, which will deal with the issue of IAEA inspection 
of the two undeclared nuclear sites in Yongbyon." The editorial 
notes that these two undeclared nuclear sites are the key to the 
resolution of the nuclear issue, and notes the fact that "the 
United States failed to put down in writing the resumption of 
inter-Korean dialogue as a precondition to the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks, accepting the North Korean stance that 
if South Korea proposes the exchange of special envoys, North 
Korea will hold a working contact in Panmunjom." The editorial 
continues: "Under this condition, North Korea proudly disclosed 
that it had agreed with the United States to suspend the Team 
Spirit ROK-U.S. joint military exercise." The editorial notes 
that when the inter-Korean contact is made in Panmunjom on 1 
March, the South side will be able to find out how serious North 
Korea is about inter-Korean dialogue and if the South's 
irresolute position in dealing with the North Korean nuclear 
issue has been appropriate. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "The Nuclear Issue and the Attitude 
of the Authorities of North and South Korea." The editorial 
anticipates little problem in nuclear inspection by the IAEA "as 
North Korean delegate Ho Chong said that the inspection will be 
completed smoothly within the set period and the date for the 
third round of high-level talks is set." The editorial 
criticizes North Korea for its attempt to exclude South Korea, a 
direct party concerned in the national reunification and nuclear 
issues, from the discussion on the nuclear issue. The editorial 
criticizes that the South Government "looks like a groomsman," 
as revealed by the ROK's "awkward" announcement on the 
suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise after the 
United States and North Korea had already adopted the written 
agreement. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 7 a 500-word 
article by Yang Sung-hyon entitled "The North Korean-U.S. 
Negotiation and the ROK-U.S. Joint Cooperation System" from the 
"Today's Eye" column. The article notes that relevant ROK 
Government officials feel the result of the U.S.-North Korean 
contact held in New York fell short of their expectations 
compared to the enormous efforts and energy of the U.S. and ROK 
side. The article notes the North Korean disclosure of the 
U.S.-North Korean agreement on the suspension of the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise before a ROK announcement and the 
failure to demand as a precondition for the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks that meaningful progress is 
made in inter-Korean dialogue, and reports: "The failure to 
include this precondition in the U.S.- North Korean written 
agreement could be a stumbling block in the future in view of 
the unpredictable North Korean attitude." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 5 an article by 
Pak Ui-chun entitled "The Inter-Korean Scuffle Over the 
Interpretation of the 'New York Contact.'" The article notes: 
"While South Korea claims that it followed through on its 
position with North Korea that the inter-Korean exchange of 
special envoys must be made before the third round of North 
Korea-U.S. high-level talks, North Korea claimed that the 
written agreement was adopted because the United States withdrew 
the unreasonable precondition, hinting that the exchange of 
special envoys was excluded as a precondition to the third round 
of U.S.-North Korean talks." The article continues: "The ROK 
Government explains that the United States did not include the 
inter-Korean exchange of special envoys in the written agreement 
because the United States can call off the third round of talks 
in case the exchange of special envoys is not realized." The 
editorial concludes: "Although North Korea shows an allergic 
reaction outwardly to the inter-Korean exchange of special 
envoys, it will probably agree to the exchange of special envoys 
before 21 March to create an atmosphere favorable for the third 
round of talks."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- Adoption of a "standard 
contract" system is being promoted for business dealings between 
South and North Korea. A government official said on Monday 
that the system would be an effective means of preventing 
disputes stemming from the two sides' different setups. The 
system would also help minimize South Korean investment risks in 
North Korea as there are currently no bilateral investment 
guarantees. 
  If the two sides reached agreement, the form of trade and 
investment contracts would be formalized at a private level 
subject to approval by government authorities. 
  "We have conceived of the idea in the belief that chances 
are 
slim for the conclusion of a governmental South-North investment 
guarantee agreement in the foreseeable future," the official 
said. 
  The South is now working on a draft and when significant 
progress is seen in the nuclear issue, it will raise the issue 
with the North, the official said. 
  Japan and China introduced a standard contract system prior 
to normalizing diplomatic relations.

  [Text] KOREA REPORT, a biweekly magazine published in 
Tokyo, has reported that Kim Chong-il, North Korean Workers 
Party secretary and supreme commander of the People's Army, has 
directly denied the possibility that he will succeed the 
position of president or party general secretary as long as 
President Kim Il-song, his father, is alive. While quoting a 
well-informed source in Washington, the latest edition of KOREA 
REPORT, published on 28 February, reported that during a meeting 
with a Korean-American in January, Kim Chong- il said that he 
had no intention of succeeding, Kim Il-song, his father, as long 
as he is alive.

Korean Affairs of CHOSON ILBO, from "The Road to Reunification" 
column: "Kim Chong-il?"] 
  [Text] In an interview for the March edition of WOLGAN 
CHOSON, ROK Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae -- who returned 
to Seoul in early February to participate in a meeting of 
overseas heads of Korean diplomatic and consular missions -- 
made shocking remarks regarding the North Korean power system. 
  He said: "There would be no difficulty for the Kim Il-song 
and Kim Chong-il system to last more than 30 or 40 years. In 
South Korea, the Pak Chong-hui system, which was established in 
the early sixties, lasted more than 30 years. The North Koreans 
are intelligent people." 
  It is unclear on what grounds Ambassador Hwang makes such 
remarks, but his remarks are very different from the previous 
view of ordinary people. In fact, new assessments of Kim 
Chong-il have recently been reported one after another. 
  Professor Kim Il-pyong, professor of the U.S. University of 
Connecticut, and Yi Hang-ku, author of the book "Kim Il-song" 
and an expert on North Korean affairs, have a positive view of 
Kim Chong-il's leadership ability. 
  Professor Kim said: "Kim Chong-il's succession to power in 
North Korea is just like a son of a businessman taking over 
management of the business. The Kim Chong-il system could be 
turned into a very different system, even though it inherits the 
Kim Il-song system. Therefore, it is highly possible that Kim 
Chong-il would maintain the stabilization of the system by 
creating his unique power system through political system 
reforms or economic system opening." 
  The professor reports several cases to prove his point: Kim 
Chong-il, who graduated from Kim Il-song University -- a 
necessity for North Korean elites -- has been interested in 
North Korean administrative reform since his campus days; has 
outstandingly developed the chuche idea "created" by his father; 
and has established legitimacy to his inheritance of power 
through a "symbolic fabrication," even though it represents a 
distortion of the truth. 
  He also added: In particular, Kim Chong-il has overcome 
several throes in the course of his study of power succession. 
These throes include his depression caused by his mother's 
death; his refugee life in Jilin, Manchuria during the 25 June 
Korean War; his feeling of uneasiness caused by his Oedipus 
complex due to his sister's death from drowning; his roughness; 
and his cruelty. (See HANGUK NONDAN, April Edition of 1992, p. 
96-107) 
  Author Yi said that Kim Chong-il's habits of working until 
midnight, sleeping late, and receiving enjoyment from a 
"pleasure- giving team" do not truly represent his "basic 
character." Many experts, however, still have negative views of 
him. 
  Professor (Scalapino) said: "It is true that there are many 
rumors that he lacks knowledge, ability, and experience. It is 
a problem that although he can inherit power from his father, he 
cannot inherit a charismatic character from him." Ms. Choe 
Un-hui and her husband Sin Sang-ok, who observed Kim Chong-il 
for a long time in North Korea, worry that he might take any 
action because he is very self-righteous and because of his 
negative character, his brutality, and his desire to become the 
best one in the world. 
  There have been rumors that he has been "in an accident." I 
believe that these rumors are rooted in the people's assessment 
of his abnormal character. 
  None of these different assessments of Kim Chong-il have 
ever 
been verified. However, it is a self-conceit to downgrade the 
North Korean power structure by regarding Kim Chong-il as a 
rowdy boy who knows nothing.

  [Excerpt] 
<H5>  Kim Il-song Death, North Korean Collapse Scenario </H5>
  [Passage omitted] Up to now, the scenarios for a North 
Korean 
[DPRK] collapse have called for popular uprisings, a military 
coup d'etat, invasion of the South, and so on, but these have 
all been centered around Kim Il-song's demise. The common ground 
of these assertions is that despite Kim Chong-il's lack of 
ability as a supreme ruler, he became heir with the absolute 
support of his father, the supreme authority. Using Kim 
Chong-il's lack of ability, that is his lack of legitimacy, 
doubts about his crisis-management ability, personality defects, 
and so on, as the basis of their assertions, those arguing for 
an early collapse of the Kim Chong-il regime in particular say 
that immediately after the death of "godlike" Kim Il-song, or 
within two to three years thereafter, the DPRK people and 
bureaucrats will drive out Kim Chong-il because they link the 
causes of their economic stagnation with the 1973 decision 
within the party to make Kim Chong-il heir. 
  Thus, to present a counterargument to the scenarios dealing 
with the collapse of the DPRK system, we must examine the 
following questions. First, is the DPRK economy really in so bad 
a state as to make recovery impossible, even if there were a 
turnaround in circumstances? Second, does Kim Chong-il lack 
authority as "Suryong [leader]," is he incompetent, and is the 
support he receives from the party, government and military 
bureaucracy and from the people, the ruled, voluntary or is it 
forced? Third, are the general characteristics of socialism as 
strong in the DPRK as they were in the former Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe or are the special characteristics of the DPRK 
strong? Of course, a strict distinction must be made between 
systemic and governmental change. 
<H5>  North Korean Economic Crisis </H5>
  Is the DPRK economy really in so bad a state as to make 
recovery impossible? Proponents of a DPRK collapse due to 
economic backwardness say food riots have been continuously 
occurring recently due to the following: The DPRK economy 
entered a gradual decline beginning in the mid 1970s. It 
recorded a growth rate [as published] of 3.7 percent in 1990, 
5.2 percent in 1991 and 7.5 percent in 1992, and its 
factory-operation rate was only 30-40 percent. Grain production 
was a mere 4.812 million tons in 1991, 1.6 million tons short of 
the total demand of 6.4 million tons, and it was short 2 million 
tons in 1992. The DPRK has not officially published economic 
statistics, however, so is not asserting that the DPRK economy 
is in the worst state possible based on estimates derived from a 
"New-People's-Account [Sin Kukmin Kyejong]" computation method 
excessively "our-style capitalistic" reasoning? 
  Experts on the DPRK economy set forth obstacles to an 
accurate understanding of DPRK economic reality generally for 
the following reasons: first, due to the closed nature of DPRK 
society, the DPRK does not officially publish statistical data 
on its economy every year; second, due to differences in 
economic systems, statistical concepts and standards are 
different; and third, exchange-rate problems between DPRK 
currency and foreign currency are not clear. Because in the 
DPRK, prices are artificially decided by the National Price 
Committee, not by the principles of a market economy, the 
functions and roles of currency are different from those of a 
market economy and this makes objective analysis difficult. In 
actuality, statistics on the DPRK GNP differ with each research 
organization. The DPRK GNP estimates calculated by the 
Unification Board, CIA (U.S. Central Intelligence Agency), IISS 
(Institute for International Strategic Studies), and SIPRI 
(Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) are all 
different. The figures of these research organizations differ by 
as much as 200 percent. This suggests that, ultimately, theories 
on the continuous negative growth of the DPRK economy may differ 
according to the statistical method used. Of course, these 
differences are not a basis for denying the backwardness of the 
DPRK economy. 
  What is important, however, is that the backwardness of the 
economy itself is not a sufficient condition for the collapse of 
the DPRK Government. There is a deep relationship between a 
change in government and economic backwardness, the degree of 
corruption among the power elite, and the extent of efforts by 
the bureaucracy to revive the economy. Only if the bureaucrats 
live well and corruption is rampant while the DPRK people shed 
their blood and sweat to surmount economic hardships, will the 
people certainly revolt. We will discuss the issue of change, 
therefore, by examining the corruption of the power elite and by 
examining what efforts the DPRK has made to revive its economy. 
  To what extent are the DPRK bureaucrats really corrupt? In 
1991, Kim Chong-il criticized the corruption and bureaucracy of 
government officials with the statement, "Our style of socialism 
centered in the masses of the people will certainly be 
victorious." This was a warning concerning the easygoing 
attitude, inertia, and corruption of the bureaucracy. Many 
defectors give witness to the corruption of the DPRK bureaucracy. 
  Concerning the degree and scale of that corruption, however, 
they make conflicting claims. At least, they say, the corruption 
of the DPRK bureaucracy is not as bad as that of the former 
Soviet Union's nomenclatura or of East Europe's communist 
parties. Moreover, their claims that systemic mechanisms for 
preventing corruption are exhaustive are important. That is, due 
to the development of a "ratification system" (a 
promotion-screening system) at each level to guarantee 
strictness in supplementing personnel, the development of a 
mutual surveillance system of criticism and self-criticism, 
consistent penalties, etc., the extent of bureaucratic 
corruption is probably not "general," contrary to what has been 
reported. Thus, it would be a more realistic analysis to say 
that the corruption of the DPRK bureaucracy is not serious 
enough to give rise to a change in the system. 
<H5>  North Korean Government Efforts at Economic Revival </H5>
  Next, let us look at what efforts the DPRK bureaucracy has 
been making to revive the economy. 
  In a speech given in the "Industrial Zealots Rally [Kongop 
Yolsongja Taehoe]" held in 1975, Kim Il-song stressed the need 
for foreign trade and economic cooperation with the West: 
"...Although until now, we have generally traded with only 
socialist countries, we must now do a great deal of trade with 
newly independent nations and with capitalist nations as well. 
Under conditions of rapid economic development and the 
appearance of new economic sectors, we cannot satisfactorily 
obtain what we need by depending on socialist markets alone." 
  Based on this "teaching," trade with the West jumped. As a 
result, in the mid-1970s the percent of overall DPRK trade made 
up by trade with the West increased rapidly, up from 11.1 
percent in 1965 to 40.6 percent in 1975. In the 1980s, the DPRK 
showed more aggressiveness in its foreign-trade policy. In the 
Thirrd Session of the 7th Supreme People's Assembly held in 
January 1984, by adopting a bill entitled, "On Developing Trade 
by Strengthening North-South Cooperation and the Foreign Trade 
Enterprise," it made a clear switchover in its external economic 
policy. 
  After 1982, the DPRK leadership started to show interest, 
for 
example by visiting China's special economic zones, in the 
results of the economic development achieved by China through 
its publication of the 1979 "Foreign and Domestic Joint-Stock 
Enterprise Law." This series of events is the background behind 
the establishment of North Korea's "Joint Management Law." Its 
basic strategy is to import foreign capital and advanced 
technology without shouldering the burden of repaying foreign 
debt and to use this in economic development. Although it is 
true that, contrary to the DPRK's original intention, the 
results of the Joint Management Law were slight due to 
inadequate economic conditions and to political and economic 
inflexibility, by establishing the "Foreigner Investment Law 
[Oegugin Tuja Bop]" and other laws supplementing the Joint 
Management Law between 1992 and 1993, the DPRK expressed a 
continued intention toward a "misquito-net [bangchungmang]" 
style of opening to foreign countries. 
  Since July 1989, along with its pursuit of developing 
special 
economic zones in Najin, Sonbong, and Nampo, DPRK announced its 
"Sonbong District Trade Zone" development plan in accordance 
with the Tumen River Basin Development Plan begun under the 
management of the UNDP in 1991. The main gist of this plan was 
to develop the area into a center of Northeast Asian economic 
cooperation and transportation by expanding harbor facilities in 
Chongjin, Najin, and Sonbong in the northeastern coastal region 
and by building highways as well as supplementing existing 
railways and roads connecting to this region in China and the 
Soviet Union. Also, development of this region entailed 
accepting the public investment, technological exchange, joint 
management/production of neighboring countries, and attracting 
partners for marine-products processing, clothing manufacturing, 
electronic-product assembly factories, etc. The DPRK actively 
encourages participation by South Korea also, and Deputy Prime 
Minister Kim Tal-hyon even visited the ROK directly, inspecting 
various industrial facilities. 
  We can assess that the DPRK elite have thus been doing their 
best to break through the economic crisis, even if only within 
the limits of what would minimize influences that might cause 
the collapse of the system. Although this has not produced 
results worthy of particular note due to the contradictions of 
the socialistic system itself and the excessive caution of the 
DPRK ruling class--that is, due to efforts to minimize the side 
effects of economic liberalization, it is maintaining the 
economy at a level where the DPRK people can lead at least a 
minimally acceptable life. More important, however, is that 
these efforts by the ruling class are acting in a purely 
functional way to create in the people a sense of unity with the 
state. Also, the reason DPRK economic backwardness does not lead 
into dissatisfaction with the system is to be found in the fact 
that the DPRK people invest more time and passion in working to 
overcome poverty than in criticism about it. Not only is this 
because of the DPRK people's low level of political culture, but 
it is also because they show an accommodating attitude, 
accepting reality as fate, which results from a loss of 
opportunities for comparison due to social control. 
  We must not overlook the fact that the DPRK's surrounding 
circumstances could be worse. Despite all obstacles, including 
the nuclear-inspection issue, China continues economic aid to 
the DPRK because it does not want a DPRK collapse; Russia also 
gives tacit approval to unofficial economic dealings with the 
DPRK; and even the U.S. exported about 250 thousand tons of 
grain to the DPRK in 1993 alone, justifying it as humanitarian 
aid. Also, although not an official relationship, the DPRK 
continues unofficial economic exchange with Japan. Even its 
trade with the ROK reached about $200 million in 1992. If the 
nuclear issue is concluded satisfactorily, the DPRK will gain 
improved relations with the United States and Japan, and because 
economic cooperation with other countries, including the ROK, 
will increase, the DPRK economy could take a turn for the 
better. Thus, we must conclude that, depending on the external 
environment, the DPRK economy always has potential for 
improvement. 
<H5>  Kim Chong-il's Policy To Make Himself "Suryong" </H5>
  Next, the scenario predicting the collapse of the Kim 
Chong-il regime after the death of Kim Il-song is in error in 
that it attempts to distinguish between Kim Il-song and Kim 
Chong-il. According to this position, although Kim Il-song 
secured his status as "suryong" through his armed resistance to 
Japan, socialist construction and "victory" in the Korean War, 
Kim Chong-il has no such record and the economy actually began 
to deteriorate after he came on the scene. The people, 
therefore, pretend to support him while Kim Il-song is alive. 
After the death of Kim Il-song--the controlling power 
maintaining the system, however, the people will pull down the 
Kim Chong-il regime, either immediately or within 2-3 years. 
  The questions here are: Is it really possible to distinguish 
between Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il; and has Kim Chong-il 
secured status as "suryong." The transfer of power in the DPRK 
is, in a strict sense, the handing over of the mantle of 
leadership as "suryong." For Kim Chong-il, it is securing this 
invisible authority as suryong, rather than possessing visible 
and institutionalized authority such as the position of 
president or secretary general of the party, which is his 
essential task. There is no office called suryong in the DPRK 
system. However, the conclusion of Chuche Thought, the basic 
ideology guiding DPRK, is the "theory of the suryong," and 
because it is not through the offices of president or general 
secretary that Kim Il-song rules, but through his "authority as 
suryong," the key to a smooth succession is for Kim Chong-il to 
inherit this authority. 
  What, then, has Kim Chong-il done to secure authority as 
suryong? First, he has worked to highlight his image as a great 
thinker. This is to emphasize his talent as a philosopher, 
second only to Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong and Kim Il-song--all of 
whom considered themselves philosophers. To do this, besides his 
many writings on art, including A Study on Cenematographic 
Art [Yonghwa Yesul Ron], he published works such as 
On Chuche Thought [Chuchesasang e Taehayo] in 1982, 
On Several Problems Presented By Chuche-Thought 
Education [Chuche Sasang Kyoyang eso Chegidoenun Myochgaji 
Munje e Taehayo] (a completion of his ideas on the social and 
political organism) in 1986, Our Style of Socialism 
Centered on the Masses of the People Will Certainly Be 
Victorious [Inmindaejung Chungsim ui Urisik Sahoejuui nun 
Pilsungbulpaeida] in 1991, The Historical Lessons of 
Socialist Construction and Our Party's Overall Line 
[Sahoejuui Konsol ui Yoksajok Kyohun kwa Uridang ui Chongnoson] 
in 1992 and Slander of Socialism Is Impermissible 
[Sahoejuui e Taehan Hwebang un Hoyongdoel Su Opda] in 1993, 
supplementing the core value system of the DPRK, Chuche Thought, 
at the right time. Thus, there is no harm in assessing his 
ability to reinterpret Chuche Thought as "high level." 
  Second, he concentrated his efforts on highlighting his 
image 
as a statesman. By exercising "working-level leadership" of 
large-scale construction sites, such as light and heavy industry 
factories and "private homes [Sallim Chip]," and of 
export-product exhibition halls, he worked to highlight his 
image as a "construction genius." Also, by stressing the 
importance of consumer products through working-level leadership 
in 1984, he injected vigor into the production of consumer 
products. It appears that the liberalization policy for raising 
the people's standard of living presently in progress is being 
carried out centered on Kim Chong-il and the elite surrounding 
him. Although his liberalization efforts are probably 
"selective," it appears they will continue in the future as 
well. Of course, this effort to revive the economy is an 
essential stage for casting off the criticism that the economy 
worsened as he began to take control of the party in the early 
1970s and for securing his authority as suryong. 
  Another important point is that the above series of policies 
to make Kim Chong-il the suryong were not developed in isolation 
from Kim Il-song. That is, the fact that Kim Il-song policy and 
Kim Chong-il policy are not independent from each other, but are 
progressing as a unity is important. Ultimately, the attempt to 
divide Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, whose relationship can be 
referred to as "One mouth, two heads" or "Duality in one body," 
is the product of a lack of understanding of the "the leader's 
[suryong] unified system of rule." 
<H5>  Kim Chong-il's Leadership Ability </H5>
  With this, one thing that must be discussed is the question 
of the extent of Kim Chong-il's actual political ability. Up to 
the present, the assessment of Kim Chong-il's character has been 
divided into two groups, positive opinions and negative 
opinions. We will examine the negative opinions first. 
  First is criticism of his ability. According to this, he was 
chosen as successor despite his total lack of personal ability, 
merely because of the glory of the absolute ruler, Kim Il-song. 
Almost without knowledge of areas other than art, Kim Chong-il 
authorizes most papers presented by his secretaries without 
correction, the claim goes. Those with this outlook assert that 
because Kim Chong-il does not have his father's 
crisis-management experience, the people do not trust him. 
  Second is the problem of his style of rule. He is criticized 
for his lack of character as a leader. As a movie enthusiast, he 
wastes foreign currency on importing movies and reminds people 
of a capitalist bum, whiling away his time watching movies. 
  There is also criticism of the policy decisionmaking process 
and the problem of a crippled distribution of power. That is, 
because Kim Chong-il prefers a "reception-center political 
style" (kitchen cabinet), rather than through the normal process 
of debate, impromptu decisions are made. Because these are more 
influential that normal decisions, bureaucrats unable to 
participate in this group remain as a potentially dissatisfied 
force, it is argued. 
  Third is the problem of his character. It is argued that 
because he lost his mother early and grew up under a stepmother, 
his character became fastidious and twisted. People began 
flattering him early on, so he is insolent and behaves 
arrogantly, such as by holding his arms behind is back even in 
front of Kim Il-song, it is asserted. 
  Conversely, there are also those giving a positive 
assessment 
concerning these problems. First, some assert that, hidden by 
the might of the political giant, Kim Il-song, he has been 
unable to receive a just evaluation. The reason he is not 
popular, according to this analysis, is that in being extremely 
[as published] loyal to his father, Kim Chong-il refrains from 
any political activity that might hurt his father's authority. 
  Second is a problem related to movies--after graduating from 
Kim Il-song University in 1964, the first area he started 
gaining experience in was propaganda and agitation. Ideological 
theory was an important means of maintaining the system. Movies 
were, given the cultural level at the time, the quickest and 
most convenient medium capable of conveying the state's 
objectives and stirring up emotion, mobilizing the masses toward 
the goals fixed by it. He could not help, therefore, but 
naturally become interested in this area, the argument goes. Of 
course, his talent for art is actually reported to be 
outstanding. 
  Third, an assessment of Kim Chong-il's arrogant attitude is 
also different. Kim Chong-il's concern for not only the 
first-generation revolutionaries, but also for the children of 
dead revolutionaries is said to be out of the ordinary. For 
military veterans in particular, he is said to protect their 
livelihood, even promoting them; he is so polite to veteran 
revolutionaries, he even goes around visiting them on New Year's 
Day, offering them the traditional bow of respect and presenting 
them with presents of hairdye. According to the testimony of 
defected diplomat Ko Yong-hwan, when the Ministry of People's 
Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u had a traffic accident and was 
near death, Kim Chong-il took quick action, saving him. Through 
such examples, we can see that Kim Chong-il's attitude toward 
the revolutionary generation is not as haughty as is reported. 
  This writer's position is that Kim Chong-il may not be 
greatly troubled by formality but is more concerned with 
substance and may possess an open personality due his artistic 
character. This writer believes that there is a high probability 
that the extreme assessments of the wild extravagance of Kim 
Chong-il are biased. Of course, this is not a personal 
justification of Kim Chong-il himself. Despite the many 
skeptical perceptions of him, given the fact that in the 30 
years since 1964, Kim Chong-il has accumulated political 
statesmanship and, even at present, he exercises actual, 
absolute authority, it is the conclusion of this writer that he 
has political ability and is likely to exercise strong authority 
in the future as well. This is particularly the case since in 
1993 when he declared a state of semi-war (8 March), declared 
the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT, and so on, and now appears 
to have passed the "national-crisis-management test." Because 
there is a high probability that this was an internal following 
of precedent for his accession to the position of supreme ruler, 
this writer believes that as long as the DPRK does not suffer a 
preemptive attack by the U.S. or other countries, Kim Chong-il 
will not attempt a militarily adventuristic, first strike on the 
ROK. 
<H3>  Party, Government, and Military Bureaucracy Support for Kim 
Chong-il </H3>
  What must be discussed next is the degree of support for Kim 
Chong-il in the party, government, and military bureaucracies. 
In a system of strong, one-man rule such as in the DPRK, having 
a wide reputation is an absolute precondition for the successor 
to inherit power. In this aspect, Kim Chong-il is perfect. The 
proof of this is the repeated confirmation by the DPRK's supreme 
ruler Kim Il-song of Kim Chong-il as his successor and his 
securing of the necessary offices. Anyone who would become 
supreme ruler in the DPRK, a country maintained by a triune 
governing structure of party, government, and military, must 
gain control of these ruling organizations. This means that, by 
whatever means, he must secure the power elite as a support base. 
  Thus, since the 1960s Kim Il-song has in fact devoted his 
energies to securing the support of the power elite, the basis 
of rule, for Kim Chong-il. As a result, he was able to secure 
the support of the 1.5 and second-generation revolutionaries. 
The 1972 decision on Kim Chong-il as successor was possible 
because he had the approval of the first-generation 
revolutionaries. There are those who actually assert this. A 
division of Kim Chong-il's support base is as follows: first, 
Kim Il-song's partisan comrades; second, party and government 
bureaucrats in their 50s and 60s who are well-trained through 
foreign schooling or travel; third, graduates of Mangyongdae 
Revolutionary Institute and Kim Il-song University; fourth, 
former members of Three-Revolutions Teams; fifth, the "Korean 
Socialist Workers and Youth League [Sarochong]", a party 
auxiliary organization composed of youth ages 14-30; sixth, 
military forces around him and numerous party organizations 
within the military; and lastly, relatives and in-laws. 
  The Kim Chong-il power base is thus "comprehensive." 
Horizontally, it includes the party, government, and military, 
all three elements sustaining power. Vertically, it takes in 
each sector, from the top to the very bottom. Also, not only 
does Kim Chong-il's power base include people from each sector 
horizontally, scholars, scientists and technicians, party 
bureaucrats, soldiers, vertically, it contains the older (60s 
and 70s), middle-aged (50s) and younger (30s and 40s) 
generations. 
  In the DPRK, predominated by a party, control of the party 
is 
essential for securing and maintaining power. Here we can say 
that control of the party signifies complete command of both the 
Politburo and the Secretariat. This is because the authority of 
the Secretariat is almost absolute. Article 26 of the "Korean 
Workers Party Regulations" reads, "When necessary, the 
Secretariat deliberates and makes decisions on problems within 
the party, such as party personnel changes and pressing 
problems, and organizes and guides the execution of its 
decisions." In the October 1980 sixth party conference, this 
party regulation was created as Kim Chong-il was appointed to 
secretary so he could "grab hold" of the reins of the party, 
government, and military. Afterward, he organized and reshuffled 
party organizations as he saw fit. Ultimately, we can see that 
the Secretariat actually surpasses the Politburo, given the fact 
that the supreme ruler Kim Il-song holds the office of general 
secretary and number-two man Kim Chong-il acts as agent of his 
authority. 
  By gaining control in the Secretariat of the organs of 
physical coercion, the National Defense Commission, the Social 
Safety Commission, the People's Armed Forces and General Bureau 
of National Security [Howi Chongguk], through the "Organization 
Leadership Commission [Chojik Chido Pu]"--the key to maintaining 
power, thus controlling the elite, Kim Chong-il secured the 
position of actual, supreme ruler. All positions in the 
Secretariat are filled with Kim Chong-il's royal-guard group of 
technocrats: Kye Ung-tae, Chon Pyong-ho, Han Song-ryong, Choe 
Tae-pok, Kim Chung-rin, Pak Nam-ki, So Kwan-hui, Yun Ki-pok, Kim 
Yong-sun, Hwang Chang-yop, Kim Kuk-tae, and Kim Ki-nam. 
  Kim Chong-il has used well a policy of identification with 
is 
father: his father becoming absolute is his own becoming 
absolute. This policy was clearly seen in his recruitment of 
personnel into the power elite. Kim Chong-il politically weeded 
out beforehand anyone who might be able to oppose the Kim 
Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary regime by adopting a 
"ratification system." Ultimately, only relatives, in-laws, and 
children of revolutionaries with good backgrounds received 
preferential treatment. They gained power by "carrying on the 
family line." We can say that, ultimately, the power elite of 
the Kim Chong-il system realized a firm, united organization 
centered around the "leader [suryong]" Kim Il-song and the 
"little leader [chagun suryong]" Kim Chong-il. 
<H3>  The Establishment of Kim Chong-il's Leadership of the 
Military </H3>
  In this context, we will do a deeper analysis of the 
military's attitude concerning the hereditary system and whether 
it will "carry on the family line" and be loyal to Kim Chong-il 
after the death of Kim Il-song. The Kim Chong-il regime will be 
a period of transition. Behind the question of what attitude the 
DPRK military will take during that time are questions, related 
to the issue of the hereditary system, of whether the armed 
forces will bring about change in the system through a coup 
d'etat either before or after the death of Kim Il-song and, in 
the event of trouble between pro-Kim and anti-Kim factions in 
the course of Kim Chong-il's succession to power, of which side 
the military will support. 
  As the DPRK system was being prepared for Kim Chong-il to 
become heir in the early 1970s, the problem of establishing his 
control of the military naturally came up. To eliminate this, 
his weak point, Kim Il-song had Kim Chong-il lead the 
"Three-Revolutions Team Movement" beginning in 1974. In 1973, he 
expanded the "Three-Revolutions Red Flag Movement" to the 
military, strengthening its solidarity with ground-level 
elements within it. The "Three-Revolutions Red Flag Movement" 
could not but succeed as a means of controlling the military. 
Not only was it a government movement strongly supported by 
Kim Il-song, but Kim Chong-il also worked passionately for its 
success. The basis for this conclusion can be found in the 
papers published by high-level generals every year since 1975 at 
every important military function, praising the movement and 
calling for strong solidarity oriented around Kim Il-song and 
the party center (Kim Chong-il). 
  Even in the 1980s, the military continued its oath of 
allegiance to the hereditary regime continuing from Kim Il-song 
to Kim Chong-il. In the ceremony commemorating the 48th 
anniversary of the founding of the People's Army, O Kuk-ryol 
emphasized Chuche Thought, saying, "The soldiers of the People's 
Armed Forces and all the people must go on, emphasizing and 
fulfilling the teachings of the great leader and their 
embodiment, the policies of the party." To stir up the moral of 
the troops, Kim Il-song reorganized the MPAF and the National 
Defense Commission in the April 1982 First Session of the 
Seventh Supreme People's Assembly, taking them out from under 
the Cabinet, making them directly subordinate to the Central 
People's Committee. In April 1985, he promoted MPAF minister O 
Chin-u from general to vice marshal and Colonel Generals O 
Kuk-nyol, Paek Hak-nim, Kim Tu-nam, Yi Ul-sol, Chu To-il, Kim 
Pong-yol, Kim Kwang-chin and Yi Tu-ik, eight veterans [an 
honorary title], to general. In 1988, he restored Choe Kwang, 
who had lost his job in 1968, making him Chief of Staff of the 
People's Armed Forces and after the 1990 Ninth Supreme People's 
Assembly, in December, he made him the third-ranking candidate 
member of the party Politburo. 
  To commemorate his 50th birthday (16 February 1992), Kim 
Chong-il gave special promotions to the next higher rank to 
officers ranging from junior lieutenant to major, to promote 
their loyalty. On 20 April 1992, he and O Chin-u were promoted 
to marshal. At the same time, he promoted Choe Kwang, Yi Ul-sol, 
Chu To-il, Choe In-tok, Paek Hak-nim, Yi Tu-ik, Kim Pong-nyul, 
and Kim Kwang-chin, eight military veterans, to "vice marshal." 
As the supreme commander of the Korean People's Armed Forces, he 
issued an order on 23 April 1992 promoting his supporters: Tae 
Pyong-nyol and 15 others to general, Kim Ha-kyu and 27 others to 
colonel general, Kim Tae-sik and 95 others to lieutenant 
general, and Yi Hyong-sop and 523 others to major general. Thus, 
he firmly established his military base of support. 
  Later, commemorating the "40th Anniversary of Victory," on 
17 
July 1993, Kim Chong-il appointed, through "marshal" O Chin-u, 
Choe Chun-kil and 13 other Korean War veterans to lieutenant 
general and Yom Tae-kyong and 84 others to major general, 
stimulating their moral. In the "Old Soldiers' Rally [Robyong 
Taehoe]" held on July 23, 1993, People's Armed Forces Chief of 
Staff Choe Kwang said concerning this, "Taking as our example 
that conviction, that spirit with which we served the great 
leader, making our bodies guns and bombs, we must defend to the 
death our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, no matter what 
violent gale blows," pledging to be loyal, "carrying on the 
family line." It appears that, ultimately, the military 
bureaucracy will continue to be loyal even after the death of 
Kim Il-song as long as Kim Chong-il does not do anything 
"strange," such as rapid reform, that would endanger the 
preservation of the system. 
  What of the people's support of Kim Chong-il? Of course, 
this 
is very difficult to assess given the present circumstances. 
However, the DPRK people generally believe there will be a 
smooth transfer of power to Kim Chong-il, according to an 
analysis of questionnaires given to defectors. Because the DPRK 
people perceive their leaders, beginning with Kim Il-song and 
Kim Chong-il, to have been born possessing special "innate" 
abilities, challenge to authority and denial of Kim Il-song and 
Kim Chong-il are considered forbidden, according to defector 
testimony. Also, the DPRK people are believed to think of Kim 
Chong-il, not as the son of Kim Il-song, but as a "comrade" 
always near, listening to and solving all their problems. 
Concerning "being loyal, carrying on the family line," it is 
said that because they think of it as a kind of family-property 
system in which a son inherits and continues father's work, they 
understand it just as they do the idea that a miner's son must 
become a miner and a latheman's son must become a latheman. 
  As we observed above, Kim Chong-il can be said to be doing 
his best to raise the people's standard of living within the 
limits of his authority. What is important is that the people 
have no great interest in the hereditary regime itself. That is, 
due to a lack of experience in voluntary participation and to 
political indifference caused by their patriarchal political 
culture, the people accommodate to the system. This writer 
thinks wrong the conclusion that, without Kim Il-song, Kim 
Chong-il will ultimately awaken the DPRK people from their myths 
and that this will lead into the collapse of the DPRK regime. 
<H5>  Special Characteristics of the North Korean Power Structure </H5>
  Next, we will discuss special characteristics of the DPRK 
power structure distinguishing it from the former Soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe. The special characteristics of the DPRK 
system can be organized as follows. 
  First, it is a long-term, father-son hereditary structure. 
Unlike the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the DPRK 
overcame the ideological quarrels of the early regime, 
establishing a unified system of rule comparatively early. Later 
on, Kim Il-song appears to have thought the only way to ensure 
that his existence as father of the nation is passed on to later 
generations was to see that his family was idolized and, as in a 
patrimonial patriarchy, to pass on his power to his eldest son 
Kim Chong-il. Of course, there were artificial attempts to 
inherit power in some socialist countries also, such as the 
former Soviet Union and some countries of Eastern Europe, but 
these all failed. Even these were only attempts to hand over 
power to an associates or subordinate, not to a son. Thus, we 
can say that DPRK's father-son transfer of power by inheritance 
is unique. 
  Due to fears of a coup d'etat and general revolution, during 
their time in power, dictators arrange for the power elite to 
thoroughly hold each other in check, watching and controlling 
them through organs of violence. They tend not to cultivate a 
number-two man while in office because they fear conspiracy. As 
a result, the designation period of the number-two man is short. 
Thus, the predecessor dies without giving his successor 
sufficient time to strengthen a power base, resulting in his 
fall from power. There are also situations in which the 
designation of a successor occurs unofficially, only between 
those concerned; remaining leaders refuse to acknowledge the 
legality of this, resulting in his fall from power. 
  To prevent this, in 1972 when he was 60 and Kim Chong-il was 
30, Kim Il-song unofficially designated Kim Chong-il as his 
successor in the party; during the 20 years since then, he has 
strengthened a firm power base for him in the party, government, 
and military. 
  Second, it is a structure of relatives and in-laws and of 
individuals holding multiple positions. One of the unique 
characteristics of the Kim Il-song power structure is the fact 
that most of his relatives and in-laws appear in key posts, 
differing from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
Filling key positions, these relatives and in-laws of Kim 
Il-song and Kim Chong-il support the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il 
hereditary regime more faithfully than any other of the elite. 
Unlike the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, DPRK had no 
experience of freedom before communization. Thus, patrimonial 
traditions remain across the whole of society, making rule by 
"blood relatives [yukchinjok]" possible. Power in the DPRK is 
amassed and concentrated in the hands of about 40 of the power 
elite. High-ranking elite hold multiple key positions in the 
party, government, military, and Supreme People's Assembly, 
making for easy harmony between the party, government, and 
military and raising the effectiveness of policy. From this 
aspect, it is apparently difficult for factional strife due to 
differences in group interest or line, or strife between 
reformists and conservatives, to arise. 
  Strife is unlikely to arise in the DPRK for the following 
reasons: First, succession of power is going to the oldest son 
in accordance with patrimonial tradition. Also, because 
preparation for the succession has been going on over the long 
period of the last 20 years, it is unlikely that there will be a 
movement to downgrade the predecessor or revolutionary change as 
in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Second, because 
the present power-elite structure is already firmly behind the 
Kim Chong-il succession, it will be difficult for trouble to 
form within the elite group even after the death of Kim Il-song. 
Third, as for the pluralism which appeared in the Soviet Union 
after Khrushchev's campaign to downgrade the status of Stalin, 
it seems unlikely to appear in the DPRK. This is because strife 
is not permitted due to a political situation permitting only 
one philosophy, one system, and one line; the rest are purged. 
Fourth, although in the DPRK too there have been small changes 
in the character of the power elite, such as a gradual increase 
in the number of specialist bureaucrats, the extent of these 
changes is minuscule compared to the former Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe. Not only this, but because the ranks are filled 
with "double-natured bureaucrats," based on the principle, 
"party member first, specialist second," their loyalty to Kim 
Il-song and Kim Chong-il is high. 
  Thus, although there may be developing a weak foundation 
from 
which trouble can form, expression of such strife as was seen in 
the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is still unlikely in 
the DPRK. More important is the fact that the DPRK power elite 
will not stir up trouble over the regime's line even to maintain 
their own positions. Given the degree of cohesion among the DPRK 
power elite, spontaneous, external expression of strife related 
to reform and liberalization appears improbable. Even if they 
were to understand that opening up to the outside world as a 
response to changes in their surrounding environment is 
unavoidable, their method would be to pursue a very careful, 
"mosquito-net"-style, selective liberalization. 
<H5>  Looking at the Kim Chong-il Regime Rationally </H5>
  Additionally, North and South Korea experienced the horrible 
tragedy of fratricidal war called the Korean War. The ROK's "red 
complex" and the DPRK's "Yankee complex" are greater and deeper 
than can be discovered in any other divided country. In a 
relatively inferior position, the DPRK's anxiety is incomparably 
greater than that of the ROK. Thus, even if the "Two Kims" (Kim 
Il-song, Kim Chong-il) did not exist, the next supreme ruler, 
whether in an authoritarian system, a military dictatorship or 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, will try to maintain 
the DPRK as a nation. 
  Even in the worst-case scenario in which Kim Chong-il is 
overthrown and an unexpected figure becomes leader, it is 
possible he will call himself the successor of Kim Il-song and 
do his best to maintain the DPRK as a nation, even making use of 
"Kim Il-song-resurrection theories [Kim Il-song puhwal ron]" if 
need be. In this context, even if the DPRK does not carry out a 
first strike, in the event an extreme situation develops, such 
as a bombing of the DPRK by the United States and other 
countries, we cannot preclude the possibility that the DPRK will 
choose to "fight to the death [okswae]" rather than abandon its 
nationhood. 
  In conclusion, in the past, there was an era when, clinging 
to the "Fake Kim Il-song Theory," even bringing up his name was 
considered taboo. Yet, Kim Il-song is unshakable despite the 
sudden changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
Far from falling from power due to internal rebellion, he is 
actually more revered by a people enveloped in a fear of sudden 
change. Thus, our "Fake-Kim-Il-song-Theory" understanding of and 
policies toward the DPRK have been proven unrealistic. By 
responding while overlooking Kim Il-song's ability and suitable 
research on the special characteristics of the DPRK system, we 
have been unable to come up with effective measures to counter 
the DPRK's unification policy toward the South. 
  Looked at in the above context, our evaluation of Kim 
Chong-il may be the same. He may not compare to the "unique" 
leader, Kim Il-song, but he will manage the system in his own 
way, based on the support of the people and bureaucracy 
resulting from over 30 years of public life and the special 
character of DPRK's suryong-centered system. It is the 
conclusion of this writer that in the future, through gradual, 
selective reform and liberalization, he will satisfactorily 
solve the problems of economic backwardness, the DPRK's 
relationship with the U.S., North-South relations, and so on. 
Therefore, by excessively stressing only his irrational side, 
we are only preparing measures based on the theory that the Kim 
Chong-il regime will collapse soon after the death of Kim 
Il-song, neglecting the preparations for gradual unification 
that would be needed in the event of long-term survival by the 
Kim Chong-il regime. This would be to repeat the same blunders 
caused by the "Fake-Kim-Il-song Theory."

  [Text] Seoul, March 1 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Tuesday he plans to discuss with Chinese leaders for a 
peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue when he 
visits China March 12. 
  In an interview with the KYONGNAM SINMUN on the occasion of 
the 48th anniversary of the local newspaper in South Kyongsang 
Province, Kim made the remark hinting that there were ongoing 
discussions between South Korea and China on the nuclear problem. 
  "My upcoming trips to Japan and China will be historical 
visits that will leave a distinct mark in the pan-Pacific era," 
Kim said. 
  Noting that Japan and China are two of South Korea's three 
largest trade partners, Kim said the country has to surpass 
Japan in technology and competitive strength if it wants to be a 
force to be reckoned with in the world. 
  As for China, it is a country with enormous potential, Kim 
said. It isn't too much, therefore, to say that South Korea's 
economic future depends on what kind of relations it will have 
with the giant neighbor, he added. 
  The president said he plans to discuss how to steer the 
course for future-oriented ties with Japan and how to promote 
favorable economic relations with China when he visit Tokyo and 
Beijing later this month. 
  With regard to a possible summit with North Korean President 
Kim Il-song, Kim said he did not know when it will be realized. 
But if it does, he hopes to discuss problems including peace 
and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as well as 
inter-Korean economic cooperation. 
  On North Korean military provocation, Kim said he could not 
rule out the possibility unless peace settles in Korea through 
mutual trust. South Korea is trying to change the attitude and 
way of thinking of the North Koreans through dialogue, Kim said. 
  Asked about a possible unification through the so-called 
"absorption formula," Kim said "it is not desirable, nor will it 
ever be a goal for South Korea."

  [Text] The Bosnian situation has entered a new phase 
because on 28 February Serbian and Croatian fighters attacked 
Muslin strongholds and U.S. Air Force planes under NATO command 
shot down Serbian fighters. 
  The Serbian and Croatian bombings are considered to be a 
"sort of challenge" to the United Nations, which has declared 
the skies over Bosnia a no-fly zone. The bombings may result in 
the international community's intervention and the escalation of 
the civil war. Everything depends on how NATO and the United 
Nations, which have recently warned that they would bomb Serbian 
areas, will respond to the bombings. 
  The skies over Bosnia has been declared a no-fly zone since 
last April: On 31 March, the UN Security Council adopted 
Resolution No. 816 declaring that no aircraft of the Serbian, 
Croatian, and Muslim groups, except for approved aircraft, can 
fly into the Bosnian airspace in an effort to prevent the civil 
war from spreading. 
  According to this resolution, NATO daily conducted 
reconnaissance in the no-fly zone. There have been 
approximately 7,000 flights so far, approximately 20 flights a 
day. 
  UN Security Council Resolution No. 816 says: "All Necessary 
measures can be taken against any aircraft illegally flying in 
the no-fly zone." This virtually means it is possible to shoot 
down such aircraft. The center of this reconnaissance mission 
code-named "Deny Flight" is the Vicenza U.S. Air Force base in 
northern Italy. Ten NATO member countries, including the United 
States, Britain, France, and Germany, have participated in the 
reconnaissance mission. 
  Fighters and reconnaissance planes based in the Vicenza base 
and other U.S. military bases and aircraft carriers have 
reportedly been flown for this mission, and a total of 4,000 
personnel, including pilots and technicians, are participating 
in this mission. 
  There have been approximately 250 violations of the no-fly 
zone. Serbs violated the zone most of the time, and this was the 
first time fighters violated the zone. 
  The downing of the Serbian fighters developed into a fierce 
exchange of fire between the Serbian army and the Muslim army of 
Bosnia, which took place a few hours later. This diminishes the 
prospects of a peaceful resolution of the Bosnian situation.

  [Text] Seoul, March 1 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government sent an application to United Nations 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali Monday to join the Basel 
Convention, which controls trans-boundary movements and disposal 
of hazardous waste. 
  South Korea will be regulated by the Convention from May 29, 
90 days after it sent the application, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  Under the Convention, signatories cannot trade waste matters 
with nonparticipants. If they want to export waste, they should 
receive written approval first from the country which imports 
the waste. 
  The Basel Convention specifies the kinds of waste matters to 
be controlled, and sets procedure of trans-boundary movements of 
the waste and ways to make a final disposal of the wastes in 
order to protect human health and environment. 
  As of now, 52 countries joined the Convention.

We plan to allow the exportation of general military supplies 
with the exception of heavy firearms such as howitzers." 
  This source revealed that currently there are no

  [Text] Kwangju -- Thousands of riot police stormed into 
two university campuses here early Sunday morning and arrested 
39 students, suspected of having instigated violent 
anti-government protests. 
  It was the first search of university campuses since the 
inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam's "civilian" government a 
year ago. 
  In the two-hour raids that began at 4:30 a.m., police failed 
to arrest leaders of "Namchongnyon," an organization of students 
in Cholla-namdo and Kwangju regions, but seized four-tons of 
leaflets, iron pipes, clubs, fire bombs and other demonstration 
items. 
  The student leaders are suspected of masterminding the raid 
on the U.S. Cultural Center in Kwangju last November and other 
protests. 
  Some 5,000 police troops were mobilized in the pre-dawn 
operation during which no violence broke out. 
  "The search was inevitable to uproot violent protests and to 
arrest students who led dozens of demonstrations even since the 
inauguration of the civilian government," a police spokesman 
said. 
  "We will put riot police into any campuses from the 
dimension 
of safeguarding law and order, if radical and violent protests 
are to take place in the days to come," he stressed. 
  Campus protests had almost died out last year under the 
influence of Kim's strong reform drive, but the government's 
decision to allow rice imports rekindled the students action 
against the agreement of the Uruguay Round talks. 
  Student leaders last month declared they would embark on a 
nationwide struggle this spring to support farmers in blocking 
rice imports.

  [Text] Seoul, March 1 (YONHAP) -- The nation observed the 
75th anniversary of the March 1 anti-Japanese independence 
movement in solemn ceremonies held across the country. 
  In a main ceremony at Sejong Culture Center in Seoul, 
President Kim Yong-sam conferred honors on nine independent 
fighters, including the late Pak Do-hyon. This brought the 
total number of independence fighters honored so far to 6,472. 
  The ceremony was attended by over 4,000 people, including 
National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sup, Chief Justice Yun Kwan, 
members of Kwangbok-hoe, the Korea Liberation Association, and 
relatives of fallen independence fighters. 
  On the 50th anniversary of the Liberation Day in August, the 
government will confer honors on newly found independence 
fighters in China, the United States and other countries. For 
this, the government will search for independence fighters, both 
alive and deceased, in the ethnic Korean communities in these 
countries.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Kim Yong-sam at the ceremony marking </F>
the 75th Anniversary of the Independence Movement Day at the 
Sejong Cultural Hall in Seoul on 1 March--live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Now we have a good opportunity 
to make a great national leap, and we should not miss this 
opportunity. We must increase the national competitive strength 
to stand out [potilsu innun] in the international arena. 
[passage omitted] 
  Only those countries that have enough competitive strength 
can become a genuine self-reliant and independent country in the 
limitless competitive age. 
  We should not stick to the past national sentiment. We must 
advance toward the future and the world, considering the past as 
a valuable lesson. [passage omitted] 
  Our ancestors said that they would not punish Japan for its 
past crimes nor condemn its acts, while they were protesting the 
pitiless colonial rule. They also said they would not try to 
satisfy their grudge accumulated in the past. They were right. 
We should cooperate with Japan in a dauntless manner 
[tangdanghage] with confidence and national pride, and we should 
also win the just and fair competition with it, without fail. 
[applause] 
  It is time for us to have a future-oriented view of history 
and to demonstrate our ripened national capacity. It is time to 
advance toward the world with a correct understanding of the new 
Japan, the new Asia, and the new world. 
  Dear 70 million fellow countrymen: 
  Without national reunification, the building of a 
self-reliant and independent country cannot be completed. The 
national division is a historic holdover from the past that must 
be cleared. Only when we destroy the wall of national division, 
will we finally be able to enjoy the true glory of the nation, 
and can we become a responsible nation that will make a greater 
contribution to the co- prosperity and peace of the world. 
  Reunification should be achieved in a direction going with 
the trend of world history. The world is moving toward an era 
of openness and cooperation, putting an end to the era of 
distrust and confrontation. 
  North Korea must realize that reform and openness is the 
only 
shortcut in making the nation one and guarantee the nation's 
welfare. [applause]

  [Text] The government decided to revise its national 
defense objective, which is a long-term policy directing 
national defense, by inserting a section on "contributing to 
world peace." 
  Until now, the government has only attached importance to 
contributing to security and peace in Northeast Asia because it 
regarded North Korea as its main enemy. The government has now 
expressed the will to also contribute actively to world peace. 
This is worth paying attention to. 
  A high-ranking Defense Ministry official said on 27 
February: 
"Our national defense goal is to `defend the country from an 
invasion, guarantee peaceful reunification, and contribute to 
regional security and peace.' We are actively examining adding 
a section on contributing to world peace." 
  As soon as such a revision is approved by the president, the 
Defense Ministry plans to insert this into the national defense 
white paper sometime this autumn. A Defense Ministry official 
commented: "The government has started to make great 
contributions in efforts to achieve world peace, such as 
dispatching our forces to Somalia upon the request of the United 
Nations last year. Our national defense goal has to be revised 
as it is limited to regional security and peace. Inserting a 
section on contributing to world peace in our national defense 
goal displays the growth of our national strength. This will 
also play a positive role in enhancing our international 
status." This official added: "Our government's military 
diplomacy will also be greatly enhanced through the revision of 
our national defense goal. In particular, through good 
neighborly military relations with other countries, we will work 
to take the initiative in achieving peace and security on the 
Korean peninsula."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea registered a 
current-account surplus in 1993 for the first time in four 
years. Nonetheless, the prospects for the coming year are not 
necessarily bright because imports are expected to increase 
sharply as economic growth speeds up and increasing foreign fund 
inflows will strengthen the won's value on the foreign exchange 
market. 
  Together with anticipated high inflation, these factors will 
in turn blunt the competitive edge of Korean products on world 
markets. In addition, the yen's continued strength, which has 
helped sharpen the competitive edge of Korean exports, remains 
uncertain in the coming year. 
  The Bank of Korea on Friday reported a current-account 
surplus of 450.3 million U.S. dollars for 1993, a striking 
reversal from the deficit of 4.528 billion dollars recorded the 
year before. A favorable trade balance and decreased 
remittances abroad thanks to the real-name financial transaction 
system are credited for the turnaround. 
  The surplus was the first since the 5.054 billion dollars 
recorded in 1989. In the four years from 1986, the nation had 
enjoyed a favorable balance of international payments thanks to 
the three lows -- low oil prices, low wages and a weak won. In 
the ensuing three years, however, South Korea suffered 
current-account deficits due chiefly to high wages and failure 
in industrial restructuring, with deficits of 2.179 billion 
dollars in 1990 and 8,727 million dollars in 1991. 
  In 1993, exports rose 7.8 percent to 81.023 billion dollars 
on a balance-of-payments basis and imports edged up 2.1 percent 
to 78, 946 million dollars to produce a surplus of 2,077 million 
dollars, compared with a deficit of 2,146 million dollars in 
1992. The favorable trade balance was attributed to a two-digit 
increase in exports of heavy and chemical industry products and 
an upturn in light industry exports. 
  The transfer account also recorded a surplus of 712 million 
dollars, up from 232 million dollars in 1992: Outward 
remittances fell from 1,744 million dollars in 1992 to 1,569 
million dollars as a result of the real-name financial 
transaction system, while inward remittances rose from 1,817 
million dollars to 1,825 million dollars. But invisible trade, 
including insurance and transportation, continued to suffer a 
deficit last year, though the amount fell from 2,614 million 
dollars in 1992 to 2,339 million dollars. 
  The transportation account incurred a deficit of 3.029 
billion dollars, while travel and investment-yield accounts 
suffered deficits of 589 million dollars and 1,339 million 
dollars, respectively. 
  So Pyong-su, a research economist at the Bank of Korea, 
predicted a current account surplus of up to 1 billion dollars 
this year, saying shipments of light industry goods and exports 
to advanced countries are emerging from the doldrums. 
  Increasing inflows of foreign capital on the strength of the 
economy's growth pace are feared to cause the won to appreciate 
in the foreign exchange market and this, together with uncertain 
price movements, makes it hard to make a reasonably accurate 
prediction for the coming year, he added. 
  In capital transactions, a surplus of 6,751 million dollars 
was registered thanks to rises in foreign fund inflows for stock 
investment, in overseas issues of corporate bonds and other 
debts and in short-term trade credit. 
  The central bank's foreign exchange holdings rose 3.11 
billion dollars to 20.26 billion dollars last year from 1992.

<F P=106> [By reporter An Yong-pae] </F>
  [Text] The controversy over Party President [PP] Yi's 
"New Line" gives advance notice that, after the regular session 
of the National Assembly, the Democratic Party [DP] will be 
plunged into a "hot battle" over the questions of an "early 
party national convention" and future party direction. Will the 
DP be victorious in its political agenda linking 
local-government [Chijaje], general and presidential elections? 
Will it succeed in taking office? We did a concentrated analysis 
of this question through interviews with the DP's next seven 
leaders: Yi Ki-taek, Kim Sang-hyon, Kim Won-ki, No Mu-hyon, Yi 
Pu-yong, Yi Chol and Chong Tae-chol. 
  Has DP president Yi Ki-taek actually begun full-scale 
mobilization in preparation the 15th presidential election? 
There has been no time since the last party national conference 
in which PP Yi has so captured the interest of the media and 
public. If one visits the PP Yi camp, one can feel an air of 
bustling activity somehow different than in the past. As 
expected, "public relations" concerning PP Yi's image are being 
carried out more actively than before and the level of the 
offensive against anti-Yi Ki-taek forces has gone up 
considerably. This began with Yi's talk with reports on 28 
September and his speech before the National Assembly on 27 
October. Out of these sessions came statements the media has 
named the so-called "New Line." It was about this time that he 
started to organize his own faction, the "Tongil Sanha Hoe." 
There has been no consistency in the series of statements and 
actions he has shown. This makes possible the analysis that 
behind it lies a calculated political foreshadowing in 
connection with his political agenda. 
  The spectrum of evaluations of the "New Line" is as varied 
as 
the number of factions within the DP. First to attack PP Yi's 
line, DP Co-President [Choego Uiwon] [CP] Yi Pu-yong asserts: 
  "If it were only the opinion of another co-president that 
might be okay, but for the party president to elucidate a new 
line and announce a party direction, the decision should pass 
through a process of debate in which many within the party 
participate. A party president must to collect the opinions of 
people disagreeing with him. If he makes a decision after 
listening to the opinions of only a few secretaries, can this be 
said to be an opinion representative of the party? I don't know. 
Apart from official meetings as party president with the party 
leadership or with lawmakers, he might have held one meeting to 
debate party line and policy. In a situation like this, he 
suddenly comes out calling this the new line. It's difficult to 
understand." 
  Some are drawing attention by presenting their opinion that 
"joint responsibility" for this lies with the media also. CP No 
Mu-hyon interprets, "It doesn't appear that the new line was 
decided upon after systematic study. It is essentially an 
exaggerated expression used of a speech and a few statements by 
PP Yi. (The media) created this name because it is material for 
new articles." The sentiments of non-mainstream lawmaker Kim 
Sang-hyon are more cynical. "I don't know what the New Line of 
PP Yi is. His line is constantly changing. It may be more 
accurate to say he has no policy line. The expression that the 
old line was the liquidation of the past and the new line is 
heading toward the future is not even worth debate. Can there be 
a future-directed blueprint without a settlement of past issues?" 
  On the other hand, PP Yi's defense is not easily refuted. 
  "In their speeches, successive political party presidents 
have stressed politics, economics, security, and society, in 
that order. In my speech, however, I gave more time to, and put 
greater stress on economic issues, rather than political ones. 
They seem to have given it the name `New Line' because they 
think it a different perspective than in the past. I'm proud 
that the party set up this future-oriented policy line one step 
ahead of the government and ruling party. For example, after I 
finished my address to the National Assembly, many of my close 
friends said: The 21st century and the future are the exclusive 
property of the government and ruling party. What are they going 
to do if you occupy them first? But this doesn't mean I'm going 
to be lax about settling the problems of the past. It's my 
philosophy that, without it, there can be no reform either. I'm 
merely suggesting that in our agenda, we work on them both 
simultaneously." 
  That there cannot but be sharp differences in 
"interpretation" over one policy line clearly shows us one 
aspect of the DP's problems. Anyway, whether the "controversy" 
caused by PP Yi is a clever move resulting from a changed heart 
or a bad move made after a long time spent in thought, it 
appears that judgment on it will be made after the regular 
session of the National Assembly with the evaluation of the DP's 
parliamentary activities. The "New Line" controversy and 
questions about PP Yi Ki-taek's leadership ability are related 
to each other, like two sides of a coin. The give and take is 
functioning to elevate the whole controversy, dragging this 
question of leadership into the arena of full-scale criticism. 
Most questioned PP Yi aggressively. "There is a lot of criticism 
that, as the party president, he is only able to exercise 
one-ninth of the leadership." 
  PP Yi's answer was also unexpectedly aggressive. 
  "The talk that I'm only exercising one-ninth of the 
leadership is correct. That's the way the party constitution 
sets things up. According to the party constitutional system, I 
represent the party as one of nine representatives. I've lead 
the various meetings smoothly in these circumstances, without 
breaking any dishes. Does it make any sense to say that I have 
no leadership ability? I'm leading the way both in reform and in 
settling the issues of the past. In the struggle against the 
ruling party too I'm doing as much as anyone else. Is there any 
other opposition figure who severely criticizes the Kim Yong-sam 
government, both in public and in private, as much as I do? 
Personally, I don't think it's right for me, the party 
president, to stand out so vehemently. It bothers me that I'm 
leading like this. Shouldn't the co-presidents of the party 
leadership aggressively lead for me? Shouldn't the party 
president be the last card played?" 
  There are many holding the opposite opinion. "I don't 
believe 
this is a result of the group leadership system," said Rep. Yi 
Chol, diagnosing the problem, "It's because most of those in the 
leadership are hastily taking care of their own interests." CP 
Yi Pu-yong's attitude is a little more serious. "I think the 
limits of PP Yi's leadership ability were seen a lot in the 
regular session of the National Assembly. I figured that if his 
leadership was displayed in the regular session of the National 
Assembly, the most important item on the political agenda, then 
he would have no problem for the remainder of his term. 
Recently, however, it is my honest feeling to doubt whether 
during the regular session of the National Assembly we can 
effectively make it through the complex political situations 
with PP Yi's leadership ability." 
  There are also those holding reserved positions. Rep. Chong 
Tae-chol thinks, "For an evaluation of his leadership ability, 
we need to give him a one-year grace period." However, "There do 
seem to be problems with the nine-man group leadership system 
and with PP Yi's leadership ability, such as the loss of timing 
for a decision on party policy because party policy is being 
changed all the time," he added cautiously. Some insist that 
consideration must be given for the historical nature of the DP. 
"Some of what is being said is not entirely unfair. Criticism 
is deserved on things such has the reshuffling of party 
officials and his inability to return the party to normal after 
the national convention," says CP Kim Won-ki, acknowledging a 
leadership problem. He added, however, that "there is one thing 
to be considered: in the past, there was the charismatic 
authority of former party president Kim Tae-chung, in which all 
power was concentrated. When he suddenly retired, this changed 
into a system of group leadership. Side effects are occurring in 
a situation in which this system has been unable to become fully 
established." 
  Regardless of whether questions are raised concerning PP 
Yi's 
leadership, most feel that there must be change in the present 
leadership system. Opinions differ, however, on whether it 
should be a group leadership system or a system of sole 
leadership by one man. CP No Mu-hyon: "We have to go to a single 
leadership system. The transitional period is now past. If we 
get a single leadership system, the number of co-presidents 
won't be important." He insists that if the group leadership 
system is maintained, its number must not be reduced below the 
seven members stipulated by the party constitution. This is 
because he believes that if it is changed to have five members, 
even only three of them could form against the others, so if the 
desire is there it would be easier to achieve illicit alliances. 
CP Chong Tae-chol thinks, "Even a single leadership system is 
okay." Only, in this event, "the party president definitely must 
have the capacity to assemble the party's divided, complex and 
diverse factions." 
  There are also many who prefer a group leadership system 
somewhat different from the present one. CP Yi Pu-yong: "Since 
we have to go through several elections, a single leadership 
system with group characteristics is desirable, giving more 
authority to the party president while reducing the number of 
those in the supreme, decision-making structure." "Because the 
system is too diffuse and complex, the number of co-presidents 
needs to be reduced," says CP Kim Won-ki, "But, as yet, a group 
leadership system is still desirable." It is only that the party 
president must demonstrate more leadership, he says. Rep. Kim 
Sang-hyon also prefers a group leadership system. "Although a 
single leadership system has its strong points, without 
leadership ability it will be just the same. If the party moves 
in a uniform, undemocratic way, it could actually become 
inflexible. In the case of a single leadership system, because 
of the practice of appointing a vice president in particular, in 
the event the president has no leadership ability, there is a 
high probability that he would only appoint someone from his own 
faction, causing even greater problems. In that case, the party 
could even be broken up." PP Yi Ki-taek and Rep. Yi Chol hold 
reserved positions, saying that the two systems both have good 
and bad points. 
  There are presently various issues disputed within the DP, 
but the "hot potato" into which all confrontation is condensed 
is, as expected, when the next party national convention will be 
held. The national convention is the place where all factions 
within the party stake their survival, hoping to provide a 
candidate for the next presidential election or hoping to make 
use of the opportunity to increase their influence. The question 
of when it will be held cannot help but be fluid because it is 
linked to the local-government agenda and other events scheduled 
to be implemented next year. Because the "calculations" of each 
faction change according to the time of the convention, they are 
conducting unseen preparations for a secret struggle over the 
selection of the time. Of interest here is the fact that the 
non-mainstream group challenging the party presidency is 
actually less interested in an early national convention. 
  Defeated by a narrow margin in this challenge for the party 
presidency during the last national convention, Rep. Kim 
Sang-hyon says, "I have no intention to demand that the national 
convention be convened early. If in the election-law negotiation 
process we come to an agreement, so that local government can be 
implemented after May, 1995, there won't be any big problems. I 
bring up the problem of Yi's leadership ability, but this is a 
call to amend the party line. I'm not saying that we must 
immediately change the 2-year term party president. I think it 
would be best to hold the party national convention normally, in 
1995." However, that does not mean that he is unconditionally 
opposed to an early national convention. It is undesirable to go 
beyond reason in opposing it, he says. 
  CP Chong Tae-chol opposes this as a general rule. However, 
"If all agree to the need to prevent a situation in which we 
would be faced with local-government elections with an 
ill-equipped party, actually divided since it hasn't been long 
since the last national convention, we could hold an early 
national convention unrelated to the issue of the party 
leadership," he says. "I understand the situation within the 
party, but I don't agree with an immediate opening of an early 
convention due to interests limited to internal party problems," 
says CP Kim Won-ki. Because the public must be convinced that 
"those actions are appropriate, given the circumstances," "It 
seems that we'll have to pass the first half of next year to 
know what we're going to do about the question of an early 
national convention," he adds. 
  On the other hand, controlling the party leadership, PP Yi 
actually shows a relaxed attitude. "Originally, the next party 
national convention is, because of my term of office, supposed 
to open in May, 1995. To effectively prepare for the 
local-government elections, we must put the party organization 
in order at least five to six months beforehand. There is talk 
in the government and ruling party that the local-government 
elections will be held in January or February of 1995, but, 
anyway, if it's of help to the party, there is no need to 
withhold support for proposals to hold the national convention 
during the latter half of next year. Just before next year's 
regular session of the National Assembly would be good too." 
  CP Yi Pu-yong hopes more aggressively for an early national 
convention. "Objective conditions are driving this, unrelated to 
anyone's intentions. There is no way we can carry out 
local-government elections with this sort of leadership system. 
Interlocked with the Democratic Liberal Party's [DLP] next 
national convention, local-government elections, etc., I feel 
that the question of reorganizing the party leadership after the 
regular session of the National Assembly is unavoidable." 
  CP No Mu-hyon explains the situation within the party, thus: 
"Because it is not a question of only dynamic relationships 
within the party, we must be careful about an early opening of 
the national convention. This is because we must do an 
integrated study of the issue, including changes in the ruling 
party, the economic situation and the DP's public image. At 
least, a feeling held in common by both mainstream and 
non-mainstream groups is that we must not do anything that might 
ruin the party's image or might cause the party damage because 
of its leadership." Many aspects of this consensus, however, are 
due to non-mainstream efforts to prudently avoid exposure to 
accusations of just carrying on an in-house fight to gain the 
party presidency. 
  If the DP is going to go for an early national convention, 
then it will have to be held before or after next year's regular 
session of the National Assembly. Regardless, it will have no 
choice but to enter into a national-convention phase next year. 
In connection with this, it is as yet difficult to predict what 
form will be taken by the complex alliances for or against the 
main group. "What's important in the party national convention 
is influence and popularity. Unlike the DLP, in which President 
Kim Yong-sam controls the territory held by each faction, in the 
DP the indiscriminate acquisition of influence is more important 
that anything else," according to the analysis of one young 
lawmaker. 
  "Presently, the KT (PP Yi Ki-taek) and DJ (Kim Tae-chung) 
alliance makes up over 40 percent of the party, securing close 
to 50 percent of the `influence.' For now, the mid-liners and 
non-mainstreamers may make up over 50 percent, but if the KT-DJ 
alliance can draw in only a part of these, the competition is 
over. For example, all that remains is the question of 
partnership: Will the mainstream alliance get CP Kim Won-ki's 
camp or will it get the reform group? The posture of the 
mainstream is reserved, however, because there is no need for it 
to decide on a partner now, making many enemies early. The 
various factions within the party are adopting wait-and-see 
postures, still not drawing clear battle lines, because they 
know too well the fact that if they fail here, they will 
experience great difficulty in securing a share of influence 
within the party." 
  This analysis is convincing only if one accepts the premise 
that the alliance between PP Yi and Tonggyo-tong [Kim 
Tae-chung's group] will continue in the future. Let us listen to 
more of what he has to say. "The KT-DJ alliance is in effect 
because of joint interests in maintaining the status quo. If 
this alliance falls apart, there is a high probability it will 
lead to great confusion and could even end in the party breaking 
up. Furthermore, if they go with an early national convention, 
it will naturally be held before next September, because they 
cannot hold a party national convention while the regular 
session of the National Assembly is being held. Then, it will 
immediately follow the close of this session of the National 
Assembly. Another partnership is unlikely to be achieved during 
that period of time." 
  However, there are many who view the alliance between the Yi 
camp and Tonggyo-tong as a temporary structure, soon to be 
cleared away. Having a particularly close relationship since the 
previous generation with former party president Kim Tae-chung, 
CP Chong Tae-chol says, "I personally heard it directly, on 
several occasions," that, "[Kim Tae-chung's] relationship with 
PP Yi is his keeping a promise to help him for about a year," 
and, "Concerning the party candidate for the next presidential 
election, his thought is that the most capable person will win." 
CPs No Mu-hyon and Kim Won-ki have similar thoughts on this. 
"This is because his apparent backing of PP Yi does not mean 
that his relationship with those he previously supported has 
suddenly become shallow," according to the interpretation of CP 
Kim Won-ki. Also, "To interpret with fixed concepts each action 
of those [Kim Tae-chung] had normally been close to, saying that 
they do what they do because a button was pressed in 
Tonggyo-tong, is too much of an exaggeration," he points out. If 
their views are correct, then we cannot hastily judge the 
balance power within the party in a fixed way. Also, then, the 
situation is inevitably fluid. 
  Concerning yet another variable, rumors of a return to 
politics by former party president Kim Tae-chung, responses are 
generally negative, although there are differences in nuance. 
The words of Yi Ki-taek: "Shouldn't we believe the words of Kim 
Tae-chung himself? Aren't we in a third-person position? 
Believing is a virtue." CP No Mu-hyon: "I believe this taking 
someone who said they were quitting politics and, without any 
grounds to do so, calling him a liar and making up various 
things about him is no more and no less than a plot by people 
trying to make the DP appear to be a regional party with no life 
of its own." One lawmaker close to PP Yi asserts, "As for this 
talk about DJ returning to the front lines of politics, an 
attempt at making the image stick that the DP is still DJ's 
party, although the party president is now KT, leaves one with 
the strong impression that it is for preventing the desertion of 
DLP supporters, particularly the middle class, and those from 
the Taegu and North Kyongsang Province regions." 
  Concerning the opposition's chances of taking office during 
the 15th presidential election, many stress that most external 
factors provide considerably good conditions for this. It will 
not be easy for the Kim Yong-sam administration to resolve the 
economic crisis and the presidential-candidate "cards" capable 
of being played by the DLP are not too powerful, it is judged. 
Many argue, however, that to make the most of this good 
opportunity, there must first be "radical reform" within the DP. 
"We must have no more people, as at present, with declining 
public support and who, too concerned over the shape of things 
in the party, abandon their own districts. We must no longer put 
out ridiculous candidates in some districts, because of 
factional interests, who then loose, as in the recent special 
election. For the overall development of the party, we need 
fundamental reform and a reshuffling of personnel," says Rep. Yi 
Chol. One co-president even confessed, "A full-scale reshuffling 
of the chairmen of district chapters is needed for the reform of 
the DP. But because if this were elucidated, it would mean the 
end of vote management in the party national convention, it's 
difficult to openly talk about it." 
  It is safe to say that the next local-government elections, 
general election, and presidential election are all one 
political agenda. This is because the results of each election 
are predicted to have a large, in some cases decisive influence 
on the next election. Rep. Chong Tae-chol gives this 
prescription. "Beginning now, we need to select candidates in 
preparation for the election of local-government leaders 
[tanchejang songo] and through competition to highlight the 
public images of at least the candidates for leader of 
large-area local governments [kwangyok chachidanchejang]. The 
painful experience of the last election, for which we had no 
good candidates, must not be repeated. Together with the Honam 
region, we must win at least in Seoul, Kyonggi Province and 
Inchon, be evenly matched in Chungchong Province and Taejon, and 
publicize in Kangwon Province, North Kyongsang Province and 
Taegu, if we are going win in the general and presidential 
elections." 
  The runners to take part in the relay race, the grand finale 
to take place in 1997 are now catching their breath. It is still 
uncertain who will run the base line as a representative 
contestant for the DP. Only in the first heat, the next party 
national convention will his profile slowly begin to appear. 
After the close of the regular session of the National Assembly, 
each team will be looking to those around them and will enter on 
an all-out quest for candidate competitors to participate in the 
preliminaries, a competition surpassing that of the college 
entrance exams. One thing is clear, however. The circumstances 
have now changed. Just as the conglomerates are shouting 
management reform in order to survive, the DP must be successful 
in its reform of opposition political culture in order to enjoy 
the thrill of gaining the pennant of victory in the end. The DP 
on the night before the big meet. As if to forecast the arrival 
of a storm, the waves are gradually beginning to rise on its 
quite waters. 
  Yi Ki-taek Interview 
  Criticism for Lack of Leadership Ability Ridiculous 
  [Interviewer] Many questions are being asked about your 
leadership ability both inside and outside the party. 
  [Yi] People are too often saying I lack leadership ability. 
I 
can't accept this. There are no perfect politicians. I too have 
faults. About this, however, I think it is a problem of the 
whole party rather than my own problem. To be blunt, if I had no 
leadership ability, how could I have been student committee 
chairman in high school and college during my school days? 
Selected as a member of the National Assembly at 29, how could I 
have become secretary general at 39, even though there capable 
seniors above me, and vice president of the party at 42? In 
politics, you have to watch your timing. Just as you can 
accelerate if needed, you've got to have flexibility in dealing 
with things. It's ridiculous to say you lack leadership ability 
because you are a little late. 
  [Interviewer] They say you have no general principles in 
your 
management of the party. 
  [Yi] I made three promises as I became party president. I 
said that I would make the DP a democratic party, a science 
party and a policy party. The DP has been so democratically 
managed that lawmakers directly selected the floor leader, a 
field-army commander. We made the party scientific by, for 
example, managing it according to budget accounting principles. 
During the last parliamentary inspections, in our handling of 
policy inspections we so established our position as a policy 
party that there are no dissenting opinions on this. A party 
president must take responsibility for bad results, but 
shouldn't the credit for these desirable changes also be given 
to him? They only question my leadership ability with no mention 
of this. I have no choice but to view this as a coin toss, an 
argument just for argument's sake, because I'm leading the way 
with no other political defects. 
  [Interviewer] It is said that former party president Kim 
Tae-chung's influence on the DP is still too great and that one 
of your greatest bases of support is the Tonggyo-tong faction. 
  [Yi] It is a fact that in actuality, former PP Kim Tae-chung 
plays the role of a fence of the DP and has enormous influence 
in the party. They ask whether the DP isn't too dependent on 
him. Since he is to me a senior opposition politician and a 
political leader whose influence is acknowledged worldwide, 
isn't it natural that I respect and not neglect his opinions? 
And I think former PP Kim's position is neutral. I have a good 
relationship with the Tonggyo-tong faction because I have had 
deep ties with CP's Kwon No-kap, Han Kwang-ok and others, 
because we are close and have worked together for a long time 
and because we achieve easy harmony on problems of running the 
party and National Assembly. 
  No Mu-hyon Interview 
  Advocating Leadership by "Next Generation of 
Runners" 
  [Interviewer] You introduced the "Next Generation Runner 
Debate." 
  [No] It's saying that it would be desirable for CPs Chong 
Tae-chol, Yi Pu-yong and the others, with PP Yi, to hold a 
competitive selection in the great battle to take place during 
the party national convention. The only large group within the 
party capable of taking PP Yi is the Honam faction. The DP must 
first of all come up with a plan capable of overcoming the idea 
that it is a "Honam party." Also, to create the image of a party 
capable of producing a candidate much more novel than Rep. Pak 
Chan-jong, regardless of people's positions for or against the 
party leadership, discussion of the next generation of leaders 
cannot help but come up in the next party national convention. 
In the battle between PP Yi and the next-generation candidates, 
the public will begin to see a new DP image. A "color 
confrontation, rather than regional confrontation" will been see 
as a fresh image by the public. We must carry out the 
local-government, general and presidential elections in this 
context if we are to have a chance of winning. 
  [Interviewer] Concretely, who do you support? 
  [No] I'm helping CP Yi Pu-yong. 
  [Interviewer] What will be your role in the future political 
agenda? 
  [No] If there is competitive selection in the party national 
convention, no middle way will exist. Some talk about roles 
divided among three persons. I don't have a role. You can't call 
supporting someone else a role, right? I have work to do, but no 
position. 
  [Interviewer] In connection with CP Cho Se-hyong becoming 
director of the Local Government Working-Level Research Center 
[Chibang Chachi Silmu Yonguso], many understand this to be not 
unrelated to the future political composition. 
  [No] This was done out of an intention to improve the image 
of the research center and get actual help, while excluding the 
tendency to view research centers as means for individual 
political maneuvering. It has nothing to do with political 
preparations. 
  Yi Pu-yong Interview 
  DP in Need of Reform Groups 
  [Interviewer] You are openly putting the brakes on PP Yi's 
policy line. 
  [Yi] Taking the long view, we must gain tangible results in, 
for example, changing or abolishing immoral laws, for there to 
be less of a burden on the DP. How will we handle public 
criticism of the DP if we end up only playing the best man in 
this? Even though we get some criticism from the conservative 
media right away, we need to highlight disputed points of the 
National Security Law, Agency for National Security Planning 
Law, Communications Secrecy Protection Law, etc. PP Yi's new 
line avoids the formation of issues to dispute. We need to 
highlight points of dispute and secure these, if for nothing 
else than as important assets for gaining support for the DP and 
for preparing for the local-government elections. A clear, 
strong tone in the DP would also for the benefit of PP Yi 
himself. This is because, rather than coming undone at 
accusations of insubstantial leadership, to gain tangible 
results for securing democratization, liberalization and a 
foundation for unification would be to take on the form of a 
genuine, 21st-century leader. 
  [Interviewer] There are also those who view with misgivings 
the image of reform groups within the party. 
  [Yi] I have determined not to hold dual membership in 
another 
faction while belonging to a reform group. I plan to participate 
in a more organized way in party-line-related discussion groups 
in the future. This must not happen, and probably won't, but 
even people who ridicule and are unhappy with reform groups will 
need them in the DP to get themselves elected in the next 
elections. Isn't it difficult to imagine a DP without reform 
groups? 
  Yi Chol Interview 
  Make All Party Management Public 
  [Interviewer] What is your reason for saying the party has 
no 
principles? 
  [Yi] Official meetings such as the party executive committee 
and party general meetings have almost become nominal. There are 
even times when, in the case of the executive committee, 
meetings are not held because of the party president's personal 
schedule. The party platform has to be decided in the party 
executive committee. But only the co-presidents' council 
[choegouiwon hoeui] is held; conflicting opinions are processed 
and spit out without being made into conclusions. In the 
selection of party officials, etc., they are only concerned with 
dividing the spoils in the next convention, thus exposing the 
chaos of the party. As a result, among party lawmakers and party 
members, there is almost no consent to party decisions or mood 
of confidence in the future. 
  [Interviewer] Could you point out some concrete problems 
which have appeared? 
  [Yi] A representative example would be the selection of 
party 
officials after the party national convention. This should have 
been done fairly, but after being put off for five or six months 
and selection principles being reversed several times, it ended 
in an unprecedented dividing of the spoils contrary to the party 
constitution and regulations and even the rules of the personnel 
selection committee. Completely unknown figures whose past it is 
impossible to know suddenly occupied important positions. There 
was even a case in which body guards were placed in positions 
requiring special expertise. When I protested this, PP Yi 
responded, "Doesn't someone have to guard documents and protect 
offices?" While implementing the budget, some of the leadership 
pay not a cent in party fees. Also, with personal interests 
involved, important districts and the position of standing 
committee chairman go to totally unqualified people. In short, 
things are happening which go beyond common sense. In the 
future, all aspects of party management will have to be made 
public: financial problems, the party-platform decision process, 
the deliberation process of the Chogang [no Chinese characters 
were provided in the text so I was unable to determine the 
correct English translation] special committee, etc. 
  Chong Tae-chol Interview 
  More To Gain Than Lose From an "Opposition Merger" 
  [Interviewer] There is strong opposition to an "opposition 
merger." 
  [Chong] The opposition must band together in an anit-Kim 
Yong-sam line. Absorption merger, Hosokawa-style merger, 
whatever its form, it would be better to unite, than not to 
unite. This is to say that in order to win in our political 
agenda headed toward the presidential election, our fundamental 
principle is that we must unite, to include everyone from the 
opposition lawmakers to those out of office. If this is done on 
the premise of mutual concession, substantial compromise is 
possible. I know that there is opposition to this composition 
within the party, but it will be difficult to take office in the 
next presidential election if we cannot overcome the confusion 
in setting up an opposition candidate. I also meet personally 
with Pak Chan-chong, Kim Tong-kil, Yi Chong-chan and others. 
Although some won't tell their position on this, basically, they 
want to join the DP. 
  [Interviewer] Some insist that it would be best to quickly 
select a candidate to run in the presidential election. 
  [Chong] There is a greater probability that making our 
candidate visible now will have adverse effects. It's desirable 
that he come to the fore on his own through the competitive 
process after the party national convention. 
  [Interviewer] Are you thinking of running in the next 
election? 
  [Chong] There as been no change in my intention to take a 
shot at the presidential election. But for this, you have to be 
chosen by the people and by heaven, and there has to be a 
possibility of winning. To be honest, who comes out of the DLP 
is also important. 
  [Interviewer] How do you view the idea of separating the 
party presidency and presidential candidacy? 
  [Chong] As a general rule, the party presidency and 
presidential candidacy must go together for their strength to be 
amplified. This is a natural phenomenon, but, there's nothing 
wrong with dividing roles if it is warranted by conditions at 
that time. 
  Kim Wong-ki Interview 
  Little Possibility of Reform in Political Sector 
  [Interviewer] What do you think of the "Three-Way 
Role-Division Debate"? 
  [Kim] It seems to begin in the critical mindset that there 
has to be new leadership. With only one (of either established 
politicians or those out of office), we are unlikely to gain 
public support. To go in a reformist direction, but pursue 
stability in keeping with the current of the times, we have to 
acquire the support of those with whom we are friendly. I am 
mentioned along with CPs No Mu-hyon and Yi Pu-yong because, 
while an established politician, due to my duties I have often 
played the role of mediator in my contact and cooperation with 
politicians not in office and been involved in a lot of dialog. 
What is important here, however, is not who is being discussed, 
but our strategy for getting in office and the issue of party 
direction for forging ahead without stagnating. 
  [Interviewer] How do you view the issue of reorganizing the 
political sector, about which there has only been a great deal 
of talk so far. 
  [Kim] Only looking on the outside, the fact that we cannot 
go 
on like this is felt by all in the DLP as well. Just judging 
from the DLP lawmakers I have contact with, few in the DLP think 
of it as "my party." Just because President Kim Yong-sam says he 
wants to create a new situation, as though the prominent 
behavior of lawmakers is problematic, doesn't mean that it all 
works out 100 percent as he wants. For example, if the number of 
active lawmakers were small, it would be difficult for them to 
execute policy as they should. But it is difficult at present to 
follow his formula closely. Because politics are variable, an 
attempt at change will be made, whether it is temporary or 
gradual. Given the present circumstances, the probability of a 
reorganization of the political sector with the DP as a partner 
is not very high. In a government-led reorganization of the 
political sector, if DLP lawmakers consider possible gains and 
losses when it has gone in the ruling party's direction, few of 
them will judge there to be much actually to be gained from it. 
  Kim Sang-hyon Interview 
  Someone Should Run in Kim Yong-sam's District 
  [Interviewer] What political culture must the DP improve? 
  [Kim] To prevent the weakening of district chapters and open 
a way for fresh personalities to participate, passing through a 
vote in which over 300 representatives participate, the total 
number of members of the National Assembly and candidates for 
local government must gradually increase. Things are difficult 
with the present regulations calling for over 50 persons. Also, 
the list of representatives must be made public at least ten 
days ahead of time and candidates must be given an opportunity 
to contact them. Taking as an example the experience of the last 
party national convention, representatives came up unknown to 
even the deputy chairmen and head officials and several hundred 
letters sent out to representatives were returned, even the 
district chapters did not know their addresses. 
  [Interviewer] Is the "Shared Roles Debate" still in effect? 
  [Kim] Inasmuch as no opposition party has ever gained office 
through a direct election, democratic forces must take office in 
the next election at all costs. This idea suggests that the 
Honam faction play the role of kingmaker. The Honam faction 
takes control of party leadership and a non-Honam faction 
provides the presidential candidate. Anyway, I'm saying that I 
won't break up things in order to become president. We can also 
put forward fresh a personality as presidential candidate. If I 
become party president, I have a strategy and plan for winning 
in the next presidential election. For example, the party 
president chosen in the next national convention would run in 
President Kim Yong-sam's Pusan district. Whether or not he wins, 
he must get publicity. Because we must win in the 
local-government and general elections to be victorious in the 
presidential election, the party president must lead the way, 
bearing the cross and showing the public a responsible posture. 
Even if the party president, one man, looses, it could be a good 
opportunity for stirring up a DP wind. 
  [Interviewer] Who do you think of as possible 
next-generation 
leaders? 
  [Kim] We can count on Chong Tae-chol, Yi Pu-yong, and Yi 
Chol.

  [Text] Commenting on the Thai-U.S. talks on a double 
taxation protocol, Director General of the Revenue Department 
M.R. Chatumongkhon Sonakun said the department is summing up the 
results of the talks, held in early February, for Finance 
Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin. Mr. Tharin will discuss several 
unresolved issues with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
during the APEC meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, on 19-20 March. 
The director general said he hoped that a conclusion could be 
reached and that no more official negotiations would be 
necessary. Anyway, he realized that it is difficult because 
there are several sensitive and complicated issues left to be 
tackled. 
  M.R. Chatumonkhon said these partly came from the failure of 
Thai officials negotiating with the U.S. side, which demanded 
more than the Thai could grant. Another problem deals with 
rigid regulations the U.S. side wanted to put into the protocol, 
whereas the Thai side wanted something more flexible. 
  A source at the Revenue Department said that there are 
several points left for negotiations concerning the protocol. 
He said the United States wants advantages over Thailand, 
whereas the matter itself is very complicated. A still 
unresolved important issue is about taxation on benefits. The 
United States has a special service set up for financing housing 
loans. The United States defended this as helping people to own 
homes. Thailand, meanwhile, wanted its BIBF [Bangkok 
International Bangking Facilities] covered by the double 
taxation protocol, but the United States disagreed. 
  According to the source, there are unsettled issues 
concerning copyrights, such as import tax rates of U.S. 
copyrighted movies for distribution in Thailand. Thailand 
requested a rate reduction; there was no agreement on this. 
Anyway, there is no problem about purchasing real estate. 
  The U.S. Government attached importance to U.S.-Thai 
negotiations on double taxation. The matter was taken up for 
discussion during U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's visit, 
and there was an agreement to hold official negotiations as soon 
as possible. As a result, there were talks in mid- February, 
but it yielded no clear-cut solution. Finance Minister Tharin 
Nimmanhemin is expected to discuss the problem with Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen during the meeting of APEC finance 
ministers pending further official talks in early 1994.

  [Excerpts] Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and foreign 
minister, asked Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri, in his capacity as the chairman of the ASEAN Standing 
Committee, to use last November's Seattle meeting of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] as a model for an APEC 
meeting to be held in Bangkok next year. The Chinese Government 
is satisfied with this although Taiwan sent an economic affairs 
official to participate. 
  Qian Qichen and his delegation left Don Muang Airport at 
1600 
yesterday for Sri Lanka. After seeing Qian off at the airport, 
Foreign Minister Prasong briefed reporters on their talks. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Thai foreign minister said that he had asked Qian to 
repeat the House Foreign Affairs Committee's invitation for the 
Chinese National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee to 
send a delegation to Thailand at an appropriate time. The 
Chinese delegation postponed its trip to Thailand following 
Taiwan President Li Teng-hui's visit to Thailand. Foreign 
Minister Prasong also asked Qian to convey a repeated invitation 
by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin to visit Thailand at an appropriate time. Foreign 
Minister Qian said that he will pass Thailand's goodwill to 
relevant authorities. 
  Prasong also said that he will send an official invitation 
to 
Qian and his wife Zhou Hanqiong to attend the annual ASEAN 
foreign ministerial meeting in Bangkok in July. 
  Prasong said that although Qian's stopover in Bangkok was 
short and there was a problem concerning the Taiwan president's 
visit, the two sides had reached a good understanding following 
a frank exchange of views. The Chinese did not see the issue as 
obstructing good relations between the two countries. This is 
only a phenomenon in the long-standing good relations between 
the two countries. Thai-Chinese cooperation in the political, 
economic, and trade fields will be further developed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The First Accomplishment of the Government"] </F>
  [Text] It is good news for everyone that the Thai 
Government recently implemented a policy of pushing leaders of 
minorities from our neighboring countries out of Thai territory, 
as these people were using Thailand as bases for armed struggle 
against those governments. 
  This good news has been attested to by the report on 
requests 
by the Thai military for the police to arrest Lao General Vang 
Pao, accused of having built a clandestine headquarters on Thai 
territory to wage war against the Lao Government and Mon 
generals who used strongholds on Thai soil to lead rebellion 
against the Burmese Government. 
  This is a good omen because it indicates that Thailand is 
readjusting its foreign policy in line with the global trend. 
Formerly, Thailand used areas under the control of minority 
rebels as buffer states to maintain distance from the neighbors 
and used them as a shield against external aggression. 
  The Thai Government has come to realize that some of our 
neighbors, although they may pursue different political systems 
or be under the rule of a military regime or a single-party 
system, are all pressured by internal forces to open their 
economies for free trade. It does not matter how Thailand 
manages to profit from more economic and trade ties with 
neigbors, but the point is that it must first revise its policy 
in dealing with them. 
  NAEO NA believes that as long as there are rumors about the 
presence of minority rebels on Thai soil, suspicion and hatred 
from neigboring governments will continue to linger. In other 
words, Thailand will certainly lose to third countries the 
opportunity to benefit from open markets in their neighbors. The 
ongoing readjustment of the Thai Government policy is indeed 
correct.

  [Excerpts] Mongolia plans to apply to join the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) within three years, the 
visiting Minister for External Relations Tserenpilyn Gombosuren 
said yesterday. He believed joining the regional grouping would 
stimulate the development of his country, which switched from a 
socialist system to democracy in 1990. "Our external relation's 
interest is to join Asean within three years, but it depends on 
the agreement of Asean members," Gombosuren told THE NATION. 
  Gombosuren is accompanying Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn 
Ochirbat on a three-day official visit which concludes today. 
In talks with Prime Minister Chuna Likphai, Ochirbat raised his 
government's interest in joining Asean, attending the Asean 
Regional Forum and joining the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(Apec) forum. [passage omitted] 
  "We can see in Europe and North America that regional 
organizations play a vital role in stimulating political and 
economic development," said Gombosuren. "We feel this kind of 
cooperation is very important. We do not have to copy it, but 
take it as an example and develop model suitable to our region." 
The minister said his government has attached great important to 
this visit--the president's first trip abroad -- because 
Thailand is a country with an outstanding record of success in 
social and economic development. 
  In a joint statement issued at a press conference in 
Pattaya, 
both sides agreed that the Asia Pacific region and the world 
have now moved into a new era in which countries enjoy 
much-improved relationships and greater cooperation. They also 
recognized the trend toward regional consolidation and peaceful 
resolution of disputes and that an unprecedentedly favourable 
environment now exists for both bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation among countries in the region.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry is to propose the government 
pay the 79.2 million baht cost of building the Thai-Burma 
Friendship Bridge, Government House sources said yesterday. 
Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri is to put the proposal to the 
Cabinet at its meeting on Tuesday, the sources said. 
  The proposal is that 39.6 million baht be allocated for the 
purpose from the fiscal 1994 budget and 39.6 million baht from 
the fiscal 1995 budget. Both allocations should come from the 
Highways Department budget. The bridge is to be built over the 
Moei River to connect Mae Sot district, Tak province with 
Myawaddy town in Kachin state. The proposal has been approved by 
the Budget Bureau and the Finance Ministry, sources said. 
However, the ministry said Thailand should have full rights 
over the bridge and the collection of tolls. 
  The secretary-general of the National Security Council, 
Charan Kunlawanit, wrote to the Cabinet approving the 
Thai-financed construction of the bridge. Interior Minister 
Chawalit Yongchaiyut backed the project in a report to the 
Cabinet, saying the area around the proposed bridge is a 
"temporary passage" between the two countries which should be 
upgraded into a "permanent" one, sources said. 
  It should be made clear whether goods transported over the 
bridge can reach Rangoon, because those that go over the 
Tachilek passage point in Mae Sai district, Chiang Rai are only 
allowed to be transported as far as Chiang Tung [Keng Tung] town 
in Shan state, he said. 
  Defence Minister Gen. Wichit Sukmak wrote in his report to 
the Cabinet that the the bridge will benefit both countries and 
will not affect security, sources said. 
  The project was initiated by the Chatchai Chunhawan 
government when his cabinet adopted a resolution in its favour 
on August 1, 1989. The Foreign Ministry was to set up a 
committee to study the issue and seek capital from the UK, Japan 
and other countries. The estimated cost of the bridge in 1989 
was 60.5 million baht.

  [Text] The Bank of Thailand has decided to stick to the 
policy of controlling surplus liquidity in order to maintain the 
credit expansion of 21 percent as planned. Roengchai Marakanon, 
deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand, said on Thursday night 
that the economy was showing signs of strong and rapid revival. 
To avoid overheating, the central bank has therefore decided to 
further control excess liquidity so that the projected 21 
percent credit expansion can be achieved. The strong growth is 
partly attributable to the export growth of last year and this 
year, which is likely to surpass all expectations, Mr. Roengchai 
said. 
  Last month's annual export value increased by 15.6 percent, 
while the target was set at 14.6 percent. This indicates quite 
definitely that the economy will grow by not less than 8 percent 
this year, he said. 
  Mr. Roengchai added that the financial system will be tight 
in the short term, depending on the spending of the public 
during certain periods. In these cases the central bank will 
accommodate through the extension of short-term loans. If, on 
the other hand, there is excess liquidity, the Bank of Thailand 
will adopt absorption measures, some of which may include bond 
issues by government enterprises such as the Bank for 
Agriculture and Cooperatives. 
  In the long rung, however, Mr. Roengchai said he believes 
that the liquidity excess will be lower than last year but not 
to the level of tight money thanks to the remaining capital 
inflows, particularly in non-resident baht accounts and in the 
Stock Exchange of Thailand. 
  The outflow experienced during last month did not even reach 
5 percent of the total capital inflow of last year which stood 
at 280 billion baht he said. 
  Although deposits have risen 17 percent to 18 percent while 
credits have expanded more than 21 percent, the financial market 
will not be tightened. This is because commercial banks can 
mobilize foreign funds from abroad, he explained. Consequently, 
the central bank must follow the situation closely to ensure 
adequate liquidity and to avoid overheating resulting from an 
excess in credit expansion (more than 21 percent) and high 
inflation (higher than 4 percent). 
  It is vital to control inflation at the projected level as 
it 
plays a very important role in fostering the competitiveness of 
Thai exports. Malaysia, for example, has inflation of as low as 
3 percent, Mr. Roengchai said.

  [Begin Somchai recording] So far, 849 projects have been 
approved by the NESDB. Out of this, 512 projects will be 
launched in provinces. The investment capital of over 73 
billion baht will create jobs for some 100,000 people. However, 
the 73 billion baht is about 30 percent of the total investment 
capital of the projects that received the NESDB approval last 
year. Most of the projects deal with agriculture. [end

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Summit of Parties in the Government"] </F>
  [Text] There is a sign that the present government is not 
doing very well. Prices in the stock market have fallen since 
the beginning of this week, while stock prices in the foreign 
stock markets have not gone down. Experts in the stock business 
point out that apart from the outflow and withdrawal of foreign 
capital invested in Thailand for profit-taking, another reason 
for the drop of the stock index could be the present political 
situation, which does not look so good. Such a situation makes 
investors reluctant to remain in the market. 
  This kind of attitude seems very possible, because since the 
beginning of the new year there have been observable conflicts 
among the parties in the coalition government. 
  A clear case is that the Phalang Tham Party has tried to 
bring up the issue of developing decentralization of 
administration through the election of provincial governors -- 
an issue that the Democrat Party, a core in the government, does 
not agree on. Strong verbal, irreconcilable conflicts have 
ensued between members of the two parties, although compromises 
were possible. 
  Another case is the conflict between the Democrat and 
Solidarity Parties. The leader of Solidarity tried to dismiss a 
permanent secretary on a charge that he failed to meet popular 
demands. In fact, that is actually the job of the head of that 
ministry. 
  These two cases make the people feel that there is a high 
possibility that these two parties may no longer be able to get 
along with each other in this government. At the same time, 
there have also been extensive rumors that the Democrat Party 
has approached at least two opposition parties that have enough 
seats to ensure the government to continue its national 
administration and made offers for them to join the government. 
  Regarding this news--which reflects government instability, 
it is strange that the Democrat Party, and particularly its 
leader Chuan Likphai, have neither shown any reaction nor any 
tendency to correct or improve the image of the government. It 
looks as if Chuan is content to let problems prevail until the 
government collapses because of withdrawal of parties in the 
coalition. This contradicts his actions in the early days of 
the government, when the prime minister had to reach compromises 
among the coalition parties whenever problems arose or 
misunderstandings occurred. 
  We do not want to see rumors turn into reality by letting 
parties in the government withdraw and inviting an opposition 
party to join the coalition in an undignified manner. We want 
to see leaders of all the parties in the present government hold 
a meeting to discuss guidelines for solving problems or to 
clearly make adjustments. All this is to ensure public 
confidence that the government remains stable. 
  The prime minister should no longer remain indifferent and 
let the situation resolve itself. This method of playing 
politics will only cause the country as a whole to suffer more 
losses. We want to see him move urgently on this matter. Do not 
just threaten that if a government party pulls out, no 
opposition party will be invited to join, but parliament would 
be dissolved instead. Such a statement is just a threat, not 
proper for a core party in the coalition government. While the 
democracy-loving people hope to see this government last its 
full four-year term, we wonder what has happened to the prime 
minister and why he has remained so indifferent.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 KYODO -- A seven-member inspection 
team arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday to resume inspections of 
North Korea's seven declared nuclear facilities after a lapse of 
more than a year, informed sources in Beijing said. The 
inspections are expected to take about two weeks. 
  The team members, led by Olli Heinonen, left Beijing earlier 
in the day, where they arrived on Monday from Vienna. North 
Korea agreed to the inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) on Friday in New York at a working-level 
meeting with U.S. Officials. 
  North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear 
sites in 1992, but threatened to pull out of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty last March when pressed to allow checks 
of two undeclared facilities suspected of being related to a 
clandestine nuclear arms development program. Inspections of 
the six declared facilities in the Yongbyon nuclear complex, 
some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang, and one site at Kim 
Il-song University in the North Korean capital are expected to 
get under way Wednesday. The inspections, however, will not 
include the two undeclared sites suspected of being nuclear 
waste storage facilities that could reveal the nature of the 
North Korean nuclear program. 
  IAEA inspectors have said that to make the checks meaningful 
they would have to examine the nuclear fuel rods to determine if 
plutonium, which could be used in the manufacture of an atomic 
arsenal, had been extracted. 
  The issue of inspecting the two undeclared sites at Yongbyon 
and examining the nuclear fuel rods has been left to the next 
round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang, 
which according to North Korean officials is scheduled for March 
21 in Geneva. 
  Meanwhile, Pyongyang rejected a South Korean request on 
Tuesday to reopen the inter-Korean dialogue, proposing instead 
to meet Thursday at the border truce village of Panmunjom. In 
response to the delay, the South Korean Government held off its 
decision to cancel the "Team Spirit" U.S.-South Korea joint 
military exercises. 
  Reopening the inter-Korean dialogue and calling off the 
military exercises had been half of a four-item agreement 
reached February 25 in a working-level meeting in New York 
between U.S. and North Korean representatives. The agreement 
had been reached to ensure IAEA inspectors access to the North 
Korean facilities. 
  Although Pyongyang had agreed with the IAEA on February 15 
to 
permit the checks, it held back issuing the necessary visas to 
the inspection team and demanded that a date be set for a third 
round of high-level talks with the U.S. 
  Following the meeting in New York, North Korean 
representatives said that the third round would open March 21 in 
Geneva, but Washington is insisting that Seoul-Pyongyang talks 
on the exchange of special envoys be initiated first. North and 
South have agreed to make the Korean peninsula nuclear- free, 
but North Korea has insisted that the issue can only be resolved 
through a bilateral dialogue with Washington.

<F P=106> ["Fool's Confession and Subterfuge" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam's utterances at a "press conference" on February 25 
were marked by an appeal, confession and poor excuse regarding 
the failure of his policy towards the North and "reforms" over 
the last one year, says MINJU CHOSON in a commentary today. 
  It is the admission of the mistake of his policy toward the 
North that the traitor Kim Yong-sam mumbled something incoherent 
as if he would bring about a "change" in the North-South 
relations, the analyst points out, and goes on: 
  Nevertheless, the puppet blared he would set the "nuclear 
issue" as a precondition for the North-South relations in the 
future, too. This cannot be construed otherwise than a mode of 
thinking of a fool who is still dancing to the tune of others, 
without his own principle. 
  It is the United States which invented "suspicion of nuclear 
development by the North" and is posing a nuclear threat to the 
DPRK after bringing nuclear arms into South Korea. Such being 
the case, if the puppets want a solution to the nuclear issue, 
they must not obstruct the DPRK-U.S. talks but demand the 
withdrawal of the U.S. nuclear weapons from South Korea. To set 
the fiction of "nuclear issue" as a precondition of the 
North-South relations is tantamount to a declaration that they 
will go along the road of confrontation and war, provoking us, 
this year, too. 
  The puppet told a lie to mislead public opinion when he 
talked about "summit talks", suspension of the "Team Spirit" 
joint military exercises and "joint economic development". 
  He driveled that he had devoted his "body and soul to the 
promotion of changes and reforms" for one year, expatiating on 
"trouble" and "efforts". South Korea, however, remains a 
colony ruled by outside forces and the military dictatorship has 
turned into a more intelligent "civilian" dictatorship in this 
period. 
  Branding the struggle of the people for independence, 
democracy and reunification as illegal, the puppet threatened 
that he would not "allow" it and prattled that he would accept 
"criticism and advice". This revealed his intention to resort 
to double-dealing tactics of repression with bayonet and 
appeasement and deception. 
  The "press conference" has proved once again that with the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam left alone, it is impossible to solve the 
internal problems of South Korea or the North-South relations. 
  Such fool as the traitor Kim Yong-sam must be removed at an 
early date not only for the independence and democracy of the 
South Korean society but also for the acceleration of the 
reunification of the country through the improvement of the 
North-South relations.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The national 
agricultural conference now in session here marking the 30th 
anniversary of the publication of the rural theses is reviewing 
with pride the achievements made in the implementation of the 
theses and discussing the tasks to bring socialist rural 
construction to a higher stage. 
  But, South Korea is witnessing a vigorous struggle of the 
farmers who suffered a crop failure due to flood and drought 
last year and are now deprived of their means of livelihood due 
to the Kim Yong- sam group's opening of the rice market. 
  South Korea's agriculture is in a serious crisis due to the 
anti- popular agricultural policy of the authorities. Last year 
South Korea was hit by the worst crop failure in ten years. 
According to data released by the "Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries," the output of rice was 606,000 tons 
less than the previous year. 
  In South Korea, which was once called a bread basket, the 
self- sufficiency rate of grain is on a steady decrease with a 
crop failure every year. The rate was 80.5 percent in 1970, and 
it dropped to 2 percent after 1981. 
  Meanwhile, the amount of annually imported grain jumped to 
12 
million tons from 5.05 million tons in the 1980-1992 period. 
  The ever-worsening crisis in agriculture and food forces an 
increasing number of farmers to leave the countryside. 
  Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique declared the 
treacherous rice market opening in December last year. When it 
is put into practice, the amount of imported grain of South 
Korea will grow to 15 million tons sooner or later and the 
self-sufficiency rate of grain will drop below ten percent. Two 
to three million more farmers will leave the countryside, the 
devastation of the rural areas will be precipitated and the 
socio-economic conditions of the working people as a whole will 
go from bad to worse.

<F P=106> ["Base Misrepresention of DPRK's Developing Economy" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The United States, 
Japan and the South Korean puppets are reportedly getting 
overheated in spreading rumors about the "economic crisis" of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with the mobilization 
of their paid media. 
  They are grossly misrepresenting the situation of our 
developing socialist economy by abusing the communique of the 
21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Central Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea on the fulfilment of the Third 
Seven-year Plan (1987-1993). They allege that "North Korea is in 
a serious condition, undergoing enormous trials for its failure 
to attain the targets of industrial production" and "its 
self-sufficiency in food has come a cropper from a long ago." 
  This is an intolerable distortion of the invincible might of 
the socialist economy of the DPRK, which is vigorously advancing 
along the road of independence and self-reliance, unaffected by 
whatever fluctuation of the international situation and of our 
reality in which all the people of the country fully enjoy an 
abundant material and cultural life. It is also a despicable 
political propaganda offensive to isolate and stifle the DPRK. 
  As was reported by the afore-said communique, we made a new 
great progress in all sectors of the socialist economic 
construction during the Third Seven-year Plan in spite of the 
collapse of socialism in the former Soviet Union and other 
European countries, the disappearance of the world socialist 
market and a chain of other international events and changes in 
the complicated external environments. 
  In this period, the industrial output jumped 1.5 times and 
its average annual growth rate reached 5.6 percent in our 
country. 
  The power, coal and non-ferrous metal ore output increased 
respectively 1.3, 1.4 and 1.6 times, with the result that the 
nation's material and fuel bases have been expanded and 
strengthened. 
  The steel output increased 1.3 times and all the sectors of 
the machine-building industry rapidly developed to achieve a 
great progress in the mechanization, automation, robotization 
and computerization of the production processes. 
  The output of chemical fertilizers went up 1.5 times, their 
qualitative composition was further improved and solid 
foundations for the completion of the chemicalization of 
agriculture have been laid. 
  A great progress was also made in light industry to bring 
about a new turn in the production of consumer goods. 
  Garment, food and daily necessities industries rapidly 
developed, locally-controlled industrial factories were updated 
and dependable local raw material bases built, with the result 
that the local industrial output jumped 1.7 times. 
  In agricultural domain, 10,400 kilometres long waterways 
were 
excavated and more than 12,400 pumping stations and 192 
reservoirs were built. 
  The amount of chemical fertilizers applied to agriculture 
was 
raised 1.4 times and their qualitative composition improved. 
  In our country where the objective of ten million tons of 
grain was attained already in the '80s, irrigation, 
electrification, mechanization and extensive use of chemicals 
have been realised and farming has been placed on a scientific 
and technical basis as required by the chuche method of farming 
to reap a rich harvest every year. 
  In fisheries, more than 1,100 fishing boats including stern 
trawlers of 3,750 tons and above were built and fishing boats 
and fish processing facilities briskly modernized to further 
consolidate the material and technical foundations of fisheries. 
  In the period, Kwangbok and Thongil Streets took shape and 
more than 100,000 modern flats were built in Pyongyang, which 
means that residential houses for more than one million families 
were built in towns and rural communities of the country. 
  Our people are leading a happy material and cultural life, 
enjoying free medical care, free education and other socialist 
benefits, without worries about food, clothing and housing. 
  The consolidation of our socialist economic and material 
foundations and the considerable improvement of the people's 
living clearly prove the invincible vitality of our independent 
national economy, which is developing on the basis of the chuche 
idea, unaffected by the imperialists' economic blockade and the 
worldwide fluctuation. 
  Nevertheless, the media serving the imperialists are 
zealously spreading rumors about our "economic crisis," 
motivated by a foolish attempt to undermine the external 
authority and prestige of our Republic, tar the image of 
Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses and crush 
the hope and confidence of the world progressive people in 
socialism. 
  They must look squarely at the unshakable will and faith of 
our people, give up the foolish dream of stifling our Republic 
and promptly stop the anti-DPRK false political propaganda.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- The Central 
Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front 
(Hanminjon) published a manifesto on February 23 calling upon 
the South Korean people to check and frustrate the moves of the 
U.S. imperialist aggressors and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous 
group who are bringing dark clouds of nuclear war on the pretext 
of the fictitious "nuclear problem of the North", the 
Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported. 
  The manifesto branded Kim Yong-sam, a pro-American sycophant 
traitor and warmaniac, as a war servant driving to the extremes 
in the van the crisis of a war that might impose more hideous 
national calamities than the tragedy of national division upon 
the Korean nation which has been subjected to national 
misfortunes and hardships, falling a victim to the games of 
outside forces. 
  The basic target of the anti-war, anti-nuke struggle is the 
U.S. aggression forces, it says, stressing the need to kindle 
fiercer flames of the national-salvation struggle cross South 
Korea for the withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression 
forces trying to force a nuclear war and their nuclear weapons 
under the banner of anti-U.S. independence. 
  It also calls for further expanding the struggle against Kim 
Yong-sam, a dyed-in-the-wool pro-American sycophant traitor and 
heinous war fanatic. 
  The manifesto stresses: 
  The "suspected nuclear development of the North" is a 
fiction 
invented with the wicked intention of finding an excuse for 
blocking a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula, 
increasing the tensions there and unleashing a war against the 
North. 
  All the people who really love the country and the nation 
and 
want national reunification should reject the fiction of 
"suspected nuclear development" of the North, oppose the 
campaign for pressure on the North and decisively rise in 
struggle to smash the scheme for "international cooperation 
system", a treacherous act of dependence on outside forces, 
transcending the difference in ideology, idea, system and 
affiliation. 
  The anti-war, anti-nuke struggle with main stress on the 
anti-U.S., anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle can be crowned with a 
brilliant victory only when it is developed into a mass struggle 
involving all the classes, strata and forces opposed to war and 
aspiring after peace.

<F P=106> ["Japan Must Liquidate Her Past Crimes First" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
reactionary ruling quarters must properly liquidate her past 
wrongdoings including the crimes in the case of the "comfort 
women for the army" first by quickly and honestly fulfilling 
their obligations under the international law, before talking 
about Japan's "international contribution" and hankering for "a 
seat of permanent member of the UN Security Council", says 
NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today with regard to the 
fact that the question of dealing with Japan's crimes against 
the "comfort women" has been put on the order of the day 
recently in the international arena. 
  Recalling that delegates from different countries, regions 
and international organizations to the recent 50th meeting of 
the UN Commission on Human Rights strongly urged Japan to 
approach the settlement of the "comfort women" issue with a 
sincere attitude, the article says: 
  It is an undeniable fact that the Japanese Government is 
obviously under obligation to take a legal action against those 
involved in the crimes against the "comfort women" and make 
compensations to the victims. It is an open secret that the plan 
of the "comfort women" system was worked out and carried into 
practice by the Japanese military and government in the past. 
  Nevertheless, none of those involved in the crimes against 
the "comfort women" has so far been punished in Japan. 
  When the international opinion including those drafted as 
"comfort women for the army" came in demand of punishment of 
those responsible for it, the Japanese authorities tried to 
avoid it under this or that pretext. 
  They allege that those chiefly responsible for the crimes 
against the "comfort women for the army" cannot be punished 
because Japan has no domestic law on the trial of the "crimes 
against humanity" and the period of prescription is past. 
  This is an open evasion of their obligations under 
international law, a shameless mockery of and insult to those 
drafted "comfort women" and human conscience. 
  Facts fully show that the Japanese authorities have no 
intention to admit and liquidate the past crimes, the anti-human 
crime of sexual enslavement in particular. 
  It is impermissible for the arrogant Japan which has no 
regard for the international law to take a permanent seat in the 
United Nations Security Council.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- A document of the 
International Fellowship of Reconciliation (IFOR) concerning the 
"comfort women" issue was distributed as an official document of 
the 50th meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights. 
  The document recalls that at the UN sub-commission on 
prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities held 
in August, 1993, Japan admitted to the war-time enslavement of 
"comfort women" by the Japanese Army and Government. 
  The facts admitted by Japan belong to such paragraphs as 
expulsion, enslavement, inhumanity and political and racial 
oppression, crimes against humanity, it says, adding that 
prescription does not apply to the acts of the Japanese Army and 
they must be punished by international law. 
  It says Japan should therefore take necessary measures for 
the punishment of those responsible for the above-mentioned 
crimes. 
  Recalling that in 1932 Japan signed the convention on forced 
and compulsory labor which was adopted by the International 
Labor Organisation in 1930, the document notes that the present 
government should still be obligated for punishment under the 
convention. 
  The criminal acts against "comfort women" should have been 
punished by the then Japanese "law", too, the document says. 
  It stresses there cannot be any prescription with Japan's 
obligation under the international law. 
  It calls attention to the fact that Japan has not yet 
punished the criminals who had inflicted sufferings upon the 
more than 200,000 "comfort women for the army". 
  Noting that Japan still refuses to admit that the acts 
committed against Asian "comfort women", mostly Koreans, 
recrimes, the document says such an approach is a disgraceful 
insult and discrimination against the Asian women. 
  The document points to some matters, urging the Japanese 
Government to take all measures including legislature, 
investigation, trial and punishment and make adequate 
compensations to all the "comfort women for the army" so as to 
fulfil its obligations under the international law regarding the 
punishment of those responsible for the criminal acts committed 
against the victimized "comfort women".

<F P=106> ["Japan Held Responsible for `Comfort Women for Army'--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- Different delegates 
made speeches with regard to the question of the "comfort women 
for the army" at the 50th meeting of the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights. 
  The delegate of the Third World Movement Against the 
Exploitation of Women said Japan had failed to take effective 
measures to compensate the "comfort women for the army" and the 
United Nations must take steps for the punishment of the 
criminals and an adequate compensation to the victims. 
  The delegate said that to this end, a step should be taken 
immediately to set up an international court and establish an 
international arbitration tribunal so that the Japanese 
government may deal with suits brought by victims. 
  The delagate of the World Council of Churches said Japan had 
not admitted that it was its legal obligation to make an 
adequate compensation to the "comfort women for the army" but 
merely repeated that it felt responsible for its crimes. 
  He said the World Council of Churches demanded that the 
United Nations Commission on Human Rights put pressure on Japan 
to punish the criminals and compensate the victims. 
  The delegate of the International Fellowship of 
Reconciliation said that if the Japanese law was not enough to 
punish the criminals involved in the issue of the "comfort women 
for the army," Japan must enact another law to discharge its 
obligation according to the international law and that the 
organization had presented recommendations to the Japanese prime 
minister to enact a "law for punishing the war crimes and crimes 
against humanity and other crimes in view of the international 
law." 
  Noting that Japan, however, punished none of those 
responsible for the criminal acts against more than 200,000 
"comfort women for the army," he stressed that though the 
Japanese government was trying to hush up the crime, it could by 
no means evade its responsibility.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- People for Nuclear 
Disarmament, an anti-nuke organisation of Australia, sent 
letters to Russian and Japanese ambassadors to Australia some 
time ago in protest against the dumping of a large quantity of 
nuclear waste in the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific by these 
countries. 
  The letter to the Russian ambassador said that the 
irresponsible acts in throwing 900 tons of nuclear waste from a 
nuclear submarine base near Vladivostok into the East Sea of 
Korea on October 17, 1993 are arousing deep apprehensions among 
the Korean people and their neighbouring countries. 
  The nuclear waste poses a grave threat to the health and 
existence of the peoples of Korea and neighbouring countries, 
the letter said, urging a stop to the dumping of nuclear waste 
in the sea for the stable life of mankind and for the protection 
of the ecological environment of the sea. 
  The letter to the Japanese ambassador recalled that Japan 
started dumping radioactive substances in the sea from 1955 and 
had thrown 1,661 200-litre drums packed with venomous wastes 
into surrounding seas in the period from 1959 to 1969. It 
strongly urged an immediate halt to such dangerous acts.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- World political and 
public circles continue expressing support for the statement 
released by a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning a solution to 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Chairman of the British-Korean Friendship Parliamentary 
Group 
Robert Parry said in a statement on February 6 expressed deep 
concern over the fact that at a time when a prospect of a 
solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was being 
opened through the DPRK-U.S. talks, the U.S. hardline 
conservative forces were overruling the DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement and the agreement reached late last year and bringing 
the situation to a hopeless phase. 
  He urged the British Government not to join in the anti-DPRK 
campaign launched according to the script written by the United 
States, taking into account the possible unfavorable effect on 
world peace and security of the catastrophic situation created 
by the reckless moves of the U.S. hardline conservative forces. 
  The Asian Regional Committee for Supporting Korean 
Reunification released a statement on February 7 denouncing the 
United States for reinforcing its Armed Forces in South Korea 
and its neighbouring countries in a bid to stifle the socialist 
system established in Korea. 
  It called on the world people to condemn the U.S. moves 
against the DPRK. 
  Chairman of the Scientific and Technical Association of 
Tanzania S.J. Mabulla, in an interview with the KCNA 
correspondent in Dar-es-Salaam on February 2, demanded that the 
United States promptly stop forcing a comprehensive inspection 
on the DPRK and presenting a military threat to it, solve the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through negotiations, 
withdraw its nuclear weapons and troops from South Korea and 
discontinue large-scale nuclear war exercises for good and all. 
  He called on the international community to strive hard to 
check the [word indistinct] on big [words indistinct] peace and 
reunification of the country. 
  The Belgium-Korea Solidarity Committee in a statement on 
February 9 said that to finally solve the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula and create a favorable climate for the 
independent and peaceful reunification of Korea depended 
entirely on the U.S. attitude.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- Malian President 
Alpha Oumar Konare and Equatorial Guinean Prime Minister 
Silvestre Siale Vileka, when they met with the DPRK ambassadors 
some time ago, expressed support to the just cause of the Korean 
people. 
  The Malian president voiced support to the proposal for 
national reunification clarified by his excellency President Kim 
Il-song, saying he stands behind the principled stand of the 
DPRK to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Equatorial Guinean prime minister said that the United 
States is resorting to all intrigues to stifle the Governments 
of Equatorial Guinea and Korea on the pretext of non-existent 
"human rights issue". This is part of its moves to stifle 
non-aligned countries, he added. 
  He noted that the struggle of Korea to defend its 
sovereignty 
fully accords with the interests of non-aligned countries. 
  Rigoberto Padilla Ruz, general secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Honduras, when he received 
the DPRK ambassador to Nicaragua on February 22, said that the 
proposal for reunification through confederacy advanced by the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is the most realistic and just 
overture. He said he would always extend support and solidarity 
to the Korean people in their struggle for the reunification of 
the country.

vigorously in the countryside of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea over the past three decades to register proud

use of chemicals to a high stage, turning the countryside into 
an earthly paradise of the people. 
  The all India Indo-Korean Friendship Association, too, 
published the work in booklet.

for the ultimate solution to the socialist rural question.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- An Indian national 
seminar of journalists on the chuche idea and the role of mass 
media in the era of independence was held in New Delhi on Feb. 
17 under the sponsorship of the All Indian Association of Young 
Journalists, Intellectuals and Writers and the All Indian Chuche 
Research Institute of Journalists to mark the 20th anniversary 
of the proclamation of the programme of modelling the whole of 
society on the chuche idea by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  A congratulatory message from the minister of state for 
external affairs of India to the seminar was conveyed, and a 
congratulatory speech made by ex-Indian President Giani Zail 
Singh. 
  In his speech, he said the chuche idea founded by the great 
leader his excellency President Kim Il-song is an idea brightly 
illumining the road ahead of the progressive people in the era 
of independence. 
  Korea is advancing triumphantly without any vacillation even 
when some socialist countries have collapsed and the imperialist 
pressure and blockade are intensifying, he said, adding: this 
is entirely because it is advancing under the banner of the 
chuche idea, the banner of self-reliance. 
  A reporter and speakers at the seminar said it is thanks to 
the sagacious guidance of the dear leader his excellency Kim 
Chong-il that the programme of modelling the whole society on 
the chuche idea is being carried out with success and the 
anthropocentric Korean- style socialism firmly defended in Korea. 
  Noting that the chuche idea is the basic idea of mass media 
in the era of independence, they evinced their resolve to more 
briskly conduct media activities to establish a new 
international information and communication order. 
  A letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted at the seminar.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song inspected the newly-built Gold Lane in 
Pyongyang on February 25. 
  He was accompanied by Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central 
Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea, and 
officials concerned. 
  Situated on a scenic bank of the River Taedong, the Gold 
Lane 
with a floor space of 14,300 square metres is a gymnasium of 
mass sports and cultural amusement. It has 40 modern bowling 
alleys, amusement rooms, sauna bathrooms, a restaurant, a shop 
and other service facilities. It is available for international 
games. 
  The gymnasium is associated with ardent patriotic devotion 
of 
traders and industrialists under the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon). 
  Going round it, President Kim Il-song expressed deep 
satisfaction over the fact that builders constructed the modern 
bowling gymnasium splendidly in a short time. 
  Noting that Kwon Yong-suk, a trader-manufacturer under 
Chongnyon, and her family did a good thing for the prosperity 
and development of the socialist homeland with a noble patriotic 
spirit, he highly appraised their patriotism and loyalty. 
  He gave instructions to manage and operate the gymnasium 
well, saying that it would greatly contribute to the cultural 
and emotional life of the Korean people, youth and students and 
promotion of their health.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Loboda, member of the CPSU since 1942: </F>
"People View Him as a Leader: A Few Words About Kim Chong-il"] 
  [Text] A great deal of information is published all 
over the world these days about Kim Chong-il. Certain circles do 
not stint on throwing a dark cloud over him and attributing to 
him characteristics that do not evoke anything likeable. 
  Who is he really, this person who has been placed in 
the highest positions in the Republic by the Korean Workers 
Party? Why do real communists look at him with hope and favor, 
and renegades with fear and loathing? 
  Enemies of socialism are frightened because Kim Chong-il, a 
strong person with principles, embodies socialist strivings and 
the decisiveness of the Korean people, and he is a true son of 
the Korean people. They are frightened that every practical 
activity and theoretical work by Kim Chong-il expresses 
socialist ideas and the greatest strength of the Korean nation. 
His image has imbedded itself deeply into the consciousness of 
Koreans and has become as beloved to them as the image of his 
father. 
  Foes are scared because in less than half a century the 
country, led by Kim Il-song, and in the last decades by Kim 
Chong-il, has become a reliable stronghold of socialism in our 
world. The invincible socialist system in the DPRK, a party that 
is true to communism, powerful armed forces, an impressive 
economy, and nationwide popular support of its leaders and a 
deep and sincere respect for them, have all become obvious 
facts. We see in the DPRK a new form of socialist organization 
for society and a country that has found its own road to 
socialism. Imperialists and their accomplices--renegades of 
every sort--are afraid of socialist Korea's influence on 
millions of people in this world. 
  Together with Kim Chong-il, a new generation is taking over 
the leadership of the party and the country. Kim Chong-il has 
devoted a great deal of effort in bringing up and educating this 
generation. This generation has a passion for action and a zeal 
for new undertakings. It is against routine, sluggishness, 
inertia, and indecisiveness. The energy and initiative of this 
new generation are blended with the rich experience, knowledge, 
and prudence of its predecessors. 
  History has given Kim Chong-il an enormous role, and at the 
same time a great responsibility, but not just for the future of 
his country. Pyongyang has become the center of unity for the 
world's socialist forces. The Pyongyang Declaration, which has 
already been accepted by over 200 political parties of the 
world, is having an ever greater influence over mankind. 
Everyone who has eyes can see how the forces of socialism are 
getting over the shock caused by the treachery of renegades, and 
how these socialist forces are growing in strength. Socialism 
now does not simply exist, but is fighting and winning. 
  All this explains the increased interest in Kim Chong-il. 
Neither blockades nor outright bans can hide the truth about 
this leader and his written works. Every honest person sees the 
image of a man for whom the happiness and well-being of his 
people are more important than anything else in the world. 
  From a very early age he devoted his life entirely to the 
cause of the revolution. In the quarter of a century since he 
finished his university studies, he has gone through all the 
stages of party organizational work and executive duties. He had 
started as a rank-and-file instructor in one of the departments 
of the Central Committee of the WPK [Workers' Party of Korea]. 
During these years he acquired a great deal of political 
experience. His family environment also facilitated his gaining 
this experience. 
  Kim Chong-il did not become simply a successor to his 
father, 
Kim Il-song, but the continuator of his father's 
deeds. He kept up the creative development of communist theory 
in accordance with the new conditions that came about as a 
result of changes in society and society's scientific 
achievements, including the achievements of the Korean people, 
who belong to one of the oldest civilizations. This is why it is 
unthinkable to separate Kim Il-songism, as a science, from its 
continuator, Kim Chong-il. 
  From the very beginning, Kim Chong-il attached great 
significance to moral education and to transforming all of 
society on the basis of the ideas of chuche. This was timely, 
not only because new tasks were arising in the process of 
building socialism but also because world imperialism was 
increasing its subversive work against the DPRK. In addition, it 
was necessary to make fundamental assessments of the activities 
of the renegades in the worldwide communist movement and to 
mercilessly expose the roots of this most harmful phenomenon. 
  Efforts made in political-educational work, and the 
consolidation of a united ideological system in the party and 
among the people brought tangible results. Communist 
consciousness was raised and the productive initiative of the 
workers increased. 
  Kim Chong-il has devoted many works to problems of ideology 
and the leading role of the WPK in ideology. It can be said 
about these works and their contents that they constitute a 
powerful attack against all forces of reaction, no matter under 
what false colors they are hiding. The correctness of the 
assessments and prognoses in these works has been confirmed by 
the entire course of development of both the DPRK and other 
countries. 
  As a writer, I understand and embrace Kim Chong-il's 
contribution of every art form to leadership. It is difficult to 
even enumerate all his important theses presented during 
meetings with employees of motion pictures, writers, musicians, 
and artists. Kim Chong-il comprehensively enlightened the roles 
of these people and the intelligentsia in general in the 
building of socialism. He charted an original course for 
completing a radical revolution that guaranteed the present 
flowering of artistry in motion pictures, literature, the stage, 
and concert halls. In Kim Chong-il's pronouncements, especially 
those given to motion picture employees, the following theses 
can be noted: Art should not fear an exaggeration of the good, 
so that this good can become even better. Also, art should not 
fear an exaggeration of a bad, depraved person, so that this 
exaggeration can evoke repulsion and ignite a striving to 
eliminate everything hateful and shameful. 
  Readers of Kim Chong-il's works are favorably impressed by 
the author's deep belief that by virtue of the objective laws of 
historical development, socialism cannot be destroyed by any 
alliances or blocs between renegades and imperialists. Day 
always triumphs over night. Kim Chong-il is convinced that 
gigantic forces are concealed within socialism, and that 
socialism is capable of creating the most just society about 
which the best minds of man have always dreamed. 
  Kim Chong-il's works also clearly demonstrate comprehensive 
understanding that in given circumstances certain things for 
which there is enough strength can be done and should be done. 
The leader of the Korean people has proclaimed himself 
uncompromising, he will not make concessions concerning 
principles and problems on which the fate of the nation and the 
success of socialism depend. It is not in his character to turn 
down plans that had been approved, no matter how difficult they 
may be. Kim Chong-il is convinced that every person, even one 
who believes himself to be weak, has hidden strength and 
potential. In order to bring them out, it is necessary for a 
person to understand that he has them, and it is necessary to 
motivate him with the all-conquering ideas of chuche. Kim 
Chong-il is characterized by the strength of his mind and his 
penetrating knowledge that allows him to quickly and faultlessly 
analyze events, tell the difference between people, and to 
assess everyone and use everyone in accordance with his 
abilities. He openly talks about shortcomings and errors, being 
convinced that the right way does not need to hide anything and 
does not need to distort facts. 
  And there is something else: Kim Chong-il expresses his 
thoughts in speaking and writing always in the most precise, 
direct, clear, and short form. His analyses are penetrating. His 
conclusions are based on facts. He expresses his thoughts 
simply, convincingly, and spiritedly. This is because Kim 
Chong-il frequently mixes with people from very different 
professions, acquiring from them the habit for this style. 
  Notwithstanding his immense popularity among his people and 
the respect given him in the DPRK, he has remained a modest and 
unpretentious man, fierce and implacable towards his foes, but 
touchingly attentive to his comrades and to working people. Kim 
Chong-il presents identical moral criteria to himself and to the 
rank-and-file. He believes that there should be no privileges or 
exceptions for anyone with regard to morality. 
  Kim Chong-il's theory and practice, based on the great ideas 
of chuche, are highly valued and approved by the world communist 
movement. He is seen as a true communist leader who is firm and 
independent, and who can resolve the most revolutionary problems 
out of all the problems that now face the revolutionaries of the 
world. Kim Chong-il is the hope not only of Koreans, but all 
other progressive peoples of this world.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
dedicates an article to the 20th anniversary of the publication 
of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's famous work "On 
Smashing the Outdated Pattern and Effecting a New Turn in Party 
Work." 
  The author of the article says: 
  The work is a highly important work which indicates a way of 
improving party work in a revolutionary manner to meet the 
requirement of the development of our party and revolution after 
the modelling of the whole society on the chuche idea had been 
pushed to the foreground. 
  The work clearly expounds the principled demand and concrete 
ways of effecting a new turn in party work such as the question 
of building our party into a vibrant militant party full of 
revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. 
  For the justness and truthfulness of the idea and theory 
contained in the work, the great vitality of the work has been 
displayed in revolutionary practice and it serves as a historic 
work which marked an occasion of a great turn in the 
strengthening and development of our party. 
  The great vitality of the work lies, first of all, that it 
made it possible to establish throughout the party a 
revolutionary system of working under the unitary guidance of 
the party centre. 
  It is the unshakable creed and absolute rules of action for 
our party members and other working people to do things as 
demanded by the party and think and act in accordance with the 
idea and will of the party. 
  The great vitality of the work also lies in that it filled 
the whole party with the revolutionary way of living and 
struggling with lusty vigour and enthusiasm. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: 
  "If a new turn is to be effected in party work, all the 
officials must shake off signs of decrepitude and make our party 
a vibrant party overflowing with revolutionary stamina and 
enthusiasm." 
  The trait of which our party members and other working 
people 
are proud is to boldly undertake any task to fulfil the plan and 
intention of the party, make a breakthrough and tenaciously 
carry it to accomplishment. 
  In the course of applying the idea and theory contained in 
the work, a radical turn has taken place in the work method of 
our party. 
  To always mix with the masses, grasp the actual conditions 
of 
the lower units, give them a substantial help and solve 
everything in reliance on the wisdom and creativity of the 
masses is the inherent work method and habitual mode of work of 
our officials today. With a great turn in the method of party 
work and the strict application of the revolutionary mass line, 
the consciousness and creative zeal of the popular masses as the 
masters of the revolution and construction have been immensely 
enhanced and a constant upsurge is being effected in socialist 
construction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song published the famous work "Theses on the 
Socialist Rural Question in Our Country," the chuche-based 
programme of socialist rural construction, on Feb. 25, 1964, and 
has wisely led the work to carry it into reality. 
  He visited many rural communities throughout the country to 
teach the officials of the rural economy and the agricultural 
working people how to do farming and manage the farms. 
  After the publication of the theses, President Kim Il-song 
convened national agricultural conferences and meetings of 
agricultural officials on scores of occasions and guided the 
agricultural working people to effect an epoch-making turn in 
socialist rural construction. 
  Vigorous efforts to implement the theses over the past 
thirty 
years resulted in the completion of irrigation and 
electrification of agriculture on a high level and fulfilment of 
the tasks of mechanization and wide use application of chemicals. 
  In recent years grand projects of harnessing nature, among 
them the building of the West Sea barrage and of waterways 
extending 800 kilometres in the western areas have successfully 
been carried out to complete the irrigation of agriculture at a 
high level. 
  28.7 percent of paddy and non-paddy fields had been 
irrigated 
before the publication of the theses. But all the cultivated 
lands in plain, intermediary and mountainous areas have been 
irrigated today. 
  Electrification of agriculture has also been completed on a 
high level. 
  In a few years after the publication of the theses 
electricity found its way into all the rural villages and 
cooperative farms of the country and to all the farm houses as 
lighting, power and heating energies. The annual consumption of 
electricity in the countryside today increased 8.6 times the 
1963 figure. 
  The task to mechanize agriculture has been fulfilled. Over 
the past thirty years the number of the tractors and lorries 
serving agriculture has increased 6 and 5 times respectively. 
Now all the farm work from ploughing to sowing, 
rice-transplanting, weeding, harvesting, threshing and transport 
are done with the help of machines. 
  The task of extensive application of chemicals to 
agriculture 
has been carried out. The amount of the chemical fertilizers 
supplied to each hectare was 300 kilogrammes in 1963 and it has 
shown a rise of more than two tons at present. 
  The output of grain has leaped 1.9 times the figure of the 
time when the theses was published, of which rice 1.8 times and 
maize 2.2 times. 
  With tens of thousands of public service establishments 
built 
in the rural villages, the farmers live without any worry. 
  Regular agricultural universities and colleges and farm 
colleges and study-while-you-work training centres of various 
forms for training technicians have been set up in provinces. 
  The number of the technicians and experts who serve for 
socialist rural construction has increased more than ten times 
the figure before the publication of the theses. 
  Ideal communist villages has made their appearance in 
Chongsan- ri, Kangso District, in Yongrim-ri, Mundok County, in 
Changdong-ri, Sukchon County, in Oguk-ri, Anak County, in 
Wangjaesan-ri, Onsong County, and other places of the country. 
  Houses built at the state expense have been distributed to 
the farmers free of charge, leaving not a person homeless. 
  Korea's countryside has turned into a modern socialist 
community and the standard of the farmers' living has reached 
the level of well-to-do middle peasants in the past days.

<F P=106> ["75th Anniversary of March 1st Popular Uprising </F>
Commemorated " -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting 
was held today to mark the 75th anniversary of the March 1st 
popular uprising. 
  The March 1st, 1919, popular uprising was an all-people 
resistance against Japan, in which the Korean people rose up and 
undauntedly fought to take back the country lost to the Japanese 
imperialist aggressors and restore national sovereignty. 
  In his report at the meeting, Chong Tu-hwan, Presidium 
member 
of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the 
Reunification of the Fatherland, said the uprising dealt a heavy 
blow at the colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists and had a 
great inspiring impact on the national-liberation movement of 
the oppressed peoples in colonies. 
  "It is 75 years since the participants in the uprising 
fought 
for independence, shedding their blood of patriotism, and it is 
nearly half a century since our country was liberated from the 
colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists, but their desire for 
independence and sovereignty of the country has yet to be 
realised nationwide," he said. 
  He said in South Korea under the military occupation by the 
U.S. imperialists, the people's demand for independence, 
democratic rights and even their elementary right to existence 
are ruthlessly violated. "South Korea remains a forward base of 
nuclear war because the Kim Yong-sam `regime' sticks to the 
anti-national policy of dependence on outside forces," the 
reporter said, and added: 
  "To establish national sovereignty in South Korea and 
reunify 
the country independently and peacefully is a noble cause of 
realising what the participants in the March 1st popular 
uprising desired and the supreme national task facing the entire 
Korean people." 
  He called on the South Korean people to launch a courageous 
struggle to overthrow the puppet government, saying that with 
the "civilian"-veiled traitor Kim Yong-sam left alone, neither 
the independence and democratisation of South Korean society nor 
the independent and peaceful reunification of the country can be 
expected and nothing but the scourge of war will be inflicted on 
the Korean nation. 
  He demanded that the United States renounce the policy of 
"strength" and approach DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere attitude 
in the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement, if it really 
wants to find a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  He urged the Japanese reactionaries to discard the foolish 
dream of gaining something from their involvement in the 
anti-DPRK campaign of the United States and the South Korean 
puppets and make a sincere apology and adequate compensation to 
the Korean people for their past crimes. 
  The meeting was attended by Yang Hyong-sop, alternate 
Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' 
Party of Korea and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- Papers here today, in 
editorials dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the March 1 
popular uprising in 1919, call on the compatriots at home and 
abroad to join in the struggle for smashing the moves of the 
separatists and reunifying the country with concerted efforts of 
the nation. 
  NODONG SINMUN says the thorough implementation of "10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country" put forward by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song is the key to making our nation repulse 
aggression and interference of any outside forces and accomplish 
the cause of national reunification in the '90s. 
  Noting that the desire of the March 1 uprisers to live in a 
land without aggressors and traitors has been realised only in a 
half of the country and the South Korean people are still 
languishing under the colonial rule of foreign imperialists, the 
paper says that if the country is to be reunified at an early 
date, it is imperative to achieve the great unity of the whole 
nation. 
  The paper continues: 
  Great national unity is never achieved by words. It is won 
and cemented when all the Koreans take a joint action by pooling 
their will and strength in the struggle for national 
reunification. All the political parties, organizations and 
compatriots of all strata in the North, South and overseas must 
keep pace and unite with each other organizationally for 
national reunification. The South Korean people must wage a 
relentless struggle to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam group, which 
is standing in the way of national reunification and trying to 
plunge the nation into a nuclear holocaust in league with 
outside forces. 
  The South Korean puppets must give up the foolish design to 
obstruct the country's reunification and slay the fellow 
countrymen in the North with the backing of outside forces and 
step down from power without delay as unanimously demanded by 
the people. 
  MINJU CHOSON demands that the United States renounce the 
moves to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea over the "nuclear issue" and keep to and implement the 
principles agreed on between the DPRK and the United States so 
that the nuclear issue may be resolved in a fair way on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  It says the Japanese reactionaries must apologize for the 
monstrous crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in 
the past, make an adequate compensation, stop clamouring about 
the non- existent "nuclear threat" from the DPRK and refrain 
from doing things obstructive to the peace and reunification of 
Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The preparatory 
committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of 
the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification 
(Pomminnyon) in an article contributed to its organ "Materials 
of Pomminnyon" called for an extensive struggle to open a new 
horizon of reunification. 
  The article titled "For Setting Correct Orientation of 
National Reunification Movement at Present" analysed the world 
situation and the tense situation on the Korean peninsula and 
said "the situation calls for firmly upholding the banner of 
national independence and great national unity". 
  What is decisive in forcing the way through this situation 
is 
always the internal factor, the article said, adding: 
  Under the grave situation as today, the independent forces 
of 
the whole nation must unite more closely under the banner of 
independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity 
and thus decisively frustrate the national splittist moves of 
the outside forces, the United States and Japan, and make active 
efforts to greet the independent reunification in 1995. 
  Turning to the key points of the reunification movement in 
South Korea at present, the article pointed out that they must 
be "rejection of the outside forces, the United States and 
Japan, implementation of the North-South agreement and 
attainment of reunification in the form of confederation." The 
outside forces obstructing the implementation of the 
inter-Korean agreement must be glaringly exposed, the article 
added. 
  It continued: 
  The proposal for reunification through confederacy 
epitomized 
in the words of one nation, one state, two systems and two 
governments is the only reunification formula. Efforts to 
attain a national agreement on this most reasonable proposal are 
an immediate task the fulfilment of which brooks no further 
delay. 
  Clarifying the main tasks of the present national 
reunification movement -- "rejection of the outside forces, the 
U.S. and Japan, implementation of the inter-Korean agreement 
and reunification through confederacy," -- the article called 
for redoubled efforts to open a new horizon of reunification.

<F P=106> [From the "Talk of the Week" feature] </F>
  [Text] Changes in Vietnam because of the renovation process 
have been noted around the world, even by those who do not 
sympathize with the political system in the country. They also 
identified the cause for these changes for the better. 
  During his second working visit to Vietnam, Mr. Lee Kwan 
Yew, 
the famous Singaporean statesman who has been called an adviser 
to Vietnam in the market economy by the foreign press, frankly 
commented that the Communist Party of Vietnam was the best 
leadership for Vietnam. It is capable of maintaining the 
country's security. It is also the party that has been leading 
the Vietnamese Revolution since its embryo. The party was 
experienced and the party leadership was needed by the people. 
Vietnam has made steady progress. More changes will take place 
in Vietnamese society. Those comments by Mr. Lee acknowledge an 
irrefutable fact and that is, in the past, in the present, and 
in the future, Vietnam and the Vietnamese need the Communist 
Party leaderhip for their renovation process. 
  There exists in the world a scheme to change the political 
system in Vietnam under the theory that pluralism and the 
multiparty system are required to create real renovation. Those 
who advocate this theory are doing what they can to carry out 
their scheme. However, whether they can implement their scheme 
remains a question. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese people are 
seriously looking straight at the painful and costly lessons 
from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. They see that 
pluralism and multiparty system only lead to chaos and collapse. 
[Words indistinct] fruits of the revolution which were obtained 
by blood and sweat of many generations and without which they 
cannot have independence, freedom, and prosperity. These 
opposition forces are shamelessly making use of the human rights 
issue in order to interfere deeply into Vietnam's internal 
affairs. 
  Proceeding from the essence of democracy reserved for the 
majority of people, Vietnam is prepared to dialogue to have 
those who want to know all aspects of human rights. They 
absolutely do not accept the imposition of human rights concept 
from any countries as well as all plots which make use of the 
human rights issue to interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs. 
They are ready to consider opinions saying that the human rights 
aspect in Vietnam is different from international law in order 
to perfecting laws and courts in service of democracy by the 
people and for the people. [sentence as heard] 
  In Vietnam, we are aware that current democracy must be 
further constructed in the interest of the majority of people. 
In its essence, this democracy is better than the one who 
reserved for the minority of people or a certain class. Only a 
democracy by the people and for the people can maintain a 
lasting security for the country and lead the renovation process 
to success.

  [Text] The Singaporean prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, 
visits Vietnam soon. It will mark an important event in 
relations between Vietnam and Singapore. Here is our overview: 
  It is the first Vietnam visit by the existing Singaporean 
prime minister. It is in response to the Singaporean visit by 
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in 1993. The visit comes 
at a time when many changes are taking place in the region and 
the world. ASEAN countries in particular have achieved positive 
economic development and are promoting cooperation with 
Indochinese countries, including Vietnam. 
  Singapore recently has emphasized relations with Vietnam as 
an important policy. Mr. Lee Kwan Yew, the prestigious former 
leader of Singapore, has twice visited Vietnam recently. He 
said Singapore is ready to share with Vietnam experiences in 
economic development and management. Indeed, Singapore is now 
Vietnam's biggest trade partner. Two-way trade last year 
reached $1.4 billion. Singapore ranks sixth among foreign 
investors in Vietnam, with 64 investment projects capitalized at 
more than $430 million. Up to now Vietnam and Singapore have 
signed five agreements in important fields, including investment 
encouragement and protection, a trade agreement, an airlines 
agreement, a maritime agreement, and an agreement on 
environmental control and conservation. 
  The coming official visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Goh 
Chok Tong will help boost relations to a higher level. Vietnam 
highly values and respects its friendly and cooperative 
relations with Singapore and firmly believes that the Vietnam 
visit by Mr. Goh Chok Tong will be a success and an important 
mark in relations between Vietnam and Singapore.

<F P=106> [Article by Viet An: "The Army in Economic Construction: The </F>
Urgent Need To Renovate Organization and Management"] 
  [Text] During the past 3 years, the national defense 
production and economic construction forces of the armed forces 
have developed quantitatively and increased their 
production-commercial effectiveness. 
  Three kinds of economic construction by the armed forces 
are: 
national defense enterprises; enterprises based on the economic 
accounting mechanism that produce or repair equipment and 
weapons, primarily for national defense, and use surplus 
capacity for economic production; and the specialized economic 
units, businesses that are based on the different sectors and 
trades. Another force are the regular units participating in 
production. A management system at all levels--from the Ministry 
of National Defense down to the basic level--has been formed. 
After the enterprises were reorganized in accordance with Decree 
388, a total of 299 enterprises have been strengthened and 
reorganized, and have gradually entered into operation. 
  Therefore, during the past 3 years the economic construction 
activities of the armed forces have continually attained new 
results. Thanks to that, the cadres and the national defense 
production and economic capabilities have been maintained and 
developed. They have contributed more and more to developing the 
national economy. 
  However, a number of units have not yet attained high 
economic effectiveness. Profit margins, amounts paid into the 
budget, and labor productivity are low; and their marketing is 
still weak, which greatly affects their ability to compete and 
their reputation on the market. The amounts turned over to the 
state and the army do not yet correspond to the existing 
potential. The reasons for that include factors of organization 
and management. 
  Enterprises reorganization has allowed us to see more 
clearly 
the structure and a worrisome situation. Of the total of 299 
enterprises, with regard to their principal activity 68 are in 
the construction sector, 163 are industrial enterprises, 20 are 
agricultural, forestry, or fishing enterprises, and 48 are 
transportation, service, or commercial enterprises. Half are 
scattered out in localities nationwide. About two-thirds have 
fewer than 200 workers, and nearly half have less than 1 billion 
dong of capital. That shows their dispersion and small scale, 
and the heavily fragmented nature of their production and 
business. That has restricted in-depth investment to renovate 
the enterprises' equipment and technology, so it is difficult 
for them to improve quality and their competitiveness has been 
restricted. In order to have new equipment and technology by 
means of cooperation with foreign countries, small enterprises 
are in a weak position, are not up to the task with regard to 
capital, experience, management, and the means to engage in 
international trade, so they may have to suffer business losses. 
  The activities of the units and enterprises demonstrate that 
many enterprises and corporations with one level of management 
operate stably and have a developing scale of production will be 
regulated with regard to organization and management, and do not 
need to ally with other enterprises in a new organization. But 
there are many with two levels of management which, after 
re-registering for business, have only administrative 
relationships with the lower echelon. On the other hand, there 
are corporations in which the lower-level enterprises still must 
cooperate with one another because of their products and 
technology, and can assist one another with regard to technology 
and capability to mobilize the sources of funds. But there are 
also many general corporations with two or three levels of 
management the role of which has become vague. On the other 
hand, some operate in the economic collective style. That 
situation is posing the requirement of studying specific 
organization and management matters. 
  Many new problems are being posed in the payment of taxes. 
Nearly all units have paid commercial income, agricultural, and 
export-import taxes to local tax offices. Many units want to pay 
taxes to a single place: the Ministry of National Defense. 
Because of Circular 08, some problems have arisen, so the 
payment of income taxes, land taxes, etc., is not uniform. With 
regard to paying profits directly to the upper echelon, many 
units think there is an inequality with the other state 
enterprises. 
  With regard to depreciation and the payment of capital 
depreciation taxes, many units think that the present 
depreciation rate is rigid and, in general, is still too low. In 
the production-commercial units of the National Defense Industry 
and Economy General Department, the collection of depreciation 
taxes is not calculated accurately and fully. If calculated 
correctly, five to seven percent of the original value of fixed 
assets should be paid, but now only 1.45 percent is paid. Some 
units recommended that they be allowed to select a depreciation 
rate appropriate for the fixed assets borrowed by the unit, or 
use internal capital to purchase them. The form of fixed assets 
supplied from the budget should be readjusted or the 
depreciation rate should be based appropriately on each sector. 
  In assigning capital, difficulties are still being 
experienced in settlement and processing. Many difficulties are 
also encountered in determining how much capital to assign 
because assets are not uniform and come from many different 
sources. 
  New problems have arisen in implementing the system of 
reporting accounting statistics and applying the system of 
national accounts. Many units have not grasped the contents and 
the necessary knowledge to apply that system. In 1993 the state 
issued a decision to apply the system of national accounts 
nationwide. More than a year has passed but there has been no 
specific guidance on implementing it. 
  One problem receiving much attention is that there are still 
many problems in establishing and implementing the mechanism of 
the party leading, the directors managing, and the workers and 
staff serving as the masters in the military enterprises. Some 
party committees and chapters have been slow in renovating the 
activity contents and guidelines, and have not yet tied in 
party work with specialized work, and are still confused about 
the new mechanism. 
  Much progress has been made in the army's economic 
construction organization and management. But a new requirement 
that has been posed is continuing to renovate, overcome 
difficulties, stabilize organization, and develop the leadership 
role in production and business. The army enterprises are also 
state enterprises, but they have special characteristics with 
regard to their responsibilities, organization, and management. 
The labor structure includes many components, which causes the 
payment of salaries according to labor to be difficult to 
implement. The type of structure and the nature of fixed assets 
and capital brought into production have many different 
characteristics, so the renovation process also differs. It is 
difficult to force them into the same mold, but it is also 
necessary to observe the spirit of the state regulations. 
  Therefore, it is necessary to study and apply the policy of 
renovating the state's economic management organization and 
mechanism, gradually separate state management from the 
management of production and business, resolve the relationship 
between the management of property ownership and the management 
of property use, form stock companies, and organize the forms of 
cooperation, alliance, and federation. At the same time, we must 
guarantee that the armed forces have a system of enterprises 
that is capable of meeting the most important needs in the 
process of building a conventional army that is combat-ready and 
plays a worthy role in strengthening the national defense 
potential and the national economy. 
  Renovating the organization and management of national 
defense production activities and building the military economy 
are urgent concerns, but also have a basic, long-range 
significance in guaranteeing the absolute, all-round leadership 
of the party and the army. It must be carried out carefully and 
in correct accordance with the law, and there must be certain 
solutions and an appropriate course.

<F P=106> [Article by Major General Mai Nang] </F>
  [Excerpts] In past wars, together with the branches of 
service, branches, local troops, and people, the special 
operations troops have manifested the tradition of being "crack, 
heroic, and clever and innovative troops capable of winning 
victory" and completed all the tasks in an outstanding manner. 
[passage omitted] 
  Today, the country is at peace. Even though things are still 
not stable, organizing the military in general and organizing 
and building the special operations units in particular are 
different than in the past. In the present stage, construction 
and combat readiness are the leading tasks. Furthermore, the 
army's task of defending our socialist fatherland now has 
different requirements and themes: defending our independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity is tied to defending the 
party, defending the socialist system, and maintaining the 
country's political security. Opposing peaceful change and 
rebellions has become the leading task. This must be coordinated 
with and dealt with actively together with other situations. We 
are no longer receiving military aid from abroad as in the past, 
and today's national defense budget is limited. Thus, renovating 
organization and building forces in accord with the 
requirements, tasks, and new situation is the task of each 
branch of service and branch, which includes the special 
operations branch. 
  In my view, in building special operations forces today, we 
must concentrate on the following main themes: 
  1. We must build special operations forces that are really 
well-trained, particularly forces that are well-trained 
politically. Special operations forces' combat strength is 
crystallized by many factors. This is the strength of the strong 
political capabilities, unique special operations combat arts, 
and tight military organization of a crack, revolutionary, and 
regular force that is gradually being modernized. If we simply 
compare our strength to that of the enemy, it will be very 
difficult to explain the victories of our special operations 
troops. Recent wars have shown that in many situations, one 
sapper team has successfully attacked a major target deep in the 
enemy's rear, an operation that would have been difficult for an 
infantry regiment, or even a division, to carry out. This stems 
mainly from the "special nature" of the special operations 
forces in all the factors and relationships, their skill in 
organizing and building forces, their special operating 
formulas, and their special capabilities in attacking the enemy. 
Thus, building special operations forces who are well-trained in 
all respects, particularly in politics, is an urgent and 
long-term task. As warfare develops and the enemy uses more and 
more weapons and more high-tech equipment, more and more 
attention must be given to this requirement. 
  In today's conditions and in a people's war to defend the 
fatherland (if war should break out), the special operations 
forces must be organized broadly. But this does not mean that 
there should be large numbers of poor-quality troops spread far 
and wide. The guiding ideas of the party must always be 
thoroughly understood in building forces, and quality, 
particularly political quality, must always come first. Starting 
now, in carrying out the national defense and security tasks and 
maintaining political stability in the country, this issue must 
be greatly elevated. The enemy's "peaceful change" plot is 
constantly making advances and hurting us. The struggle against 
aggression is actually underway. This cannot wait until there is 
a war of aggression. Unless we defeat their plots and stratagems 
in peacetime, we could lose the party and the regime, as has 
happened in many countries. Once the leading party and the 
regime is lost, the entire system will be lost, and that will 
lead to the loss of the country. We will fall into the orbit of 
neocolonialism in one form or another. 
  This new task requires that the military, which includes 
special operations troops, have a new combat strength and 
contribute, together with all the people, to winning the complex 
and very difficult "political war." At the same time, it must 
have the strength to serve as the activist for all the people 
and be prepared to defeat a war of aggression if war should 
break out in order to defend our socialist Vietnamese 
fatherland. Special operations cadres and soldiers must have 
strong political capabilities and adhere closely to the targets 
and ideals. They must be absolutely loyal to the fatherland and 
people and be vigilant. They must react quickly to all types of 
enemies and not vacillate or waver in the face of the deceptive 
arguments of the enemy or in the face of monetary or material 
bribes. At the same time, sappers must be imbued with a lofty 
idea of the offensive. They must be resolute, brave, and daring. 
They must have adequate military knowledge and be physically 
strong. Only then will they be able to stand firmly and fight 
for long periods in terrible conditions, have the fortitude to 
overcome difficulties, and have the wisdom and ability to defeat 
targets not of their choosing in conditions in which they are at 
a disadvantage in terms of both forces and equipment. With this 
spirit, along with improving the quality of military training, 
the special operations branch has constantly strengthened 
political and ideological education, regarding this as one of 
the important things for ensuring that the sapper forces are 
built up and can fight victoriously. [passage omitted] 
  Political education must enable everyone to see that the 
tasks of sappers today have expanded as compared with those 
during the national liberation war. Because of this, the 
disciplinary and tactical requirements are higher, and this 
defines the determination to study and train to satisfy the 
requirements and fulfill the tasks. 
  2. Special operations detachments that are strong in all 
respects must be built. 
  With respect to the special operations branch, just as in 
the 
past, the combat units must build strong sapper teams, 
spearheads, units, and joint units that have the ability to 
fight on any battlefield and attack targets deep in the enemy's 
rear using the equipment available. This is a pressing and 
long-term requirement. 
  To build special operations detachments requires above all a 
thorough understanding of the spirit of General Staff Directive 
116CT-TM on building units that are strong in all respects. 
Because of the special nature of the special operations forces, 
we are concentrating on the following: 
  We must build strong party organizations, particularly party 
chapters and party cells. The various-echelon party 
organizations, particularly the party chapters, must really have 
the ability to lead the party members and masses in the units. 
The party organizations must ensure that people thoroughly 
understand the party's resolutions, policies, and lines and 
carry out the construction and combat training tasks for their 
units. At the same time, because sappers usually operate in 
small numbers far from the guidance of higher echelons, the 
branch is giving much attention to building party chapters 
having many outstanding members. Today, in the special 
operations branch, all combat units have party chapters. The 
problem is to ensure that many party chapters have party 
committee echelons and that more and more party chapters are 
strong in all respects. 
  An important requirement is to build ranks of primary-level 
management cadres, because cadres are the root of every victory. 
Special operations cadres must not only have excellent technical 
and tactical standards and be strong physically but they must 
also be highly skilled in mobilizing the masses and building 
political bases among the people. They must be able to organize 
an area and be skilled in training the cadres and soldiers 
subordinate to them. The experiences gained from past battles 
and operations have been reviewed. Both the successful and 
unsuccessful experiences must be passed on to subordinate cadres 
and soldiers through both formal training and on-the-job 
training. 
  Combat readiness training and training in discipline and 
order are central tasks in building detachments that are strong 
in all respects. Today, just as in other infantry units, sappers 
are obligated to serve in the military for only 2 years. In such 
a short period, training must be planned and follow a scientific 
model in order to ensure that 1st-year soldiers have good basic 
standards and that 2d-year soldiers are well-trained and skilled 
in every respect. Emphasis must be placed on forging excellent 
skills in independent combat as well as in joint combat with 
other branches of service and other arms. 
  Combat training must be coordinated with physical education 
and with strengthening discipline and order. For a long time to 
come, just as in the past, the special operations troops will 
have to carry on operations and fight for long periods with just 
the equipment and food they carry. Thus, they must be physically 
strong and have a good concept of organization and discipline. 
Sapper discipline does not stop here but also manifests high 
combat coordination. In unusual times, special military 
knowledge will be used to affect the prestige of Uncle Ho's 
troops. [passage omitted] 
  3. Reviewing things and carrying on scientific studies must 
be strengthened in order to satisfy the new requirements and 
fulfill the new tasks. [passage omitted] 
  If a war to defend the fatherland breaks out, the enemy will 
certainly use modern, high-tech weapons and equipment. But 
special operations forces must manifest their great role and 
exploit special methods of attack on the battlefields of a 
people's war based on the training that they received in 
peacetime. The special operations troops can attack important 
targets on land, command bases, rear area and technical targets, 
and the aircraft and ships of the enemy deep in their rear. 
  Making complete preparations so that the special operations 
forces can fulfill the combat readiness tasks based on the 
experiences of the war for national liberation does not mean 
blindly applying the old experiences to the new situation, which 
changed has and developed. The special operations branch must 
study many problems such as the organization and construction of 
sapper forces, sapper combat arts, the use of sappers of 
integrated branch commands, formulas to maintain rear services, 
techniques, intelligence for the sappers during combat, and so 
on. Above all, plans must be studied to determine how to 
organize the special operations forces in a rational manner, 
from the special operations forces of the command and in the 
military regions and corps to the local special operations 
forces. The necessary ratio between professional forces and 
draftees in today's special operations units must be determined. 
Formulas for having sappers carry out quick and secret 
operations must be studied, and plans to build corridors, 
positions, and political bases in predetermined locations must 
be studied. 
  Scientific research must go deeply into studying and 
purchasing new weapons and equipment, new modes of attack, and 
writing training materials for the special operations troops. 
The highest requirement with respect to the weapons and 
equipment used by sappers is that they are compact, easy to use, 
easy to assemble and set up, and easy to transport on both land 
and in water, that their shape is suited to each type of special 
operations force, and that they are highly destructive. 
  Weapons research must be directed toward the application of 
the newest technology in order to improve the old types of 
weapons and improve and purchase equipment so that the special 
operations forces can operate at remote distances on both land 
and at sea. The signal and liaison means and reconnaissance 
means of the special operations forces is another difficult 
problem that must be studied. An important research task is to 
ensure that the special operations troops eat a proper diet and 
are physically healthy so that they can carry out the immediate 
tasks and remain in good health. Studies must be done on 
processing highly nutritious foods that are easy to use and that 
can be preserved for long periods. Food for water sappers, for 
example, must be small, light, impervious to water, and easy to 
use so that the sappers can eat while swimming. On the other 
hand, studies must be done on manufacturing preventive medicines 
and other drugs suited to independent activities, particularly 
when sappers must rely on themselves at sea. 
  Many of the scientific research problems exceed the 
capabilities of the special operations forces. It is hoped that 
the state, the Ministry of Defense, and scientists both in and 
outside the military will provide help.

  [Text] Tel Aviv, REPUBLIKA -- Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin has said Israel wants to immediately establish 
diplomatic relations with Indonesia. He said this when he 
received four Indonesian journalists, one of whom was Nasir 
Tamara from REPUBLIKA, at his office in Tel Aviv, Israel last 
Monday evening. According to Rabin, there has been no official 
timetable for mutual recognition and diplomatic relations. 
However, he added that the two nations could first get to know 
each other before establishing diplomatic relations. 
  "As Israeli prime minister, I hope that the establishment of 
diplomatic relations will be realized as soon as possible. 
However, we know that all this will be a long process and will 
depend on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as well," said 
Rabin. 
  Rabin believed that "the way to peace between Israel and the 
Arabs is also through a rapproachement between Israel and the 
Islamic World. Thus, support from Indonesia as a country which 
has the largest Islamic population in the world will be very 
important and crucial." Rabin said that he and President 
Suharto "agreed to gradually create conditions -- business 
relations, as an example -- to pave the way for better 
relations" when he visited Jakarta some time ago. Rabin once 
again reiterated that Israel "wants to coexist peacefully with 
the Palestinians." 
  While the PLO has recognized the existence of Israel, Israel 
itself has refused to recognize the existence of Palestine. 
Khalid Mawardi, head of the Political Department of the 
Nahdlatul Ulama [Association of Muslim Scholars] Central 
Executive Committee, regarded the Israeli-PLO agreement signed 
in Washington last year as an initial step and said the 
agreement cannot strongly justify the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Israel. 
  According to Khalid, Israel remains a colonizer as long as 
the Jewish state does not quit all Arab territories -- the West 
Bank, Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, and the 
Gaza Strip -- which it occupied during and after the 1967 war. 
  A similar reaction came from Sumargono, chairman of the 
Indonesian Committee for Solidarity with the Islamic World. 
"Israel is an aggressor as long as it continues to occupy Arab 
territories. As this continues, it would be improper to have 
diplomatic relations with Israel," he said. According to 
Sumargono, Indonesian Muslims are not psychologically ready for 
such relations. "There could be upheavals if this is done. The 
Muslims are deeply injured over Israel's current brutal acts 
against the Palestinians." 
  Mr. Riza Sihbudi, political observer from the Indonesian 
Institute of Sciences and senior lecturer at the Department of 
International Relations at the Faculty of Social and Political 
Sciences of the University of Indonesia, said the establishment 
of diplomatic relations with Israel is a sensitive issue. "We 
must be careful. We must truly think about their advantages and 
disadvantages," said Riza, the author of a book entitled "The 
Middle East, Islamic World, and American Hegemony."

<F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Ramos during the Symposium on </F>
Philippines' Accession to Intellectual Property Rights 
Protection and the First Anniversary Celebration of the 
Presidential Inter-Agency Committee on Intellectual Property 
Rights at Malacanang Palace in Manila on 28 February; monitored 
in progress -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] A year ago we established the Inter-Agency 
Committee on Intellectual Property Rights [IACIPR] under 
Executive Order No. 60, which is your Bible, and this is our 
instrument for improving and enforcing existing laws for the 
protection of intellectual property rights [IPR]. We did this 
to strengthen collaboration among various government agencies 
and the private sector [words indistinct] infringements, piracy, 
and counterfeiting, and since then, the 13 government agencies 
and the two NGO's [nongovernment organization] who compose the 
IACIPR, had mounted a concerted and aggressive effort in 
pursuing the committee's mandate and functions. [passage 
omitted] 
  From the perspective of local investors, authors, trademark 
owners, and producers, IPR protection is indispensable for the 
development of domestic industries that do more than copy 
foreign models, but show the creativity and the ingenuity of the 
Filipino. Provided with adequate protection and incentives, the 
Filipino inventor can develop the critical technology needed for 
the rapid development of our industrial and agricultural 
sectors. [passage omitted] 
  Under the 1992 Inventor and Invention Incentives Act, R.A. 
[Republic Act] 7459, inventors enjoy income tax exemptions for 
the first 10 years from the date of the first sale of the 
invention and they are exempted from business license fees, 
among others. Through your IACIPR, you will strengthen the 
protection of their inventions against piracy and counterfeiting 
so that they will earn rightful profits for their inventions and 
recover their investment. 
  We plan to do the same thing for our artists, writers, 
performers, composers, and musicians whose talents have not only 
enriched our lives but have gained worldwide recognition for the 
Philippines as well. That, this administration has given 
priority to the development of culture and the arts. [sentence 
as heard] We have adopted the national development plan for 
culture and the arts to promote a renaissance in Filipino 
culture. 
  Institutions critical to the plan are now in place, part of 
which is the national endowment fund for cultural and artistic 
programs. The government is also taking steps to develop the 
local movie, television, and music industries into export 
industries, and we hope to turn Metro Manila and Subic and many 
other places later on into the Hollywood of the Philippines and 
of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  To promote cultural renewal it is important that the 
intellectual creations of Filipino artists and musicians be 
recognized and protected. In the state of our composers, for 
example, we should give value to their intellectual creations 
and their works by paying them adequate royalties every time 
their music is performed for profit and it is only just and fair 
that all establishments using their musical compositions should 
start thinking about paying the royalties due our composers and 
musicians. [applause] 
  I am pleased to announce that upon my instructions the 
Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] has submitted a study on 
how to effectively enforce nationwide the music copyrights of 
composers and authors. 
  From the perspective of foreign investments, especially 
those 
that hasten the phase of technology transfer, our interest is to 
build up the confidence of investors in the country's capability 
to protect their intellectual property rights the minute they 
bring their own technology and products into the Philippines. 
We must also contend with international development that 
impacts on foreign trade and investments. For example, major 
markets for our export products such as garments, furniture, and 
sugar, require that we protect their IPR or otherwise face trade 
sanctions. This can adversely affect the achievements of our 
export and investment targets. IPR, therefore, is clearly 
indispensable if we are to achieve the goals of Philippines 2000. 
  Towards making the Philippine business environment more 
attractive and competitive in the race to attract foreign 
investments, the Philippine Government remains committed to 
evaluating its present flaws of IPR in consonance with our 
multilateral and bilateral commitments. As you well know, last 
15 February 1993 [year as heard], the Philippines, together with 
117 other countries accepted the conclusions of the Uruguay 
Round [UR] of the multilateral trade negotiations under the 
auspices of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, or GATT, 
because it will bring about substantive benefits to our economy. 
The recently concluded UR negotiations have further 
strengthened the multilateral trading system by bringing in 
agriculture and services into the GATT, achieving lower tariffs, 
removing nontariff barriers, improving GATT rules and 
discipline, including dispute settlement and ensuring a more 
adequate protection of IPR's. 
  In the area of IPR's, the benefits we can derive from the 
UR are the greatly reduced risk of unilateral trade action such 
as the Section 301 actions of the U.S. Omnibus Trade Law and 
strengthen dispute settlement procedures. But availing 
ourselves of this benefit is not without cost. In the area of 
IPR we have to accede to tighter rules for protection and accept 
the possibility of cross-retaliation which means that continued 
violation of commitments in the services of IPR areas, for 
example, can bring about a retaliation in the goods area if 
authorized by the new world trade organization. 
  The UR provisions of the trade [-related] aspects of 
intellectual property or TRIP's have set terms and standards on 
IPR that all the members of the GATT will have to adopt in their 
respective laws. Most of these norms and standards, however, 
are already found in Philippine laws. In Asia, we have one of 
the most comprehensive legal systems dealing with intellectual 
property. As early as 1947, the Philippines legislated a patent 
of trademark system based on American law. In 1972, P.D. 
[Presidential Decree] 49, a decree on intellectual property was 
issued containing almost all the modern principles of 
copyrights, including the grant of copyrights to computer 
software. Likewise, the rights of performers, recording 
companies, and broadcasting companies known as property rights, 
were recognized and protected. But unlike other developing 
countries, especially in Asia, our acceptance of the TRIP's 
agreement does not involve a basic change in our existing 
intellectual property protection system. It would merely 
introduce changes to update our laws in line with the rapidly 
modernizing world. 
  In considering the many benefits and advantages the 
Philippines would gain in accepting the UR agreement, I am 
clearly in favor of Philippine accession to the substantive 
provisions of the 1971 Berne Convention. Early today, I signed 
our country's instrument of accession, thereto, an endorsement 
letter to the Senate requesting it to ratify the same as soon as 
possible. [applause] I would like to assure you that we will 
also take decisive action to amend our laws to adopt to TRIP's 
standards. These bills are now being rushed and the DTI will 
ensure their filing with Congress shortly. 
  While intellectual property rights laws in the Philippines 
are comprehensive enough, much more is to be done to improve 
their enforcement and we would like to thank Stanford Research 
Institute or SRI International for undertaking an in-depth study 
on the problems of the adjudication process of IPR cases. I 
have taken note of and I am very much alarmed by the serious 
delays and inefficiencies which the existing adjudication 
procedures inflict on IPR holders whenever they seek redress for 
their grievances. I assure you that we will give serious 
considerations to measures that you have proposed to clear the 
procedural bottlenecks that you have identified. 
  We now see a convergence between government plans and those 
of SRI in certain proposed measures to solve the problems in the 
adjudication process. We have already considered the need to 
set up special courts to hear exclusively IPR cases. I do not 
have any objection to this proposal. In fact, I would like to 
take this opportunity to direct your IACIPR Chairman Secretary 
Navarro to coordinate with the executive secretary, Teofisto 
Guingona, of the referral of this proposal to Chief Justice 
Andres Narvasa of the Supreme Court. We will request him to act 
on this favorably. Please take note also that the 
administration-sponsored measure revising the jurisdiction of 
the courts was approved last week by the Senate-House bicameral 
conference committee. 
  The threshold of the amounts involved for the regional trial 
court, or RTC, to acquire jurisdiction with respect to civil 
actions involving real property, maritime, [word indistinct] 
cases, and etcetera has been increased substantially. This will 
unload the dockets of the RTC's and enable then to dispose of 
their backlog expeditiously. 
  We also hope to raise the penalties of infringement of IPR 
and simplify the procedures for the prosecution of IPR violators 
through legislation. Finally, allow me to commend the IACIPR 
for its impressive performance during its first year of 
operations in battling piracy and counterfeiting [applause]
