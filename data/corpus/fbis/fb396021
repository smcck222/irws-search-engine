  [Excerpts] SINGAPORE, March 8 (AFP) -- Singapore is 
expected to stand firm on the court-ordered flogging of an 
American teenage vandal despite a strong protest from U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, official sources said Tuesday. An 
official, queried on the protest lodged Monday, pointed to a 
weekend statement by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 
saying it indicated Singapore was unlikely to yield ground on 
the issue. Lee had said that foreigners living in Singapore 
would have to abide by local laws. "These laws are published, 
they are transparent. Everyone knows about them," he said, 
according to local news reports. 
  Michael Peter Fay, 18, was sentenced on Thursday to four 
months jail, six strokes of the cane and fined 3,500 dollars 
(2,200 US) for spray-painting cars, pelting them with eggs and 
retaining stolen property. The court-ordered flogging drew 
immediate criticism from a senior US diplomat here and the 
American Chamber of Commerce, which said it was "shaken" by the 
sentence. 
  The Singapore government is expected to issue a formal 
statement responding to Clinton's announcement that Washington 
had filed "a strong protest" over the affair. Clinton had said 
that while he recognised that the Singapore authorities were 
acting within their jurisdiction, he hoped the caning decision 
would be reconsidered. "We recognize that they have a certain 
right to enforce their own criminal laws. But we believe that 
based on the facts and the treatment of other cases, similar 
cases, that this punishment is extreme and we hope very much 
that somehow it will be reconsidered," he said. [passage omitted] 
  Some analysts said Washington's protest may have been poorly 
timed because Fay, a student at the American school here, is on 
bail pending appeal to a higher court. The judicial process was 
therefore still not completed, they said. Lee said Saturday that 
Singaporeans had been ordered caned for similar offences and 
that it would be absurd to have separate laws for locals and 
Americans. There was no reason why "foreigners should be more 
thin-skinned," he said. 
  Singapore's home affairs ministry said after the subordinate 
court ruling that the same laws applied to Singaporeans and 
foreigners. Of the 14 people, between the age of 18 and 21, 
convicted for vandalism and ordered caned over the last five 
years, 12 were Singaporeans, it said. A juvenile court will next 
month sentence a 15-year-old Malaysian who pleaded guilty to two 
counts of vandalism while a 16-year-old Hong Kong resident will 
go on trial, also for vandalism, next week.

  [Text] Singapore -- Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng 
said yesterday that he did not think Singapore's relations with 
the United States would deteriorate over the court decision here 
to sentence American teenager Michael Peter Fay to jail, caning 
and a fine for vandalism. He told reporters at the Bishan East 
PAP [People's Action Party] Women's Wing function: "Whether it 
is a large group of foreign workers or one individual being 
caned, it doesn't affect bilateral relations that countries 
build up over the years. There are broader interests between 
countries than just the behaviour of individual citizens. Every 
country looks at relations based on national interests." 
  He added that, ultimately, it was the prerogative of each 
country to administer the law in its own way. "And that, we 
expect of America, whose citizens are here. And similarly, we 
expect the same of Singaporeans when they go abroad." 
  Fay was sentenced to four months' jail, six strokes of the 
cane and was ordered to pay a $3,500 fine after he pleaded 
guilty to two charges of mischief and one charge of dishonestly 
retaining stolen property. The American community, through the 
embassy and its business council, has expressed concern over the 
caning sentence.

  [Excerpt] Singapore -- The Singapore Malays National 
Organization (PKMS) condemned the Hebron massacre of 
Palestinians as an act of cowardice in a statement issued on 
Saturday. It said that the act was especially offensive as it 
was committed in a mosque. 
  "We hope the United Nations will conduct a full 
investigation 
and deploy a peacekeeping force in order to preserve peace and 
protect the Palestinians who are vulnerable to armed Israeli 
settlers." The perpetrators should be tried, said the party in 
the statement signed by acting president Atan Rafie. 
  The statement comes in the wake of internal divisions and 
power struggles within the party. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Royal Army has launched its long awaited assault 
on the Khmer Rouge military base at Pailin. More than 7,000 
men, including 3,000 policemen with military training are taking 
part in the operations. The Royal Army is backed by tanks, 
armored personnel carriers, vehicle-mounted rocket launchers, 
Katyusha rockets and 130-mm artillery pieces. 
  The CAMBODIA TIMES has been informed by senior military 
officers that the initial casualty report will be available 
soon. Fierce fighting was believed to be taking place in many 
areas as a result of the offensive which commenced last 
Wednesday, 2 March. 
  The army has moved from positions in Pursat, Bavel district 
and Samlot in a multi-prong attack. 
  Military sources said that the timing and positions of 
attack 
have been clearly planned and victory is expected to come before 
the end of the week.

  [Text] In another message from Beijing to National Assembly 
Chairman Samdech Chea Sim and to Samdech Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, Cambodia's first and second prime 
ministers, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk says that he has 
plans to stay in Cambodia for two months starting from the day 
he arrives on 8 April. 
  The king, however, says that his Chinese doctors have 
prohibited him from going out of the royal palace to visit 
various provinces because of his health. 
  In his previous message he said that he planned to visit 
some 
provinces in May, after his arrival in Cambodia on 8 April; 
however, these visits have to be canceled because of his 
doctors' instructions. The previous message also reveals that 
the king also plans to mark the 90th anniversary of his late 
mother, Queen Sisowath Kosomak; meet with the royal government; 
and receive guests and various credentials, and so on. 
  The king notes that Chinese doctors have suggested that he 
return to Beijing in May to continue the treatment of his bone 
marrow cancer with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The Prince 
Father, however, insisted that he wanted to stay in Cambodia for 
two months saying that he seems to have recovered his strength. 
The prince says in a moving sentence that "If I am still alive 
and my health gets better, I want to visit Kratie, Pursat, Stung 
Treng, Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri, and Koh Kong Provinces." 
  Since the king cannot visit the provinces, he has invited 
delegations from over 10 provinces to see him and the royal 
consort for about an hour at the Tevea Vinichhai Pavilion in the 
royal palace. He has also asked that careful protection be 
given to avoid incidents when these provincial delegations 
travel to Phnom Penh.

  [Text] For 30 years, the Cambodian nation and people, like 
the peace-loving countries worldwide and especially the Third 
World countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America, have been 
mercilessly victimized by the United States' secret 
organization, the CIA. The latter has carried out all manner of 
the most poisonous activities against the sacred wish of diverse 
countries desiring to live with unity and in peace within their 
territorial integrity. 
  Our nation and people were victims of the 1970 coup d'etat 
organized by the CIA, which has continued to destroy Cambodia's 
independence, peace, and neutrality. Now there are reports that 
the United States has decided to send a Peace Corps, which is a 
division of the worldwide notorious CIA to Cambodia to continue 
destructive activities against our nation and people. 
  Our nation, people, and the patriotic forces will in no way 
remain idle and allow the CIA or its Peace Corps to do away with 
Cambodia at will. We will certainly continue our struggle to 
restore Cambodia's independence and peace within its territorial 
integrity.

<F P=106> [Open letter from Khieu Samphan, head of the party of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea, to the representatives of countries and 
international organizations who will attend the Tokyo conference 
from 10 to 12 March 1994; dated 4 March -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Your excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen: as 
representatives of your countries and various international 
organizations or agencies, you will attend the international 
conference to collect aid for Cambodia, which will be held in 
Tokyo from 10 to 12 March 1994. 
  On behalf of the national resistance forces of Democratic 
Kampuchea [DK] and the Cambodian nation and people in the 
countryside, in the cities, and in Phnom Penh and abroad who 
have taken part in the struggle against the Vietnamese enemy 
aggressors for the defense of Cambodia's land and race since 
1979, I would like to submit to all of you, excellencies, 
ladies, and gentlemen -- who are representatives of countries 
and governments that cherish peace and justice in the world and 
have all along provided firm support to the just cause of the 
Cambodian nation and people -- this open letter for your 
consideration. 
  I. In the past, the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] 
always welcomed and supported all initiatives and international 
conferences aimed at mobilizing relief assistance to alleviating 
the misery and suffering of the Cambodian nation and people, 
victims of the Vietnamese war of aggression. 
  The PDK always urged that humanitarian aid provided by the 
international community reach the needy Cambodian people. 
  The PDK's position on this matter, either before or after 
the 
signing of the Paris agreement, is already known to national and 
international public opinion. 
  II. At the same time, the PDK has also done its utmost to 
oppose any activities which, under the cover of assistance of 
any kind, are aimed at consolidating and developing the 
Vietnamese-installed regime, continuing the war in Cambodia, and 
allowing communist Vietnam to swallow up the Cambodian nation 
and race through military aggression, demographic invasion, and 
through the power structure it has set up in Cambodia since 1979. 
  III. Your excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen, you are not 
unaware that ever since its formation, this government with two 
prime ministers has been used by the Vietnamese communists and 
the alliance as an instrument to launch small- and large-scale 
military operations aimed at destroying the Cambodian national 
resistance forces and the people in the DK's liberated zone so 
that they will be able to vie for their own interests in 
Cambodia. 
  At first, they launched the military operations against the 
region of Phnom Chhat in Thmar Puok District of Battambang 
Province and against Stoung in Kompong Thom Province. Then, 
starting from September 1993, they have mobilized a large number 
of troops with many top-ranking commanders and a huge amount of 
weapons, ammunition, and other war materiel to destroy the 
national resistance forces in the region of Anlung Veng in Oddar 
Meanchey Province. The objective of their large-scale military 
operations is to eliminate the DK forces, which support His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point idea for Cambodia to 
achieve genuine national reconciliation, national unity, and 
peace. 
  It can be said that the military operations launched by this 
government with two prime ministers are against national 
reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. On the surface, it is 
fighting between the two-headed government's forces and the DK 
forces. However, the formation of the government with two prime 
ministers and the current Khmer Royal Armed Forces and the 
strategic policy of the countries which they serve are known to 
all. 
  Their true nature is that of all-round power structures set 
up by the Vietnamese aggressors since 1979, with the only 
difference being that the personalities of some political 
parties have been put in here and there in order to mislead 
national and international public opinion. 
  Diplomatic sources in Phnom Penh have also clearly indicated 
that there have been a large number of Vietnamese forces in 
Cambodia. They are to be found in various ministries, in the 
puppet army, and even taking part in the fight against the 
national resistance forces on various fronts, particularly on 
the Anlung Veng battlefield. 
  Since August 1993, even though the Cambodian nation, 
people, and national resistance forces have insisted on talks 
among all Cambodian leaders with a view to achieving national 
reconciliation and unity so as to restore peace in Cambodia, and 
even though the king himself made a five-point proposal on 24 
November 1993, the Vietnamese communists' puppets, such as Hun 
Sen, Tie Banh, and others, have only cried out: Fight, fight, 
fight! 
  In his proposed annual plan, Hun Sen has called for the 
military strength to be expanded by forcibly enlisting students, 
workers, and farmers in villages and communes so as to continue 
the vietnamese war of aggression. 
  In its various trips abroad, the government with two prime 
ministers has tried hard to buy arms and ammunition and to 
request assistance regarding military equipment. It has gone so 
far as to rubber-stamp communist Vietnam's sending of its troops 
and war materiel into Cambodia under the cover of the so-called 
cooperation on military issues between Cambodia and Vietnam 
worked out during Chea Sim's trip to Hanoi at the beginning of 
this month. Besides, communist Vietnam continues to send its 
nationals to Cambodia under the framework of its strategy to 
swallow up Cambodia through demographic invasion. The number of 
those Vietnamese in Cambodia has increased to nearly four 
million. This is indeed a very big threat to the survival of 
the Cambodian nation and people. 
  IV. In brief, we can see that Vietnam's war of aggression 
continues unabated either through military war or demographic 
invasion or through the power structures it has set up since 
1979. 
  In such a situation, will the assistance of all kinds 
provided by the international community to the government with 
two prime ministers be able to rebuild the country? Or will it 
be helpful to the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the 
alliance in continuing to kindle the flames of war that will 
bring about ruin and destruction for Cambodia and its people and 
death to the Cambodian nation and race? 
  During the past 14 to 15 years, especially after the signing 
of the Paris agreement, have the Vietnamese communist puppets 
built anything in the interests of the Cambodian nation and 
people with the huge amount of assistance -- worth millions of 
dollars -- given to Cambodia by the international community? 
Rather, have they not used all that money to expand their war 
machinery and their instruments for repressing the Cambodian 
people? 
  Every dollar given by you to the victimized Cambodian people 
as humanitarian aid has been diverted by the Vitnamese puppets 
to buy ammunition and poisonous products to kill the Cambodian 
nation and people. 
  Past experiences show that the assistance generously 
provided 
by the international community to Cambodia will certainly be 
transformed into weapons used by the Vietnamese communists, the 
Vietnamese puppets, and the alliance to carry on the war to kill 
the Cambodian nation and race -- which is what they have been 
doing ever since the formation of this government with two prime 
ministers. 
  The flames of the war will flare up with no end in sight. 
  In such a situation, will the assistance to be provided by 
the international community for the construction of Cambodia not 
be in contrast to your purpose? If so, how will this affect 
your consciences as the representatives of the peace- and 
justice-loving countries and governments who want to help 
relieve the Cambodian nation and people from misery and 
suffering? 
  If the Vietnamese war of aggression continues in Cambodia, 
will it be beneficial to Cambodia as well as to the strategic, 
political, and economic interests of the countries in this 
region or not? Will communist Vietnam, which annexed Laos and 
Cambodia, not be a threat to regional security? 
  On the contrary, if the assistance is used to compel the 
government with two prime ministers to accept and implement the 
five-point guideline of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk so 
that Cambodia achieves genuine national reconciliation, national 
unity and peace, will this not be a benefit to Cambodia and the 
region as well? 
  Once Cambodia has national reconciliation and peace and 
investment from countries near and far, will this not help to 
ensure the security, stability, and prosperity of the Southeast 
Asian region? 
  V. On behalf of the PDK and the Cambodian people who have 
taken part in the struggle against the Vietnamese aggressors for 
the defense of their nation and race as well as for peace and 
security in this region, I would like to make a sincere appeal 
to you, the representatives of peace- and justice-loving 
countries and governments and of the international 
organizations, to consider whether to provide the assistance in 
a way that will help the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, 
and the alliance continue their war to kill the Cambodian nation 
and people and menace regional peace and security, or instead to 
use this assistance to compel the government with two prime 
ministers to accept and implement the five-point guideline of 
His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk that will pave the way for the 
achievement of genuine national reconciliation, national unity, 
and peace in Cambodia, thus strengthening peace and security in 
the region -- a way which is the best for peace in Cambodia and 
in the region.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 8 Mar (AKP) -- On 3 March Khmer Rouge 
soldiers attacked several positions of the Khmer Royal Armed 
Forces in Bavel District, Battambang Province, about 300 km 
northwest of Phnom Penh. According to Battambang's provincial 
police, some 50 Khmer Rouge soldiers from Divisions 320 and 450 
attacked the position in the Prey Khpos sector for half an hour. 
  At the same time, 30 other Khmer Rouge soldiers occupied the 
government forces' positions in Ampil Pram Daeum Commune for a 
few days. 
  Two other positions in this commune and the Commune of Kdol 
Ta Hen also came under attack from Khmer Rouge forces. 
  Ampil Pram Daeum and Kdol Ta Hen were attacked three times 
by 
the Khmer Rouge last January and February. The current 
activities of the guerrillas appear to be acts of banditry which 
have caused great losses in human life and property to the local 
population.

  [Text] Jakarta, 27 Jan--Minister of Home Affairs Moh. Yogie 
S.M. stressed that political reform is a consequence of 
increasing openness and democratization. This reform is being 
spurred in order to create increasingly stable quality as a 
nation and greater progressiveness and self-sufficiency in life 
as a state. 
  Although there are now many challenges, the desires for 
political changes by part of society are a product of the 
success of national development. "Therefore, we view them 
positively and do not belittle the demands of society, because 
the reformation produced by openness and democratization must be 
consistent with Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution." 
  Yogie said this Wednesday [26 January] at the Department of 
Home Affairs, Jakarta, in a limited working meeting of governors 
from throughout Indonesia in connection with preparations for 
implementation of the 1994-95 RAPBN [Draft National Budget] and 
RAPBD's [Draft Regional Budgets]. There was also discussion of 
political upbuilding, stabilization of the mechanism for 
selecting heads of first and second level regions, and 
implementation of the INPRES [Presidential Instructions] Program 
for Backward Schools (IDT). 
  He also said, "Because of growing public political 
awareness, 
political upbuilding of the people must be inspired by the 
people's aspirations, which naturally carry much weight. Good 
aspirations are those that benefit the prosperity of all the 
people and avoid giving attention to only one group. Because 
giving attention to only one group could trigger disintegration, 
it must be avoided." 
  Besides, he said, approaches based on aspirations can be 
properly realized only if supported by a strong political 
infrastructure and superstructure. An awareness needs to be 
implanted among the people that the aspirations that are 
developing, as an aspect of openness, must adhere to norms, 
ethics, and rules. 
  The same point of view on the part of the government and the 
people will create future political communications marked by 
dialogue and harmony. Such communications require a society that 
is full of aspirations as people who are independent and free 
from pressure and dependency. 
  The domestic political supervisor also said that because 
democracy is a situation that is always developing, it is not 
possible to determine a standard model, let alone make the 
democracy of any specific country a model that must be imitated. 
"Democracy cannot be developed immediately as merely a single 
phase. Basically, democracy develops spontaneously (not 
engineered). There may be many natural characteristics. 
Democracy should not be developed through `social 
experimentation' and certainly not by repeatedly trying things, 
because what is at stake is the nation's security and the 
country's unity," the minister of home affairs said. 
  Touching on the 1994-95 budget, he said the Department of 
Home Affairs has established a set of programs to cover nine 
sectors, 14 subsectors, 23 programs, and 105 projects, with 
funds totaling 40.476 billion rupiah, which means an increase of 
7.5 percent over the 1993-94 budget.

  [Text] Jakarta, 19 Jan--During the last 40 years, the 
government has banned hundreds of faiths that have emerged in 
Indonesia. As an effort to revitalize the PAKEM [Oversight of 
Faiths Among the People] Team, Attorney General Singgih, S.H. 
[Master of Laws], installed the Central PAKEM Coordination Team 
at the Attorney General's Office Building in Jakarta. 
  From the time it was formed in 1949 until 1993, the PAKEM 
banned 523 faiths. The team's job is to receive and analyze 
reports and/or information about faiths among the people. The 
PAKEM Team also has the job of carefully researching and 
evaluating developments in particular faiths to ascertain their 
impact on public order and security. 
  At the central level, the team is chaired by the attorney 
general, with the deputy attorney general for intelligence as 
deputy chairman. Other members of the PAKEM Team include the 
director general of sociopolitical affairs of the Department of 
Home Affairs, the director general of culture at the Department 
of Education and Culture, the assistant for territorial affairs 
to the ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] chief of General Staff, 
the second deputy to the chief of the State Intelligence 
Coordinating Agency, and the director of intelligence and 
security for the Indonesian Police. 
  As he installed the Central PAKEM Coordination Team, 
Attorney 
General Singgih said that the heterogeneity of the Indonesian 
people with respect to ethnic groups, religions, races, classes, 
cultures, and languages provides potential for the emergence of 
interference with national unity and integrity. 
  "The Central PAKEM Team has been formed to oversee the 
activities of faiths to ensure that they will not plunge into 
endeavors that could threaten the order of society and state 
under applicable laws," he stated. According to Singgih, the 
PAKEM Team will also face challenges and obstacles that must be 
resolved collectively with regard to legal materials, 
coordination among involved agencies, facilities, and 
infrastructure. 
  Nevertheless, the attorney general said he was confident 
that 
by looking sharply at the problems being faced and by carefully 
formulating efforts to deal with them--and equipped with the 
experience of its members--the team will be able to take 
integrated action to handle the various issues involved in 
overseeing faiths among the people. 
  Meanwhile, Soeparman, S.H., chief of public relations for 
the 
Attorney General's Office, said that the background of the 
revitalization of the PAKEM Team is the flow of globalization, 
which makes possible the entrance of foreign or existing faiths 
that could influence faiths already present in Indonesia. 
  In principle, the government will ban faiths that deviate 
from GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] provisions on the 
subject, namely that the promotion of faith in One God must not 
be oriented to the formation of new religions and that such 
promotion must be in accordance with the first and second 
principles of Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian state]. 
  Faiths that deviate and are banned are those that are not 
consistent with Indonesia's national political, economic, 
social, and cultural conditions, he explained.

  [Text] The Philippines will push for the implementation of 
the agreement to set up an arms registry within the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations to monitor conventional arms buildup 
in the region at a special ASEAN senior officials' meeting on 7 
March in Bangkok, Thailand. 
  The 7 to 9 March meeting will take up solutions to "dampen 
friction" within the region by coming up with methods to contain 
potential flashpoints in East Asia, Foreign Affairs 
Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said. The meeting will be 
attended by high-level foreign affairs, defense and security 
officials in the region. Severino said that instead of tackling 
specific issues, such as the territorial disputes in the South 
China Sea involving the Spratly and Paracel Islands, the 
conference will discuss "general means" to sustain the political 
stability in Southeast Asia. 
  For instance, instead of talking about North Korea's nuclear 
sites, ASEAN senior officials would focus on making the region 
nuclear-free, Severino said. 
  The "operationalization" of a previous agreement to monitor 
conventional arms buildup within the ASEAN is also one of the 
items to be discussed during the meeting. 
  An arms registry has already been set up in Singapore but 
the 
agreement has yet to be implemented. The program is patterned 
after the United Nations, in which conventional arms purchases 
and development are monitored and inventoried, and transparency 
in weapons buildup is ensured, Severino said. 
  The meeting will also discuss the implementation of a 
separate agreement among ASEAN members on disaster-relief 
operations. The agreement calls ASEAN countries to coordinate 
efforts in helping member-states in disaster-relief operations 
through technical and financial assistance. 
  Severino said there have also been proposals to set up a 
security body within the ASEAN to settle disputes among member 
nations, although the group has been approaching the issue 
cautiously due to possible misperceptions that it might be a 
prelude to setting up a military alliance within the region. 
  Meanwhile, Severino said that the territorial dispute in the 
South China Sea involving the Spratly Islands will be one of the 
talking points during the 11 March bilateral consultations 
between the Philippines and Vietnam scheduled in Manila. The 
Philippines, Vietnam, China, Malaysia, and Brunei have asserted 
claims either in whole or in part on the oils-rich Spratlys. The 
Philippines will reiterate its desire for the peaceful 
resolution of the territorial dispute during the RP [Republic of 
the Philippines]-Vietnam talks. China and Vietnam have the 
potential to use force in settling their claims. 
  The Philippines will also bring up during the discussions 
the 
situation of some 200 "boat people" or refugees in Bataan who 
have been ensured of resettlement but were later abandoned by 
the United States.

  [Text] American investment in Thailand may be affected if 
Singapore and Korea are accepted into the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), says M.R. Napthong Thongyai, chief of 
the Thai Commercial Counsellor's Office in Washington. 
Singapore, an ASEAN member, and Korea have approached the NAFTA 
partners -- the United States, Canada and Mexico -- to become 
members of what is already the world's largest free-trade zone. 
  According to M.R. Napthong, the US Trade Representative's 
office has informed the Thai Commerce Ministry of the two 
countries' overtures. Mexico once opposed to the idea of new 
NAFTA's members, appears to be doing an about-face and has 
recently suggested that other countries in South America could 
join the pact. 
  A Commerce Ministry source said that if Singapore and Korea 
were accepted into NAFTA, US investments in other ASEAN 
countries including Thailand would be affected. The source noted 
that Singapore would be a target for criticism from members of 
the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] unless it offered similar 
preferential tariffs to members of both trade blocs. 
  He said Singapore may offer lower tariffs on certain items 
traded among NAFTA members or shorter enforcement time frames 
than those offered to AFTA members. Singapore has long been 
known in favour of such an agreement, so many ASEAN members fear 
it would offer the US the best deals. 
  If NAFTA covered Korea, it may erode the competitiveness of 
Thai exports in certain items such as textiles and electronic 
products in the United States, said the source. 
  Another source in the Business Economics Department said 
there would be little impact on Thai exports to the United 
States since Thailand enjoyed lower rates on products such as 
computers under the Generalised System of Preferences. 
  Singapore is the second-biggest exporter of computers to the 
United States with a 17.2 percent market share. Japan's share 
is 35.2 percent. 
  The source said Thai exports of textiles, which account for 
2.6 percent of the US market, would not suffer because a 
bilateral agreement ensured export quotas.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday welcomed 
Cambodia's call for urgent talks on the two countries' 
overlapping maritime boundary, saying that Thailand has long 
wished to settle the issue through dialogue. Prasong said 
Thailand is ready for talks with Cambodian authorities about the 
unclear land and sea boundary and for beginning joint 
development projects with the country in case an agreement 
cannot be reached on the disputed areas. 
  He was referring to a report that Cambodian Under Secretary 
of State for Industry, Mines and Energy Nheap Bunchin had called 
for urgent dialogue with Thailand over the unclear maritime zone 
following the discovery of local offshore oil in January. 
"Thailand welcomes the call for boundary talks and we hope that 
the countries involved can tackle the matter through dialogue," 
he said. 
  On January 17, a Japanese consortium, Kampek, struck oil in 
the Apsara Field's Block One about 200 km southwest of 
Sihanoukville in the Gulf of Thailand. Bunchin claimed that 
news of the find had sparked a rush of proposals from oil 
explorers. 
  Prasong said the proposed talks will help determine whether 
the oil is in Cambodia's waters or not. 
  Thailand and Cambodia have yet to set up a joint boundary 
committee, usually headed by a deputy foreign minister. 
Cambodia had initially put on the shelf Thailand's proposal for 
setting up the committee. During his official visit to Phnom 
Penh, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai had suggested the two 
countries form a joint boundary committee as a mechanism to deal 
with possible boundary disputes. In a joint communique signed at 
the end of Chuan's visit, the two countries agreed that the 
proposed boundary committee be set up in due course. 
  An informed source meanwhile said Phnom Penh probably lacks 
professional personnel to deal with the complex issues involved 
after two decades of wars, and because it is now in a difficult 
transitional period of reconstruction.

  [Text] The government has not been supporting Thai 
business people allegedly involved in illegal business in 
Cambodia, Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan said yesterday. 
The Cambodian government should be responsible for foreign 
investors, including Thais, Amnuai said. It is common for 
foreign investors to be involved in unlawful business in other 
countries, he said. 
  The government has warned Thai business people not to engage 
in illegal activities in foreign countries, and only a few Thais 
were allegedly involved in such activity, he said. "Every 
country has such a problem, which is solvable," Amnuai said. 
  Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi said over the weekend 
that a handful of foreign investors, including Thais, have 
well-established mafia-type links and were deeply involved in 
money laundering and drug trafficking activities in that country.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has praised China 
for its assistance in the repatriation of Thai workers. 
  The Department of Information says a total of 223 Thai 
workers were persuaded to work in Shenzhen, Guangzhou [as heard] 
Province, the People's Republic of China. Each worker was 
charged a commission of 50,000 baht. When the workers arrived 
in Shenzhen, the broker seized their passports and they were 
later abandoned by their employers. 
  The office of Thai Consulate General in Guangzhou has worked 
with Chinese authorities in repatriating Thai workers late last 
year by China's Southern Airline. The Shenzhen local 
administration agreed to pay 1.5 million baht for the air fares 
as a gesture of friendship between the peoples of both 
countries. The ministry says the assistance provided to the 
Thai workers will help strengthen relations between Thailand and 
China.

<F P=106> [Article by Kiatchai Phongphanit: "Burma-ASEAN, An </F>
Expensive Investment"] 
  [Text] It is rather apparent that Thailand is very eager 
to invite Burma to the ASEAN ministerial meeting it will host in 
Bangkok in July. One can recall that Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri has tried to bring Burma to the ASEAN meeting as an 
observer. Thailand has openly made known its position on this 
matter. 
  No one knows whether the invitation, which is common 
knowledge, to Burma was in exchange for something from that 
country. However, the foreign minister's visit to Burma was 
followed by an increase in trade contracts between the two 
countries. More important, several hundred Thai fishermen were 
released by Burma. 
  In any event, the foreign minister has not relaxed his 
drive. 
He has tried to lobby fellow ASEAN countries to see the merit 
of inviting Burma to the ASEAN meeting with full observer 
status. He said during a recent official visit to Manila that 
he saw no complications in inviting Burma for consultations with 
ASEAN. The Thai foreign minister's stand is clear. 
  It is difficult to understand the eagerness on the part of 
Thailand when other ASEAN countries do not seem to be concerned 
if Burma avoids involvement in ASEAN at this time. Singapore 
did not invite Burma as an observer to the ASEAN ministerial 
meeting it hosted last year. A result of Singapore's skillful 
diplomacy is that it was able to avoid negative comments from 
the countries which were applying pressure against Burma. 
  Vietnam attended the Singapore meeting last year as an 
observer, signifying a degree of acceptance of that country by 
ASEAN. However, during his recent visit to Vietnam Singapore 
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that country should not 
consider joining ASEAN for another year or two. 
  Thailand's diplomatic skills trail those of Singapore. At 
this point we should make known our position that the time is 
now right for Vietnam to join ASEAN. The Vietnamese 
administrative system can hardly be an obstruction. The Burmese 
system is just as lamentable; how can Thailand justify its 
endeavor in favor of Burma? Thailand cannot avoid strong 
criticism on this matter. The long-term repercussion will be 
considerable because we will be on the opposite side of the 
superpowers who are applying pressure against Burma. 
  We cannot even correctly choose sides; what else is there to 
say about this bungling? 
  A point to be concerned with is losing face if Thailand's 
eagerness does not receive the expected response. So far we 
have not heard about the Burmese position regarding how eager it 
is to accept an ASEAN invitation. 
  It is likely that this year Burma will be occupied with its 
domestic problems more so than it might be with ASEAN matters 
because it knows that its acceptance will not be easy. Burma 
has seen the Vietnam case as an example, and it will be forced 
to think even harder. 
  Burma will be pressured by many events. One will be the fact 
that the ASEAN ministerial meeting will be held in July, the 
same month that Aung San Suu Kyi's detention is scheduled to 
end. There are rumors that Suu Kyi's detention will be 
extended. A refusal to release her will essentially disqualify 
Burma from joining the international community. Pressure from 
the United States, the UK, and the European Union will increase, 
and an ASEAN action concerning Burma could lead to a future 
confrontation with those countries. Thailand will not be able 
avoid their dissatisfaction because it led the campaign to 
invite Burma. 
  There is an ambitious anticipation that because the group in 
power allowed a U.S. congressman to meet Suu Kyi, a settlement 
between her and the Burmese Government is possible. THE 
ECONOMIST even ridiculed Congressman Richardson's grandeur about 
a meeting between Suu Kyi and Khin Nyunt "even if they only 
discuss the weather." 
  Another problem facing Burma is peace talks with minority 
groups. These talks will never reach concrete agreements as in 
the accord with the Kachins. On this subject, Thailand was 
accused of forcing minority groups to negotiate and accept 
conditions set by the military dictatorship in Rangoon. 
  Burma will be forced to exert efforts to achieve concrete 
achievements in these areas. To join ASEAN merely to show that 
it has become part of the international community will not help 
Burma solve the minority problem. 
  The drafting of the Constitution by the Rangoon power 
holders 
is a joke, not only because there are conditions that retain the 
military leadership role, but the Burmese military dictatorship 
has already started to arrest people who oppose the drafting and 
the conditions. The constitution will fuel new, violent 
political confrontation, and chaos will be unending. 
  What qualifications does Burma have for Thailand to invite 
its participation in ASEAN? By offering an invitation, Thailand 
will be viewed as engaging in trade and association with that 
country only to exploit it for short-term and unethical reasons. 
  It is anticipated that as the ASEAN meeting in Bangkok in 
July approaches, U.S. pressure against Burma will increase. The 
U.S. policy toward Burma will be more aggressive in conjunction 
with pressure from U.S. allies such as the UK, France, 
Australia, the Scandinavian countries, the European Union, 
Japan, and the United Nations. 
  The main demands of the group applying pressure against 
Burma 
are the unconditional release of Suu Kyi and the return of 
legitimate power to the group which won the general election in 
1990, improved human rights, and the formation of a democratic 
government acceptable to the world community. 
  Burma has apparently done nothing in these areas. In the 
eyes of the world, the so-called "constructive engagement" has 
not done anything constructive for Burma, only constructive 
business dealings. One cannot understand why there is such 
eagerness to invite Burma to the upcoming ASEAN meeting. Will 
this investment turn out to be too expensive? Where can 
Thailand hide its face if Burma feels that it should tackle its 
problems first and reject the invitation?

  [Text] Burma has agreed in principle to the construction 
of a bridge over the Moei River linking Tak province with 
Mywaddy, and has accepted Thailand's offer of financial support 
for construction expenses, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said 
yesterday. Prasong said his Burmese counterpart, U Ohn Gyaw, has 
endorsed Thailand's initiative for the construction of the 
bridge to link Tak's Mae Sot district with Mywaddy. The Cabinet 
last week agreed to the Foreign Ministry proposal that Thailand 
take responsibility for funding construction of the bridge, 
because Burma is not prepared to do so. However, it asked the 
ministry to make sure Burma wants the bridge. 
  "U Ohn Gyaw informed me during my official visit to Rangoon 
for a Joint Commission meeting that Burma wants the bridge," 
Prasong said. The bridge is expected to boost border trade and 
tourism in the area. 
  Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem 
yesterday informed Burmese Ambassador to Thailand U Phone Myint 
of the Cabinet resolution last week to fund construction of the 
bridge. 
  Thailand initially considered other options related to the 
project, including a proposal that Tak province's private sector 
construct a temporary bridge at the same location. Tak's private 
sector wants the temporary bridge immediately, while waiting for 
a decision on the main bridge by the two governments.

  [Text] At present, foreign investors have more confidence 
in investing in Thailand. Japan has now categorized Thailand as 
the world's fourth most favorable country for investments. Mr. 
Suphachai Phanitchaphak, deputy prime minister, said that 
because of this sense of confidence, Japan is planning to move 
automobile spare parts and computer parts production bases to 
Thailand. This is because it is predicted that the trend of 
Thailand's economic growth rate this year will be even higher 
due to the expansion of investment in both the public and 
private sectors. 
  [Begin Suphachai recording] While the rate of our economic 
development growth is, in my opinion, rather good this year -- 
at least eight percent -- the inflation rate here is between 
three and four percent, which is lower than the world's average 
inflation rate. Therefore, we should not worry about our 
financial stability. The same is true with the stability of our 
exchange rates. This is because at this point our monetary 
reserves amount to U.S. $26 billion so far, thus making our 
country rank one among the world's top ten for most favorable 
places for investment. With such a large volume of monetary 
reserves on hand, we should not have any concern about the 
natural flow of our cash. [end recording] 
  The deputy prime minister, however, admitted that Thailand 
still encounters problems in agricultural production. The 
government has paid special attention to this development and 
has encouraged farmers to switch from planting low-priced crops 
to growing other alternative crops which fetch better prices. 
The government has already provided low interest rate loans to 
farmers who wish to do so. In addition, the government is now 
keeping a close watch on the approved investment projects in 
Zone 3 to see whether the trend of investment has expanded from 
the zone's center to its sub regions or not so that a cross 
border link-up can be set up with the economies of some 
neighboring countries. In the meantime, the government is 
speeding up the implementation of a project to link the eastern 
region with the northeast. This project has already been 
approved and its construction designs laid out. 
  [Begin Suphachai recording] At the beginning of last year, 
applications for government approval to invest in Zone 3 
increased five fold or 500 percent. We are now waiting to see 
how much money these investors, who received approval from the 
government, will spend on their initial investment and in which 
direction these investments will expand. Since the investment 
has been targeted for the center of Zone 3, we have yet to see 
whether it will be expanded to the zone's sub regions, 
especially border areas with neighboring countries. This trend 
will pave the way for our economy to spread out from the center 
to remote regions, especially border areas. There is a bright 
prospect of success in this direction because the Asian 
Development Bank and other countries have rendered support to 
such endeavors. I believe that problems in the remote border 
areas will be resolved more smoothly. [end recording]

  [Text] It has been learned on 8 March that the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team for 
North Korean nuclear facilities, which began it activities on 3 
March, is not proceeding well with inspections. 
  A high-ranking government official said on 8 March, "North 
Korea is objecting to some of the IAEA's inspection activities. 
Particularly, it is rejecting the extraction of samples from a 
radioactive chemistry laboratory in Yongbyon which is estimated 
to be a nuclear reprocessing facility." 
  The official continued, "North Korea and the IAEA agreed in 
Vienna to the extraction of samples from the radioactive 
chemistry laboratory although the extraction of samples from the 
five-megawatt reactor is not possible because it is not a 
replacement of a fuel rod. There can be no concession because 
this is the core of the IAEA inspection." 
  The government authority added: "However, we have to wait 
and 
see to judge whether the IAEA inspection team's activities are 
successfully concluded. That will be around this weekend or 
early next week."

  [Text] Seoul, March 8 (YONHAP) -- The United States urged 
South Korea to strengthen its intellectual property protection 
to harmonize with the Uruguay Round agreement in trade talks 
here Tuesday. A delegation led by U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade 
Representative Peter Collins met with Seoul officials for 
negotiations focusing on intellectual property and opening the 
South Korean market to American cars. 
  The talks opened just weeks before a report will be 
submitted 
to the U.S. Congress on the status of South Korea's intellectual 
property rights protection. A final decision on whether to drop 
South Korea from the priority watch list or label it as a 
priority foreign country is due late next month. 
  Washington is demanding that Seoul continue to crack down on 
violators and upgrade its laws to match those of the 
trade-related intellectual properties (TRIPs) of the Uruguay 
Round. For instance, a movie with an acknowledged copyright in 
one country automatically receives the same copyright protection 
in all other nations under the terms of TRIPs. South Korean law, 
however, only recognizes a movie copyright from after 1987. 
Seoul explained that it conducted a special crackdown on 
violators in the January-October period last year, which helped 
improve the situation. 
  On another front, Washington took issue with various 
barriers 
in South Korea when buying U.S. cars such as high tariffs and 
the acquisition tax. U.S. officials also described what they 
saw as psychological barriers, such as worries about a tax audit 
when purchasing a foreign automobile. Seoul replied that it does 
not erect such barriers and that its current 10 percent tariff 
is not high compared with common international practice. It 
explained the rate has already been lowered from 15 percent and 
thus cannot be reduced further this year. The European union 
also levies a 10 percent tariff on imported cars, South Korea 
pointed out.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Unreasonable Demand by the United States and </F>
Our Attitude on Countermeasures"] 
  [Text] The United States has aimed at Japan a gun called 
the Super 301. At the same time the United States is demanding 
that we reduce our automobile tariff rate. In the past, the 
United States has expressed satisfaction over the ROK's schedule 
for opening up. Therefore, it seems that a visible apprehensive 
element will not immediately appear at the upcoming ROK-U.S. 
trade negotiations. However, since the United States is 
continuously showing interest in our automobiles, 
communications, and intellectual property rights, and is even 
demanding the improvement of the ROK's system and business 
practices, a detailed countermeasure is necessary in this field. 
  Looking at the ROK, the United States recognizes that we may 
become a second Japan. It is necessary to turn our attention to 
this view. We do not have elaborate organizations for domestic 
dealings, a distribution network like a spider's web, and 
business practices like Japan. Therefore, there is no reason 
for us to be unnecessarily misunderstood. 
  The United States is demanding that we reduce the tariff 
rate 
of U.S. automobiles -- currently 10 percent -- to 2.5 percent. 
When we consider the fact that Europe imposes a 10 percent 
import tariff rate on foreign made cars, it is difficult to 
accept the U.S. demand. The United States is picking a quarrel 
on special excise and local taxes imposed according to the car's 
engine displacement. The tariff rate must be readjusted in some 
cases, but we cannot give special treatment to foreign goods by 
changing our domestic law. 
  The U.S. intention is to increase the number of its cars in 
the ROK market. Even though we cannot accept all the conditions 
the United States is demanding, we must bear in mind the hidden 
message it is giving us. It is now inevitable for ROK 
businesses to be more exposed to competition with foreign 
businesses. We must realize that the arena for competition is 
even affecting our domestic market. 
  In the process of economic development in the past 30 years, 
which was mainly centered on exports, ROK consumers were sort of 
forced to sacrifice themselves to assist export products. 
Consumers could not but endure high price and low-quality goods. 
Strengthening competitiveness is important in an international 
environment, but promoting the consumer's convenience is another 
important yardstick in judging competitiveness. 
  We cannot face the demands for opening up through 
negotiations alone. We must accelerate competitiveness among 
domestic businesses to strengthen their structure. However, 
this is also a difficult matter. Furthermore, the people's 
demands to obtain high-quality goods at cheap prices are 
increasing. Even though we have opened up, import is a 
monopolistic structure and the distribution level is 
complicated, thus, the benefits of openness are not being spread 
equally. 
  The government must bear this in mind. It is also necessary 
for the government to resolutely revise the domestic system 
related to imports. When considering the general trend, the 
attitude of domestic businesses is to be competitive with cheap 
and high-quality goods and services. Also, businesses must bear 
in mind that they can no longer expect nor can they receive more 
assistance from the government and the people.

<F P=106> [From the "Reporter's Eyes" column by Yang Ki-tae] </F>
  [Text] Does the U.S. Super 301 (comprehensive trade law) 
mean the era of U.S. economic hegemony has begun? 
  An ROK trade specialist said, "The ideal of free trade which 
led the post-war international trade, is now in name only. The 
measure is a signal that the United States will play the role of 
international police and judge in economic issues as well." 
  An official of the Korea Foreign Trade Association said, "By 
the measure, the United States declared economic hegemony and 
that it will take any pretext and means to exercise power for 
the nation's economic interest. In the future, the only 
economic theory to survive is `power is justice.'" 
  ROK trade specialists say the most serious problem of the 
issue is that no country can restrain U.S. hegemonism after the 
dissolution of the former Soviet Union. 
  The fact that the United States is preparing to make 
reprisals through the Super 301 on Japan which said "no" in the 
U.S.-Japan summit talks held in February, is a declaration of 
war that anyone who challenges the authority of the United 
States cannot be left intact. It will be difficult for the 
United States, a country leading the international order, to 
avoid the denunciation that it is ignoring international 
promises and trust by restoring the Super 301 under the excuse 
of its national trade deficit. 
  It has been denounced that the United States, which had 
caused much dispute with nations concerned during Uruguay Round 
[UR] negotiations, is exercising individual retaliation, such as 
the Super 301, when the agreements are still fresh. Because the 
United States is showing its greediness by such an action 
ignoring the UR spirit although the contents of the agreements 
show the U.S. interests were reflected most. 
  It is more of a blow that the U.S. action nullifies the 
World 
Trade Organization [WTO] after it had agreed to establish the 
WTO for the management and supervision of free trade order 
beginning next year. 
  It has been pointed out that if the United States were to 
seek only its own national interests even before the start of 
the new trade order agreed by the world, it should not have 
begun the international negotiation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Concern Over U.S. Managed Trade"] </F>
  [Text] The United States has revived Super 301 at last. 
This is a natural outcome of discontent with Japan, which 
evades the essence of the question each time by making up for 
poor U.S.-Japan relations in an impromptu manner. 
  In fact, the United States put forward an offensive trade 
policy "befitting" the post-Cold War era during the summit with 
Japan last month. In other words, it declared that there will be 
no more "empty" joint statements to be adopted merely for the 
sake of formalities between the allies. Thus, there is an 
indication that so-called managed trade [kwalli muyok], which is 
intended to reduce red figures in trade with Japan by 
establishing a quantitative standard in the U.S. export of 
commodities to Japan, will become the U.S. strategy. The 
revival of Super 301 can be seen as an extension of the 
offensive trade policy suggested during the summit. 
  We fully understand the discontent with Japan roaring in 
across U.S. society. In fact, there is no such a nation like 
Korea which has been exhausted by the closed economy of Japan 
which dashed only toward the balance in the black. 
Nevertheless, we cannot stand on the U.S. side. In other 
words, we have no objection to the fundamental principle of 
encouraging Japan to realize the inevitability of opening up. 
However, we cannot agree with the method of the U.S. practice. 
  The World Trade Organization [WTO], which 118 nations agreed 
to jointly establish during the talks in Geneva last December, 
has not yet been officially formed. At this very point, Super 
301, which seeks unilateral sanctions and retaliation, has been 
revived. Thus, its revival can be said as an unjust, dangerous 
act of disturbing settlement and development of the WTO, which 
intends to pursue opening and multilateralism. 
  Moreover, the red figures in U.S. trade are attributable to 
its own chronic financial red figures and to the trend of its 
excessive consumption. Therefore, once the United States 
assumes an offensive posture, retaliation will undoubtedly be 
expanded. This is because the ROK and Taiwan will attempt to 
fill up the vacuum created due to reduction in Japan's export of 
goods to the United States, and the United States will shift the 
target of retaliation on others. 
  On the other hand, Japan's unilateral concession, designed 
to 
avoid retaliation, cannot be defined as the best method for 
problem settlement. If a solution to the pending problems is 
sought from the standpoint of managed trade, Japan's concession 
will merely heighten the possibility of Japanese business 
circles' "autonomous" expansion of imports of U.S. commodities, 
and will the reduce shares [chibun] of European and small 
countries' in the Japanese market. 
  At this point, we would like to call on the United States to 
abandon managed trade and on Japan to boldly unbar the gate to 
its domestic markets. We also urge the ROK Government to seek 
solidarity forces in the multilateral trade system, in the 
Asian-Pacific conference, and in the Northeast Asian arena, 
instead of merely announcing protest statements and watching the 
trend of the situation, and to work out diversified strategy for 
national survival in a bid to expand the scope of choice. Our 
international circumstances may be aggravated to such an extent 
that even regionalism, which we do not wish, should be regarded 
as a supplementary step. 
  From the outset, diplomacy is aimed at seeking the best 
result while preparing for the worst situation. The ROK should 
work to unite strength with other states in Northeast Asia by 
developing regional forums and should make efforts to persuade 
the United States and defend the multilateral trade system.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Cha-su: "U.S. Trade Pressure and Government </F>
Countermeasures"] 
  [Text] The United States is now stepping up the trade 
pressure that had abated temporarily. It appears as though U.S. 
trade pressure will be amplified since the Super 301 provision 
was revived on 3 March. Accordingly, the government is taking 
pains to prepare countermeasures against the U.S. trade pressure. 
  At present, the United States is interested, most of all, in 
opening the auto market wider and hastening the opening of the 
services sector. On 7 March, the United States dispatched Peter 
Collins, U.S. deputy assistant trade representative in charge of 
Asia and Pacific affairs, to the ROK to make a full-scale demand 
for the ROK to open its auto market. 
  The United States believes that the 120 to 1, car imports to 
exports ratio is in a state of great imbalance because of tariff 
and non-tariff barriers in the ROK, and are strongly demanding 
that the ROK adjust this. First complaining of the ROK's 10 
percent tariff on passenger cars compared to its 2.5 percent 
tariff, the United States said that because the special excise 
tax is imposed according to differential tariff rates, the 
competitive strength of large U.S. cars is diminished. Tax 
probes of buyers of foreign cars, and the inability of U.S. car 
makers to secure broadcast advertisement time were cited as 
additional barriers to the advance of U.S. cars in the ROK 
market. 
  Apparently, U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade Representative 
Collins will also discuss the issue of intellectual property 
rights with ROK Government officials. The United States placed 
the ROK on its list of countries subject to priority 
surveillance. Although the ROK has strengthened the protection 
of intellectual property rights over the past several years, 
illegal duplication of software programs and trademark 
infringements by enterprises have yet to be rooted out. This is 
another source of U.S. complaints. In connection with this, the 
government will notify the United States of our policy of 
strongly cracking down on infringements of intellectual property 
rights, and at the same time will ask the United States to 
exclude the ROK from its list of countries subject to priority 
surveillance. 
  The government feels that we do not have to unconditionally 
meet the U.S. demand for market opening, but that we can cope 
according to our own plan. In other words, because our 
government has already begun to open up each field according to 
its policy of openness, it simply plans to seek the full 
understanding of the United States by explaining the situation. 
The government will also convey its concern over the revival of 
the Super 301 provision to the United States, pointing out that 
the provision runs counter to the spirit of forming the World 
Trade Organization, which is to be inaugurated next year with 
the conclusion of Uruguay Round negotiations. 
  Government officials explain that trade issues recently 
raised by the United States differ in character from those of 
the past, and that our government is not being unilaterally 
pressured. A Foreign Ministry official said: "That fact that 
the United States is still interested in our country in its 
demand for further opening of our markets, is a positive sign." 
He continued: "A bigger problem is that people in the United 
States are now talking of giving up on the ROK market to focus 
on Japan and China instead."

  [Text] Seoul, March 8 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government will readjust its North Korea policy of linking the 
nuclear issue with economic cooperation if the proposed exchange 
of special envoys proceeds smoothly, sources said Tuesday. 
  As a result, inter-Korean economic cooperation could start 
as 
early as next month, they said. 
  Such cooperation would include permission for South Korean 
businessmen to visit the North, investment in the Najin-Sonbong 
and Nampo free economic zones and the establishment of direct 
shipping lines to North Korea, they added. 
  The sources, from both the administration and the business 
sector, said Seoul has already decided to stop linking the issue 
of Pyongyang's nuclear program with inter-Korean economic 
cooperation if a special envoy from either side visits the 
other's capital this month. 
  The government plans to finalize the decision at a meeting 
of 
national security-related ministers after watching developments 
at the next round of working-level contacts at Panmunjom 
scheduled for Wednesday. 
  A formal announcement on the government's amended North 
Korea 
policy could come shortly after Washington holds a third round 
of high-level talks with Pyongyang in Geneva on March 21, they 
said. 
  One government source said, "tension on the Korean peninsula 
has eased greatly as a result of North Korea's acceptance of 
outside inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  "It is now the time to resume working toward inter-Korean 
economic cooperation, which has been suspended for more than a 
year," he added. 
  "If the U.S.-North Korean talks proceed smoothly and North 
Korea doesn't suddenly change its attitude toward the exchange 
of special envoys, the government will announce the change in 
its North Korea policy around March 23," he said. 
  Seoul, however, has not ruled out the possibility that 
Pyongyang's attitude could change or circumstances on the Korean 
peninsula could worsen, forcing a policy readjustment, the 
source said, asking for anonymity. 
  In addition to increased investment in the North Korean free 
economic zones, South Korea will push plans to establish 
inter-Korean economic liaison offices, liaison offices of big 
businesses in the truce village of Panmunjom and direct shipping 
routes to the North. 
  As for visits to the North by South Korean businessmen, the 
government could give the go-ahead as early as next month while 
sending working-level missions to the North to sound out 
investment opportunities, they said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 8 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean trade 
dropped sharply in February from the same month of 1993, the 
Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said Tuesday. South-North 
trade fell by 34.1 percent to 12,578,000 U.S. dollars last month 
from a year earlier. The drop was attributed to a 49.8-percent 
decrease in South Korean purchases of metals, including gold and 
zinc ingots, from the North compared to a year ago. However, 
South Korea's sale to the North soared, although the figure was 
still low compared to purchase. The South sold about 699,000 
dollars worth of goods to the North last month, compared to 
43,000 dollars the year before, thanks to increased shipments of 
textiles and raw and subsidiary materials for "processing on 
commission trade."

<F P=106> [Article by An Song-kyu: "Comparison of National Power </F>
Between North and South Korea Based on 1992"] 
  [Text] It has been learned that South Korea is six times 
richer than North Korea, compared with their people's standard 
of living. 
  The section in charge of North Korean affairs of the 
Institute for the National Unification (Section Chief So 
Chae-chin) examined the difference of national power between 
North and South Korea in seven areas such as politics, social 
management capacity, economy, education, science and technology, 
military capacity, and diplomatic capacity for two years since 
1992. These facts have been disclosed in a thesis "A 
Comparative Study of National Power Between North and South 
Korea" issued by the institute on 7 March. To examine the 
difference of economic capacity between the North and South, the 
section in charge of North Korean affairs used the Kline model 
based on the GNP, energy and mineral resources, industrial 
productive capacity, food production, and trade volume. In 
assessing the difference of their economic capacity, the 
institute gave 100 points to the GNP and 20 points to other five 
areas. 
  Accordingly, as of 1990, South Korea received 110 points in 
total economic capacity, while North Korea received 18 points. 
This shows that South Korea's economic capacity is six times 
larger than that of North Korea. 
  The Kline index, based on South Korea's GNP, shows a 100:10 
ratio in economic capacity. This indicates that South Korea's 
economic capacity is 10 times larger than that of North Korea. 
This shows that the difference of economic capacity between the 
North and South has been widened more compared with the 100:78 
ratio in 1960 and of 100:50 in 1970. 
  In 1990, South Korea's GNP was $237.9 billion. South Korea's 
GNP has increased 179 times from $1.35 billion in 1953, while 
North Korea -- with a GNP of $23.1 billion in 1990 -- has 
increased 53 times from $440 million in 1953. The Kline 
industrial index based on the production of iron and steel 
products, aluminum, and cement shows that South Korea has 
received 19 points while North Korea has received 8 points. 
This indicates that South Korea's industrial capacity is 2.4 
times larger than that of North Korea. 
  In the manufacturing business area, South Korea is three 
times more advanced than North Korea; in iron and steel 
products, four times; in automobile production capacity, 57 
times; in shipbuilding capacity, 16 times; in chemical 
production capacity, two times; in refinery capacity, 12 times; 
and in cement production capacity, four times. 
  The index in the social indirect capital areas, including 
transportation and communication -- which was assessed 
separately by the section in charge of North Korean affairs -- 
shows that South Korea has received 20 points while North Korea 
has received 6. This indicates that South Korea is three times 
more advanced than North Korea. 
  The total length of South Korea's roads is 56,715 km, with 
71.5 percent of them paved, while the length of North Korea's 
roads is 23,000 km, with 10 percent of them paved. 
  North Korea possesses 264,000 cars while South Korea has 
3.39 
million cars. This indicates that South Korea has 13 times more 
cars than North Korea. 
  In 1990, South Korea's harbor loading and unloading capacity 
was 224.35 million tons while North Korea's is 34.90 million 
tons. 
  The Kline index in the external trade sector -- which shows 
the country's trade position in the global economy -- indicates 
that South Korea has received 20 points while North Korea has 
received 1. South Korea's trade position is 20 times firmer than 
that of North Korea. 
  The trade volume of South Korea is $134.8 billion while that 
of North Korea is $4.7 billion. South Korea has 28 times more 
trade volume than North Korea. 
  It has been learned that North Korea's self-sufficient index 
in food, mineral resources, and energy is higher than that of 
South Korea. The self-sufficient index in food shows that South 
Korea has received minus 20 points while North Korea has 
received minus 3. South Korea imported 11.18 million tons of 
food from foreign countries in 1991 while North Korea imported 
1.6 million tons. The self-sufficient index in energy, 
including oil, coal, gas, and power plants, shows that South 
Korea has received minus 12 points while North Korea has 
received minus one. 
  The amount of South Korea's oil imports in 1990 was 55.90 
million TOE (1 TOE equals to 7.3 barrel), while North Korea 
imported 3.55 million TOE. 
  The mineral resource index shows that South Korea has 
received minus 17 points while North Korea has received minus 
three. This has been comprehensively assessed based on North 
and South Korea's dependency on foreign countries in minerals 
necessary for the heavy and military industries.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Excerpts] The PRC's ship freight volume is expected to 
grow to 1.5 billion tons in 10 years. Because China's economic 
development is impossible without additional seaports, China has 
long envied those on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, it is now 
becoming more interested in the Tumen River Development Program. 
The land routes of North Korea, barriers to freight 
transportation in northeastern Asia, will be opened by Chinese 
pressure. As a consequence, the unification of Korea may occur. 
Korea should construct many more seaports and meet neighboring 
countries' wishes. Korea without numerous seaports is a useless 
country. 
  When one looks at a map of Asia or the world, one can find 
something that one may overlook when viewing a map with only the 
separated Korean peninsula. This is the geopolitical and 
geoeconomic importance of the Korean peninsula. The Yellow Sea 
is a huge gulf and a harbor situated in east-northeastern Asia. 
The Koreans live on a continental bridge, linking the continent 
with the ocean. 
  The Korean peninsula is what one calls a gateway to the 
continent and a base for managing the ocean. It is such an 
important region geopolitically that communist and capitalist 
powers came into conflict with each other to produce the tragic 
38th parallel. [passage omitted] 
  China relies on coastal transportation to move freight which 
exceeds the capacity of its roads and railroads. The total 1992 
Chinese freight transportation volume was 650 million tons. 
Some 280 million tons, including 4000 tons of transit freight, 
were import-export freight and 350 million tons were domestic 
coast-to-coast transportation freight. 
  If Chinese ship freight volume grows at this pace, it will 
exceed more than 1.5 billion tons in 10 years. The problem is 
that Chinese harbors do not have the capacity to receive that 
much freight volume. This is why the Korean peninsula is 
regarded as being of great value. Because the waters of the 
Chinese harbors are mostly shallow due to the earth and sand 
flowing out from the Yellow River, big ships cannot enter and 
leave the ports. Therefore, despite 21 open ports, all harbors 
except for Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou 
are of little use. [passage omitted] 
  Of the 1.5 billion tons of ship freight in 10 years, even if 
1 billion tons are barely managed at its own harbors, for the 
rest of the half billion tons China must get neighboring 
countries' harbors (of South Korea, North Korea, Russia, and 
Japan). If neighboring countries do not lend harbors (though 
this is unlikely), China's economic development can be stopped. 
Therefore, China now desperately seeks harbors. As a part of 
such efforts, China, after winning over the UNDP, planned the 
Tumen River Development Program. [passage omitted] 
  If this region becomes a free export zone, China will get a 
long awaited ice-free port in the Japan Sea. North Korea, 
wanting to take this opportunity to acquire foreign currency, 
made it clear they would like to take part in the Tumen River 
Development Program at the Pyongyang Conference in the springs 
of 1992 and 1993. [passage omitted] 
  On 19 December 1992, China, negotiating directly with 
Russia, 
leased Zarubino harbor for fifty years. And China agreed to lay 
a railroad between Khraskino and Hunchun for Russia and also get 
operating rights for seventy years. These events embarrassed 
North Korea very much. 
  Wanting to yield to none, North Korea agreed to lease to 
China the eastern Chongjin harbor as well as Rajin and also to 
immediately begin improving the railroads and roads between 
Hunchun of China and Rajin. Judging from this, the construction 
of Fangchuan harbor that China first announced, was nothing but 
a rumor. Its real aim might have been a strategy to get the 
right to use Chongjin, Rajin, and Zarubino harbors. The reason 
China first negotiated with Russia and not North Korea on the 
lease of Zarubino harbor was because the stubborn North Korea 
dragged the negotiation out for too long and requested the 
utility rate of Chongjin harbor at three times more than the 
current international price. 
  As China reached an agreement first with Russia, North 
Korea, 
in its confusion, made repeated concessions to China's demands, 
even sharply cutting the utility rate of the eastern Chongjin 
harbor. As of result, North Korea played into China's hands. 
  Among the three northeastern provinces of China, Liaoning is 
the only province with its own harbor. In China every province 
is a separate unit and autonomously controls its own economic 
activities. Therefore, Heilongjang and Jilin Provinces, which 
have no harbors of its own, lease of Dalian or Tianjin harbors 
and are often times deprived of priority use of these harbors by 
Liaoning Province. For that reason, these two provinces are 
enthusiastic about getting the right to use new harbors in the 
Japan Sea. 
  China has to develop and use the Sonbong and Chongjin 
harbors 
of North Korea as well as Zarubino and Rajin harbors. If China 
expands these four harbors, it will be able to transfer 30-50 
million tons of freight per year. 
  The Japanese Government only furnishes funds and then 
maneuvers behind the scenes. It lent $50 million to the Maruichi 
Company, a private enterprise, and let this company take part in 
the development of Zarubino harbor. The Japanese Government 
trading with China is creating an opportunity to stimulate the 
backward economy of its coastal regions in the Japan Sea. 
  Giving long-term credit to China matters little to Japan. 
The 
problem of the northern four islands still remains unsolved 
between Japan and Russia. The Japanese Government is not in a 
position to take an active part in the development. So it has 
let Niigata Province independently participate in the 
development program. Only if Japan lets its local government 
act independently in the development program, will it bear fewer 
funds to support the UNDP. After the development of these 
harbors in the Japan Sea is completed, Japan, second to China, 
will make a profit on the harbors. It is because most of the 
freight in these harbors are transferred to Japan. 
  Of course, China will be the country receiving the most 
benefit. Because of poor ground transportation, China has to pay 
a great deal of money and time to transport its freight from 
Jinlin and Heilongjang provinces to Guangdong Province in the 
south. Because China can save much money and time transporting 
its domestic freight through Zarubino harbor, it is likely to 
make much use of this harbor in the future. As Seoul is 
geographically situated behind Inchun, and Beijing at the rear 
of Tianjin, so Hunchun is situated behind Zarubino, Rajin, and 
Sonbong. Because Hunchun is likely to grow tremendously in the 
future, the foreign enterprises that have applied for investment 
in Hunchun already numbers about 260. Of these, about 160 
enterprises are South Korean and the rest are Japanese or Hong 
Kong among others, they say. Such a trend is expected to 
continue to increase hereafter. For a while, the land price of 
Hunchun rose as fast as that of Kangnam District, Seoul. 
Mongolia, which has no harbor, of course, received the program 
with open arms. [passage omitted] 
  China involved the UNDP and let the Tumen River Development 
Program attract international attention. China made the 
countries concerned -- China, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, 
Mongolia -- agree to jointly manage the golden triangular zone. 
Also, China obtained a lease of harbors under a bilateral 
agreement to with Russia and began construction work there, and 
even obtained harbors in North Korea. We cannot help but praise 
China's foresighted scheme and its paving the way for the future. 
  Hunchun is one of the regions where many Korean people live. 
For this reason, South Korean enterprises should make inroads 
there. It is obvious that by South Korean enterprises making 
inroads into Hunchun would politically be a help to the 
unification of Korea, as Hunchun is situated behind North Korea. 
  Negotiations between North Korea and China which have 
carried 
on for three years did not yield good results. If China comes to 
an agreement through the UNDP, it will readily be able to 
acquire development funds from the World Bank and enjoy the 
advantage of joint management of the harbors. Therefore, China 
will continue to carry on the negotiations through the UNDP. 
South Korea could also reduce, through the UNDP, North Korea's 
excessive response to its strategy toward the North. 
  Even if this region is open under a bilateral agreement as 
well as an agreement involving the UNDP, South Korea should help 
the development program to succeed. 
  South Korea's strategy should not be one favorable only to 
its own land, but one favorable to all of northeastern Asia. 
Only if South Korea does so will it win recognition and be held 
in high esteem by neighboring countries. 
  Like many of South Korea's enterprises which make inroads 
into Hunchun of China, it should participate in the construction 
of Zarubino harbor as a long-term strategy. That will of itself 
pave the way for South Korea to take part in the program to 
develop North Korea. 
  Let us return to the main subject. If China's development of 
harbors does not make progress as fast as the freight volume 
increases, it will utilize Zarubino, Chongjin, Rajin, and 
Sonbong harbors for its exports. But it will utilize the South 
Korean harbors as the temporary storing places of imported 
freight and its dependence on South Korea's harbors will 
increase day by day. Accordingly South Korea should invest in 
the construction of harbors for not only its own freight but of 
all of northeastern Asia. Without its harbors, South Korea will 
become a useless country. If South Korea does not construct 
many harbors, it will eventually lose its huge interests because 
the main marine transportation companies of the world will 
utilize Japanese harbors even if they are a little distant. 
  Because Pusan and Inchun harbors are so saturated, South 
Korea is constructing a harbor at Kwangyang Bay. Aside from 
these two, some suitable places for harbors are found in the 
neighborhood of the South coast including the Kohung Peninsula. 
The Kunsan harbor, when newly developed, is expected to possess 
great value. The invested capital in the construction of harbors 
will be returned in 10-20 years. 
  In steadily carrying out such public works requiring huge 
capital, a provisional organization such as the present social 
overhead utility planning team in the Blue House is 
insufficient, and instead a special organization such as a 
maritime ministry should be set up. 
  Even if South Korea serves as an intermediate base where we 
store some of China's imported freight and transfer it to small 
ships, there is also another problem. First of all, the cost of 
labor in South Korea is expensive. Although China has 17 harbors 
where small ships of less than 10,000 tons can enter, there will 
often be times when freight to be shipped off to China piles up 
for a long time at our harbors due to China's increasing 
domestic ship freight. Loading, unloading, and storing expenses 
in such circumstances will become a primary factor in raising 
the costs. Therefore China will make efforts to take its freight 
as soon as possible in order to save expenses. 
  There is an only way to settle this problem. North Korea 
must 
clear the way. China has no choice but to request North Korea 
clear the way so that the railroads can be connected from South 
Korea's harbors to China. 
  If freight being imported to the northeastern three 
provinces 
of China is transported overland via North Korea from South 
Korea, much more expenses could be saved. In this case, China 
will come to realize North Korea is an obstacle to its economic 
development and will command North Korea clear the way. 
  Since Russia democraticized, North Korea has no ally to turn 
to but China. How could North Korea not clear the way? Even for 
China's part, it has no choice but to take any measure because 
the ups and downs of China's economy depend upon this issue. 
Eventually North Korea will come to clear the way as China 
demands. Accordingly the interchange between North and South 
Koreas will be a mode that freight, truck drivers and train 
operators will begin. Once a road is opened up, it will become 
wider and more people will pass through day by day. 
  Before such things happen, North Korea will realize that it 
has been driven into a corner, unless it changes. The major 
premise of such exchanges is that South Korea must construct 
more harbors. 
  Increasing ship freight, limited harbor capacity, shallow 
coastal water and disadvantageous natural surroundings of China 
are the primary factors in raising South Korea's land value. If 
South Korea constructs more harbors, it will not only increase 
its national interests, but will let China demand that North 
Korea clear the way, and eventually the roads between the North 
and South will be open on their own. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seoul, March 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday he "will consider favorably" 
bringing North Korean loggers to Seoul despite legal 
complications. 
  "We are terribly concerned about the kind of conditions 
which 
North Koreans are subject to," Han said in a press conference at 
the Foreign Correspondents Club here. Some 150 to 200 North 
Korean loggers in Siberia hope to either come to Seoul or stay 
in Russia, the foreign minister said, but "there are legal 
complications" in trying to bring them to South Korea. 
  One of the problems is many of the loggers' unclear status 
in 
Russia, as they lack passports or some form of identification. 
Seoul officials say that before they can be flown to South 
Korea, the Russian Government must determine their identity, 
define their status and allow their departure. But Seoul is 
looking for a solution, he said, that "we will consider 
favorably." 
  Meanwhile, he defended South Korea's national security law, 
saying it had been revised through "a unanimous, democratic" 
process. 
  "We have an adequate mechanism to protect the human rights 
of 
each individual," Han told the foreign journalists, responding 
to claims from abroad that the law is subject to abuse. With 
another inter-Korean contact just a day away, Han reiterated 
that meaningful dialogue between the two is a prerequisite to 
North Korea-U.S. high-level talks. 
  Seoul is looking not to isolate but to bring North Korea 
into 
the international fold, said Han, so that Pyongyang can adapt to 
the post-cold war world order. 
  The foreign minister criticized the recent U.S. decision to 
revive the Super 301 trade provision, calling it "unfortunate." 
  Seoul hopes that Washington will tread cautiously so that 
bilateral trade relations are not harmed in the process of 
applying the revived law.

  [Text] Seoul, March 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will ask 
Russia to assume responsibility for repaying loans extended to 
the former Soviet Union and to give a written guarantee on 
undertaking this obligation. A ranking government official said 
Tuesday the request would be put to Russia at the coming 
bilateral meeting on the loans slated for late this month in 
Seoul. 
  Russia has not made any clear commitment on assuming 
responsibility for loans to the former Soviet Union totaling 
1.47 billion U.S. dollars and overdue interest of 80 million 
dollars, he added. This will be an important item on the agenda 
at the upcoming government-to-government meeting with Russia, he 
said. 
  In April last year, Russia agreed with the former Soviet 
Union's group of creditor nations to reschedule the servicing of 
the group's loans as the successor to the Soviet Union. But 
Russia has not signed any such agreement with South Korea about 
the latter's loans to the former Soviet Union. 
  Under an agreement reached by the group of seven advanced 
nations in November 1992, Russia will repay 61.34 percent of the 
loans the former Soviet Union secured from the west and the 
other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 
the remainder. Russia would take responsibility for repaying 
all of the loans only if the other CIS member nations were 
unable to shoulder their share. 
  The official said the agreement is the only document that 
Russia has signed in regard to repayment of South Korean loans 
to the former Soviet Union, though it vaguely provides for this 
responsibility. 
  The government will also request that Moscow repay the loans 
in the form of industrial materials, land leased in the Far East 
of Siberia for construction of an industrial estate for South 
Korean firms, or the rights for South Korean fishermen to fish 
in the sea of Okhotsk -- instead of in the form of arms -- if it 
wants repayment in kind. 
  Russia has insisted on a written guarantee covering 
repayment 
of the loans to the former Soviet Union if South Korea agrees to 
reshedule the debt servicing in the same manner as that Moscow 
agreed with the Soviet Union's creditor nations.

  [Text] Seoul, March 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Tuesday that Cold War tensions have not disappeared yet 
between South and North Korea, emphasizing that only power can 
maintain peace. Kim's remarks came during a speech at the 
commencement ceremony for the Korea Air Force Academy's 42nd 
class in Chongwon, North Chungchong Province. The president 
said, "North Korea is in a difficult situation, diplomatically 
isolated from the rest of the world and suffering from economic 
poverty. North Koreans are moving their military power close to 
the front line, and their air power can pose a threat to us in 
only a couple of minutes." 
  He asked the graduates not to fail in defending the South's 
air space. In modern warfare, advanced weapons decide victory or 
defeat very quickly, the president said. Unless the country 
boosts its technology to the level of advanced nations, it will 
not be able to win an economic or technological war or achieve a 
self-reliant military. "In this respect, our national defense 
system should be scientific and efficient," President Kim said.

  [Text] Seoul, Mar. 8 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang asked Home Minister Choe Hyong-u on Tuesday to try to 
terminate government subsidies to a couple of permanent public 
campaign organizations. The two organizations the premier 
singled out were the Central Council of Saemaul Undong (New 
Community Movement) and the Council for the Promotion of Correct 
Ways of Living (Barukye- Salki-Hyobuihoe). In an official 
letter, Yi suggested that the Home Ministry do away with 
government subsidies to the two organizations by switching them 
into purely private organizations. 
  Explaining about the premier's instructions, Choe Kyu-hwak, 
third administration coordinator of the office of the prime 
minister, said that the two organizations have been receiving 
government subsides under special laws. He said he understands 
that at the prime minister's instructions, the Home Ministry 
will work out detailed ways to make the two organizations stand 
on their own feed. Choe said, however, that this does not apply 
to the Federation for Freedom (Chayu-Chong-Yonmaeng) which he 
said is an ideological organization. He thus hinted government 
funds would continue to be funneled into the federation. 
  This year alone, 20 billion won in both central and local 
government funds were set aside for the Saemaul Council and 11.3 
billion won for the Correct Ways of Living Council.

  [Text] Basel (Special)--Bank of Korea governor Kim 
Myong-ho told international financiers Monday that Korea will 
further ease rules restricting foreign financial institutions 
business activities in order to promote fair competition. 
  Speaking before a special meeting of the Bank for 
International Settlements (BIS) at Basel, Switzerland, in which 
major European central bank heads are participating, Kim said, 
"Entry barriers will be dismantled to promote competition among 
financial institutions, apart from minimum established 
conditions required to ensure the stability of the financial 
system." 
  Kim said foreign banks will be able to "diversify their 
presence in Korea, establishing joint-ventures or subsidiaries." 
  He cited two policy tasks which must be tackled successfully 
in order for Korea to attain the status of a truly advanced 
economy. 
  One is to promote the efficiency of the Korean economy, 
especially the financial sector, by a heightened reliance on 
market mechanisms rather than government initiatives. The other 
is to participate ever more positively as a responsible member 
in the concert of nations, he said. 
  "In the light of these realities, there is no viable option 
for Korea but to press boldly ahead with financial 
liberalization and the opening of its financial market," he 
noted. 
  The BOK governor told the BIS special session that business 
boundaries will be readjusted so as to enhance competition, and 
increase benefits to clients as well as to mesh with the 
worldwide trend toward universal banking. 
  He also said the ceiling on foreigners' portfolio investment 
will be progressively raised and the criteria for the opening 
branches by foreign securities companies will also be relaxed 
this year. 
  In addition, Kim made it clear that the extent of foreign 
exchange liberalization will be broadened in the near future. 
  "Restrictions on the foreign exchange position of banks and 
the underlying documentation requirements for foreign exchange 
transactions will be progressively relaxed," he said. 
  Touching upon capital account liberalization, Kim said Korea 
will take a cautious and gradualistic approach to capital market 
opening. But he added that Korea has now acquired sufficient 
confidence to allow the process to move into high gear and it 
will be further accelerated as the country plans to seek full 
membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) by 1996. 
  Stressing the most crucial step in liberalizing is to 
deregulate interest rates, he said the third stage of interest 
rate deregulation, which will take place in 1996 and will 
liberalize all deposit interest rates except those on demand 
deposits, "may well be implemented ahead of schedule as long as 
financial market and macroeconomic conditions permit." 
  Kim said policy-based loans, which have become an obstacle 
to 
indirect control of the money supply as well as to the 
managerial autonomy of financial institutions, are being 
progressively pared back. 
  He pointed out that stability is one of the most important 
prerequisites for Korea's financial market liberalization. 
  "A stability-focused macroeconomic policy is an important 
element favoring the success of financial liberalization. 
Liberalization carried out in an unstable macroeconomic 
environment may well worsen pre-existing instability." 
  In order to maintain macroeconomic stability under financial 
deregulation, he said, the BOK will make utmost efforts to keep 
the money supply at a proper level to ensure price stability. 
  In addition, he emphasized the importance of adequate 
prudential regulations in accordance with the progress of 
financial liberalization. 
  "It is important for the BOK to induce financial 
institutions 
to strengthened their risk management systems and to maintain 
capital adequacy. In this respect, Korea will apply in full the 
capital adequacy standards set by the Basel Accord from 1995," 
he said. 
  The BOK is in broad agreement with the new proposals of the 
Basel Committee on banking supervision which take into account 
market risks concerning derivatives transactions and interest 
rate risks.

  [Text] Seoul, March 8 (YONHAP) -- For Pohang Iron and Steel 
Co. (Posco), the world's No. 2 steel maker, Tuesday's selection 
of an outsider as chairman marked a first in its 20-odd-year 
history and came as a great surprise. Because of a conflict of 
interest between Chairman Chong Myong-sik and President Cho 
Mal-su that surfaced in January as well as the company's 
expansion into the cellular phone industry as the largest 
shareholder of the new Mobile Telecommunications Co., a top 
management reshuffle had long been expected. Nevertheless, the 
selection of an outsider as top manager caught nearly everyone 
off guard. 
  The outsider is former Deputy Prime Minister and Economic 
Planning Minister Kim Man-chae. A company boasting 12 trillion 
won (15 billion U.S. dollars) in assets, 7 trillion won in sales 
and 2.5 billion dollars in exports is now under his leadership. 
  Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su, who 
represents the government as the controlling shareholder of 
Posco, said he believes the new chairman is the right man to 
reform Posco's management in line with the Kim Yong-sam 
government's economic and industrial policy because he knows the 
policy better than anybody. Indeed, Posco Chairman Kim headed a 
team of economic advisers to President Kim during his 
presidential campaign. 
  Minister Kim thus suggested that Kim was selected as Posco's 
new chairman at the recommendation of Chongwadae [presidential 
office]. In other words, he became the steel maker's top manager 
due to the strong confidence Chongwadae places in him. 
  Asked about the new chairman's lack of experience in company 
management, Minister Kim pointed to his chairmanship of Samsung 
Life Insurance Co., adding there is no firm rule that a steel 
man must become the top manager of a steel firm. His broad 
economic knowledge and sharp insight into international affairs 
will make him a good company manager. Moreover, his drive and 
experience as the government's chief economic policy-maker make 
him the most qualified man for Posco's top post, Minister Kim 
said. 
  After losing in a previous parliamentary election, Kim has 
served as chief Korean delegate to the eminent persons' group of 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, director of the U.S. 
East-West Center in Hawaii, member of the Korea-U.S. Wisemen 
Committee and chairman of the Korea Foundation for the 
handicapped.

  [Text] HANOI, March 8 (AFP) -- Vietnam gave a cool response 
Tuesday to demands by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
for improvements in human rights before Washington will 
establish diplomatic ties, saying it would not accept 
preconditions for normalisation. 
  "We are ready to cooperate with the United States on several 
problems but we will not accept any issue becoming a 
precondition for the normalisation of diplomatic relations," a 
foreign ministry spokesman said. 
  Christopher said Saturday in Hawaii before heading off for 
an 
Asia-Pacific tour that Vietnam needed to make progress in its 
human rights record, settle claims by US businesses and resolve 
questions on US service personnel missing since the conflict in 
Indochina. 
  "There are a great many things they would have to do before 
normal relations can be established," Christopher said. 
  US and Vietnamese met in New York last week to discuss human 
rights in an atmosphere described by Hanoi as "constructive," 
although no other details merged from the meeting. 
  Vietnam has said it welcomes dialogue on the issue but will 
not countenance "interference in its internal affairs." 
  A recent State Department report on Vietnam's human rights 
record welcomed changes to the constitution that enshrine 
certain legal rights, but accused Hanoi of detaining dissidents 
who peacefully expressed political views. The secretary of 
state praised Hanoi for its help in the search for the 1,647 US 
personnel still listed as missing in action in Vietnam, which 
has diminished as a obstacle to ties due to increased 
cooperation from authorities here. 
  Officials from both sides also said they had made "some 
progress" in talks in Hanoi last week on opening liaison offices 
and settling claims on more than 500 million dollars in assets 
seized by both sides in 1975 after the Vietnam War.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 8 -- The government was determined 
in 1994 to make investment procedures simple, clear cut and 
strict so as to create investment environment in Vietnam more 
attractive, Minister Dau Ngoc Xuan, chairman of the State 
Committee for Cooperation and Investment told a recent press 
conference. He added that in a meeting which focused on 
external economic activities held earlier this year, the 
government emphasised improving and simplifying investment 
procedures so that investors would have less trouble in applying 
for investment licence. 
  The law on foreign investment introduced in 1987, is 
considered of the more open compared with several other 
countries in the region. However, rules governing investment 
procedures are very complicated, taking much time and creating a 
lot of trouble for investors. At the moment it takes about six 
months or even a year to get a project licensed, often having to 
be submitted to up to as many as 10 authorised offices for 
approval. The meeting, Mr Xuan said, also discussed measures to 
secure the implementation of the licensed projects. It affirmed 
that great efforts should be made in 1994 to make the investment 
environment in Vietnam more favourable. Regarding the export 
processing zones (EPZ), Mr Xuan said there was nothing to worry 
about the matter of losing the nation's sovereignty (as a number 
of people once believed) when opening EPZs. It depends on the 
state management in EPZs on Vietnam's laws. The most important 
thing is to create favourable conditions to attract more 
investment into the EPZs. Mr Xuan further said that the setting 
up Tan Thuan EPZ (Ho Chi Minh City) had the potential to be 
successful. To date investors had registered to establish their 
enterprises, factories and companies in more than half of the 
available area. Other EPZs such as ones in Linh Trung (Da 
Nang), Haiphong and Soc Son (Hanoi) are expected to be 
successfully formed.

Bureau member Vu Oanh: "Great National Unity in the New 
Situation and Tasks"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  Part Two </H6>
<H5>  Great Unity in the New Situation </H5>
  I. The present situation: 
  Our party great national unity strategy in the present 
situation is designed in such a way that it can exploit and 
develop our traditional concepts while renovating various 
aspects to suit developments at home and abroad. 
  1. "In the present international situation, nationalism has 
become a very important factor. The developing countries must 
carry out a very difficult and complicated struggle to extricate 
their countries from poverty and backwardness while opposing the 
reactionary forces to protect national independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Nations are facing 
global, pressing issues related to the common fate and destiny 
of mankind such as maintaining peace, protecting the 
environment, reducing the population growth rate, and preventing 
and eradicating serious diseases." (excerpt from resolution no. 
07-NQ/TU of the party Central Committee) 
  We all know that mankind is making preparation to conclude 
its tasks in the 20th century to embark on the 21st century 
against the background of swift changes in the international 
situation that have dramatically affected the old world order 
while paving the way for a new one. The upswing in the 
scientific-technological revolution has brought about new 
results in the computer, electronic, communications, and 
biochemistry domains, thus helping to accelerate the pace of 
production development. Socioeconomic reform programs have been 
launched in a wide and far-reaching scale in various countries, 
thereby seriously affecting the fundamental social issues in 
each nation (these include the issues of ownership, political 
system, democracy, and social justice) 
  It is necessary to say that while there are conflicts, 
racial 
and religious crusades, starvation, diseases -- especially AIDS 
-- destruction of the ecology, and environmental pollution in 
certain countries that are threatening the daily life of 
millions of people, new conditions and opportunities emerge 
eleswhere. These include the trend of peace and stability in 
our region, the dynamic development in the Asia-Pacific zone, 
the trend of increased cooperation in the world, and the 
vigorous development in universalizing the economic life in many 
nations. These are developments that have created new favorable 
conditions and opportunities for accelerating the developmental 
pace in our nation. 
  In our efforts to join the international community, we have 
faced numerous difficulties caused by our poor economy and 
backwardness. However, as a country lagging behind, we have the 
chance to learn from the experiences of other nations. As a 
result, while facing numerous ordeals we are in a position to 
vigorously and quickly develop our socioeconomic situation. 
Thanks to our foreign policy -- one of independence, 
sovereignty, and diversified diplomatic activities -- our 
country can firmly advance forward despite acute difficulties 
and ordeals. This has enabled us to continue to expand 
relations with other nations while combining our national 
strength with that of the world and our traditional strength 
with that of the era. 
  2. Implementing the renovation process set and led by our 
party, our people have scored initial yet very important 
achievements, thereby creating a new condition for national 
development. This is a very favorable condition for 
strengthening the all-people national unity to help extricate 
our country from poverty and backwardness to advance further. 
While enjoying this new condition we also face many new 
problems that call for our great efforts to overcome them. 
  The renovation process set by our party is basically in line 
with the trend of the era, the social evolution law, the reality 
of our nation, and the aspiration of our people. This has been 
proven as true by our initial achievements and by our ability to 
overcome numerous difficulties and ordeals. 
  However, in reality, we still have many weaknesses. While 
our economy is still poor and backward, we are facing the danger 
of lagging behind economically compared to other countries in 
the region, thus causing an adverse effect for us in various 
domains. This is a great ordeal of the era and a danger to the 
vitality of the nation. As a result, we must strive to bring 
our self-reliance tradition into full play while closing our 
ranks to overcome all difficulties. 
  3. Vietnam has a population of more than 70 million, who 
have 
a good background and are composed of various strata, 
nationalities, and religious groups living at home and abroad. 
Although they have different backgrounds, different living 
conditions, and different religions, they are proud of their 
Vietnamese origin. Their nation has several thousand years of 
history and the tradition of unity to build and defend the 
nation. They have but one common aspiration to reunite the 
country to make the people prosperous, the nation powerful, and 
the society just and civilized, to be able to join in the 
international community and surge forward to catch up with 
developments of the era. 
  In view of the above-mentioned characteristics, Vietnamese 
citizens should realize their historic duty toward the nation, 
bring into play their wisdom and creativity, uphold their sense 
of responsibility, and strengthen the great national unity bloc. 
Let them make every effort to enrich themselves while at the 
same time contributing to making the country more powerful. 
  II. The objectives and tasks under the policy of great 
national unity. 
  As specified under the "economic stabilization and 
development" strategy, in the years ahead, efforts must be made 
to help the country "tide over a crisis situation and stabilize 
the socioeconomic situation." Steps must be taken to lead the 
country out of poverty and underdevelopment, improve the 
people's living conditions, consolidate national defense and 
security capabilities, and create conditions for the country to 
reach a higher level of development by the start of the 21st 
century. 
  The resolution of the Ninth National Assembly's Fourth 
Session has set forth the orientations and tasks for 1994 as 
follows: It is necessary to firmly safeguard the achievements of 
the renovation process, develop the industrialization and 
modernization program a step further, and grasp all 
opportunities to quickly increase the economic growth rate and 
shift our country to a new stage of development. At the same 
time, it is imperative to effect important changes on the 
cultural and social fronts, firmly maintain political stability, 
safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and 
broaden diplomatic relations. 
  To fulfill that arduous task, it is more important than ever 
to strengthen unity among Vietnamese countrymen, bring into full 
play the strength of the national community, and strengthen the 
all- people great unity bloc a step further. 
  The general tasks of the National United Front at present 
are 
"to develop the tradition of patriotism, national pride, and 
spirit of sufficiency and self-help; motivate all Vietnamese 
countrymen to participate in the renovation undertaking to 
firmly defend national independence, unification, sovereignty, 
and territorial integrity; strive to fight poverty and 
backwardness; surge forward to achieve the goals of making the 
people rich and the country powerful and of bringing about 
justice and civilization in society; and implement President Ho 
Chi Minh's sacred testament, which calls on everyone to "build 
Vietnam into a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, 
prosperous, and powerful country and contribute to the cause of 
peace, independence, democracy, and progress in the world." 
  Acting in line with the above-mentioned objectives and 
tasks, 
the Political Bureau has set forth major policies as follows: 
  1. Great national unity calls for efforts to strengthen 
unity 
among people in the great family of the Vietnamese nation -- 
which is composed of various strata, classes, ethnic and 
religious groups, and people at home and abroad -- to make the 
above-mentioned goals come true. To achieve unity, we must 
share similarities and at the same time must accept differences 
that are not at variance with the common national interests. We 
must strive to overcome prejudices, complexes, and hatred; look 
toward the future; and promote the spirit of solidarity, 
openness, and mutual trust. Everyone should work toward the 
goals of national independence and freedom and of happiness for 
the people. 
  2. Great national unity constitutes the fundamental line of 
our party and state. The concept of great national unity must 
be reflected in all lines, policies, and regulations of the 
state and must be included in all political, economic, cultural, 
social, national defense and security, and diplomatic 
activities. This is aimed at meeting the legitimate interests 
and aspirations of people of all strata. We must link rights 
with duties and personal interests with citizens' duties and 
must bear in mind that the national interests come first. It is 
necessary to create favorable conditions for releasing the 
production force and encourage all individuals and economic 
sectors to bring into full play their energy, talents, and 
creativity to increase production, expand business, and enrich 
themselves through honest means. We must encourage the people 
to practice thrift and build and protect the nation and must 
make constant efforts to improve the material and cultural life 
of the people. At the same time, we must encourage the people 
to satisfactorily implement various social welfare policies 
through the movement to repay those who have rendered 
meritorious services to the nation, participate in public 
utility projects and humanitarian activities, help one another 
to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty, and develop the 
tradition of benevolence and righteousness of our fathers and 
forefathers. 
  3. We must build a clean and strong people's government 
with high efficiency to make it a real law-governed state of, 
by, and for the people. The people's government must protect 
the people's legitimate rights and interests, firmly maintain 
the state order and law, perfect and execute the policy of 
multisectorial economic development with the state management, 
and outline and execute social welfare policies. It must 
preserve and develop the national culture together with efforts 
to acquire the essence of the world culture. It must build new 
men, strengthen the national defense and public security, and 
broaden its external affair activities. 
  4. We must expand our great national unity block via 
diversified activities. We must organize and develop mass 
movements at different levels, create more activities suitable 
to all social strata, and improve the positive role of exemplary 
people in different social classes, ethnics, and religions. We 
must direct our activities to villages, subwards, and 
households. We must strengthen the alliance between the workers 
with the peasants and intellectuals to make it a foundation for 
our great national unity block. 
  III. Main Ideas on Policies for Great National Unity. 
  1. The initial achievement of the renovation undertaking has 
offered opportunities for everybody to actively build their life 
and to contribute to the cause of national construction and 
protection. The policy for great national unity, on that basis, 
needs to encourage and create more favorable conditions for the 
people to develop further. Our party and state have and will 
create equal opportunities for everyone: peasants will be 
granted the right to use their land, workers will possess shares 
in their enterprises, and the public will be provided loans for 
their business operation so that everybody will have a fair 
chance to improve their life, making the poor become better, the 
average become rich, and the rich become richer. 
  For the people who have rendered a meritorious service to 
the 
nation such as the families of fallen combatants and injured 
soldiers and the people who have been in national service for 
many years with outstanding performance, our party and state 
have given them privilege treatment and have launched public 
movements to help them. However, we must pay more attention to 
provide better assistance and conditions to them so that these 
people can have a living standard at least equal to that of 
average people in the same residential area would enjoy. We 
must not leave them struggling permanently in the poverty line. 
  For the workers, we must provide them with additional 
technical and professional training so that they can adjust 
themselves in the industrialization and modernization process. 
We must train our contingent of workers for new technologies 
and accelerate our technical training in service management, 
tourism, languages, accounting, statistics, and so forth... 
according to the market demand. We must introduce the 
share-holding system in state enterprises and business, provide 
loans for the workers to set up their share-holding enterprises, 
and widely apply the quota contract system for our workers. We 
must provide enough jobs for workers and establish a cooperative 
relationship between employers and workers to improve the 
business productivity, quality, and efficiency. On the 
foundation of respecting the law, we must guarantee the workers' 
legitimate interests and fulfill our financial obligations to 
the state. 
  For the peasants, the national industrialization and 
modernization will create great effects for rural areas, 
agriculture, and peasants. The infrastructure construction must 
concentrate in rural areas, especially the development of public 
roads, electricity, postal and communications, culture, health 
care, and education to narrow the gap between cities and rural 
areas. The government must continue to perfect its policy to 
grant the right of land use to peasants. It must also introduce 
policies to develop the reasonable relationship between the 
industry, agriculture, and service. It must increase investment 
for the development of barren land, empty hills, water surface, 
and coastal areas. It must develop processing industry, 
industries, and handicrafts and expand our market relation to 
quickly consume products made by peasants. Particularly, we must 
pay attention to improving peasants' knowledge and upgrade the 
cultural, medical, and education service in rural areas. 
  Regarding the intelligentsia, it is necessary to make 
everyone realize that for the struggle to make the goals of 
making the people rich and the country powerful and of bringing 
about justice and civilization in society come true, along with 
helping our nation integrate into the world community at an 
early date, the key factor does not rest with the fact that our 
country is large in size and rich in natural resources but with 
the fact that it is endowed with wisdom and a fine cultural 
heritage. If a country treats its think tank badly or plays 
down its role, that country will have no conditions for 
development or a bright future. There exists a causality 
between deterioration and waste of the think tank and depletion 
of natural resources and socioeconomic sluggishness. 
  To develop our national cultural heritage, learn from the 
cultural quintessence of the times, have access to modern 
science and technology, and complete projects to benefit our 
country and people, we must rely ourselves on our highly 
knowledgeable intellectuals. Therefore, we must put the 
intellectuals in an important position and encourage them to 
apply their knowledge to scientific and technological research 
work a step further. It is necessary to get rid of the evils of 
narrow-minded attitude toward and prejudices against the 
intelligentsia. It is important to treat our intellectuals in a 
spirit of democracy and equality and to pay greater attention to 
their aspirations. Resolute measures must be taken against 
science monopoly. It is necessary to rely on the intelligentsia 
to discover and select talents and formulate lines and policies, 
particularly policies toward science and technology. Steps must 
be taken to broaden international relations in science and 
technology and create favorable conditions for scientists to 
maintain contact with the outside world and work or participate 
in research projects or training courses overseas. It is 
necessary to keep in mind that it is the objective of the policy 
toward intellectuals to make our country ready to enter the 21st 
century, which marks the start of a new era, the era of wisdom. 
  As for religions, it is important to regard them as 
necessary 
elements that have made their long-lasting presence felt in 
society. Religions meet both the spiritual and cultural needs of 
the people. By nature, religions do not act at variance with the 
nation and socialism. Instead, they exert a positive impact on 
society. It is necessary to pay due attention to the policy 
toward religious and nonreligious people, respect the people's 
right to believe or not to believe in a certain religion along 
with the concepts of love of mankind, humanitarianism, charity, 
and merit-making of the various religions. 
  On the one hand, it is necessary to respect the right of the 
various religions to perform their activities. It is forbidden 
to violate places of worship or interfere with the internal 
affairs of the various religions. It is necessary to protect 
churches, pagodas, and temples. It is important to keep the 
various religious organizations within the people's mastership 
system. On the other hand, stern measures must be taken to deal 
with attempts to take advantage of religions to undermine the 
great national unity bloc and violate state law. 
  As for people of different ethnic groups, it is necessary to 
give them equal treatment based on solid principles. Special 
efforts must be made to help ethnic minority compatriots 
eliminate hunger and reduce poverty. Plans must be worked out 
to help them with medical treatment, disease prevention, and 
anti-illiteracy work. Practical steps must be taken to apply 
birth control education to each region and each ethnic group. 
Due efforts must be made to care for children, especially 
newborn babies. A number of ethnic groups is facing the danger 
of extinction. Therefore, it is necessary for the state to 
adopt urgent measures to preserve and develop them. 
  It is necessary for the state to work out prompt measures to 
resolve once and for all the allotment of forest and forest land 
to peasant households. It is important to make concentrated 
investment in the expansion of key communication networks, water 
conservancy projects, public healthcare facilities, small-scale 
hydroelectric power plants, and information and postal services. 
  Plans must be worked out to expand the work-study school 
system. Sightseeing trips must be organized for ethnic minority 
compatriots to visit cities, mountain regions, sea areas, and 
foreign countries. Steps must be taken to preserve and develop 
the cultural quintessence of people of different ethnic groups. 
It is necessary to respect the spoken dialects, writing 
systems, and fine customs and practices of people of different 
ethnic groups. 
  It is necessary to supervise the operations of sectors 
directly under the management of the central government. It is 
important to increase personnel in charge of areas inhabited by 
ethnic minority compatriots and key services like public health, 
communications, water conservancy, culture, and education. It 
is necessary to work out separate programs for hilltribe people 
and see to it that practical measures are adopted to implement 
them. Severe measures must be taken against sectors and 
individuals who violate the state nationalities policy. 
  Regarding the private industrial, commercial, and 
agricultural sectors, the state must strengthen its relations 
with them and must firmly grasp their aspirations, 
circumstances, and capabilities. Incentive measures must be 
worked out to encourage the private sector to make bold 
investment in production and business activities. 
  The private industrial, commercial, and agricultural sectors 
constitute an important part of the multisectorial economy. 
Once they are sponsored by or have joint ventures with the 
state, the private sector will develop itself into a major 
production force and play a positive role in socioeconomic 
development.

  [Text] "1994 is the year of Vietnamese electrical power and 
the year in which the south will finally have sufficient 
electricity," said Premier Vo Van Kiet on 16 November 1993 at 
the Thac Mo hydroelectric project located on the Be River. 
  January: the three gas turbines installed at Ba Ria, with a 
total capacity of 100 megawatts of electricity, generate 
electricity. April: the 500-kv north-south landline goes into 
stage-1 operation. June: one of the two 75-kw Thac Mo turbines 
goes on line. Those will be joyous news items this coming spring. 
  With a capacity of 150 megawatts, Thac Mo has greater 
capacity than Thac Ba (120 megawatts) and almost the capacity of 
Da Nhim (160 megawatts). But to date, this is the largest 
hydroelectric project for which all the geographical and 
geological research and for which the technical designs for 
almost all the main projects were done by us. 
  The energy line and water gates, pipelines, plant, outside 
distribution stations, and spill heads of the pressure lines 
were built by the Interenergo Corporation (Ukrainian Energy 
Projects Institute). All of the other technical projects, 
including the main dam, the spillways (including intake and 
drainage canals and foundation holes), the Duc Hanh dam and 
secondary dams, the canal connecting the two reservoirs, and the 
plans to organize construction--pressure line, surfaces, and 
hydroelectricity--were the responsibility of Research and Design 
Corporation II. 
  Nguyen Van Thinh, the deputy director of this corporation, 
said that most of the people who participated in the Thac Mo 
project were very young. A few people such as Doan Hai Minh and 
Nguyen Xuan Hoa were present at Song Da and Tri An, but at the 
time that they were there, there was little work and the 
technical requirements were not great. 
  Work on the project got underway on 20 November 1991. But 
the 
"intellectual products" of the people at Research and Design 
Corporation II, that is, the economic and technical arguments of 
Thac Mo, had been approved 8 months prior to that, and by June 
1991 all the technical designs had been examined. 
  But it was not until 27 December 1993, when the Be River was 
safely dammed, that the quality of the design was affirmed. 
  "Brain power is very cheap," joked a number of people. Thac 
Mo cost more than 1.5 trillion, but the technical design work of 
the men cost only about 3 billion, which is just 0.2 percent of 
the total cost. 
  Thac Mo is no longer a dream. The same is true of other 
large 
hydroelectric projects such as Ham Thuan-Dami (472 mw). Things 
have been turned over to them and they have gotten underway. 
  Many people refer to the 500-kv north-south landline as the 
"rapid landline." 
  Ten years ago, the 220-kv landline from Bien Hao to Tri An, 
a 
distance of 23 km, was called the "rapid landline" because it 
was built in just 7 months. Another well-known landline was the 
230-kv landline from Thu Duc to Can Tho: after more than 6 long 
years (1979-1985) and tens of "operations," 180 km were 
"basically completed." This was the case even though pillars, 
insulators, lines, and so on were on hand in the storehouses 
prior to the start of construction. 
  The 500-kv north-south landline runs for 1,480 km from Hoa 
Binh to Phu Lam in Ho Chi Minh City. People have done research, 
drawn up designs, carried on construction, and purchased 
equipment. There is nothing simple about this ultramodern 
landline. The line passes through many very difficult sections: 
the Cam Thuy mountains in Thanh Hoa, 25 km; the Hai Van area 
from Hue to Danang, 50 km; the the Lo So gorge in Kontum, 120 
km; Krong Ana to Daknong in Dak Lak, 100 km, and so on. Who 
would have thought that in less than 2 years from when 
construction officially got underway, the basic work--laying the 
foundation, erecting the pillars, laying the landline--would 
have been completed. 
  Hoang Dinh Hai, Nguyen Van Tan, Ly Van Tho, Le Van Hien, 
Tran 
Vinh Tai, and Tran Phuoc Nhi, the leaders of the units 
subordinate to Power Construction and Installation Corporation 
II, the unit responsible for constructing that section of the 
line from Buon Ma Thuot to Phu Lam (a distance of 320 km), 
confirmed that it had been necessary to overcome many great 
"obstacles." Construction had to be carried on in mountainous 
terrain filled with mines and bombs left from the war, there 
were battles against malaria, and there were difficulties 
because of the long distances involved, because the area was 
uninhabited, and because of the swamps near the cities. Together 
with many other "landline workers," about 5,000 people along the 
route and 110,000 other people were mobilized to complete the 
landline on time and transmit electricity from the north to the 
south by spring. 
  Bui Van Luu, the director of Power Corporation II, said that 
to date, the national power network has reached 93 percent of 
the districts and 55 percent of the villages in the south. In 
1993, per capita electricity output in the south reached 150 
KWh, which is almost double that (80 KWh) in 1975. But in a 
number of provinces in the Mekong Delta, output has reached only 
40 KWh per person. In An Giang, the province with the highest 
rice yield in the country, output has reached only 35 KWh per 
person per year. As of October 1993, An Giang was ranked fourth 
in the south with respect to the number of galvanometers: 
28,152. But in Tri Ton, Tinh Bien, and Phu Tan, some villages 
had only six galvanometers. The average is one galvanometer per 
10,000 people. Here, the people have to purchase electricity at 
a cost of 750-900 dong per KWh. 
  In many other places besides An Giang, the peasants in the 
south are not very happy with "Mr. Electricity." Many localities 
have formed hydroelectric corporations, power service 
corporations, and so on in order to purchase and sell 
electricity. 
  Peasants in the south are still waiting for the Spring 
electrical current to reach every house.

  [Text] Washington, March 3 KYODO -- President Bill Clinton 
decided to reinstate the "Super 301" trade provision by 
executive order in an effort to ward off political pressure from 
Congress for tougher measures, a senior Clinton aide said 
Thursday [3 March]. 
  Also, the official said, Clinton wanted to keep the trade 
dispute with Japan under White House control and settle their 
differences through discussion, and not confrontation. 
  Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic 
policy, said that was the message Clinton wanted to give to 
Tokyo when he called Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa before the 
White House announced Clinton's decision to reinstate Super 301, 
a move strongly opposed by Japan. 
  "The President felt extremely strongly that even though we 
were doing something that the Government of Japan would disagree 
with, that it was important that he personally called and talked 
with the prime minister," cutter said in an interview with KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE. 
  Clinton "wanted the prime minister to understand that there 
was domestic pressure here, political pressure, that he had 
carried out the executive order rather than simply allow 
legislation in Congress to occur," Cutter said. 
  There have been several legislative moves in Congress since 
the trade talks between Washington and Tokyo collapsed February 
11. 
  Trade bills submitted include a tougher version of "Super 
301" sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus calling for reinstating the 
trade legislation on a permanent basis. 
  The "Super 301" measure authorized by Clinton requires the 
U.S. Government to identify unfair trade practices in 1994 and 
1995. 
  Cutter said Clinton had also give instructions to his aides 
in an executive order that "was more discretionary and allowed 
more control" by the White House. 
  The President hoped that Hosokawa and senior officials in 
the 
Government of Japan would understand and would read the language 
of executive order carefully, Cutter said. 
  Clinton believes that he has established a strong sense of 
personal trust with Hosokawa and that in"working together" the 
two of them "can keep control of events," Cutter said. 
  "What he wanted was to be able to solve these (trade) 
problems in discussion," Cutter said of Clinton's intentions in 
calling and talking directly to the Japanese prime minister. 
  Cutter acknowledged that there is "a great deal of distrust" 
on both sides over trade issues but he did not think there was 
any distrust between the two leaders. 
  Despite the failure of their meeting on February 11 to agree 
on a new bilateral trade framework, Cutter said the two leaders 
"hit it off extremely well" the next morning when Clinton 
invited Hosokawa and his wife, Kayoko, for breakfast at the 
White House.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Two influential business 
organizations urged the government on Monday [7 March] to expand 
Japan's 10-year public works investment program by more than 100 
trillion yen to break an impasse in Japan-U.S. economic 
relations. 
  The program calls for spending 430 trillion yen on public 
works projects from fiscal 1991 to 2000 to stimulate domestic 
demand. 
  The Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), in a 
recommendation to the government, proposed income tax cuts for 
two consecutive years through a revision of the tax system. 
  The federation also urged the government to set a target for 
reduction of Japan's huge current account surplus to a certain 
proportion of its gross domestic product. 
  It stressed the need for Japan to promote the opening of its 
market and economic deregulation. 
  The federation urged private corporations for their own 
efforts to expand imports. 
  Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), called on Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Monday and submitted a list of proposals for 
restructuring Japan-U.S. relations, association officials said. 
  They said the proposals included an increase in spending on 
public works projects by more than 100 trillion yen over the 
next 10 years and bringing down the level of Japan's current 
account surplus to about 2.0 percent of its gross domestic 
product.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Tuesday [8 March] he will continue trying to break 
an impasse on talks over a new trade "framework" between Japan 
and the United States. 
  Hosokawa, speaking at the House of Representatives plenary 
session, said "a window for the negotiations is still open to 
both Japan and the United States." 
  Japan is determined to go ahead with its pump-priming 
measures and the opening of its market to foreign traders, he 
said. 
  The prime minister was referring to his February 11 summit 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Hosokawa and Clinton 
announced the breakdown of the framework talks at a joint news 
conference following the Washington summit. 
  Hosokawa, replying to questions by Shunichi Suzuki, a member 
of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), expressed 
worries about the reinstatement of the "Super 301" trade 
provision, which he said violates the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Super 301, reintroduced by Clinton on March 3, gives the 
U.S. 
Government power to impose retaliatory tariffs against unfair 
traders if they fail to remove trade barriers. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told the same session that 
Japan, the U.S. and South Korea will make joint efforts to 
resolve the issue of North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons. 
  At the House of Councillors earlier in the day, Hosokawa 
renewed his pledge to reform Japan's economic structure, which 
has been criticized by other countries as impeding fair trade. 
  "The Japanese people expected the coalition government to 
break the rigidity of politics and the economy caused by the 
long-term rule of the Liberal Democratic Party," he said. 
  Hosokawa also expressed hope that the Japanese economy will 
see a recovery in fiscal 1994, which begins in April. 
  Accelerating inventory adjustment in the private sector 
offers bright prospects but the economy remains stagnant in 
general, he said at the upper house session. 
  "The government compiled the 15 trillion yen stimulus 
package 
and incorporated measures into the fiscal 1994 budget to bring 
the economy back on track as early as possible in fiscal 1994 
and keep up stable growth from fiscal 1995 on," the premier said. 
  He was responding to questions by Tomio Yamamoto, an LDP 
upper house legislator. 
  Hosokawa tried to allay concern about a possible shortage of 
rice, saying the government increased the amount of domestically 
grown rice to be sold in March and is taking steps to solve the 
shortage. 
  Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of 
rice to make up for the shortage resulting from last year's 
worst harvest in the postwar period. 
  Representatives of political parties started three days of 
interpellations Monday on last Friday's policy speeches by 
Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers.

  [Text] Washington, March 7 KYODO -- International Business 
Machines Corp. last year became the first American company in 
eight years to be granted the largest number of U.S. patents, a 
report said Monday [7 March]. 
  IBM vaulted past Japanese firms with 1,085 patents in 1993, 
surpassing second-placed Toshiba Corp. of Japan by 45, the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office report said. 
  Canon Inc., the Japanese camera and optical instruments 
maker, ranked third with 1,038 patents. 
  Eastman Kodak Co. jumped from seventh to fourth position 
with 
1,007 patents, followed by General Electric Co. with 933. In 
1992, only one U.S. firm was in the top five, the patent office 
said. 
  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. ranked fifth in 1993 with 926 
patents, followed by Hitachi Ltd. with 912. 
  Motorola Inc. of the U.S. was eighth with 729 patents, and 
two Japanese companies -- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and 
Fuji Photo Film Co. -- rounded off the top 10 places for 
nongovernmental organizations. Matsushita got 712 and Fuji 
Photo 962. 
  A record 188,099 patent applications flooded the U.S. Patent 
Office in the fiscal year that ended September 30 last year. 
  The office said it granted 107,332 patents, 45 percent of 
them to non-U.S. interests. The number was 2,396 less than the 
previous year.

  [Text] Washington, March 7 KYODO -- The United States has 
proposed using numerical indicators to monitor sales of 
U.S.-made cellular phones in Japan, informed sources in 
Washington said Monday [7 March]. 
  The U.S. is due to announce sanctions against Japan next 
week 
over a trade dispute on the phones, and the sources said its 
latest position means it expects the volume of sales of 
Motorola-type cellular phones to increase to about 240,000 in 
the cellular service area extending from Tokyo to Nagoya. 
  The U.S. Government says Japan has violated a 1989 cellular 
phone trade accord, and is scheduled to unveil by Thursday of 
next week a list of Japanese products subject to U.S. import 
sanctions if no settlement is reached by then. 
  At present, the U.S. cellular phone maker Motorola Inc. is 
holding talks with its Japanese partner Nippon Idou Tsushin 
Corp. (IDO). 
  IDO has reportedly offered to accept a Motorola demand to 
install 159 Motorola base stations for relay of cellular phone 
transmissions, while Motorola is said to have withdrawn a demand 
that IDO buy 225,000 Motorola phones. 
  IDO offers both Motorola systems and those made by Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) for its cellular phone 
service in Tokyo-Nagoya area. According to U.S. figures, IDO 
had signed up 308,000 NTT-type cellular phone subscribers as of 
the end of last year, and Motorola a mere 12,900 subscribers.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. 
(IDO) is close to reaching an agreement with Motorola Inc. of 
the United States on opening Japan's cellular phone market to 
Motorola systems, Japan's postal minister suggested Tuesday [8 
March]. 
  Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki told 
reporters after a cabinet meeting that the Japanese cellular 
phone service company and the U.S. telecommunications equipment 
maker appear to have made good progress in their talks. 
  Kanzaki would not say when IDO and Motorola are likely to 
reach agreement but added he believes both companies are keeping 
in mind a U.S. plan to announce trade sanctions against Japan on 
March 17 if no settlement is attained. 
  Kanzaki also declined to confirm news reports that the U.S. 
has demanded that sales of Motorola-type cellular phones be 
increased to about 240,000 per year in the cellular service area 
extending from Tokyo to Nagoya.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Japan's major computer chip 
makers are building manufacturing lines for leading-edge memory 
chips, company officials said Monday [7 March]. 
  NEC Corp. will build a new line at its plant in Roseville, 
California, that could produce 64-megabit dynamic random-access 
memory (DRAM) chips, an NEC spokesman said. 
  NEC also plans to build a manufacturing plant in Kyushu for 
64- megabit chips for production starting in August. 
  Hitachi Ltd. is building a plant in Ibaraki Prefecture that 
will contain facilities for production of 64-megabit chips, a 
Hitachi spokesman said. 
  Fujitsu Ltd. also has a plan to build a similar-level of 
facilities for logic chips, a Fujitsu spokesman said. 
  The moves are viewed by analysts as efforts by Japanese chip 
makers to gain a step on their U.S. and South Korean rivals in 
the market share contest for 64-megabit chips.

  [Text] Tokyo -- Senior officials at the U.S. Defense and 
State Departments held a meeting on 28 February with Ichiro 
Yoneyama, director general of the Defense Facilities Agency 
[DFA] who is visiting the United States to settle the issue of 
U.S. military bases on Okinawa. At the meeting, the officials 
mentioned the reversion of Yomitan auxiliary airfield and said: 
"We will study the possibility of its return." It is the first 
positive comment U.S. officials have shown regarding return of 
Yomitan auxiliary airfield. 
  The remarks came from Assistant Secretary of State for East 
Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord and Assistant Secretary 
of Defense for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Ross [name as 
received] following a request from Director General Yoneyama for 
a response on three pending matters -- return of Naha Naval 
Port, return of Yomitan airfield, and the suspension of 
live-shell firing exercises over prefectural highway 104. 
  Yoneyama said: "It is the wish of the prefectural people to 
settle these issues." 
  According to the DFA, until now the United States has only 
mentioned the possibility of moving the parachute training which 
is currently carried out at Yomitan auxiliary airfield. It has 
never before hinted at the return of the airfield, instead 
arguing that "it also acts as a radio wave impact area for both 
Torii and Sobe communications stations which are located near 
the auxiliary airfield." 
  The United States has said that parachuting training could 
be 
held at other sites, but has maintained that "the return of the 
auxiliary airfield itself is difficult." 
  At the 28 February meeting, however, the U.S. officials 
said: 
"We would like to study the possibility of returning the 
airfield once we have moved parachute training to another area." 
They reportedly showed their understanding of the feelings of 
the prefectural people toward U.S. military bases on Okinawa. 
It is also said they promised to exert efforts to cooperate 
with the Japanese Government to settle other issues as well. 
  The DFA is taking a positive view of the remarks by the U.S. 
officials, saying: "It is a major advance that U.S. officials 
took positive line on the return of Yomitan auxiliary airfield." 
  The agency hopes Director General Yoneyama will continue his 
meetings with high-level U.S. officials. 
  He is due to arrive in Las Vegas on 1 March and visit San 
Diego on 2 March to make inspection tours of military bases. 
The bases include Nellis Air Force Base, which supervises night 
landing practices held in Japan; North Island Naval Base; and 
Miramar Naval Base. He is scheduled to meet base commanders and 
other officials.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Japan is not considering 
new macroeconomic trade measures despite recent calls from the 
domestic business community, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
said Tuesday [8 March]. 
  Fujii told a regular press conference that he has heard no 
discussions in the government of new steps, such as 
much-discussed macroeconomic targets. 
  He declined to say directly whether a proposed increase in a 
10- year 430 trillion yen public works spending program would be 
included in a market-opening package to be compiled this month. 
  Leading Japanese business organizations are calling for a 
boost in the fiscal 1991-2000 spending program and for targeting 
a reduction in the current account surplus as a percentage of 
gross domestic product (GDP). 
  Asked about such proposals, Fujii repeated that cabinet 
ministers discussing the market-opening package will likely 
confirm plans to act "voluntarily and positively" in four key 
areas, in a meeting expected to be held before U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher arrives Wednesday for an official visit. 
  The four areas are deregulation, import promotion, the 
boosting of antitrust enforcement and the improvement of 
government procurement practices. 
  He also called for steady implementation of the government's 
15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package together with the 
fiscal 1993 third supplementary budget, and swift enactment of 
the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  He repeated that these measures will have "an extremely big 
effect" in boosting domestic demand, a key component of efforts 
to reduce Japan's trade imbalances. 
  Fujii said he hopes the steps will be taken "as soon as 
possible" with "sufficient deliberation" in the Diet on the tax 
revision bills, which include tax cuts of some 6 trillion yen 
contained in the stimulus package. 
  He declined to say whether a delay beyond the month's end in 
passing the bills might hold up the staged income tax cuts, 
which are slated for implementation this summer. 
  On Monday, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a press 
conference he wants the government to pass the bills by the end 
of March to give the ministry time to implement the tax cuts 
promptly.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa renewed his pledge Tuesday [8 March] to reform Japan's 
economic structure which has been criticized by other countries 
as impeding fair trade. 
  "As the coalition government was established, the Japanese 
people expected it to break the rigidity of politics and the 
economy caused by the long-term rule of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP)," Hosokawa said at a plenary session of the House of 
Councillors. 
  Hosokawa launched the seven-party coalition last August 
after 
breaking the LDP's 38-year-long grip on power. 
  At Monday's plenary session of the more powerful House of 
Representatives, the prime minister vowed continued efforts to 
make the Japanese economy more open to the rest of the world 
even though the initial task of the coalition government to 
reform politics is complete. 
  Hosokawa also expressed hope that the Japanese economy will 
see a recovery in fiscal 1994, which begins in April. 
  Accelerating inventory adjustment in the private sector 
offers bright prospects but the economy remains stagnant in 
general, he said. 
  "The government compiled the 15 trillion yen stimulus 
package 
and incorporated measures into the fiscal 1994 budget to bring 
the economy back on track as early as possible in fiscal 1994 
and keep up stable growth from fiscal 1995 on," the premier said. 
  He was responding to questions by Tomio Yamamoto, an LDP 
upper house legislator. 
  Hosokawa tried to allay concern about a possible shortage of 
rice, saying the government increased the amount of domestically 
grown rice to be sold in March and is taking steps to solve the 
shortage. 
  Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of 
rice to make up for the shortage resulting from last year's 
worst harvest in the postwar period. 
  Representatives of political parties started three days of 
interpellations Monday on last Friday's policy speeches by 
Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura on Tuesday [8 March] urged top government 
bureaucrats to make further efforts to work out deregulation 
steps, the pillar of market-opening measures to be announced 
later this month. 
  Takemura called in vice ministers in charge of trade, 
agriculture and construction to the prime minister's official 
residence and made the request, government officials said. 
  It is unprecedented that the chief cabinet spokesman gave 
such instructions directly to top bureaucrats of the government 
ministries and agencies, the officials added. 
  In a related development, the second round of talks between 
ministers concerned with external economic affairs will be held 
on Thursday rather than Wednesday as originally scheduled, 
government sources said. 
  The ministers will discuss measures to further open Japanese 
markets to foreign products as part of the nation's voluntary 
efforts to reduce its huge trade surplus.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Japan's most powerful 
business lobby and the largest umbrella organization for labor 
unions agreed Tuesday [8 March] that a proposed third-party 
agency to promote deregulation should comprise only 
private-sector members, officials said. 
  In a meeting with officials of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), representatives of the Japan Trade 
Union Confederation (Rengo) suggested that the proposed agency 
should not include retired bureaucrats, so as to remain 
independent from the government. 
  The idea was put forward by the advisory group for economic 
structural reform, headed by Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa, 
when the government advisory body unveiled a package of measures 
to ease state regulations and boost the Japanese economy late 
last year. 
  The Keidanren officials supported the Rengo suggestion and 
said the federation will convey the request to Koshiro Ishida, 
director general of the Management and Coordination Agency, in 
late March. 
  The bilateral meeting also dealt with tensions in the trade 
ties between Japan and the United States, and the domestic 
economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- A senior official of the 
Trade Ministry opposed a proposal Tuesday [8 March] for Japan to 
set quantitative goals in macroeconomic fields as part of its 
efforts to cut its huge trade surplus. 
  Japan should not make the achievement of a specific ratio of 
current account surplus against gross domestic product (GDP) 
into a government commitment, said the official, who declined to 
be identified. 
  It is impossible for the government to guarantee the 
fulfillment of such a pledge, the official said, explaining that 
current account balance figures are easily affected by external 
factors beyond government control, such as crude oil prices. 
  The official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] was commenting on Monday's proposal by the 
Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) to 
reduce the profit ratio to 2 percent of the GDP within three 
years. 
  To set such an economic goal is tantamount to the "numerical 
targets" Japan has repeatedly rejected in trade talks with 
Washington as managed trade, the official said. 
  He said Tokyo cannot go beyond seeking to achieve "a highly 
significant decrease" in its current account surplus as agreed 
during the Japan-U.S. summit in July 1993. 
  The comments came amid growing calls from both within and 
outside the government for Japan to set some macroeconomic goals 
in order to mend the soured economic ties with the United States. 
  The Foreign Ministry, for example, proposed the GDP profit 
ratio be cut to 2.8 percent for fiscal 1994 from the 3.1 percent 
estimated for the current year. 
  On a revival of a U.S. trade provision known as Super 301, 
the MITI official said he feels the step is designed to smooth 
the way for a breakthrough in the Japan-U.S. trade dispute 
rather than targeting Tokyo for retaliation. 
  Under the provision, Washington will identify trade 
practices 
it finds unfair to U.S. products, using findings from an annual 
survey on global trading practices set for release at the end of 
March. The U.S. administration would then have until September 
30 to pinpoint priority countries engaged in unfair trading. 
  The U.S. may have selected a September deadline, rather than 
an earlier one as previously expected, to reflect Washington's 
consideration toward Japan and give it more time to take market- 
opening steps, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The government's fair trade 
watchdog unveiled Friday [4 March] new draft guidelines designed 
to eradicate rampant bid-rigging activities on tenders for 
public works projects. The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) will 
formalize by summer the draft calling for strict controls on a 
wide range of activities related to bids on public works 
projects to replace the current standards established in 1984, 
FTC officials said. 
  The new guidelines will classify suspect corporate 
activities 
into three categories -- those that violate the Antimonopoly 
Law, those that do not, and those that are on the borderline. 
  Such acts as selecting before bidding takes place firms 
expected to get the orders on public works projects, rigging bid 
prices or deciding the minimum tender price, will be stipulated 
as violation of the law. 
  The draft also says exchanging information on bids, 
including 
bidders' business records or tender prices, has a high 
probability of violating the Fair Trade Law. 
  Exchanging information about the prospect of firms' 
participation in bids or forming joint ventures for bidding will 
also fall into the category of acts that could violate the law. 
  The existing guidelines allow firms to exchange information 
about bids as long as they do not select the successful bidder 
or set the tender price, but the system is regarded as being 
full of loopholes to allow bid-rigging practices. 
  The FTC move comes against the backdrop of prosecutors 
investigating corrupt relations between politicians and 
construction companies over public works projects and the United 
States harshly criticizing the closed nature of the Japanese 
construction market. 
  The construction ministry, since last December, has been 
tackling a wholesale review of the bidding system for public 
works projects to secure fairness and give wider access to 
foreign competitors under the open-bidding system expected to be 
introduced in April, ministry officials said. 
  The FTC will finalize the draft guidelines after hearing 
views from ministries involved and economic organizations, as 
well as from the U.S. and the European Union, the officials 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The Japanese securities 
industry said Friday [4 March] it plans to allow individual 
investors to trade in Chinese stocks through brokerage houses. 
  The Japan Securities Dealers Association said the Shanghai 
Stock Exchange will be designated as its 36th overseas bourse on 
which Japanese investors will be allowed to trade in stocks. 
The association said a formal decision on the matter will be 
made at its executive session to be held next week. 
  The Chinese Government allows foreign individuals to sell or 
buy designated issues on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which was 
opened in 1990. 
  Shanghai authorities asked the association in January to 
allow individual Japanese investors to participate in trading, 
officials said. Shanghai will become the eighth stock exchange 
in Asia to be designated by the association, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japan is looking to export 
surplus ethylene manufacturing facilities to China in a bid to 
help China's chemical industry develop and at the same time ease 
a glut in domestic facilities, a government official said Friday 
[4 March]. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is 
dispatching a trade mission jointly with petrochemical concerns 
and trading houses to China to sell the idea, a ministry 
official said. The mission is to meet Chinese Government 
officials during a visit from next Thursday through March 13, 
the official said. 
  Japan is ready to provide Chinese firms with low-interest 
loans from the Export-Import Bank of Japan if the two sides 
reach agreement on the deal, the official added. 
  Japan has an ethylene-manufacturing capacity of some seven 
million tons a year, way above the five million tons needed 
domestically every year. Ethylene is a key petrochemical 
material used in a wide range of industrial resin products. 
  China now faces a shortage of petrochemical products such as 
resins as it industrializes, according to the official.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Russian and Japanese 
experts to a two-day symposium on Russia's economic reforms 
singled out the recent hyperinflation and sharp drops in 
investment as the biggest problems to be tackled, an Economic 
Planning Agency (EPA) official said Friday [4 March]. 
  The symposium, sponsored by the EPA, opened Thursday in 
Tokyo 
as part of the educational assistance for Russia's economic 
reforms pledged by Japan in May 1993. 
  Russian participants to the symposium, the second of its 
kind 
following one in March 1993, included Andrey Shapovalyants, 
first vice economic minister, Aleksey Ulyukayev, deputy director 
of the institute for economy in transition, and Vladimir Volkov, 
deputy chief of the department of the social and economic 
development. 
  Japanese participants included Shinyasu Hoshino, president 
of 
the National Institute for Research Advancement, Nobuyoshi 
Araki, chief economist at the East and West Research Institute, 
and Masashi Kato, the EPA's vice minister for international 
economic affairs. 
  According to the EPA official, the participants discussed 
macroeconomic aspects of the problem of inflation in Russia 
under which consumer prices rose by 9.4 times and wholesale 
prices tenfold during 1993. 
  They also talked about the sharp drop in investment in 
Russia, to the point that it is difficult even to renew obsolete 
equipment and facilities. 
  The Russian participants reported at the symposium that 
Russia's efforts to introduce market economy have now come to 
the stage of "irreversibility." But its economy is still in 
poor condition, with gross national product contracting by 12 
percent and industrial output dropping by 16.2 percent in 1993 
from the previous year, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Russia has released a 
Japanese fisherman detained since August for allegedly 
encroaching its territorial waters off Japan's northernmost main 
island of Hokkaido, Foreign Ministry officials said Monday [7 
March]. 
  The action follows the release in late February of 21 
Japanese fishermen detained in waters near the four disputed 
Russian-held islands. 
  The Sakhalin provincial government notified the Japanese 
consulate general in Khavarovsk on last Thursday that it would 
release Fujio Honma, captain of No. 18 Toho Maru, on Saturday at 
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. 
  Japanese officials received honma as scheduled Saturday at 
the Sakhalin detention house, the ministry said. 
  Honma is in good condition and will fly back to Japan on 
Friday, they said. 
  Russia detained the fishing vessel on August 30. of a crew 
of 
four, three have already been released. 
  Honma's release brings the number of Japanese fishermen 
still 
detained in Russia to 22.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Japan will extend 
assistance totaling 907.8 million yen to the World Food Program 
(WFP) to help people afflicted by conflicts in the former 
Yugoslavia, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday [8 March]. 
  The package includes 37.8 million yen to transport 120 
million yen worth of hardtack and some 750 million yen to 
purchase and transport canned fish, the ministry said. 
  The aid will be extended in response to requests by the WFP 
and other international organizations to help an estimated 4.26 
million people in the strife-torn region, it said. 
  The people are suffering from a serious lack of food, daily 
goods, medical facilities, electricity, gas and water, the 
ministry said. 
  Foreign Ministry official said the latest assistance was 
also 
decided as a result of a government mission which visited the 
region in early January to study possible areas in which Japan 
can step up its aid. 
  Japan has so far extended a total of 82 million dollars 
(about 10.1 billion yen) to the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR), the WFP and other organizations offering 
humanitarian assistance to the people in the region.

  [Text] Nagoya, March 9 KYODO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said 
Wednesday it will enter the market for off-road four-wheel drive 
(4wd) subcompacts in Japan and Europe in the near future. 
  The 2000cc RAV4 model will be introduced domestically after 
May and on the European market in summer, Toyota officials said. 
  They refrained from revealing the price, but industry 
sources 
project it will be around 2 million yen in Japan. 
  The new model marks the first subcompact off-road car 
offered 
by Toyota, which has previously marketed the cars with larger 
capacity, the officials said. 
  The smaller off-road cars have gained popularity among young 
people because they can also be easily driven about town. 
  Suzuki Motor Corp. has enjoyed monthly sales of more than 
1,000 units of such cars.

  [Text] Nagasaki, March 8 KYODO -- The Maritime Safety 
Agency arrested 20 Vietnamese on Tuesday [8 March] on suspicion 
of illegally entering the country aboard a small wooden boat the 
previous day. 
  The agency did not arrest four children found on the boat, 
officials said. 
  The Vietnamese were discovered boarding a boat anchored off 
Ukujima Island in the Goto group of islands, part of Nagasaki 
Prefecture in western Japan. 
  This is the first application of a new rule adopted at an 
international conference on refugees from Indochina in Geneva 
last month. 
  Special regulations allowing boat people from Indochina 
temporary immigration permits pending screening of their 
applications for refugee status were abolished Saturday as a 
result of the conference. 
  Under the new system, people from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia 
who enter Japan without valid passports will be deported to 
their home countries without the option of seeking refugee 
status. 
  The boat left Haiphong with 10 people on board in October 
12, 
1993, and moved along the Chinese coast calling at ports where 
it was supplied with fuel and food, and picking up 14 more 
people on the way, agency officials said.

deportation without being allowed to apply for refugee status if 
convicted of illegally entering Japan, the Justice Ministry 
said. Special regulations allowing boat people from Indochina 
temporary immigration permits pending screening of their

  The abolition was in line with the results of an

  Under the new system, people from Vietnam, Laos, and 
Cambodia, who enter Japan without valid passports will be

  Residents of Ukujima Island in the Goto group of islands in 
Nagasaki Prefecture spotted the 24 people aboard a small wooden 
boat anchored some three kilometers southeast of the island at 
around 7:20 A.M. and informed the authorities. 
  The boat people are being questioned by Maritime Safety 
Agency officials. They are thought to be from Vietnam and 
include seven women and four children, agency officials said.

  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria, who was wearing a cap and

are isolating developing nations. Meanwhile, here in Colombia 
the controversy that his trip to Japan has sparked is still 
growing. Raul Gutierrez has filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] The rounds of applause amazed 
President Gaviria in Tokyo shortly before he entered the 
university [not specified] to receive an honorary doctoral 
degree and when he appeared before approximately 4,000 students 
wearing a cap and gown. The president explained here how 
Colombia was the only Latin American country that grew during 
the so-called lost decade, the 1980's. 
  He took his message elsewhere later. Bankers and 
industrialists told him Colombia's negative image is being 
exaggerated. He replied the violence his country is facing will 
not destabilize the economy or democracy. 
  [Gaviria] Foreign investors who have conducted business in 
Colombia during the last 30 years, including renowned Japanese 
companies, deem Colombia's security problem as an affordable and 
manageable risk. 
  [Gutierrez] Before he attended a meeting with journalists, 
he 
met with Prime Minister Hosokawa. President Gaviria will meet 
with Emperor Akihito on 1 March. [end recording]

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japan's new ambassador to 
the United Nations, Hisashi Owada, indicated Friday [4 March] he 
will work to achieve a permanent seat for Japan in the Security 
Council. "Carrying out the role expected of Japan in an 
extremely important body such as the Security Council is 
important, and a large number of countries expect this (of 
Japan)," said the former vice foreign minister in an interview 
with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  Owada, 61, who is the father of Princess Masako, wife of 
Crown Prince Naruhito, also said trade friction with the United 
States should not be allowed to cause a deterioration in the 
bilateral relationship. He said that in the relationship with 
the U.S., "there are many areas where security, the economy and 
society overlap." 
  "Becoming antagonists is out of the question," Owada said. 
"It is dangerous to surmise that friction will occur 
periodically." 
  Owada said the achievement of an early resolution of 
economic 
problems between the U.S. and Japan is vital. "Restructuring 
the economic relationship with Japan is an important mission of 
the administration of President Bill Clinton," he said. 
  Owada, who resigned as the Foreign Ministry's top bureaucrat 
last August, replaced Yoshio Hatano in the New York posting 
earlier this week.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 5 KYODO -- Japan will drop its bid to 
join a UN mission to observe South Africa's [RSA] first all-race 
parliamentary elections and instead will dispatch election 
monitors within the framework of bilateral cooperation, 
government sources said Saturday [5 March]. 
  The government will not send election monitors under the UN 
umbrella because local circumstances portend danger such as 
terrorist attacks, the sources said. 
  Instead, the government will dispatch a dozen or so people 
to 
monitor the multiracial polls set for April at the request of 
the South African Government, they said. 
  The decision will be made by the end of this month, they 
said. 
  In January, the UN General Assembly unanimously endorsed a 
resolution calling for the sending of an 1,800-member mission to 
South Africa to monitor the elections. The United Nations has 
asked if it could join the mission, Foreign Ministry sources 
said. 
  Prior to the UN decision, Japan's parliamentary Vice Foreign 
Minister Syozo Azuma traveled to the country in early January 
and proposed to Pretoria that Japan dispatch election monitors 
to the region. 
  Foreign Minister Pik Botha pledged to Azuma that the South 
African Government will guarantee the security of Japanese 
election monitors during the election period, officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- The government decided at a 
cabinet meeting Tuesday [8 March] to send 15 election observers 
to El Salvador on Friday to join a United Nations peacekeeping 
mission there, officials said. 
  The dispatch is in line with a request from U.N. Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali made late February to send Japanese 
personnel to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary 
elections, the officials said. 
  A peace agreement was signed in January 1992 after a 
decade-long "proxy war" in El Salvador between the right-wing 
government, backed by the United States, and leftist guerrillas, 
supported by the former Soviet Union. 
  In a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo 
last November, El Salvador's President Alfredo Felix Christiani 
asked Japan to send voting monitors for the elections. 
  The 15-member Japanese team, comprising three from the 
Foreign Ministry, one from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and 
11 from the private sector, will join a 900-member U.N. unit to 
oversee the polls in the Central American country. 
  All the Japanese members are proficient in speaking Spanish, 
the officials said. 
  The Japanese team is scheduled to work in El Salvador until 
March 31, but its stay may be extended until May 10 if no 
candidate wins a majority of votes to become president and vice 
president and a reelection is called to pick the two top leaders 
of the nation. 
  El Salvador will be the third country to which Japan sends 
election observers in accordance with the U.N. Peacekeeping 
Cooperation Law, following Angola and Cambodia. 
  The 1992 law stipulates that to send election monitors 
overseas the government must confirm three necessary conditions 
-- a declared cease-fire, agreements by parties concerned to 
accept such personnel and assured neutrality in the country.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 5 KYODO -- The Food Agency is to order 
wholesalers and retailers to stop tie-in sales of domestic and 
foreign rice next week, saying such practices go against the 
Antimonopoly Law, agency officials said Saturday [5 March]. 
  "Such practices deprive consumers from freedom to choose," 
an 
official at the agency said. 
  In the face of a shortfall in last year's rice crop because 
of the cool and rainy summer, Japan early this year began to 
sell foreign rice imported from Thailand and China either mixed 
with domestic rice or separately. 
  But some retailers and wholesalers are requiring customers 
to 
buy domestic and foreign rice as a set, since long-grain rice 
imported from Thailand is unpopular with Japanese consumers, who 
favor medium and short-grain rice as a food staple.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- The blending of Japanese 
and Thai rice for retail, with the latter accounting for at 
least 20 percent, will be mandatory as an emergency measure to 
cope with any attempts to hoard Japanese rice, the head of the 
Food Agency said Monday [7 March]. 
  Hiroshi Ueno, director general of the agency, told reporters 
that to counter the high demand for Japanese rice and to ensure 
a fair distribution of it among consumers, retailers will be 
prohibited from selling Japanese rice alone. 
  Retailers will, in principle, be obliged to sell blends of 
Japanese and Thai rice, basically on an 80-20 percent basis, 
Ueno explained. 
  The agency also decided on other emergency measures, 
including stepped-up rice supplies from domestic producing areas 
to consumption centers, quicker domestic transportation of 
imported rice, a closer watch for attempts to hold back sales of 
Japanese rice in anticipation of future price rises, and a 
better explanation of rice supply and sales plans to consumers 
to dispel worries about supply shortages. 
  The package of emergency measures will be reported by Farm 
Minister Eijiro Hata to a regular cabinet meeting on Tuesday. 
  Immediately after the meeting, the agency will start giving 
administrative guidance to rice wholesalers and retailers.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's Cabinet ministers agreed Tuesday [8 March] to order 
that imported rice must be blended with domestic rice before 
being sold, government officials said. 
  The decision, made in an unofficial session after a cabinet 
meeting, supports a proposal put forward by the Food Agency, 
which said the move is needed to stop hoarding of domestic rice. 
  The move was criticized by Wakako Hironaka, director general 
of the Environment Agency, as going against the government's 
deregulation policy, the sources said. 
  They said Farm Minister Eijiro Hata stressed to the cabinet 
that consumers should not rush to purchase for fear of a 
shortage, saying, "Japan has sufficient rice. There is no need 
to worry." 
  Regarding blending, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said the 
government needs to tell the public how to cook foreign rice. 
This view was echoed by Manae Kubota, director general of the 
Economic Planning agency. 
  The farm minister told reporters after the cabinet meeting 
that his ministry favors blending because it wants rice to be 
distributed equitably among consumers amid the shortage of 
domestic rice. 
  Referring to growing criticism that consumers will be forced 
to buy foreign rice, he said, "I know there are some problems 
about blended rice. Our ministry will monitor a wide range of 
opinions, including when to start distributing the blended rice."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- The Agriculture Ministry 
will work out emergency measures to ensure smooth distribution

consumers, officials said Monday [7 March]. 
  The officials said the package of measures will be reported

  After the cabinet meeting, Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata will appeal to cunsumers to cope 
with the situation calmly because there is no supply shortage, 
the officials said. 
  Hata will say the ministry will release about 500,000 tons 
of 
rice per month from March to June, the same level as last year, 
and domestic rice will account for about 50 percent of the total 
supplied on the market in March, they said. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura ordered the Food 
Agency to implement measures to avoid confusion among consumers, 
the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura has refused to give himself up 
voluntarily to prosecutors for questioning over his alleged 
receipt of 10 million yen from leading general contractor Kajima 
Corp. in January 1992, NHK TV reported Monday [7 March]. 
  NHK said prosecutors plan to arrest Kajima's former Vice 
President Shinji Kiyoyama on suspicion of involvement in the 
sending of the money to Nakamura. 
  It also said prosecutors will raid offices involved and hold 
a meeting shortly to discuss how to handle the probe following 
Nakamura's rejection to come forward for questioning. 
  Investigators suspect Nakamura accepted the 10 million yen 
in 
reward for his influence to help prevent the lodging of a 
criminal complaint against contractors by a trade watchdog body 
over bid- rigging practices. Nakamura's deed may constitute 
bribery, investigative sources said. 
  If convicted, a bribe taker could be imprisoned for up to 
five years, according to the penal code. 
  Nakamura, 44, an incumbent conservative member of the House 
of Representatives, was a senior member of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP)'s construction lobby at the time of the 
receipt of the money. 
  He served as construction minister from December 1992 to 
August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  Law enforcement authorities are required to ask for 
permission from the Diet for the arrest of a legislator while 
the legislature is in session. The Diet is currently in a 
150-day ordinary session that started in late January. 
  Kajima's Kiyoyama, who is suspected of sending the money to 
Nakamura, allegedly asked him to put pressure on the Fair Trade 
Commission (FTC) not to file an accusation with prosecutors 
against a bid-rigging scandal involving Kajima and 65 other 
construction firms in Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo. 
  A local executive of Kajima, one of Japan's three largest 
general contractors, reportedly served as head of a club of the 
66 construction companies involved in bid-rigging in the 
prefecture. 
  At the time, Nakamura served as the deputy chairman of the 
LDP's panel on the Antimonopoly Law. 
  Nakamura reportedly met then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, 
62, 
several times from the end of 1991 to early 1992 to discuss the 
FTC's activities. 
  The FTC, investigating the scandal involving public works 
projects in Saitama Prefecture, announced in May 1992 it would 
not file an accusation and instead ordered the 66 companies to 
stop the allegedly unfair business practices. 
  Kiyoyama, 67, has already been charged with giving a 20 
million yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi while he 
was in office. 
  In a series of scandals involving major contractors, 
prosecutors have so far indicted two governors, two mayors and 
dozens of executives of construction firms. No Diet member has 
so far been arrested.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) president Yohei Kono said Tuesday [8 March] the LDP will 
not pursue party interests in considering a prosecutors' request 
to arrest former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura for his 
alleged receipt of a bribe. 
  Nakamura, 44, a House of Representatives member of the 
opposition LDP, has refused to comply with a Tokyo District 
Public Prosecutors Office request to submit to questioning 
regarding his alleged receipt of a 10 million yen bribe from 
major construction contractor Kajima Corp. 
  Diet permission is required for the arrest of 
parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet 
is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late 
January. 
  Responding to reporters at the party's headquarters, Kono 
said the party's response will "depend on the contents of the 
request." 
  "We will listen to the request and respond properly," Kono 
said. 
  Kono said it is "extremely regrettable" that Nakamura is 
under suspicion for receiving a bribe. The party executive will 
conduct its own investigation, he added. 
  "We will have to treat this seriously," he said. "The party 
will have to straighten its collar and have the relevant bodies 
look into it." 
  Meanwhile, Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama said the Diet should promptly grant permission to allow 
prosecutors to arrest Nakamura. 
  "The Diet, if asked, should quickly give the go-ahead in 
accordance with legal procedures," Murayama told a news 
conference. 
  Murayama noted he will leave the matter up to the lower 
house 
steering committee, adding the SDP, the largest force within the 
coalition, has no plans to hold an internal discussion on the 
matter. 
  Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, one of the 
seven coalition parties, also told a news conference that the 
Diet should endorse the prosecutors' request for the arrest if 
the allegation is true as media reports have claimed. 
  Tetsuzo Fuwa, presidium chairman of the opposition Japanese 
Communist Party, told reporters the Diet should approve the 
request. 
  He said it is natural for the prosecutors to conduct an 
investigation to probe the scandal. 
  Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP), another coalition member, told reporters 
that the prosecutors' request is unavoidable since Nakamura has 
refused to submit to questioning. 
  Yonezawa said he regrets the scandal has emerged at a time 
when politicians are trying to establish higher ethical 
standards, following enactment of an electoral reform package in 
late January.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prosecutors are set to ask 
the Diet on Tuesday [8 March] to waive the parliamentary 
immunity which currently provides former Construction Minister 
Kishiro Nakamura with protection from arrest, investigative 
sources said. 
  Nakamura, 44, currently a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
member in the House of Representatives, is suspected of taking 
10 million yen from leading general contractor Kajima Corp. in 
January 1992, the sources said. 
  Nakamura is also suspected of using his influence as a Diet 
member to head off a Fair Trade Commission (FTC) criminal 
complaint against major contractors over alleged bid-rigging, 
the sources said. 
  At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chairman of the LDP's 
panel on the Antimonopoly Law. He served as construction 
minister from December 1992 to August 1993 under then Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  The prosecution's petition for Diet permission of arrest 
will 
mark the 15th time in postwar history that prosecutors have 
sought to arrest a legislator during a Diet session and the 
first since a 1967 scandal involving taxi operators in Osaka. 
  The House of Representatives will decide on the request to 
arrest Nakamura after its steering committee considers whether 
to approve it. 
  Investigators suspect Nakamura accepted the 10 million yen 
from contracting giant Kajima in return for his efforts to 
deflect the FTC complaint, which concerns a bid-rigging cartel 
in Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, the sources said. 
  Nakamura has refused repeated requests by the Tokyo District 
Public Prosecutors Office to appear for questioning regarding 
his alleged receipt of the money, they said. 
  Diet permission is required for the arrest of a 
parliamentarian while the legislature is in session. The Diet 
is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late 
January. 
  On Monday, Tokyo prosecutors met senior prosecutors of the 
Supreme Public Prosecutors Office and the Tokyo High Public 
Prosecutors Office and decided to raid Nakamura's offices and 
the Tokyo headquarters of Kajima, the sources said. 
  Prosecutors also plan to rearrest a former vice president of 
Kajima, Shinji Kiyoyama, on suspicion of involvement in 
delivering the money to Nakamura, they said. 
  Investigations show Kiyoyama approached Nakamura in the 
summer of 1991, seeking his help in pressuring the FTC not to 
file an accusation against a cartel of 66 construction firms 
believed to have rigged bids on public works projects in Saitama 
Prefecture, the investigative sources said. 
  Nakamura reportedly met then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, 
62, 
several times from the end of 1991 to early 1992 to discuss the 
FTC's activities. 
  The FTC, which investigated the Saitama Prefecture 
bid-rigging, announced in may 1992 it would not file an 
accusation with public prosecutors, and instead ordered the 
contractors to stop the bid-rigging. 
  Nakamura's alleged receipt of the 10 million yen could 
constitute intermediary bribery under the penal code which says 
public officials cannot receive money for influencing other 
public officials, investigative sources said. 
  Recipients of such a bribe can be punished with up to five 
years imprisonment, according to the penal code. 
  Kajima's Kiyoyama, 67, has already been charged with giving 
a 
20 million yen bribe to then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi in 
December 1992. 
  A series of scandals involving major contractors has so far 
led to the arrest of two governors, two mayors and 29 leading 
executives of eight construction firms. 
  The arrest in March 1993 of LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru led 
to the contractors' bribery scandal. Kanemaru has been charged 
with evading a huge amount of taxes on his undeclared incomes 
which were mainly secret donations from contractors.

  [Excerpts] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- The cabinet of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa asked the Diet on Tuesday [8 March] 
to strip former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura of 
parliamentary immunity to allow prosecutors to arrest him on 
suspicion of bribery, officials said. Nakamura, 44, a House of 
Representatives member of the main opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), is suspected of taking a 10 million yen kickback 
from leading general contractor Kajima Corp. in January 1992, 
investigative sources said. 
  Prosecutors applied for a warrant of arrest for Nakamura 
from 
the Tokyo District Court. Nakamura has repeatedly refused to 
voluntarily face questioning, the sources said. 
  The prosecution's request for Diet permission to arrest a 
legislator is the 15th in the postwar period and the first since 
a 1967 case involving taxi operators in Osaka and a then LDP 
member. 
  The cabinet approved the arrest permit issued by the Tokyo 
District Court. [passage omitted] 
  The lower house will hold a plenary session to decide 
whether 
to give the go-ahead to Nakamura's arrest. 
  Prosecutors of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' 
Office, 
meanwhile, raided Nakamura's office in Tokyo's Chiyoda ward and 
the head office of the Japan Federation of Construction 
Contractors, a major association of builders, on Tuesday 
afternoon to search for evidence, the sources said. 
  Prosecutors have also rearrested Shinji Kiyoyama, a former 
senior vice president of Kajima. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who has been accused of taking a 10 
million yen bribe from a major construction firm, said Tuesday 
[8 March] he will take his fight to court. 
  Nakamura said in a statement through his lawyer that the 
truth and substance of the bribery scandal would be distorted if 
he were to agree to be questioned by prosecutors. 
  He said he would rather have prosecutors issue a warrant of 
arrest to "get it settled once and for all in court." 
  Prosecutors have requested permission to issue an arrest 
warrant against Nakamura, who has repeatedly refused to 
voluntarily present himself to prosecutors for questioning on 
suspicion of taking the 10 million yen bribe from leading 
general contractor Kajima Corp. in 1992.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) searched the offices of a contractors' association and 
over 20 member companies in Tochigi Prefecture on Tuesday [8 
March] for evidence of suspected bid rigging, commission 
officials said. 
  The companies are suspected of illegally conspiring to 
repeatedly fix bidding prices for municipal and prefectural 
public works projects. 
  The prefectural association's branch office in Utsunomiya, 
north of Tokyo, which lists 146 engineering works companies, was 
subjected to the compulsory search. 
  The searches were the first by the FTC since it investigated 
a contractors' association in Yamanashi Prefecture last May.

  [Text] Fukuoka, March 8 KYODO -- The Fukuoka District 
Court ordered major trading house Marubeni Corp. on Tuesday [8 
March] to pay 3.65 billion yen to a steel frame trader which 
went bankrupt due to bogus business deals involving Marubeni 
officials. 
  Presiding Judge Koji Maki said "business deals former 
executives made in the name of Marubeni are valid," fully 
supporting claims by the trustees of Iida Sangyo Co., based in 
Fukuoka, who demanded for payment of the outstanding sum by 
Marubeni. 
  Iida Sangyo executives made no mistake in accepting orders 
sealed and placed by Marubeni officials, as "according to the 
commercial code the former (Marubeni) executives were acting as 
trade employees with the powers of representation," the ruling 
said. 
  Marubeni, Iida Sangyo and Kyowa Co., a now-defunct 
steel-frame producer, signed a sales contract for steel frames 
in March 1986. 
  From that time, Marubeni placed orders with Kyowa through 
Iida Sangyo, which also advanced the money for the deals. 
  Marubeni refused to refund Iida Sangyo a total of 3.65 
billion yen for six orders placed between April to September 
1990, claiming it had not placed any new orders with the company 
after August 1988. 
  Due to the outstanding 3.6 billion yen owed by Marubeni and 
further claims amounting to 2.2 billion yen against Kyowa, Iida 
Sangyo had to file for bankruptcy. The Fukuoka District Court 
eventually declared the company insolvent in February 1991.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's cabinet approved Tuesday bills to cut local taxes, as 
part of a planned one-year 6-trillion yen reduction in income 
taxes for 1994. The bills, still subject to Diet approval, call 
for a 1.7 trillion yen reduction in residential tax, while also 
allowing local governments to issue debt-financing bonds to pay 
for the local tax cut. 
  Leaders of the ruling coalition agreed last month to cut 
income taxes for one year as part of the latest 
recession-fighting package designed to stimulate the sluggish 
economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
Governor Yasushi Mieno said Tuesday [8 March] the central bank 
needs to keep a close watch on rising trends in long-term 
open-market interest rates. 
  Short-term interest rates have stayed at low levels while 
long- term rates keep rising, Mieno was quoted as telling 
cabinet ministers concerned with the economy. 
  His remarks were quoted at a press conference by Manae 
Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), 
at which she announced the agency's monthly economic report. 
  She quoted Mieno as saying that market yields on long-term 
government bonds are on the rise, reflecting diminishing 
expectations of a fall in interest rates, the global uptrend in 
money market rates and the deteriorating supply-demand situation 
in the domestic bond market. 
  Long-term government bond yields are also climbing in 
response to pickups in some parts of the nation's economy, Mieno 
was also quoted as saying. 
  The latest EPA economic report described the current 
economic 
state as "generally sluggish although showing some brighter 
signs," an improvement from "general sluggishness" in the 
previous report. 
  Mieno was also quoted as saying plus and minus factors are 
still conflicting in the Japanese economy. The BOJ will thus 
keep closely monitoring the trend in interest rates in steering 
the nation's monetary policy, he said. 
  On Japan's money supply, Mieno said the key money supply 
growth gauge is staying at low levels. 
  Meanwhile, EPA chief Kubota, referring to the latest 
economic 
report, said Japan's economy is heading in "a better direction." 
  But she warned against excessive optimism on the outlook, 
saying the EPA will cautiously watch developments. 
  Last summer, the EPA withdrew a statement that the economy 
had bottomed out. She said, "burgeoning buds in some part of 
the economy should be nurtured so that they become full blown."

  [Text] Utsunomiya, March 6 KYODO -- Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Sunday [6 March] that the Japanese economy 
has "clearly bottomed out," adding that although the economic 
situation is in a delicate stage, various factors (indicating 
economic affairs) are gradually improving. 
  Fujii expressed his views on the current state of the 
country's economy, plagued by the longest recession in the 
postwar period, during a speech in Oyama, Tochigi Prefecture, 
north of Tokyo. 
  Fujii also expressed strong hope to raise taxes designed to 
fund welfare programs by increasing the current 3 percent 
consumption tax. 
  He said that financing Japan's increasingly aging society 
with income tax revenues has reached its limits. 
  Fujii said that while in office he wants to lay the 
groundwork for setting up a tax system to finance pension funds 
and a care system for the elderly.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Japan's economy remains 
sluggish as a whole, though only some areas of personal spending 
show a slight recovery, the Economic Planning Agency said in a 
monthly report Tuesday [8 March]. 
  The agency said the nation's economy is still undergoing 
adjustment and in an overall slump, practically unchanged from 
expressions used in the previous month's report. 
  An agency official briefing reporters said there are some 
signs showing an upswing such as household spending, durable 
good sales and spending for leisure. 
  "But for such positive indicators the levels are still low 
and there are too many other negative indicators," the official 
said. 
  Private-sector capital spending plans for fiscal year 1994 
that starts April 1 will decline 4.5 percent from the previous 
year, according to a quarterly survey conducted by the Bank of 
Japan in February. 
  On the labor front, unemployment has steadily increased and 
job offers have decreased, particularly in the manufacturing 
sector. 
  The report noted that inventory reduction has progressed but 
industrial output has been lackluster. 
  Concerning business failures, the figure for companies going 
broke stood at the previous year's level, it said. 
  The only bright spots are public works spending, boosted by 
the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, and booming 
housing construction, buoyed by low interest rates, the report 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- The ratio of manufacturing 
companies that adopted any measures to adjust their work forces 
from October to December 1993 reached 50 percent of the total, 
the highest ratio seen since the mid-1970s, the government said 
Tuesday [8 March]. 
  A similar survey noted a 51 percent ratio in the first three 
months of 1976, when Japan was suffering from a recession 
stemming from an oil crisis. 
  In February, the Labor Ministry polled 5,359 companies with 
more than 30 employees across the nation. Of them, 3,345 
replied. 
  The ministry said the latest ratio is a 4 percentage point 
rise from the level seen in the July-September period. 
  As for trimming the work force, 38 percent of the 
respondents 
cut overtime and 24 percent decreased or suspended new hirings. 
  Seven percent temporarily closed factories, up 5 percentage 
points from the previous survey, and 2 percent called for early 
retirement or dismissed employees, an increase of 1 percent from 
the previous poll. 
  As for the service industry, the ministry said the ratio of 
companies that reduced staffers increased by 7 percentage points 
to 31 percent. 
  The ratio for companies in the wholesale, retail sales and 
restaurants industries, on the other hand, declined by 9 
percentage points to 27 percent.

  [Excerpt] Senior ASEAN officials have agreed in principle 
to the idea of inviting Burma to a meeting of ASEAN foreign 
ministers taking place in Bangkok in July, a Thai foreign 
ministry spokesman said yesterday. But it remains to be decided 
whether Burma should be invited as "guest of the host country," 
or "guest of ASEAN," said Suwit Simasakun. "There's still time 
to think about this. The principle is not to isolate them (the 
Burmese) but how far they will be involved depends on them," he 
said. 
  ASEAN officials have long made clear that an invitation to 
Rangoon would be contingent on progress toward political 
liberalisation in Burma. 
  Thailand is hosting what will be the 27th annual conference 
of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations. 
  Consensus on inviting Burma to the ASEAN foreign ministers' 
gathering was reached yesterday at a meeting in Bangkok of the 
grouping's foreign affairs and security officials. The 
so-called special SOM (Senior Officials' Meeting), continuing 
through tomorrow, is concentrating on preparations toward the 
first ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the grouping's new mechanism 
for security dialogue. In the first mention of dates, officials 
yesterday said the foreign ministers' conference would take 
place from July 23-24 and would be followed by the first session 
of the ARF on July 25. 
  The annual Post Ministerial Conference with seven so-called 
dialogue partners the United States, Canada, Australia, New 
Zealand, South Korea, Japan and the European Union is set for 
July 26-27. The six ASEAN member states are inviting these 
dialogue partners and five others -- China, Russia, Vietnam, 
Laos and Papua New Guinea -- to attend the ARF. 
  Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem 
called the ARF a mechanism for solving security problems. 
Yesterday's meeting endorsed a related idea -- the proposed 
establishment of a regional peace-keeping centre. But it 
remains to be decided whether the centre should function as a 
nucleus for training regional peacekeepers or one for exchanging 
information, said Mr Suwit. 
  The idea of setting up a regional peacekeeping centre 
surfaced last month in response to the United Nations 
secretary-general's "Agenda for Peace". Reportedly the 
brainchild of Indonesian scholar Jusuf Wanandi, of the Institute 
of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS), the idea will be 
discussed in depth at an ASEAN-ISIS workshop scheduled in 
conjunction with the next meeting of senior ASEAN officials in 
April. 
  The ASEAN officials' meeting yesterday also saw Thailand 
propose holding a Southeast Asian Ten Nations Conference. 
  The proposal calls for a ministerial-level meeting of the 
six 
ASEAN member states, and neighbours Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and 
Burma, said Director-General of East Asia Affairs Department Don 
Pramatwinai. Yesterday's gathering also discussed outstanding 
problems in the South China Sea, on the Korean Peninsula, and 
prospects of setting up a Zone of Peace Freedom and Neutrality 
(ZOPFAN). [passage omitted]

  [Text] ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh will visit 
Tehran in mid-April for talks with the Economic Cooperation 
Organization (ECO) secretariat on establishing economic, trade 
and tourism links between the two regional groupings. 
  Ajit Singh, who is attending the three-day closed-door 
Special Senior Asean Officials Meeting (SOM) in Bangkok, said 
the ECO had expressed an interest in closer ties. It was also 
in line with the decision of the third Asean summit in Singapore 
in 1992 to develop closer relations with other regional 
groupings. 
  "It will be a preliminary, exploratory visit to study the 
possible scope of relations between Asean and the ECO," he said. 
The 10-member ECO groups Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan 
and the former Soviet Muslim republics of Kazakhstan, 
Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 
Ajit Singh will visit Pakistan on the return trip. 
  Last year he led a delegation to China that concluded with 
Beijing opening a new chapter in science and technology 
cooperation with Asean. He recently made an official visit to 
Vietnam and Laos, who became Asean observers in 1992. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suwit Simasakun said yesterday 
Burma must be brought into the mainstream of regional affairs. 
Asean members had agreed in principle that Burma should be 
invited to attend the Asean meeting in July, but there was still 
no agreement on what status Rangoon should have. 
  The SOM meeting, attended by senior Asean foreign affairs, 
security and intelligence officials, yesterday reviewed security 
in the region and made preparations for the first Asean Regional 
Forum (ARF) on July 25. An Asean official said the regional 
issues touched were on Burma, the South China Sea, the Korean 
peninsula and Cambodia, relations with major powers like China, 
the US, Japan and Russia. 
  The political cooperation issues covered included the Asean 
role in Zopfan -- the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality -- 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and confidence-building 
measures.

  [Text] A Post and Telecommunications Ministry source 
disclosed on 3 March that the government is planning to give 
financial support to the Japan Mobile Communications (IDO) to 
help it invest in plant and equipment as part of an expansion of 
base stations. The government has decided that the Japan 
Development Bank [JDB] can increase its loans to IDO for this 
project. As there are signs that progress will be made at 
Japan-U.S. negotiations, the government wants to help bring the 
negotiations to a successful conclusion and believes that 
supporting plans to increase the number of base stations will 
help. 
  Increasing the number of base stations for the Motorola 
cellular phone system became a focal point of Japan-U.S. 
negotiations on mobile and car telephones and the IDO submitted 
a compromise proposal designed to front-load the expansion plan. 
The JDB awarded the IDO loans amounting to 17 billion yen in 
fiscal 1992 and 25 billion yen in fiscal 1993. Under current 
regulations the loans can cover a maximum of only 50 percent of 
the investment total. The government, however, is trying to 
increase this about 70 percent. If it fails to achieve this, it 
will provide full support for loans to be provided at the 50 
percent level.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- Hwang Sang-chun, 
chairman of the State Environmental Commission of the DPRK, 
strongly urged the South Korean authorities to immediately stop 
nuclear waste dumping in the sea and take emergency measures to 
prevent nuclear leakage. 
  Speaking at a press conference here today, he told home and 
foreign reporters that the South Korean authorities dumped 
29,513 curies of liquid waste, 84,737 curies of gas waste and 
29,034 drums of solid waste in seven years from 1986 to 1992. 
  He ascribed their dumping of a large amount of nuclear waste 
in the sea to their anti-popular policy, the backwardness of the 
technological levels of atomic energy facilities and, 
especially, their clandestine promotion of nuclear arms 
development. 
  According to him, the authorities in South Korea have paid 
no 
heed to the health and lives of the population and environmental 
protection in constructing and running nuclear power stations, 
and failed to regularly check, repair and readjust machinery, 
while immersing themselves only in power production for 
money-making. Subsequently, there have been not infrequent 
leakages of radioactive substances due to breakdown, damages, 
etc. 
  It is no secret that the "Taedok research complex" in South 
Korea, has nuclear reprocessing facilities now operated under 
the name of "a research reactor". 
  The spent nuclear fuel from the reactors in South Korea is 
turned into plutonium through reprocessing facilities now 
concealed at the "Taedok research complex" and used to develop 
nuclear weapons. 
  He condemned dumping of nuclear waste into the sea by the 
South Korean puppets as a wanton violation of international 
accords, barbarism and anti-national, anti-human crimes to 
exterminate the nation and mankind. 
  He sternly warned that if the South Korean puppets continue 
dumping nuclear waste into the sea and accelerating the 
development of nuclear weapons, they will have to bear 
responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom and face 
strong denunciation at home and abroad. 
  Chairman Hwang Sang-chun and Yi Hak-sun, an expert of 
nuclear 
safety and radioactive protection, answered questions put by 
reporters. Exposing the scheme of the South Korean puppet 
clique to build a nuclear power plants in Kosong, South Korean 
Kangwon Province, they said that if the power plant is built at 
the place less than 10 kilometres from the Military Demarcation 
Line, nuclear polution will directly affect the northern half of 
the country.

  [Excerpts] Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council, commander in chief of the 
Defense Services and patron of the Union Solidarity and 
Development Association [USDA], addressed trainees at the 
opening ceremony of management course No. 1/94 for USDA 
executives held in Union Hall, the Central Public Relations 
Corps in Hmawbi at 0900 this morning. [passage omitted] 
  In his opening address, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said that today's 
management course is being held for 404 USDA executives from 
branches in states, divisions, districts, and townships 
throughout the country. He expressed pleasure at meeting with 
the trainees. 
  He said first he would like to explain why USDA branches are 
being organized firmly and extensively throughout the country. 
He said the main objective in forming this organization with the 
people, including patriotic trainees, is to meet the need for 
national unity which has declined and weakened throughout the 
nation. 
  Reviewing the 1988 events [year of the uprising], he 
recalled 
that there were many factions among the various strata of 
society and the youths. National unity was in a state of 
disintegration and nationalism and patriotism were in decline. 
There were some who tied the state flag to their legs while 
some flew it upside down. There were also attacks against the 
Defense Services which were defending the nation with their 
lives and eventually there were attempts to cause the 
disintegration of the Defense Services. These events almost 
destroyed the national psyche and the way of thinking, and 
national unity declined at an unprecedented rate. 
  Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said that this situation was most evident 
when political parties were allowed to be formed and a total of 
235 emerged in such a small country with everyone acting like 
self-proclaimed rulers. Furthermore, despite measures taken to 
bring about multiparty democracy step by step, some who could 
not wait followed the path of armed struggle as a short-cut to 
power. Instead of holding discussions patiently among ourselves 
inside the country to find a solution, these persons deserted 
the national convention, thought highly of foreign powers, and 
approached them. 
  Continuing, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe noted that there are also 
those in the country who oblige the wishes of foreign powers. 
There are those who echo foreign claims about a lack of 
democracy and human rights violations in Myanmar [Burma]. He 
said these actions reflected the decline of national unity and a 
lack of patriotism. Therefore, he said the USDA was formed 
systematically with the objective to fill in the role of 
strengthening national unity. 
  Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said acts of anarchy prevailed during the 
events of 1988 and that the USDA was formed to prevent similar 
events in the future and to promote the observance of law and 
order among the general public. He said the long-term goal for 
the trainees is the five aims of the organization 
[nondisintegration of the Union; nondisintegration of national 
unity; perpetuation of national sovereignty; promotion and 
vitalization of national pride; and the emergence of a 
prosperous, peaceful, and modern Union]. [passage omitted] 
  He said the five aims of the organization are not temporary 
in nature, but will have an impact on the future and that these 
aims will remain forever. There may be political and economic 
changes in the future, but these aims are not likely to change. 
These aims will remain constant and firm. [passage omitted] 
  Continuing, he said he would like to report to the trainees 
about endeavors being undertaken by the state. He said he would 
first like to explain an endeavor for national unity, that is, 
the matter of armed organizations. He said these organizations, 
which have existed for over 40 years since the achievement of 
independence, have been undermining the country's economic and 
social development and causing hardship among the general 
public. However, he said it is believed that if national unity 
is constructed, armed organizations will have an opportunity to 
operate democratically and politically within the framework of 
law. He said we have invited them in order to provide such an 
opportunity. 
  He said because of this invitation, quite a number of these 
organizations are working hand in hand with the state. 
Organizations such as KNU [Karen National Union] have been 
invited to the talks. Mons, Karenni, and Kayah have also been 
invited. Some are still in the process of holding talks. The 
invitation has been extended with goodwill because it is 
believed that the bloodshed and fighting among our own brethren 
that has been going on for over 40 years is not good and that 
the time has come to enable the people who have been suffering 
since independence to live in peace and prosperity. He said it 
is known to the trainees how some organizations have responded 
to the invitation and are beginning to cooperate. 
  Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said another outstanding endeavor today 
is the convening of the National Convention. Therefore, there 
are sectors dealing with the National Convention, the 
reestablishment of national solidarity, and national 
construction. National construction is related to national 
solidarity and they are inseparable. He said while the endeavor 
is being made to invite the armed organizations in the jungle, 
the legal political parties inside the country were invited to 
convene [at National Convention] in order to work for unity. 
These organizations will consult on the emergence of the state 
constitution. 
  He said the old constitution has ceased to operate. In order 
to establish a new nation, a new constitution must be drafted 
when the old one ceases to operate and the new one has not 
emerged. He explained that the National Convention is currently 
being held in accordance with the policy of reestablishing 
national solidarity. He said the consultations at the convention 
have been quite effective. At present, basic principles have 
been laid down and work is being done on each chapter. He said 
two outstanding political endeavors are being undertaken -- the 
national convention to draft a new state constitution to 
establish a new nation, and the invitation extended to armed 
organizations for national solidarity and to enable them to work 
peacefully and democratically. He said he had pointed out two 
major points out of many political developments. 
  Speaking about the economic sector, he said the economic 
system is being reformed in preparation for the nation that will 
emerge in the future. He said, as is known to the trainees, 
that a market- oriented economy is being established and the 
people are being allowed to work according to their own physical 
and mental abilities. He said at present unemployment is 
declining as more enterprises which provide work are established 
and people become more well-off. He said there is improvement 
in production as well as in trade. He said economic measures 
are being taken to suit the future nation which will be a 
democratic nation. 
  Speaking about social development, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said 
efforts are being made to develop villages and towns, construct 
sports facilities to promote moral development, and to promote 
the education and health sectors. 
  He said that SLORC is laying down a sound political and 
economic foundation to ensure that the future nation that 
emerges is peaceful, prosperous, and stable. He said, 
meanwhile, efforts are being made for social and moral 
development. He said the USDA will work hand in hand with the 
SLORC in these endeavors. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By reporter Kang Tae-ho] </F>
  [Text] Anticipating the post-unification period, most 
businesses, and particularly conglomerates, view North Korea as 
a market they are destined to enter. This means that, although 
there be many obstacles and investment dangers, they are 
prepared to risk these for the sake of long-term investment. 
  However, as long as government policy does not support this, 
there will be limits to North-South economic cooperation. Even 
through early 1993, businesses interested in economic 
cooperation with North Korea, filled with expectation following 
the birth of the new government, forecast that 1993 would be an 
epoch-making turning point in North-South economic cooperation. 
That forecast missed the mark, however. Set in the context of 
the February resolution on special inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea's 
announcement that it would withdraw from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty following this, the government's policy 
of linking the nuclear issue with economic cooperation tied the 
hands of business. Actually, the results of 1993's North-South 
economic cooperation show that it is just marking time. 
  Beginning on 7 October 1988 with the announcement of an 
economic opening toward the North, a follow-up measure to the 7 
July Proclaimation, trade with North Korea is now in its sixth 
year. During that time, the scale of North-South trade reached 
$200 million annually. Besides conglomerates such as Lucky Gold 
Star, Samsung, and Daewoo, small- and medium-sized firms are 
actively getting involved, bringing the present total to over 
270 companies. 
  By what motives or opportunities are these firms getting 
involved in trade with North Korea? What are the actual problems 
in North Korea trade? What do working-level officials on site 
think is needed for full-scall trade with North Korea? 
Examples of North-South Trade [Nambuk Kyoyok 
Saryejip], published by the Unification Board at the end of last 
year, answers these questions at least partially. 
Examples are found in the experiences of 
working-level officials of companies which had constantly 
participated in North-South trade. These show us the present 
state of North-South trade. 
  -- Commissioned Processing Trade. Using the opportunity 
provided by Mr. P, a middleman in trade with North Korea, when 
he proposed a venture in the commissioned processing of clothing 
while describing his visit to North Korea at their Beijing 
office during the summer of 1992, Lucky Gold Star pursued trade 
in the commissioned processing of work uniforms. First of all, 
it was most important to learn the level of North Korea's sewing 
work. One month after sending subsidary materials for making 
samples via a North Korean Koryo Airlines flight, Lucky Gold 
Star received test products and evaluated their quality. 
Responsibility for risk concerning subsidiary materials, quality 
control, delivery period, and shipping were brought up as 
predictable problems. To prepare against inferior quality, 
factory work uniforms were chosen for commissioned processing. 
It was decided to bear the increased financing-cost that would 
result from delayed delivery. As for shipping, because this was 
the first commisioned-processing transaction, it was decided to 
used a Pusan-Hong Kong-Nampo route even if it was more expensive. 
  This transaction, as a first attempt, was completed almost 
perfectly and Mr. P did an excellent job as an agent. It was 
noted, however, that two conditions must be met for the 
vitalization of commissioned processing in the future. One is 
that at least a limited visit to North Korea for a fixed period 
by a team of technicians is urgently needed. Even problems which 
can be solved if a technical team does direct consultation have 
to pass through very complex precedures. The other is the 
problem of shipping. If products pass through Hong Kong, 
shipping expenses increase, possibly becoming an obstacle to the 
competitiveness in exports to third countries which could be 
achieved through North-South cooperation. Speeding the opening 
of sea and land routes, although limited, is the most basic 
measure to be taken for North-South economic cooperation. 
  Stressing the importance of the precise delivery of supply 
materials and detailed work instructions, Samsung Products, 
which did commissioned processing trade in men's pants, pointed 
out that two-way traffic and communications for this must be 
easy. Shipping through a third country acts as the greatest 
factor in delayed delivery. In such a case, there are limits to 
making clothing, which is so sensitive to fashion. 
  Hanil Synthetic Fiber, which traded in the commissioned 
processing of semimanufactured sweaters, revealed that although 
the product-quality level of clothing processed in the North 
tends to be very good, there are noticeable product defects due 
to the use of worn-out machinery. Thus, consideration must also 
be given to spare parts supply. 
  -- Commodities Trade. Songbo Sangun, which imported walnuts 
from North Korea's Choson Agricultural Products Trade Company, 
came by chance to promote trade with North Korea. 
Representatives of the company were introduced to a Mr. S, who 
frequently visited China and claimed to be close enough to a 
Choson employee to carry on business transactions. The 
conditions presented by middleman Mr. S were that if Songbo 
Sangun would only send a ship to Nampo, it would load and take 
out 100 tons of walnuts with payment was to be made within 20 
days of the ship's arrival at a domestic port. Loading and 
taking out the walnuts without even a leter of credit was 
unbelievable. However, domestic production of walnuts was 
absolutely insufficient compared to consumption and if the 
walnuts would only arrive around the middle of December, they 
could be sold for New Year's Day and Porum [the 15th day of the 
first month of the lunar new year] and a considerable profit 
could be had, they thought. Negotiations were held with several 
shipping companies brokering ships for North Korea, but they 
demanded 3-4 times the commercial freight rates. They said that 
this was because there was a danger of accidents due to 
difficult communications and because there were even cases in 
which ships had to wait on cargo which had not been prepared 
correctly, or worse, returned empty. 
  Renting a ship at an expensive rate, they sent it to Nampo. 
Even though contact was made through an agent, not even an ant 
showed up on ship. Finally after 10 days, they had no choice but 
to withdraw the empty ship. They figured that the North Korean 
side had no confidence they could receive payment after the 
walnuts were shipped. However, at this time Mr. K from another 
trade company said that all they would have to do is send a ship 
again. Fortunately ship of company T was in port at Nampo and 
was able to load and bring the walnuts for a low price. 
  The problem was customs. With customs officials trying to 
push responsibility off on each other, they ended up going all 
the way to the Unification Board to have their documents 
inspected. What is worse, it was reported on television that 
people may be bringing in Chinese walnuts disguised as North 
Korean walnuts, so customs procedures were delayed because they 
were unable to confirm that the walnuts were North Korean. 
Ultimately, it took a month and a half to pass customs, so they 
missed the high-demand season and could not get a good price for 
the walnuts.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Following weeks of mounting 
tension between Japan and the United States over threats of a 
trade war, Tokyo now awaits the arrival of U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher on Wednesday [9 March] night, hoping 
the visit will be a chance to heal thorny bilateral ties. 
  Christopher's three-day visit will be the first direct 
high-level contact between Tokyo and Washington after U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
jointly announced the collapse of bilateral trade framework 
negotiations in Washington last month. 
  The failure of the talks, aimed at redressing the huge trade 
imbalance, prompted the U.S. Government to take tough actions 
against Japan, including an executive order to reinstate a 1988 
trade law. 
  The Super 301 measure gives the U.S. Administration broad 
powers to impose sanctions against countries it judges to have 
unfair trade practices. 
  While U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in 
announcing the step that the U.S. is not "designating or 
identifying any practice of any country today," the action is 
widely said to be targeting Japan to press it into reducing its 
more than 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. 
  Reinstatement of Super 301 was reportedly considered by U.S. 
officials as soon as bilateral trade talks broke down on 
February 11. 
  While voicing conern over such "unilateral" moves in the 
wake 
of the just-concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
negotiations, the Japanese Government, at least on surface, 
reacted calmly, saying it was expected because Clinton had 
hinted of a reinstatement since his presidential election 
campaign. 
  Tokyo and Washington, failing to close the gap on the 
concept 
of "objective criteria" to measure the penetration of imports 
into Japanese markets, are now in a cooling-off period. 
  Japan, under pressure from the U.S. and Europe to open its 
markets to reduce its growing current account and trade 
surpluses, is currently making strenuous efforts to hammer out a 
package of voluntary market-opening measures by the end of the 
month. 
  When Christopher meets Japanese leaders, including Hosokawa 
and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, probably on Thursday, 
bilateral economic problems, including the failed framework 
talks, are likely to be high on the agenda, Foreign Ministry 
sources said. 
  The Japanese side is expected to explain the upcoming 
market- 
opening package and seek U.S. understanding, while expressing 
concern over the reinstatement of Super 301, according to 
sources. 
  "I think there are great attentions to what Christopher has 
to say concerning the framework talks," a senior ministry 
official said. 
  "But frankly, I don't think there will be any new moves as a 
result of the visit," the official said on condition of 
anonymity. 
  As ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said, it may be 
difficult to offer Christopher "concrete ideas " about the 
market-opening package although the cabinet ministers meet 
Wednesday to map it out. 
  "The government does need a bit more time before it is able 
to make an announcement on the complete action to be taken," 
Terada said. 
  With no immediate breakthrough likely in the economic arena, 
the Japanese officials hope to deflect focus on economic and 
trade issues and instead shed more light on two other aspects of 
bilateral relations, the political and security fields. 
  "It's a good opportunity to show that Japan-U.S. relations 
do not simply revolve around economic matters," another senior 
ministry official said. 
  Terada said that economic and trade problems are "just one 
of 
the agenda items" and that Christopher's visit provides "ample 
opportunity to exchange views on the international situation." 
  Hosokawa and Christopher are likely to discuss China, since 
the secretary of state will fly to Beijing after leaving Tokyo 
on Friday and Hosokawa is scheduled to visit China from March 19 
to 21, he said. 
  Christopher and Japanese leaders are expected to reaffirm 
the 
importance of bilateral security arrangements and reconfirm 
cooperation in solving problems involving North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  Japan and the U.S. are also expected to hold the first "two- 
plus-two" security talks, with undersecretary of defense Frank 
Wisner accompanying Christopher. Defense Agency Director 
General Kazuo Aichi will join Hata. 
  Christopher will also attend an international conference on 
aid to Cambodia on Thursday and deliver a speech to business 
leaders Friday. 
  This will be Christopher's third trip to Japan. He visited 
Tokyo last April to attend the Group of Seven (G-7) ministerial 
conference on aid to Russia and last July for the G-7 summit 
meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Buying in the hot U.S. and 
Southeast Asian stock markets highlighted active Japanese 
purchases of foreign securities last year, the Finance Ministry 
said Friday [4 March]. With Wall Street stocks posting strings 
of record highs while Japanese shares lagged, net Japanese 
buying of U.S. securities jumped to 21.93 billion dollars in 
1993 from 8.75 billion dollars, the ministry said in an annual 
report. 
  Surging share purchases from October in the roaring Hong 
Kong 
and Southeast Asian bourses pushed net Japanese securities 
buying in the ministry's "other" category 3.63 billion dollars 
from net sales of 1.85 billion dollars in 1992, a ministry 
official told reporters. 
  Steady bond markets helped boost net purchases in Germany to 
17.38 billion dollars from 8.13 billion dollars and in France to 
10.03 billion dollars from 2.53 billion dollars, he said. But 
Japanese sold a net 17.96 billion dollars' worth of Luxembourg 
securities, compared with earlier net sales of 2.81 billion 
dollars, on redemptions of dollar-denominated Japanese warrant 
bonds there, the official said. 
  As foreign exchange losses forced them to bail out, Japanese 
investors sold a net 4.38 billion dollars of securities in 
Australia, against previous net sales of 1.73 billion dollars, 
and sold 5.76 billion dollars' worth in Canada, a turnaround 
from 1992 net purchases of 1.58 billion dollars. 
  Net purchases of British securities dipped to 16.76 billion 
dollars from 17.06 billion dollars, while those in Switzerland 
climbed to 2.05 billion dollars from 708 million dollars. 
  As previously reported, net foreign securities purchases 
totaled 43.51 billion dollars, up from 32.47 billion dollars.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "America With Crowbar in Hand"] </F>
  [Text] It appears that the revival of the "Super 301 
Provision" has triggered shocks and reactions in Japan. Let us, 
however, see its revival as an aspect of the realities of the 
post- Cold War era without overreacting to it. 
  President Clinton signed his executive order to revive the 
Super 301 Provision in line with his long-advocated policy. We 
use the term his long-advocated policy because the President 
already made it clear that he would revive the provision if 
elected in a campaign pledge titled "the Highest Priority to the 
People," announced jointly by himself and Vice President Gore 
(candidate at the time) as presidential and vice presidential 
candidates running on the Democratic Party's ticket during the 
1992 presidential campaign. The President has chosen the most 
effective timing for revival of the provision in a bid to make 
it clear that the revival of the provision targets Japan, among 
other nations. 
  The most internationally notorious provision allows the 
United States to identify "unfair nations" in trade with the 
United States, negotiate with those unfair nations to remove 
their trade barriers and open their markets to U.S. goods, and 
raise large tariffs and impose sanctions against those nations 
in case they refuse to make concessions. 
  There is no guarantee that the United States will not 
identify unfair trading nations arbitrarily. There is doubt that 
the revival of the provision constitutes a violation of GATT 
rules which call for holding multilateral negotiations to settle 
trade disputes. Japan has guarded, reacted, and toughened its 
stand against the step the United States has recently taken, and 
we think Japan has probably made reasonable responses. 
  We want to indicate two points. 
  Among other things, Japan's excessively emotional reaction 
to 
the U.S. decision to revive the prevision will never be a plus 
not only for Japan itself, but for overall Japan-U.S. relations. 
  It can be said that the U.S. posture to hold negotiations 
with Japan with a hint at the possibility of slapping sanctions 
on Japan is aimed at bullying Japan to accept what it demands. 
The U.S. posture may incur displeasure in Japan. There is a kind 
of sense of a game in recent U.S. moves to use the revival of 
the provision as a "tool to crack open Japan's closed market." 
  If Japan sticks to a single way of confronting the revival 
of 
the provision, it may increase differences and tensions between 
the two countries. Japan needs to look at the situation with a 
broad sense of a game. 
  Another point we want to indicate is that this time, Japan 
must realize anew the significance and depth of the changes 
taking place in the United States during the post-Cold War age. 
  The Clinton administration is pouring the same strong energy 
into "revitalizing the U.S. economy" as successive U.S. 
administrations did into their policies toward the Soviet Union 
during the Cold War era. Promoting trade and stepping up 
pressure for market opening is an extension of this energy. 
  Although it is true that there are a lot of problems with 
the 
specific methodology of dealing with the pressure, it appears 
that Japan is still optimistic about the way the United States 
will expend this energy. We believe this makes Japan's actions 
inarticulate and restricted.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Christopher will visit 
Japan for three days from 9 to 11 March. Taking advantage of 
his visit, the Japanese Government plans to seek ways to resume 
the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which remain suspended, 
and to seek an understanding with the United States about 
Japan's efforts to open its market by explaining these efforts 
to Christopher. 
  He will be the first U.S. cabinet member to visit Japan 
since 
the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act was 
revived. Christopher will meet separately with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata and will deliver a speech to 
the opening ceremony of the "International Committee on the 
Reconstruction of Cambodia" to be held 10-11 March in Japan. He 
will also attend the first Japan-U.S. security consultations 
(the so-called 2-Plus-2 talks) to be held on 11 March in Tokyo, 
with senior foreign and defense officials from the two countries 
attending. U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan Spero, who is in 
charge of economic affairs and who arrived in Japan on 8 March 
prior to Christopher's visit, will meet with Deputy Foreign 
Minister Matsuura on the morning of 9 March. 
  At separate meetings with Secretary of State Christopher, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa and his cabinet ministers will brief him 
on a new package of economic stimulus measures, as well as 
Japan's measures to open its market, measures which the 
government plans to map out by the end of March. They will also 
seek his understanding of Japanese plans to create an 
environment for reducing its current account surplus through a 
steady expansion of domestic demand. In addition, they will 
consult with him on a set of compromise proposals by the 
Japanese private sector for settling bilateral negotiations on 
such sectors as cellular phones, automobiles, and semiconductors. 
  During the separate meetings, they will ask that the United 
States cautiously deal with the revived Super 301 provision.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] will begin negotiations with China on exporting the 
Japanese petrochemical industry's substantial excess facilities 
to that country as a way of helping it develop its heavy 
chemical industry. The negotiations will mostly concern 
exporting plants for producing general-purpose plastic resins as 
well as ethylene, which is the basic material for making resins 
with. The negotiations are discussing plants for producing 
about 1 million tons converted into ethylene. 
  A joint government-industry feasibility study mission will 
present a specific concept to the Chinese Government on 7 March. 
The MITI plans to back up the export of the petrochemical plants 
by making available credits from the Japan Export and Import 
Bank and by providing technological assistance through official 
development assistance (ODA) programs. The ministry wants to 
make this project a new theme in Japan's assistance to China, 
while hoping that this will help the Japanese petrochemical 
industry facilitate its lagging rationalization programs and 
reorganize itself. 
  There have been instances of U.S. steel manufacturers 
exporting their steel production plants to China, but these 
deals have been made at the private-sector level, and this will 
be the first such example of government-to-government industrial 
cooperation. Many Asian nations are now hurrying to expand 
their steel and chemical industries, and it is likely that this 
will be a model case for production bases being moved out of 
Japan. 
  The MITI sent a joint government-industry mission to China 
on 
3 March. The industry is represented by seven major chemical 
companies including Showa Denko, Mitsui Petrochemical 
Industries, and the Sumitomo Chemical Company, plus several 
major trading companies. The mission will present on 7 March 
Japan's concept to officials of such Chinese Government offices 
concerned as the State Planning Commission and the China 
National Petrochemical Corporation. 
  In China, in step with its growing economy, the demand for 
petrochemical products such as plastics and packing materials is 
growing fast, but China's annual domestic ethylene production 
capacity is now only 2.27 million tons. While annual imports of 
petrochemical products run to 1.7 million tons converted into 
ethylene, the shortages of facilities are only worsening. 
  On the other hand, Japan, which has an annual ethylene 
production capacity of 7 million tons, has the problem of excess 
supply. As a result of decreased demand from the auto industry 
and the home electric-appliance industry caused by the economic 
recession, the total domestic demand has fallen to about 5 
million tons, thus creating an excess capacity of nearly 2 
million tons. As such, the MITI has come to believe that the 
excess capacity should be reduced by exporting some facilities 
to China. 
  According to the concept of the MITI, plants for producing a 
total of 1 million tons -- translated into that amount of 
ethylene -- will eventually be exported to China. Specifically, 
plants owned by some Japanese chemical companies will be 
dismantled and then will be exported -- for reassembly in China 
-- at low prices as part of economic cooperation programs. 
Low-interest loans from the Japan Export and Import Bank will 
be made available as funds for purchasing the plants. The 
plants transferred will receive the benefit of technological 
cooperation under ODA programs, and technicians will be sent to 
China to train Chinese technicians in plant operations and 
maintenance. 
  The mission will also propose to make the business of 
producing ethylene using the transferred plants a joint venture 
project between Japan and China. The idea is to turn the 
business into a government-industry joint project by using funds 
from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund as well as 
investment by private Japanese companies. The ministry wants to 
export several sets of plants -- most of them for producing 
ethylene. 
  The MITI has already sounded out Japan's major manufacturers 
on this concept, and the manufacturers are taking the position 
of accepting it. The export deal is expected to be finalized 
within this year. The plants under consideration for export are 
those at the Chiba industrial complex, where Mitsui 
Petrochemical Industries, the Maruzen Petrochemical Company, and 
the Sumitomo Chemical Company have their production operations; 
in the Mizushima industrial complex (in Kurashiki city), which 
is operated by the Asahi Chemical Industry Company and 
Mitsubishi Petrochemicals; and in the Kawazaki industrial 
complex operated by the Tonen Chemical Company and the Japan 
Petrochemical Company.

  [Text] In a series of meetings with the leaders of the 
ruling coalition parties on 1 March, Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa explained "the idea of merging the coalition parties 
into one." The idea Hosokawa proposed has given rise to 
arguments within the ruling coalition that it is aimed at 
opening the way to political realignment. Hosokawa said: "The 
idea has been misinterpreted. It has nothing to do with 
political realignment. What it means is the coalition parties 
have no choice but to cooperate to win against the large, 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in House of 
Councillors elections next year." While also touching on the 
reported discord between Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa 
and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa 
revealed what could be termed "Hosokawa's three principles" in 
his remarks on measures needed to win in national-level 
elections, and on political realignment. 
  According to a top official in the ruling coalition, during 
meetings with coalition leaders Hosokawa said: 
  Concerning measures needed to win in national-level 
elections: "When there is much accumulated sludge, it is better 
to flush it out in a vast flow. It does not matter whether the 
flow is impure or clear." 
  Concerning political realignment, the premier said: "Various 
types of carpenters are gathered from many parts of the nation 
to construct a building. When you are having your house built, 
you cannot be choosy about the carpenters. Now is the time to 
gather carpenters to build a house." 
  In connection with the future course of Japan, Hosokawa 
said: 
"It is not time to discuss (Takemura's proposal of) making Japan 
`a small but brilliant nation' and (Ozawa's proposal of) making 
Japan `an ordinary nation.' We cannot afford to hand over power 
to the strong LDP." 
  By using such metaphors, Hosokawa reportedly explained the 
idea of merging the coalition parties into one. However, it is 
uncertain whether he won the understanding of coalition leaders, 
who are preoccupied with the planned cabinet reshuffle.

various troubles. I would like to solicit your continued 
favors." In this way, the chief cabinet secretary expressed to 
the prime minister his intention to support the latter as chief 
cabinet secretary. The prime minister responded, "You and I work 
in the same office and your apology sounds awkward."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Can Hosokawa Challenge New Reform?"] </F>
  [Text] In finalizing his policy speech given before the 
Diet on 4 March, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reportedly had 
in mind devoting the first seven months of his government's 
formation to political reform with the coming second period 
focusing on economic and administrative reform. 
  His speech did express those thoughts. He began by stating 
that "those of us responsible for government at this historic 
juncture have a duty to gorge ahead on the path of change and it 
is demanded of us that we remake politics, the economy and our 
society no matter how great the difficulties." He also 
stressed, "I intend to take up the challenge of new reforms, not 
forgetting the essential spirit of this reform government." 
  This issue consciousness is only to be expected considering 
the circumstances surrounding Japan both domestically and 
abroad. In international terms, the Clinton administration has 
revived the Super 301 provision and has staked out a hard-line 
position in preparing for trade negotiations. Domestically, 
taking action to spur economic recovery and reform taxation are 
urgent matters. To handle these issues, many people are calling 
for deregulations and administrative reform. 
  Moreover, from the standpoint of the nature of the present 
recession and international relations, there is a pressing need 
to review the economic and social structures that had been 
praised as the Japanese system's strengths. Hosokawa was 
undoubtedly correct when he said in his speech, "in laying the 
foundations for a new era of development, it is imperative that 
we demolish those systems and practices that are no longer 
compatible with the needs of the times" and that, "we must 
promote reform that will be conductive to business restructuring 
and the creation and development of new industries." 
  However, the biggest issue is whether the government can 
create a structure for implementation that will match the points 
noted by the prime minister. The ruling coalition's 
cohesiveness has been visibly shaken with the recent, sudden 
announcement of a plan to introduce a national welfare tax and 
the rumblings about a cabinet reshuffle. In more direct terms, 
there are doubts as to whether the administration structure will 
follow the dictates of government when there is trouble stirring 
between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary, who 
serves as the main coordinator of the cabinet. 
  Implementing deregulation or administrative reform will not 
be possible unless the political sector cuts into the sacred 
ground of the bureaucracy. As a result of circumstances 
surrounding the compilation of the government budget from the 
closing days of the past year, it became apparent that the 
coalition parties, which are still trying to become accustomed 
to controlling the government, had to eventually rely on the 
bureaucratic apparatus led by the Finance Ministry. There is 
even the sense that the bureaucrats' power in formulating policy 
has increased since the Liberal Democratic party controlled 
government. 
  In his speech, the prime minister said: "It is impossible 
for the administration alone to stand unchanged when there are 
such major changes taking place in politics and the economy. 
Seeking to establish an administration that is fair, 
transparent, and, above all, has the people's interest as its 
first priority, we must initiate radical surgery on our 
administrative structures and systems." From his experience as 
a committee chairman in the Third Provisional Council for the 
Promotion of Administrative Reform, Hosokawa should be 
well-aware of the strong opposition posed by bureaucrats. If 
his resolve ends up being nothing more than mere words, he will 
have problems maintaining control over the government. 
  One hopeful sign for the Hosokawa cabinet is the still-high 
support it receives from the people. In a poll conducted by 
ASAHI SHIMBUN at the end of February, the Hosokawa Cabinet was 
supported by 57 percent of respondents. While the figure was 
slightly lower than the 60 percent recorded in a poll in 
December 1993, the support rate did not seem to be affected by 
the recent fiascoes involving the national welfare tax and the 
cabinet reshuffle. Now is the time for Hosokawa to return to 
his initial intent and not take advantage of the people's 
magnanimity. 
  We would like to further indicate two points that are 
important to carry out drastic deregulation and administrative 
reform. The first is to attempt to solidify public opinion by 
clarifying concrete goals and aims for the policy. Economic and 
administrative reform covers a wide range of topics. While 
Hosokawa promised to "promote visible administrative reform," it 
is important to explain in easily understandable terms what 
results are being targeted and how the actual changes will be 
made. 
  The second point is the need to clarify the overall plan and 
procedures and to create a structure that will implement the 
process in a step-by-step manner. The government plans to 
submit a bill in the current Diet session to establish a 
committee on administrative reform that will promote supervision 
of the administration and public disclosure of information. 
That institution should be designed to bring together the power 
of politics and public opinion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Japan Communist Party Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa </F>
by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The Japan Communist Party 
[JCP] criticizes the relationship between the ruling coalition 
parties and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] for being a 
"single seat constituency Yokusan [The Yokusan Seiji Kai was a 
political organization created by the militarist government in 
1942 to promote national solidarity] system." 
  [Fuwa] During the deliberations on the political reform 
bills, the Diet's Yokusan nature after the coalition 
government's birth became evident. This was demonstrated by the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] endless, repeated 
compromises. Even the "heiritsu" system proposal, combining 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, was 
initiated by the LDP, which calls itself a strong opposition 
party, when it was in power. It is more than clear that the LDP 
is supporting the coalition through policy coordination. Mr. 
Hosokawa increasingly resembles his grandfather, former Prime 
Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Like the Taisei Yokusan Kai [national 
organization for political control created in 1940] during the 
Konoe administration, most of the former opposition parties were 
coopted into the political regime, and a "new Yokusan 
structure," which has even made the LDP fall in line, was 
formed. This made the passage of the reform bills possible. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] As a result of the House of 
Councillors' rejection of the bills, the system for proportional 
representation was changed into a bloc system, which is 
disadvantageous to the JCP. Was it a strategic error on your 
part? 
  [Fuwa] Some people said that it would have been better for 
the upper house not to reject the bills. That is a criticism 
that came after everything was over. For once, at least we 
succeeded in pushing for the bills' rejection. That is very 
different from accepting without putting up a fight. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Will you put up your own candidates 
for all 300 electoral districts under the new system? How would 
you campaign in the electoral blocs? 
  [Fuwa] It goes without saying that we will do our best under 
whatever electoral system there is. We will put up candidates 
and fight in both the single-seat and 
proportional-representation constituencies. Even if the 
proportional representation elections will be fought in several 
blocs, we will fight in these elections and try to avoid making 
them impersonal campaigns. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you stand by your decision to 
refuse any government subsidy for your party? 
  [Fuwa] There will be no change in that policy even after the 
system of subsidies for political parties goes into effect. It 
is our goal to work for an end to this system as soon as 
possible. From the experience of other countries, it is clear 
that official subsidies will only corrupt the political parties. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of future political 
alignment under the new system? 
  [Fuwa] There has been talk of political realignment since 
the time of the LDP regime. The political regime has become a 
more nasty one after they experimented. Under the present 
political framework, no matter how hard the political forces 
other than the JCP try to create two or three major forces, they 
will be nothing more than alliances of convenience, and there 
can be nothing new. What we need now is to create a new trend of 
working for the people's interests. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There has been dissension among the 
ruling parties on account of the national welfare tax and other 
issues. Do you think this will be the start of a realignment? 
  [Fuwa] The Hosokawa administration's strategy is to take 
care of hiking the consumption tax rate before the upper house 
elections in summer 1995. The SDPJ is said to have resisted 
this. However, its counterproposal is not much different from 
the national welfare tax. The SDPJ's opposition and resistance 
consists of nothing more than postponing the issue for one year. 
I do not think the SDPJ will ever part ways with the 
administration and be the receptacle of the people's criticisms 
against the tax hike. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How would you confront the Hosokawa 
administration at the Budget Committee and on other occasions? 
  [Fuwa] The Hosokawa administration is a successor to LDP 
politics. There is a tremendous gap between its slogans of 
reform and its real substance. We will vigorously oppose the 
budget draft, which has done nothing about subsidies and 
preferential tax treatment to big business and which is 
one-sidedly in favor of arms expansion, as evidenced by 
increased appropriations for U.S. military bases, and the 
purchase of AWACS (airborne warning and control system). Of 
course, we will also pursue the issue of the prime minister's 
alleged acceptance of 100 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin 
Trucking Company.

  [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] held a 
national meeting of general secretaries from its local branches 
at the Nihon Kyoiku Kaikan building located at Hitotsubashi, 
Tokyo, on 5 March. In his speech, General Secretary Wataru Kubo 
said: "A party that cannot change its policies has no other 
choice but to stand isolated." Thus, he indicated his view that 
the SDPJ's basic policies on foreign affairs and defense have to 
be reviewed so the SDPJ will be able to deal with the future 
realignment of political parties. Kubo disclosed a plan to set 
up a "Project for Promoting Cooperation in Election Campaigns" 
(tentative name) within the SDPJ, pointing out that promoting 
cooperation among the ruling coalition parties in the next 
national election campaigns is the task to be dealt with at 
present. 
  After indicating his view that full-fledged political 
realignment is close at hand, Kubo showed his resolution to 
unify various political forces centering around the social 
democratic and liberal forces. He said "we must prepare for the 
possibility that we may have to make a decision on transforming 
into a new party." 
  Kubo further said, the SDPJ and Komeito failed to reach an 
accord aimed at obtaining political power in 1980; and the SDPJ, 
Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the United 
Social Democratic Party also failed to reach an accord to this 
end in 1989 because of "discord on basic policies". He 
emphasized the need for party reform, including the review of 
the party's basic policies, indicating his concern over the 
possibility of being isolated as "a party that cannot respond to 
structural changes" if the SDPJ should fail to effect policy 
changes. 
  With regard to electoral cooperation, Kubo admitted that 
several issues, such as the issue of the cabinet reshuffle, have 
revealed the existence of a "bipolar structure" in which the 
SDPJ, the DSP, and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] form one group and 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito form another. 
However, he stressed: "We are not at odds with each other. It 
is premature to consider this as the fixed framework of the 
realignment." Thus, Kubo indicated that the ruling coalition 
parties, including both Shinseito and Komeito, should promote 
cooperation in election campaigns for the time being with the 
common objective of supporting the Hosokawa administration. 
  Prior to Kubo's speech, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama gave a 
speech. While indicating a positive stance on cooperation among 
the ruling coalition parties in election campaigns, Murayama 
commented on the concept of forming a large floor group among 
the ruling coalition parties advocated by some members of the 
ruling parties, saying: "It is impossible for parties with 
different views on the state system and on the Constitution to 
unite as one force." Thus, Murayama indicated that the issue of 
cooperation in election campaigns should be discussed 
independently from the issue of realignment of the political 
parties.

  [Text] For the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the 
cabinet reshuffle drama ended with not a single advantage to the 
party. While the party has not changed its basic policy of 
supporting Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition 
government, its members are beginning to lament that "You end up 
being the bad guy for working hard to sustain the 
administration; all your efforts are wasted," (according to a 
leading Shinseito member.) Some members have even called for a 
revision of political strategy focused on the next round of 
political realignment. 
  However, meanwhile, the ruling parties have to cooperate to 
steer through the current Diet session. It is still difficult 
to draw up a vision for the future. As the polarization in the 
ruling parties gets under way, Shinseito, which still needs to 
go into electoral cooperation with the ruling parties for the 
upper house elections of July 1995 and lower house elections 
under the single-seat constituencies system, is bound to be 
plagued by lingering concerns. 
  At a general meeting of Shinseito Diet members on 4 March, 
Norio Sugiyama, in charge of the budget in the House of 
Representatives, said: "If something goes wrong, this Diet 
session may see the end of the administration. The Liberal 
Democratic Party has replaced its executive members [of the 
Budget Committee] with hardliners, and is poised to boycott 
committee deliberations. If we are always criticized whether or 
not we do anything, we might as well become Buddhas." 
  One upper house member also said, "There is the question of 
quantity and quality in the cabinet. The prime minister chose 
quantity. While we will still support the administration, we 
may not work as hard as before." He hinted at the possibility 
of a subtle change in the party's political stance in the future. 
  Shinseito realized even at the time of the inauguration of 
the administration that a confrontation with the social 
democratic and liberal forces might surface sooner or later. 
However, the truth is, it wants "things to stay as they are at 
least until the lower house elections under the single-seat 
constituencies system," (according to a senior party official.) 
Others are optimistic that a decisive split can be avoidable 
through electoral cooperation among all the ruling parties, 
saying "Support or opposition to the cabinet reshuffle will not 
be the determining factor for a decisive polarization. Even the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan, the Democratic Social Party, 
and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] are not one monolithic group." 
  For better or for worse, Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa is 
still the key person in the party. He has not appeared in 
public since the afternoon of 2 March, after the prime minister 
announced he was giving up plans to reshuffle the cabinet. 
Ozawa did not also attend the plenary session of the House of 
Representatives on 4 March, where the government's key policy 
speeches were delivered. 
  There is speculation that Ozawa is making a silent protest 
to 
the prime minister. However, one of his close aides explained, 
"He is not angry. He is thinking of the next step, and is quite 
irritated that he cannot see clearly what the future holds." 
  It would be interesting to see what strategy Ozawa will come 
up with to deal with the next act of the political drama after 
his advise was not heeded in the decision process on the cabinet 
reshuffle, a crucial "turning point of the administration."

  [Text] After plans for the "national welfare tax" and the 
reshuffling of the cabinet were both aborted, Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] is now forced to revise its strategy for the 
realignment of the political world. As the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and 
Sakigake [Harbinger Party] work more actively for a so-called 
"tripolar" structure, Shinseito's concept of forming a new-new 
party by unifying all the ruling coalition parties has become 
improbable. It is now concentrating on unity with the Japan New 
Party [JNP], the prime minister's home camp, and working for the 
restoration of its leadership in the coalition. 
  With regard to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who 
has not appeared in public for some time, while some people 
think "he is beginning to distance himself from the prime 
minister" (according to a ruling party source), there has 
actually not been any change in his support for the prime 
minister. He is working on assisting the prime minister from 
the sidelines to effect a breakthrough in the stalled Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. 
  Shinseito did not participate in the meeting of ruling party 
representatives on 7 March, and party chief Tsutomu Hata (deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister) alone attended the meeting 
of ruling party leaders. Ozawa was also absent from the plenary 
session of the House of Representatives on that day, and the 
explanation given by his office was: "(He is) tired and taking 
a rest." 
  Hata said, "There should not be any problem since the party 
head was present," denying speculation about a Shinseito 
boycott. Another party official asserted, "Since Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Takemura said he would act as the coordinator, then 
let him do so." This indicates that Shinseito is actually 
abstaining from steering Diet affairs. It probably intends to 
watch out for any misdeeds by Takemura in his coordination 
efforts, then take the opportunity to impair the trend of 
support for the "social democratic-liberal" bloc. 
  However, close associates of Ozawa say that "Japan-U.S. 
relations constitute a national issue," and Ozawa is prepared to 
offer full cooperation. Ozawa has recently been busy 
circulating around, making contact with U.S. Government 
officials. He met with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale 
on 28 February. 
  It is said that the reason Ozawa was absent from the meeting 
of government and ruling party leaders convened on the evening 
of 2 March to announce the cancellation of plans for a cabinet 
reshuffle was because he was discussing ways to bring about a 
breakthrough in the insurance sector negotiations with Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii at a hotel in Tokyo. 
  It is also true that this situation of "semi-boycott" 
(according to a senior Shinseito official) is making the party's 
strategy ineffective. Shinseito has been working on a strategy 
of accepting potential deserters from the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] by urging the former Kato group [of the LDP], with 
which Shinseito forms a Diet floor group called the 
"Shinseito-Kaikaku Rengo [Reform Alliance]," and the 
"Kaikaku-no-Kai [Association for Reform]" led by Takeo Nishioka, 
former chairman of the LDP General Council, to form a floor 
grouping of independents. Part of the reason for this new group 
is that by allowing members of the group to participate in the 
meeting of ruling party representatives, they can join hands 
with Shinseito and Komeito to defeat the SDPJ, DSP, and Sakigake 
by numerical strength, in order to effect a change in the 
present balance of power. 
  However, after passage of the political reform bills, while 
Shinseito "has been making secret contacts with LDP members, 
they are very unresponsive," (according to a senior Shinseito 
official). It seems that another split in the LDP is not 
forthcoming in the immediate future. 
  Therefore, Shinseito's strategy for the moment is to, at 
least, take in the former Kato group in an effort to accelerate 
the momentum of political realignment. It will further work at 
winning the JNP over, and conducting more active exchanges with 
this party.

  [Text] At a news conference following a cabinet meeting on 
1 March, International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi 
Kumagai commented on the state of the economy, saying: "There 
are signs that the economy has been improving since the 
beginning of the year." In this way, he indicated that the 
economy had gone through the worst period. In January, 
industrial production and shipping indexes increased and an 
inventory-shipment ratio declined. Referring to this, Kumagai 
noted that there were signs of recovery in consumer spending and 
other areas. He said: "Although the sales of high-priced 
products are still sluggish, they are gradually picking up." 
  Concerning the imports of U.S. autos and auto parts 
discussed 
in the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks, Kumagai said: "It 
is necessary for the Japanese industry to have a correct 
understanding of what the United States is thinking."

  [Text] ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll on 27, 28 
February on the public's attitude toward tax-related issues. 
The results show that 62 percent of respondents said tax 
increases were "inevitable" to ensure adequate public services 
for the aging population. 
  Asked if consumption tax should be raised to secure revenue 
for welfare programs, 45 percent approved and 42 percent 
disapproved. After the controversy surrounding the prime 
minister's proposal for a public welfare tax, the public is 
beginning to understand that taxes must rise in preparation for 
the aging of society; however, they also showed a high degree of 
frustration with unfair taxation practices. 
  On consumption tax, the largest number of complaints were 
about the "tax profits" of retail stores -- not all tax money 
paid by consumers goes into the public purse. Changes in the 
public attitude to taxes were observed in people's moderate 
responses to the 3-percent consumption tax proposal, and the 
drop in the number of those who believe taxes are too heavy. 
  In previous surveys in March 1988 and September 1989, those 
who saw tax increases as "inevitable" if the country was to 
ensure adequate services for its aging society accounted for 46 
percent and 54 percent, respectively. However, this group rose 
to 62 percent in the latest survey. The public is gradually 
showing a positive attitude toward tax increases. Similarly, 30 
percent opposed any tax increases this time, down 9 
percentage-points from the September 1989 survey. 
  Public opinion is still divided on the issue of increasing 
consumption tax to boost revenue resources for welfare programs. 
Yet, in a September 1993 survey, 70 percent disapproved of the 
idea of a consumption tax hike in exchange for a cut in income 
tax. As the public becomes aware of the problems of an aging 
society, it is beginning to take a more positive attitude toward 
the idea of a consumption tax increase to fund welfare programs. 
  Among supporters of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
Komeito, 
and the Japan New Party, more than 50 percent supported a 
consumption tax rise, while 30 percent were against the idea. 
By contrast, more than 50 percent disapproved of the tax 
increase and about 30 percent supported the idea among 
supporters of the Social Democratic Party of Japan and the Japan 
Communist Party. Opinions among supporters of Sakigake 
[Harbinger] and the Liberal Democratic Party were split. 
  Asked to indicate, from five possible answers, the worst 
aspect of a rise in consumption tax, the largest group, 
amounting to 39 percent, chose "tax profits" because, they said, 
"it is hard to see if tax money is really going into the public 
purse." The figure of 73 percent said the current taxation 
system is "unfair." Settling public frustration with the 
current tax system is probably a prerequisite before any tax 
increases are imposed in preparing for the aging of society. 
  On the current 3 percent consumption tax, which is about 
five 
years old, 35 percent said the tax burden was "too heavy," but 
57 percent said it was "not important." In the April 1989 
survey held immediately after the introduction of the 
consumption tax, 71 percent said the tax rate was "too heavy." 
It appears the public's ill feelings toward the tax have eased 
over the last five years. 
  Asked for the general feelings about taxes, 48 percent said 
"taxes are too heavy," and 44 percent said they are at "an 
acceptable level." The percentage of those who think taxes are 
too heavy has dropped drastically from the 60 percent figure in 
the March 1988 survey, and is the lowest since the survey 
started in September 1970. 
  Compared with results of the previous survey, those who said 
taxes were too heavy dropped from 70 to 53 percent among 
industrial workers, and from 68 to 52 percent among 
administrative workers. In general, the decline in complaints 
about the tax burden was more obvious among white-collar workers. 
  As far as their thoughts about taxation in the future are 
concerned, 39 percent supported a further increase in indirect 
taxation, while 48 percent were opposed.

  [Text] Because the Hosokawa regime suffered a major setback 
in its plan to institute a national welfare tax, the problem of 
a tax system reform will be deliberated at the governing 
coalition parties' "consultative meeting on a tax system reform 
for a welfare society" chaired by Koken Nosaka, chairman of the 
Diet Administration Committee of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ]. Many observers already predict that "it is 
difficult to expect that a conclusion will be reached by the 
year's end," with the unified local elections and the House of 
Councillors election pending next year. Officials at the 
Finance Ministry's Tax Bureau are ready for a prolonged battle 
and say, "Talk of a tax increase is taboo before elections, and 
it is better to carry out an increase in the consumption tax 
rate in April 1997." 
  As for the SDPJ, which killed the national welfare tax plan, 
it is true that the party is not concerned about the future of 
the consumption tax rate after the upper house election. SDPJ 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama divulged to people around him that 
"there is no other choice but to raise the tax rate." It looks 
like the SDPJ's leaders have already been shown a blueprint by 
top officials of the Finance Ministry's Tax Bureau of a tax 
system reform. 
  According to the Finance Ministry plan, the name of the 
current consumption tax will be changed, will be called either a 
"welfare tax" or a "national life tax," and will be incorporated 
in the yearly report of the government-sponsored Tax System 
Committee, to make it appear that the plan was thoroughly 
discussed. At first, the tax rate will be set at 7 percent, 
with the 3-percent rate left intact on sales of food products to 
save the face of the SDPJ. In addition, the plan is said to 
have prepared a year-end refund of about 20,000 yen for 
low-income people, to appease Komeito [Clean Government Party]. 
  It is doubtful, however, whether the governing coalition 
parties can come to a conclusion before the year's end, as the 
Finance Ministry hopes they can. As for the Finance Ministry, 
Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito faces difficulty in 
playing an active role this time, because he was under attack 
over the national welfare tax. Therefore, Tax Bureau Director 
General Tadashi Ogawa and his staff are likely to make the 
necessary prearrangements. But, many Tax Bureau officials are 
cautious about handling the tax reform and express a negative 
sentiment by saying that "it is more than enough just to 
complete the discussions within the year." Such an attitude is 
attributed to the fact that Director General Ogawa is closely 
associated with former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, thus 
suggesting a possible resurgence of the Tax Bureau's 
behind-the-scenes strife with those affiliated to the line of 
Ichiro Ozawa and Saito. 
  Director General Ogawa cannot get along at all with Vice 
Minister Saito, and he does not even nod to the vice minister 
when he runs across him in the ministry's hallway. At the end 
of last year, he was reported to be set to be dismissed from his 
post, and Takeshita seems to have mediated to settle the strife. 
Their relations, however, are still riddled with cracks. 
  Vice Minister Saito is reputed to be "the type of 
outstanding 
person who comes along every 10 years," while Director General 
Ogawa is the "trump card of the Finance Ministry" who has dealt 
with broad sections of the ministry such as taxes, the budget, 
the minister's secretariat, and the like. Within the ministry, 
it is said prematurely that they will compete for the post of 
governor of the Bank of Japan 10 years from now. 
  What to do with Tax System Committee Chairman Hiroshi Kato 
will also become a focal point in the future discussion of the 
tax system. Although his term of office expired at the end of 
January, he is full of ambition to act as chairman. However, 
because of his repeated slips of his tongue concerning his 
convictions and his settlement of problems with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa through direct talks over the head of the ministry, the 
Tax Bureau wants him "to retire." It is also true, however, 
that "there is no suitable man of ability to succeed him." 
  The composition of the Tax System Committee has been 
criticized publicly for being "composed of representatives of 
the rich and for not reflecting the voice of the common people." 
With this in the background, the Prime Minister's Office is 
considering a dramatic plan to add new members who are largely 
women to the prime minister's liking.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 22 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- At the 
secondary schools of Mongolia there are studying some 370 
thousand children. This is approximately by ten thousand less 
than during the last year. More than 92 thousand schoolchildren 
have stopped attending their lessons for the current schooling 
year. Such a weakening children's interest in study is being 
promoted by a number of objective and subjective factors. Among 
them one can see such as a formalistic attitude to the teaching 
in schools, low level professional skill of some teachers and at 
last financial difficulties arising in the transition period to 
a market. Last winter some 86 schools had to cease their 
studies due to the absence of heating supply to their 
schoolbuildings. For many of schools in the countryside there 
is a serious lack of teaching staff.

Minister Hong Sun-yong said today that the inspection of North 
Korea by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] had not 
reached a point that would be acceptable to us, and that the 
North-South dialogue had not proceeded smoothly. It is therefore 
not clear whether the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks will be held on 21 March as scheduled. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Hong said: If the talks are not held 
as scheduled, the North Korean nuclear issue cannot but return 
to the starting point. Considering this, the government has 
continued to discuss the presentation of the nuclear issue to 
the UN Security Council with friendly countries, such as the 
United States.

  [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- Seoul denied reports 
Wednesday that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspections were being hampered in North Korea. 
  "The inspections are going smoothly so far," said a Foreign 
Ministry official. "IAEA activities are expected to conclude 
around March 14 or 15." 
  The IAEA inspectors who arrived in Pyongyang on March 3 have 
just about finished checking five of the seven declared 
facilities, the official said. However, the remaining two 
installations -- a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor and a 
radiochemical laboratory used for reprocessing -- are critical 
in determining whether North Korea diverted any nuclear material 
for non-peaceful uses. 
  The vernacular daily TONG-A ILBO reported that North Korea 
was restricting IAEA access to these two facilities. The story 
came out on the same day South and North Korea were to meet at 
the truce village of Panmunjom to arrange an exchange of 
presidential envoys.

  [Text] North Korea, claiming that it has not agreed that 
the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South 
should be a precondition for the third round of North Korea-U.S. 
high-level talks, is delaying allowing the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] to extract test material from major nuclear 
facilities, thus laying a stumbling block. 
  Hearing the report from relevant authorities on the 
afternoon 
of 8 March that a stumbling block is laid on IAEA's nuclear 
inspection now ongoing in North Korea, the government discussed 
measures for this, and decided to reconfirm that North-South 
special envoy exchange is the precondition for North Korea-U.S. 
talks. 
  On 8 March, a high-ranking government official said that 
"North Korea, contrary to its previous promise, is claiming that 
the inspection of the core facilities, including 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor and a radiochemical laboratory, should be 
conducted at the end of the schedule, thus making the 
inspection, including extraction of test material, delayed." 
  This official pointed out that "North Korea, claiming that 
the North-South special envoy exchange is not a precondition for 
the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, threatened 
that if the United States continually insists on special envoy 
exchange as the precondition for the talks, North Korea will not 
allow the inspection of core facilities." 
  The official noted that "the inspection team, changing its 
original plan, is continuing inspection activities, including 
replacement of batteries of surveillance cameras installed in 
the other five nuclear facilities. Whether North Korea will 
reject the inspection of core facilities to the end or not is a 
matter that we should continually watch." 
  This government official stressed that "during the recent 
New 
York working-level contact with the United States, North Korea 
agreed that the North-South special envoy exchange must be 
realized before the third round of talks." Thus, he reconfirmed 
it is the firm position of the ROK and the United States that 
the third round of high-level talks will be held only after the 
special envoy exchange is realized. 
  In particular, the government is going to reconfirm this 
existing position during forthcoming talks with Robert Galluci, 
U.S. assistant secretary of state, for readjustment of the 
positions of the ROK and the United States toward the third 
round of talks. 
  The official also noted that "as the special envoy exchange 
is clearly a precondition for the third round of talks, it is 
not necessary for us to raise a specific demand that the special 
envoy exchange must be realized before the third round of talks 
during the working contact with North Korea slated for 9 March." 
He added that "whether or not North Korea sincerely accepts 
nuclear inspection as previously promised and respond to special 
envoy exchange is a matter which North Korea should decide 
according to necessity for a third round of high-level talks." 
  However, North Korea, in a statement issued in the name of 
Kang Sok-chu, North Korean vice foreign minister, on 4 March, 
threatened that if the United States continually maintains that 
the envoy exchange must be realized before third round of talks, 
North Korea cannot satisfactorily ensure the inspection by IAEA.

  [Text] Panmunjom, Korea, March 9 (YONHAP) -- North and 
South Korea failed to make any progress on exchanging special 
envoys at a meeting in the truce village of Panmunjom on 
Wednesday, agreeing only to meet again this weekend. 
  At the meeting held in North Korea's Unification House, the 
South asked the North to drop four demands made at the previous 
four meetings and to respond to Seoul's proposal on an exchange 
of special envoys. 
  Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, who led the South 
Korean delegation to the meeting, warned that if North Korea 
insisted on its "unreasonable demands," it would be accused of 
"erecting a barrier to a special envoy exchange." 
  Stressing that the envoy exchange is a pressing issue that 
cannot be put aside, he said he expects North and South Korea 
will jointly work for reconciliation, cooperation and 
co-prosperity by realizing an exchange of special envoys. 
  But chief North Korean delegate Pak Yong-su, reiterating the 
four demands, offered a counterproposal calling for two 
additional items, including maintenance of national 
self-reliance, in the agenda for discussion by the special 
envoys. He also proposed that the South Korean envoy visit 
Pyongyang first for three nights and four days and that the 
preparatory period for the visit be 15 days. 
  North Korea's four demands include suspension of the joint 
South Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit," withdrawal of 
President Kim Yong-sam's remarks on North Korea's nuclear 
program and scrapping of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot 
missiles in South Korea.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 9 (YONHAP) -- The sudden cold snap 
was their first topic when South and North Korean 
representatives met again after six days Wednesday at the truce 
village of Panmunjom to discuss the long-awaited exchange of 
special envoys. "It feels like winter's final spite," the 
North's chief negotiator Pak Yong-su said in lieu of welcoming 
his South Korean counterpart Song Yong-tae. 
  "It was warm until yesterday, but the mercury plunged to 
below zero Celsius this morning," Pak noted. "We have had rain 
in Seoul and the central region since Monday. I believe spring 
flowers will start blooming sooner or later," Song retorted in 
an equally breezy greeting. "Willow buds are the first to 
announce spring...wild garlic and Shepherd's Purse (spring 
plants Koreans commonly eat as a vegetable dish or in soup) are 
already out and I had them for breakfast," was Pak's next 
addition to the small talk. 
  "I hope to see the special envoys come and go during this 
beautiful spring," said Song, finally getting down to the nitty- 
gritty. 
  -- The two representatives were able to agree in principle 
on 
at least one thing -- stepping up inter-Korean economic 
cooperation. 
  Processing-on-commision trade between South and North Korea 
in the past two months reached 2.8 million U.S. dollars, already 
60 percent of last year's performance, Song said, implicitly 
proposing direct exchanges so as to boost two-way trade. "Well, 
2.8 million dollars in two months is less than expected," Pak 
said, suggesting that the communist regime has been busy putting 
its trade-first policy into action. "If South and North Korea 
run together toward the world, it won't be just one plus one 
becoming two, but our forces multiplying 10- and 20-fold," Song 
predicted. 
  -- Pak was, as always, witty, asking Song if he had cooked 
for his wife the previous day. "March 8 is international married 
women's day and I make it a habit of cooking for my wife that 
day," Pak said. "How nice, and I thought you were a hen-pecked 
husband...," Song jested. As for himself, he said that he 
entertains his wife by taking her on trips or for a drive every 
now and then. 
  -- North Korea made a keynote statement first as the meeting 
took place on the Northern side of Panmunjom. Before getting to 
the closed-door session, Song commented on news reports after 
their previous contact last Friday. He said he was personally 
embarrassed by press reports calling the last meeting "much ado 
about nothing," adding that he had hoped to see articles 
picturing this contact as having blossomed like a flower. "Let's 
be patient. Good results will come out in the end," Pak 
responded. 
  -- The two negotiators again tossed back and forth thorny 
and 
playful barbs. Pak started by saying he read in a South Korean 
newsweekly that Song practices a mock meeting before 
inter-Korean dialogue. 
  "I wonder who played my role. I hope to be friends with 
`him'," he said. "I also read in one newspaper where you said 
you knew what I'm thinking just by looking at my eyes. Well, 
tell me what my eyes say today," he ventured. 
  The two then picked up on their joke about the envelope and 
briefcase that Pak first mentioned at last week's meeting. 
  "I see you haven't brought your big briefcase this time. I 
guess you don't have too much to offer this time," the chief 
North Korean negotiator observed. "Well, instead of a briefcase, 
I brought with me a big bundle," Song countered, pointing to a 
white envelope brought by Pak and bantering, "You won't feel 
very comfortable carrying an empty envelope around." 
  "Since you came here (Northern side of the truce village), 
we 
will have to give you something big this time... Let's do 
well," Pak said expansively.

  [Text] After the North-South working-level contact ended, 
Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, our side's senior 
delegate to the contact, said that the North side had shown a 
positive sign by proposing an amendment to the agreement 
regarding the procedures for the exchange of special envoys, but 
the North and South failed to make any practical progress in the 
discussions because the North side has continued to insist on 
resolving four issues in advance. 
  Delegate Song Yong-tae said that senior delegates from the 
two sides met separately and frankly exchanged their views for 
approximately 20 minutes after the working-level contact ended. 
He did not comment in detail on the contents of the meeting, 
but said that the sixth North-South contact, which will be held 
on 12 March, would likely be a turning point in determining the 
success or failure of the exchange of special envoys. 
  Delegate Song Yong-tae said that at present, he cannot be 
pessimistic nor optimistic on whether the exchange of special 
envoys is held before 21 March, the day the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks is scheduled. He stressed 
that our government's position remains unchanged, and added that 
the North side is likely to be aware of the fact that the third 
round of U.S.-North Korean talks cannot be held without the 
exchange of special envoys between the North and South.

<F P=106> [Article by Chong Tong-u, international affairs desk </F>
reporter: "The Two Faces of the U.S. Nuclear Policy" from the 
"Reporter's Eye" column] 
  [Text] A foreign report said that on 6 March the United 
States successfully test-fired a cruise missile for the first 
time this year over northern Canada. That day, the two missiles 
without warheads were fired from a base in the northern edge of 
Beaufort Sea in the North Pole and reached Alberta and 
Saskatchewan Provinces in west Canada, respectively, after 
flying 2,500 kilometers. Concerning this, the U.S. military 
authorities merely noted that a cruise missile test-firing was 
conducted, and did not elaborate on the functions of the fired 
missiles or any other details. It is not necessary for one to 
mention again what these missiles are used for. 
  Almost at the same time, a train carrying 60 nuclear 
warheads 
arrived in Russia from Ukraine. The warheads, which were left in 
Ukraine after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, were to 
be moved to Russia and dismantled according to the agreement 
signed by U.S. President Clinton, Russian President Yeltsin, and 
Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk last January. This agreement 
stipulates that all of the 1,600-odd nuclear warheads and 176 
long-range missiles in Ukraine will be destroyed. It is a fact 
already known to the world that this agreement was realized 
through strong and persistent U.S. diplomatic efforts. 
  How should we explain the inconsistency of the fact that the 
very moment when nuclear weapons of one country were being 
destroyed, another is test firing a nuclear delivery system? 
  The United States voluntarily assumed the role of world 
police both in name and reality. This being the situation, the 
United States is attempting to inquire into not only political 
and military but also economic and even human rights issues of 
the nations of the world, and asserts that it will punish them 
for their wrongdoings. Strong measures against the North Korean 
nuclear development are a practical example of the role of 
global police from the military standpoint. Making an issue over 
the ROK's National Security Law and interfering in the human 
rights issue in China are the result of voluntary assuming the 
role of police on human rights. It is true that the voluntary 
assumption of the police role by the United States has positive 
aspects, because a certain order and system should be maintained 
in the international community, just as in relations between 
individuals, and because the United States has become the only 
superpower of the world, both in name and reality, after the 
collapse of the U.S.-Soviet Union confrontation system. Thus, it 
is not bad for the United States to assume the role of 
maintaining military and diplomatic order. 
  However, whoever maintains order should be stern with itself 
as much as it demands order from others so as to win their 
trust. Since the United States demands that the international 
community reduce its nuclear weapons and delivery system, it 
should also refrain from acting to evoke suspicion from the 
international community. Is the United States stern enough with 
itself so as to be recognized as the police by the international 
community?

<F P=106> [By Kim Chung-kun from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China has been closely analyzing North Korea's 
nuclear technology level during the past year since the North 
Korean nuclear issue became an international issue. It was 
learned that China ultimately concluded that North Korea had not 
yet reached the level of developing nuclear warheads. 
  A high-ranking diplomatic source in Beijing said: "After a 
long investigation into various aspects of the North Korean 
nuclear issue, China judges that North Korea's current nuclear 
technology is only at the level of reprocessing plutonium and 
that it has yet to reach the level of nuclear enrichment." 
  According to this source, China views that North Korea's 
economy limits nuclear development.

  [Text] At ROK-U.S. working-level trade talks held on 8 
March in Seoul, concerning the issues of automobile and 
intellectual property rights, the U.S. side strongly urged the 
ROK side to further reduce tariffs on imported cars and to 
conduct a special crackdown on those who violate intellectual 
property rights, along with revising relevant laws and 
regulations established to protect the rights. 
  In the talks, while highly assessing the results of the ROK 
side's efforts to crack down on violators of the intellectual 
property rights, the U.S. side not only called for the ROK side 
to conduct a stronger crackdown on violators, but also strongly 
urged it to revise its laws and regulations so as to match those 
of the intellectual property agreement of the Urguay Round and 
the level of those of advanced countries. 
  Concerning the issue of opening the automobile market, the 
U.S. side, claiming that the ROK authorities have taken such an 
unfavorable measure as conducting a tax audit on those who 
purchase foreign cars, strongly urged the ROK side to stop 
taking such a measure and to further lower tariffs on imported 
cars from the current 10 percent. 
  However, recalling the fact that the laws related to the 
intellectual property rights such as the copyright protection 
law, the computer program protection law, the tariff law, and 
the cabled television broadcasting law have already been revised 
last year through consultations with the United States, our side 
explained that the tariff on imported cars has been lowered from 
15 percent last year to 10 percent this year and that it is 
difficult to further lower the tariff because the European Union 
also levies a 10 percent trariff on imported cars.

  [Text] Washington, March 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has 
played an active role in the Uruguay Round of trade 
negotiations, contributing to global liberalization benefiting 
its own economy as well as those of its trading partners, the 
U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said Tuesday. 
  In its annual trade policy report released Tuesday, the USTR 
said, however, that South Korea should soon implement laws to 
protect patents, trademarks and copyrights (trips) as reports of 
piracy and counterfeiting continue. The USTR also urged Seoul 
to ease formal and informal restrictions on motor vehicle 
imports. 
  "As part of its contribution to a successful Uruguay Round, 
Korea will lower barriers to trade that will benefit U.S. 
exporters and investors," the report said. 
  It recalled that last July, Presidents Bill Clinton and Kim 
Yong-sam launched the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC), a 
one-year initiative to expand bilateral economic ties with 
special attention paid to Korea's plans to deregulate and 
internationalize its econony. 
  "Liberalization of Korea's investment restrictions is a top 
priority for the United States in these consultations," the 
report said. 
  In another area, the United States and South Korea concluded 
an agreement in July 1993 which contained specific steps to open 
Korea's beef market fully, it said. The agreement, subsequently 
expanded and modified as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations, 
strictly limits the Korean Government's involvement in 
regulating importation and distribution of beef and creates an 
alternative private-sector distribution channel, it said. 
  Korea has also taken positive action in lowering tariffs on 
agricultural and manufactured goods, it said. 
  "In the services area, Korea has provided broad commitments 
with relatively few qualifications," it said. "Korea's 
commitments are especially strong in advertising, architecture, 
engineering, computer services, construction, value-added 
telecommunications, and movement of personnel." 
  "Korea's offer provides not just a standstill commitment to 
adopt no new restrictions, but a rollback of existing 
restrictions," it said. 
  Last December, Korea completed its accession negotiations to 
the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) government 
procurement agreement in renegotiating the pact in parallel with 
the Uruguay Round. 
  The agreement will result in significant new opportunities 
for U.S. exporters from 1997, the report said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The World Focuses on the National Security </F>
Law"] 
  [Text] It is deplorable that political discussion on the 
National Security Law [NSL], which is well known as an evil law 
trampling upon human rights, has not shown any progress although 
it has, with the domestic movement to repeal the law, become a 
matter of international concern. Both a high-ranking U.S. 
Government official and the U.S. secretary of state remarked on 
their hopes for the repeal of the NSL and it is a main issue at 
the UN Human Rights Commission Conference being held in Geneva, 
Switzerland. Considering that the Human Rights Commission 
Conference adopted a resolution recommending the phased repeal 
of the NSL in Vienna in 1992, it is conceivable that a stronger 
resolution may be adopted this time. It seems that we will not 
be able to avoid being labeled as a "country with underdeveloped 
human rights." 
  While not demanding repeal with the help of international 
opinion, we must reemphasize our opinion regarding the 
government and ruling party's insistance on disapproving the 
revision or repeal of the NSL, and their objection to 
international opinion. 
  First, let us examine if the revision or repeal of the NSL 
is 
a domestic issue that should not be discussed by others. The 
foreign minister called the U.S. ambassador to the ROK to 
protest the remarks by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
Hubbard, and the Democratic Liberal Party issued a statement 
refuting the confirmation remarks by Secretary of State 
Christopher. They all asked for a halt in remarks that 
interfere in internal affairs. Although we would like to 
positively appraise the government and the ruling party's 
apparent change in attitude from one of swallowing its anger on 
unsatisfactory points in relations with the United States, we 
cannot but criticize their points of refutation. Without 
mentioning the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the human 
rights issue is already a matter of international concern and no 
one can deny that it is common practice to apply international 
measures. Moreover, the International Human Rights Conference 
held in Vienna in July 1993 declared that protection and 
improvement of human rights is a legal concern for the 
international community. We have to recognize that insistance 
on this as a domestic issue is limiting when considering that 
our country will have increasingly more occasion to comment on 
the human rights conditions of foreign countries. 
  Next, the problem is whether the NSL should remain an evil 
law that tramples on human rights now that the civilian 
government is in office. We would like to hear the government's 
answer to assertions by human rights groups, including the 
Kennedy Human Rights Foundation, that "illegal retention under 
the NSL continues." However, an explanation will not solve the 
problem. The fact that there is a law condemning "human 
thoughts that are not provable" is itself a contradiction that 
needs to be raised. 
  Let us lastly examine why the NSL should be made an issue 
when related North Korean laws are far more unreasonable and 
atrocious. While comparison of North Korea's laws with ours in 
terms of mutuality in North-South relations is not even worth 
consideration, if we assume that everything the government and 
related organizations say about North Korea's legal system and 
human rights situation are true, and strictly apply mutuality 
here, we would need to enact more evil laws and tolerate more 
atrocious human rights infringements. Is this justifiable? 
  Recalling the interview with the NEW YORK TIMES in 1979 by 
Kim Yong-sam, then president of the New Democratic Party, urging 
the United States to "exercise open and direct pressure to then 
President Pak Chong-hui," we again ask the government and the 
ruling party if the NSL remains indispensable when it goes 
against the trend of today's international community which 
stresses opening up and internationalization.

  [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
retaliated for Seoul's protest against human rights violations 
in a tit-for-tat spat at the Human Rights Commission Conference 
in Geneva on Tuesday. 
  Yi Chol, North Korea's ambassador to Geneva, told the 
conference that the South Korean Government is a "military 
regime disguised in the mask of a civilian regime." 
  Seoul retains fascist laws, Yi said, apparently referring to 
the national security law which prohibits any unauthorized 
contact with North Koreans. Yi reminded that even U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has stated as Washington's 
official position that he wants to see this law repealed. 
  South and North Korea signed an historic agreement in 1991 
on 
reconciliation and agreement, Yi said, pointing out that Seoul 
should remain faithful to this accord. 
  Yi's statements came in reaction to Seoul's protest a day 
earlier charging that human rights in North Korea are infringed, 
that individuals are kidnapped or go missing and that individual 
freedoms are ignored.

  [Text] Seoul, Mar. 9 (YONHAP) -- Kim Nam-su, 61, one of 76 
North Koreans taken prisoner during the Korean War (1950-53) who 
opted for a third country in a POW exchange following the 
cease-fire, arrived in Seoul on Wednesday afternoon from Brazil, 
where he has lived for the past 40 years. 
  "I'm very pleased to return to my home country, which I've 
long dreamed of," he said upon descending down from a Korean Air 
plane. 
  Kim went to Brazil via India in 1954 and was imprisoned in 
1963 for stabbing a Japanese-Brazilian to death in a quarrel 
with fellow Japanese-Brazilians over their contempt for him as a 
Korean. A Korean church in Sao Paulo helped him get out of 
prison in 1975, but he killed a Chinese-Brazilian in 1979 and 
was then placed in a mental hospital. 
  Aided by a campaign for his release by the Korean community 
in Brazil, he was freed on Feb. 4. His return to Seoul was 
arranged by Father Kim Tong-ok of the Korean Catholic Church and 
the Korean Consulate-General in Sao Paulo. 
  Kim was the second of the 55 North Korean POWs living in 
Brazil to come to Seoul, following Yim In-ho's return last year. 
He will spend the rest of his life in a Catholic nursing home 
in Eumsong, North Chungchong Province. 
  Born in Kosong, Kangwon Province, in 1933 and forced to join 
the North Korean Army while attending high school in Wonsan 
during the Korean War, Kim said, "I'd like to spend the rest of 
my life doing something meaningful to me, though I'm old and 
feeble." 
  Meeting him at Kimpo International Airport was Kim Chun-cha, 
who said he might be the brother she parted with in North Korea 
during the war. He failed to recognize her, however.

  [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu arrived in Seoul Wednesday for a three-day visit 
emphasizing economic cooperation with South Korea. Iliescu, 
Romania's first popularly elected president, meets with his 
South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam later in the afternoon and 
will be the main guest at a state dinner. He will meet leaders 
from both the ruling and opposition camps on Thursday. But the 
highlight of his visit is an industrial tour and meetings with 
business leaders that will take him to the southern part of the 
country for a first-hand look at factories, with 22 businessmen 
accompanying him. 
  Romania had been a staunch ally of North Korea until 
Iliescu's election as president, and Seoul officials see his 
visit as another sign of the cold war's collapse. 
  Kim and Iliescu will issue a joint statement after their 
summit pledging to pursue dialogue on political and economic 
cooperation. The two countries' foreign ministers will sign an 
aviation agreement on Thursday.

Illiescu by correspondent Yi Hong-ki in Bucharest, Romania; date 
not given--Iliescu replies are recorded] 
  [Text] The KBS held an exclusive interview with Romanian 
President Illiescu, who is slated to visit the ROK on 9 March. 
President Illiescu provided his views on the situation on the 
Korean peninsula, North Korea's nuclear development project, and 
ROK-Romanian economic relations. Correspondent Yi Hong-ki has 
more from Bucharest, Romania. 
  [Yi] President Illiescu of Romania, a country with 
established diplomatic relations with both Koreas, while noting 
that North Korea's efforts to develop nuclear weapons have 
gained some results, predicted that North Korea will eventually 
convert its nuclear development for peaceful purposes due to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's inspections. 
  [Illiescu] I do not think North Korea has great nuclear 
capacity, but it is considerable. However, I really do not 
think that North Korea's nuclear development represents a great 
danger. 
  [Yi] In the interview with the KBS on his upcoming ROK 
visit, 
he assessed that relations have made great progress in various 
areas since the ROK and Romania established ties four years ago. 
He pointed out that it is very important to promote political, 
economic cooperation between the two countries. 
  [Illiescu] We try to follow the great industrial 
achievements of the ROK. 
  [Yi] President Illiescu repeatedly stressed how important 
the ROK's economic cooperation was for the stability of 
Romania's democracy and its market economic system.

  [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- The presidents of South 
Korea and Romania issued a joint statement on Wednesday after 
their summit confirming they support international efforts to 
prevent nuclear arms proliferation. President Kim Yong-sam and 
his Romanian counterpart Ion Iliescu recognized the necessity of 
the two countries working together to maintain and expedite the 
current worldwide trends of peace and cooperation. 
  "They expressed their support for the international 
community's efforts to reduce weapons of mass destruction 
including the nuclear arsenal, and to prevent their 
proliferation," the statement said. 
  Iliescu, Romania's first popularly elected president, 
arrived 
in Seoul Wednesday for a three-day visit. He is the first 
Romanian president to visit Seoul since the two countries formed 
diplomatic relations in 1990. 
  President Iliescu backed Seoul's efforts to achieve peaceful 
reunification of the Korean peninsula, while President Kim 
reasserted South Korea's support for political and economic 
reforms in Romania as it heads toward creating a democratic 
society and market-oriented economy. 
  President Kim asked Iliescu to back up South Korea's efforts 
to become a member of the United Nations Security Council, and 
the Romanian president expressed his support for the idea. 
  The two presidents agreed to encourage investment and 
industrial cooperation in conformity with their domestic laws, 
and to forge bilateral agreements in such important economic 
areas as energy production, including peaceful use of nuclear 
energy, electro-technics and electronics, and the automobile and 
shipbuilding industries. They also agreed to expand cooperation 
in science and technology and to encourage joint research 
projects and exchanges of scientists and researchers, and of 
information and experience in the promotion of economic reform, 
as well as cooperating in professional education and 
specialization of economic experts and managers. 
  "In this regard," the statement said, "both presidents 
agreed 
to establish the joint committee in conformity with the 
agreement on economic, scientific and technical cooperation 
signed on Aug. 7, 1990." The committee's first meeting will be 
held at an early date deemed agreeable to both sides, according 
to the statement. 
  At the summit meeting, the two presidents exchanged views on 
international affairs including the situation in Northeast Asia, 
the Korean peninsula and the Balkans, and on ways to expand 
bilateral relations. 
  Iliescu will be the main guest at a state dinner on 
Wednesday 
night. He is scheduled to meet with leaders from both the 
ruling and opposition camps on Thursday. 
  Romania had been a staunch ally of North Korea until 
Iliescu's election as president, and Seoul officials see his 
visit as another sign of the Cold War's collapse.

  [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
thanked Romanian President Ion Iliescu Wednesday for his 
country's help in attempting to resolve the North Korean nuclear 
issue. Speaking at a banquet for the Romanian head of state 
Wednesday night, President Kim expressed hope that Bucharest 
will continue to support and encourage Seoul in its efforts to 
achieve peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula. Iliescu 
arrived in Seoul earlier in the day and held a summit meeting 
with President Kim. 
  "I was pleased to note that in the summit meeting, we 
confirmed the fact that the friendly cooperative relationship 
between our two nations has steadily progressed in all fields," 
Kim said. "In particular, our businesses are venturing into 
Romania, a very encouraging sign for the promotion of 
substantial cooperation between our two countries," he said. 
  An aviation accord to be signed Thursday by South Korea and 
Romania and a double taxation avoidance agreement taking effect 
this year will ensure that bilateral relations become firmer and 
more mature, Kim said. 
  Romanian President Iliescu, in his table speech, expressed 
admiration for the Korean people having succeeded against all 
hardships to defend and maintain their national identity and 
having made their valuable contribution to the enrichment of 
universal culture. He said the "Korean miracle," which he said 
is a source of inspiration for other countries, was the result 
of persistent efforts, enterprising spirit and skill of the 
Korean people. "The Romanian people have fought all along their 
troubled history against foreign domination, in defence of their 
national identity, and to conquer and protect the independence 
of their country," he said.

  [Text] The Export-Import [Ex-Im] Bank of Korea has agreed 
with Romania's state-run telecommunications corporation to 
extend a $50 million loan from the Economic Development 
Cooperation Fund (EDCF), a spokesman said. 
  The agreement was signed in Bucharest last Friday (local 
time) between Ex-Im Bank president Kim Yong-pin and Dumitru 
Anghelescu, president of the communications corporation Rom 
Telecom R.A. 
  The EDCF loan carries an annual interest of 4.2 percent and 
has to be paid back over the next 20 years with five years' 
deferment of repayments of the principal. 
  The state-run telecommunications company will use the loan 
for modernizing communications equipment in the Romanian state 
of Prahova. 
  Signed prior to the state visit of Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu today, the agreement is expected to boost bilateral 
economic cooperation and to help Korean companies export 
machinery and equipment to East European countries, the 
spokesman said.

  [Text] Look East and learn from the Koreans and 
Japanese--it's under that slogan that Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad has led his country's economic development 
since the early 1980s. 
  His work to create opportunities for Malaysian businesses, 
in 
turn, may hold some lessons for Korean government officials and 
perhaps President Kim Yong-sam himself. Since the beginning of 
the year, Kim has said he will put top priority on boosting 
national competitiveness and urged his administration officials 
to spare no efforts to support businesses. 
  Frequent overseas working trips low on official protocol are 
said to exemplify his efforts to achieve the goal of placing 
Malaysia in the ranks of the most advanced countries, with a per 
capita income of $16,000 by the year 2020. 
  The Malaysian prime minister recently made such a trip to 
Korea with the sole purpose of business talks. His three-day 
private visit at the invitation of the Hyundai Business Group 
made Koreans realize again why he is called the "business 
premier." 
  In December 1991, he had made a similar visit to Korea, also 
at the invitation of Hyundai. 
  Mahathir arrived in a southern airport Saturday in a small 
private airplane, accompanied by only three Malaysian 
businessmen and no government officials. During his visit, he 
declined any protocol. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong received and saw him off 
at the Kimhae International Airport in his capacity as former 
ambassador to Malaysia, not as the vice foreign minister. 
Mahathir inspected the group's auto plant and shipyard in the 
southeastern port of Ulsan. He checked a model of a small truck 
Hyundai plans to produce in a joint venture with a Malaysian 
business. He focused on business talks with Hyundai Chairman 
Chong Se-yong and other top executives of the group about the 
plan for the joint production of small trucks and another plan 
to order ships. 
  A Hyundai official said Mahathir asked the group to keep his 
visit unpublicized so that he could concentrate on objectives. 
  Besides the two business-only visits, Mahathir has made four 
other trips to Korea, including his first visit in 1980 when he 
was trade and industry minister. He made two official visits 
here as prime minister in August 1983 and in September 1990. 
Mahathir came to Seoul in May 1992 to speak to a meeting of the 
Pacific Basin Economic Council, a group of regional private 
economic leaders. 
  A Foreign Ministry official said business trips by Mahathir 
should be a stimulus for Korean officials. 
  The official, however, said, it is hardly imaginable for a 
Korean president in the near future to visit a foreign country 
at the invitation of a private business. 
  "Korea is different from Malaysia in many ways, such as 
social atmosphere and people's attitudes," he said. There can 
also be a gap between words and attitudes of Koreans on the 
matter, the official said. 
  "I don't think, despite what they say, that Koreans will 
accept it as natural for their president to visit a foreign 
country only for business talks with a private enterprise," he 
said. 
  The official pointed out one thing that hinders Korean trade 
officials from going all-out to support a Korean business in 
overseas markets. In many cases, competition among Korean 
companies is fiercer than competition with foreign firms, he 
said. 
  "The President has told us to be salesmen for the nation's 
businesses," the official said. "But whose products will we 
have to help sell if Korean companies compete with each other?"

  [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- The Science and 
Technology Ministry has publicly invited South Korean research 
institutes and universities to take part in joint-venture 
research complexes in Russia with Russian think tanks and 
businesses this month. Ministry officials said Wednesday that 
Korea and Russia have decided to open three to four pilot 
research complexes in Moscow this year to accelerate transfers 
of advanced Russian technology. The project is expected to 
enhance current Korean-Russian research cooperation, exchanges 
of researchers and training of engineers, the officials said. 
  Through the program, Korea will be able to utilize Russia's 
vast and sophisticated research facilities and brainpower to 
acquire intensive scientific and technological information from 
the ex-superpower, they said. The complexes will be locally 
incorporated through joint investments, with Korea paying cash 
for maintenance and research in the beginning stage and Russia 
providing the facilities and manpower. Research will be focused 
on technologies concerning machinery, materials, and 
electric/electronics that are lacking among Korean manufacturers 
as well as physics, chemistry and other basic sciences. For its 
part, the government will offer advice, help in choosing, 
commissioning and registering Russian partners, and subsidies 
for research projects and other expenses, the officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry's 
Yulgok special inspection team announced Wednesday that it has 
arrested three field-grade officers for their involvement in 
irregularities stemming from "the Yulgok project," a program to 
build up the nation's military power. The team also punished 
the chief of the Navy's Signal Corps and nine other officers for 
neglecting to supervise eight programs related to the Yulgok 
project. 
  The chief of the inspection team, Lt. Gen. Chang Pyong-yong, 
announced the results of the two-month probe into the Yulgok 
project at the Defense Ministry building. 
  Navy Cmdr. O Yun-hwan was arrested last week after it was 
disclosed that he had informed a trader of the expected bidding 
price for shooting control equipment on military ships, in order 
to negotiate a contract for a higher price than the expected 
bidding price, at the end of 1991. 
  Trader Chon Won-hong received more than 1,154,000 U.S. 
dollars, indeed higher than the expected bidding price, from the 
Defense Ministry for importing and providing the shooting 
control equipment, thus making an undue profit of more than 
190,000 dollars. 
  Cmdr. O received roughly 80 million won (about 100,000 
dollars) from Chon, who was also arrested early this month. 
  Cho Ki-hyon, head of Chong U Construction Co., Ltd., was 
arrested for bribing two officers to win the order and for using 
a particular construction method at military schools on the 
outskirts of Kwangju and Kimhae. 
  Army Col. Chong Sok-yong and Air Force Lt. Yim Myong-yong 
received 20 million won and 47 million won, respectively, from 
Cho. Both were arrested in January. 
  The inspection team also said that Daewoo Corp. drew up a 
behind- the-scenes contract with Lockheed Aircraft Ltd. of the 
United States for mediating the Navy's purchase of sea patrol 
planes (P-3C), besides the official contract. 
  Daewoo received an official commission of 3 billion won from 
Lockheed and asked for an extra 18.4 billion won under the 
secret contract, only to be rejected by Lockheed. 
  The inspection team reviewed the Air Force's F-4E Phantom 
fighter improvement project and decided to cancel it due to 
excessive expenditure and U.S. restrictions on transferring 
advanced technology to South Korea. 
  On the Korea Navy Tactical Data System (KNTDS) program, the 
inspection team said the Navy did not judge U.S. development of 
the system precisely and paid the American company, Litton Ltd., 
2.7 billion won unnecessarily for the system. 
  Chang said after the announcement that his team had carried 
out a strict investigation of former defense ministers including 
Kwon Yong-hae and Choe Sae-chang, but had found nothing untoward. 
  Meanwhile, Chang added that the inspection team will ask the 
Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry to cancel the registrations 
of the 11 businesses which are involved in the Yulgok 
irregularities including Koverseas Ltd. 
  The Yulgok special inspection team, comprised of the Armed 
Forces special inspection group, the Defense Security Command, 
joint investigation team and the ministry's law officers, 
finished a mission yesterday that began last Dec. 28.

  [Excerpt] The Defense Ministry decided on 9 March to cancel 
the plan to upgrade Phantom fighters, reorganize the Piho 
self-propelled gun project, and reexamine the trainer plane 
project. 
  Chang Pyong-yong, chief of the Defense Ministry's special 
inspection team, said this when he announced the results of its 
two-month investigation into the eight Yulgok projects. 
  Chief Chang said: "The 240 billion-won Phantom upgrade 
project was feasible when it was first mapped out in 1988. 
However, when we examined the project now, we found that we 
have no reason to go ahead with this project because it is not 
efficient and because we will not be able to obtain much 
aviation technology from it." 
  The Defense Ministry decided to reimburse the investment of 
Samsung Aviation in this project (four billion won). 
  The Piho project (one trillion 19.5 billion won) was 
designed 
to develop 30 mm antiair guns. The plan requires imports of 
major technologies and parts from foreign countries, and, as a 
result, the local content of the equipment will be a mere 44.4 
percent. However, the ministry decided to reorganize this 
project, because its cancellation would result in a loss of the 
international credibility of the local corporations involved. 
  The ministry also decided to go ahead with some of the 
projects under investigation, including the marine patrol 
aircraft project (602.3 billion), the Sangmu project (560 
billion won) [a project to relocate the Army Training and 
Doctrine Command in Kwangju], the destroyer project (110 billion 
won), and the Naval Tactical Data System project (15.6 billion). 
Nevertheless, the ministry decided to readjust the excessively 
appropriated expenses. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seoul, Mar. 9 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Audit and 
Inspection [BAI] said on Wednesday it had uncovered 47 cases of 
budgetary waste among public offices. The board demanded 
disciplinary actions or warning against the public officials 
involved. A board official said his board made a budgetary 
inspection of the Economic Planning Board and 59 other 
government offices for five days beginning last Dec. 20. 
  "The check showed a number of offices squandered unused 
budgets in the year-end period or used them for purposes other 
than they were intended for," he said. The Health and Social 
Affairs Ministry, for instance, obtained 174 million won for use 
in distoma programs reasoning the money was needed in treating 
distoma patients, the number of whom it estimated at 50,000 in 
1993. The Ministry gave the estimate despite the fact that those 
stricken by distoma numbered no more than 7,900 to 14,000 a year 
in the 1990-92 period. The ministry used only 31 million won in 
distoma programs and diverted the remaining 143 million won to 
other purposes such as staffs' welfare programs. 
  In another incident, the Pusan police agency wasted 30 
million won by purchasing additional color films although there 
was a sufficient stock of them, he said. The official said 
unused budgetary funds were believed to reach 1189.6 billion won 
in 1993.

  [Text] The Communications Ministry will abolish a 
governmental agency for mail inspection and establish a new 
bureau to handle trade issues and help domestic firms expand 
overseas, a spokesman said yesterday. The abolishment of the 
Post Service Research Institute, which is contained in the 
ministry's reorganization plan, came amid renewed controversy 
over the role of the institute. The institute had run dozens of 
branch offices across the nation to conduct inspections of mail 
at the request of the intelligence agencies and police. 
  Opposition lawmakers had demanded that the institute be 
abolished, branding the agency a legacy from previous 
authoritarian governments. The ministry has argued that mail 
inspection is part of the government's counterintelligence 
efforts. 
  Government inspectors currently handle, 1,500 letters and 
other postal items a day, according to ministry figures. The 
total volume of post inspected decreased from 584,000 items in 
1990 to 542,400 items in 1992. 
  The ministry said the mail inspection is still needed for 
security purposes, but that the operation will be handed over to 
major post offices. The ministry's reorganization plan also 
featured a government effort to cope with the increasing trend 
in the international marketplace to tear down trade barriers 
between countries. 
  A new Information and Telecommunications Cooperation Bureau 
will be charged with gathering and analyzing overseas market 
information and helping domestic firms sell more goods and 
promote joint projects overseas, a spokesman said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- Kim Mun-su, a former 
progressive labor activist, stands out as a definite anomaly in 
the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), which is still 
characterized by many as conservative. Kim, nevertheless, has 
recently joined the DLP and was named Tuesday as head of the 
party's Puchon-Sosa District chapter in Kyonggi Province, 
triggering a dispute among ranking members of the ruling party. 
  In the past Kim, 43, openly voiced skepticism about a 
capitalistic society and pursued socialist revolution, centered 
around workers. He was at the forefront of the radical labor 
movement and led the leftist struggle against past 
administrations headed by retired generals. His membership in 
the party, not to speak of his appointment as head of a DLP 
local chapter, naturally raised many an eyebrow. Conservative 
members of the DLP wonder how Kim will react to proposals on 
revising labor laws in the future and what stand he will take on 
the controversial National Security Law. 
  Reaction to Kim's appointment came immediately at Tuesday's 
party postholders meeting, where 10 local chapter heads were 
named. Rep. Yi Chi-ho of the party's Minjung faction said he did 
not understand how the party could accept a man who had served a 
two-and-a-half-year prison term for illegal labor activities. 
  Kim was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for 
organizing the Seoul Labor Movement Federation in 1985. It was 
the crowning achievement of a long career devoted to struggling 
against the government that began in the 1970s. 
  "If (Kim) could record the anti-establishment struggle as an 
achievement, what is going to happen to those who stood on the 
side of the establishment?" Yi asked Wednesday. 
  "If he has changed his political views, the party should 
have 
clarified them before accepting him into its ranks," Yi said. 
  Another senior DLP official said, "there are many party 
members who are wondering about the true colors of the party." 
Still another senior party man asked sarcastically: "Wouldn't 
the DLP appear to be a progressive party to the people, while 
the Democratic Party has become a conservative party?" 
  One party member who served as a ranking government official 
under President No Tae-u reacted more stoically. "Hasn't a new 
political force been forming in the party with new people being 
induced from the dissident camp?" 
  "It is now the time," he went on, "for either those new 
members or the party to clarify their ideological views." 
  The reform advocated by President Kim Yong-sam and 
anti-establishment activities pursued by members of the 
dissident camp are two different things and should be 
distinguished as such, said another party official. "Those 
people who welcome President Kim's reform would not necessarily 
accept Kim Mun-su," he said. But party leaders belonging to the 
Minju, or President Kim's, faction beg to differ. Rep. Kang 
Sam-chae said the ruling party should be able to embrace a wide 
spectrum of political views, including those in favor of 
conservatism as well as progressive forces. "Political 
ideologies change with the times," he said. Able politicians 
with dissident backgrounds and progressive tendencies could 
provide great impetus to the party's efforts to effect reform 
and change, Kang said, noting that Kim Mun-su has already 
publicly accepted President Kim's spirit of reform. 
  Other Minju faction members echoed Kang's sentiments. "With 
the degeneration of socialism and the end of the Cold War, the 
leftist progressive ideology has few followers even in activist 
groups," they said. Those who still insist on ideological 
confrontation do not even want to join the establishment, they 
said. 
  In any event, the last word, perhaps, belongs to Kim Mun-su 
himself. He has said he would actively participate in President 
Kim's reform campaign and help carry it out rather than watching 
from the outside and only offering criticism.

  [Text] State-owned Korea Telecom yesterday announced it 
will sell 1.16 million shares of Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT) 
through opening bidding March 21 and 22, offering fresh 
incentives for unenthusiastic investors. Korea Telecom had 
failed in the previous two attempts to auction off the shares, 
about 21 percent of the cellular monopoly, retarding the 
government's privatization effort. 
  In this new round of bidding, a Korea Telecom spokesman 
said, 
institutional investors will be invited to put in tenders. The 
company also eliminated a regulation that banned buyers from 
selling the shares within the first year of purchase. The 
spokesman also said the company will lower the cutoff price for 
successful bidders. In previous biddings, KMT shares were sold 
for 335,000 won per share on average. 
  Sunkyong Business Group virtually took over the cellular 
company by buying up a 23 percent holding in January when Korea 
Telecom invited tenders to auction off some 44 percent of KMT. 
Since then Korea Telecom has tried in vain to sell the 
remaining 21 percent stake. In the second round of bidding Feb. 
14 and 15, only 2,380 shares were sold. In the third trial Feb. 
28, there were no successful bidders. 
  Once a popular stock on the Seoul Stock Exchange, KMT shares 
dropped in price from a record high of 407,000 won per share 
early last month to 300,000 won earlier this month. With the 
rumors of new incentives, the price began picking up again and 
KMT shares were selling 316,000 won per share Monday.

<F P=106> ["Statement signed on 7 March by His Majesty Norodom </F>
Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia, concerning 
the great danger from war between the Khmer Royal Armed Forces, 
KRAF, and the forces of Democratic Kampuchea, DK" -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] Most beloved compatriots: The war between the KRAF 
and the DK forces, or Khmer Rouge, is now raging. It has 
brought no good nor benefit to our motherland. On the contrary, 
this war has brought only destruction, losses, suffering, pain, 
shame, and desperation for Cambodia, for the nation, and 
especially for its innocent poor people. 
  In my capacity as the father of the nation and the king 
father of the entire Cambodian people, whether they are men or 
women, belonging to whichever political parties and living 
wherever in the country, I appeal on the one hand to the Royal 
Government [RCG] and the KRAF and on the other to the party of 
Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK] to immediately agree to a general cease-fire on 
all battlefields throughout Cambodia. 
  I appeal to all of you, my children, to accept a total and 
unconditional reconciliation and concord. I appeal to all of you 
to join hands in building peace and to coexist peacefully now, 
in the future, and forever. Peace in Cambodia is the life, 
happiness, prosperity, and glory of our nation and motherland. 
War is death for Cambodia and our race. All problems remaining 
between the RCG and the PDK must be settled through only one 
means, a peaceful means. I appeal to the RCG and the PDK to give 
our motherland total peace, because only in this total peace can 
our motherland engage in the reconstruction process for the sake 
of our people and thereby enable our people to live happily in 
dignity and with freedom, bereft of all suffering. 
  I appeal to the NADK and the PDK to restore and rebuild all 
bridges, roads, and trails that this army and party have damaged 
and destroyed, and to help clear all mines from places that they 
have been laid. 
  I appeal to the KRAF to uphold the good traditions of the 
KRAF of the Sangkum Reas Niyum's era by, starting from now, 
paying attention to helping our poor people improve their living 
conditions. The KRAF must dedicate themselves to peaceful tasks 
for national reconstruction as in the time of Sangkum Reas Niyum. 
  I ask all of you, my beloved children and compatriots, to 
accept the expressions of my warmest and deepest love for you 
and may you all enjoy the four blessings of Lord Buddha, namely: 
long life, social prestige, happiness, and good health. 
  P.S. I would like to make it clear that I will not tolerate 
any parity between the RCG and the PDK, because DK is only a 
party whereas the RCG is a national government of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia. One day, through peaceful negotiations, the PDK will 
have to return to the Kingdom of Cambodia all the zones that 
they are controlling, including Pailin and the Preah Vihear 
temple, because the Kingdom of Cambodia has only one government, 
that is, the RCG, and only one army, that is, the KRAF.

danger arising from the war between the Khmer Royal Armed Forces 
[KRAF] and the forces of Democratic Kampuchea [DK]: 
  The war between the KRAF and the DK forces called the Khmer 
Rouge has, from the beginning to the present day, brought 
nothing good nor any profit to our nation and motherland. On 
the contrary, it has brought about only destruction, rift, 
suffering, hardship, misery, disgrace, and despair to our 
Cambodia, our nation, and especially our poor and innocent 
people. 
  In my capacity as the father of the nation and the Prince 
Father of all Cambodians, male and female alike and from all 
political parties and factions, I appeal to the Royal Government 
on the one side and the PDK [Party of Democratic Kampuchea] and 
DK national forces on the other to immediately and urgently 
cease fire on all battlefields in the entire Cambodia. I appeal 
to all of you to agree to reconcile fully without any 
preconditions. I appeal to all children to build peace and live 
peacefully together eternally now and in the future. 
  Peace in Cambodia is the life, the happiness, the 
prosperity, 
and the glory of our nation and motherland. War is the death of 
our Cambodia and our race. The one and only way to settle all 
the problems remaining between the Royal Government and the PDK 
is through peaceful means. I appeal to the Royal Government and 
the PDK to please bring full peace to our motherland, because 
only with full peace will our motherland have the capability 
(?to carry out reconstruction for) our people; and only when 
this is achieved can our people live in peace, happily with 
honor and freedom, and relieved from their misery and hardship.

  [Excerpts] PHNOM PENH -- The Minister of Finance had 
dismissed allegations that it would be difficult to adopt the 
French accounting system. Sam Rangsi, in an interview with the 
CAMBODIA TIMES, said: "Contrary to common belief, it was not I 
who had initiated and implemented this system. It was already 
in place during the rule of the former State of Cambodia 
government. During that period, French experts had been based 
with the then government for almost three years to help them 
prepare the fundamentals of the French accounting system. It is 
not an entirely new system as many believe. The French 
accounting system to be implemented here is based on that 
devised in 1982, which is in conformity with many European 
accounting systems." [passage omitted] 
  "The 1982 version is in uniformity with the accounting 
systems practised in Britain, Germany and Holland. It is just 
the presentation styles that are different. For example, in the 
British system, the cash balance is shown at the top of the 
accounting figures, while the fixed assets are at the bottom. 
In the French system, it is just the reverse. So there is no 
great difficulty in adapting or adopting this system," he 
pointed out. 
  Several businessmen had criticised the adoption of the 
French 
accounting system as a disincentive to much needed foreign 
investment and an unnecessary administrative burden for the 
local companies. [passage omitted] The main difference between 
the French and Anglo-International system is the way assets and 
liabilities are classified and how depreciation is treated.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Charge"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Royal Government's decision to remove the 
security charge levied on local and foreign companies for the 
establishment of trade companies and foreign representative 
offices here, is a very welcome move. This will give Cambodia an 
edge in boosting foreign investments, especially in view of the 
fact that the United States embargo on Vietnam has finally been 
lifted. 
  No doubt there will be an expected clamour to invest in the 
Indochina region, but the country with the most pull will be the 
one which provides the best economic returns for the amount 
invested. And Cambodia cannot afford to be seen as lackadaisical 
about foreign investment, as the country needs foreign capital 
to rebuild the country. 
  It would be a pity to give up on this opportunity to attract 
investment, merely because the government did not act fast 
enough. Prior to this move, trading companies and foreign 
representative offices had to deposit U.S. $3,000 with the 
National Bank as caution money. [passage omitted] Cambodia has a 
lot to offer investors but more steps need to be taken to make 
life easier for them. If this means cutting down on a lot of 
red tape, then so be it. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] PHNOM PENH -- The Royal Government has managed 
to attract between U.S. $200 million and U.S. $300 million in 
investments here since the formation of the government and the 
liberalisation of this nation. However, most of these 
investments were not in the right category as it did not benefit 
this nation much, in terms of technology transfer or resource 
utilisation. New investments will be diverted to the right 
sector to enable mutual benefits. 
  Minister of Finance, Sam Rangsi, told the CAMBODIA TIMES 
that 
the country has done remarkably well for a young and infant 
liberal democracy. "Vietnam, with a bigger population and 
resource base, has reportedly attracted U.S. $1 billion in 
foreign investments. However, many of them are cautious as it is 
not a gold mine as many believe. The lifting of the trade 
embargo on Vietnam by the United States will also not have any 
major material effect on the flow of foreign investment here." 
  "Our sustained efforts to show consistency in immigration 
and 
investment policy and the promotion of transparency in laws, 
regulations and procedures, will see the influx of more 
investors here in the near future. Within the next few weeks, we 
will see major multi-national companies, with a strong 
reputation, resource base and expertise, signing business 
agreements as well as announcing business ventures and 
investments here." 
  "These are the type of investors we need. We do not need bad 
investors who are here just to reap the country of its resources 
in limited industries such as logging, timber, gems and 
unhealthy sectors such as laundering of money," Rangsi said. "We 
will chase out the bad investors who do not represent the true 
business community here and replace them with new, serious and 
big companies with reputable international standings. These 
will be seen very soon." 
  "Priority, said the Finance Minister, would be given to the 
manufacturing sector, tourism, transportation and 
infrastructural sectors." [passage omitted] 
  "Other measures to encourage investors are the writings of 
the new investment law which will be submitted at the ICORC 
[International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia] 
meeting soon and which has been in principle approved by the 
Royal Government." 
  "We are also looking into the formation of new laws 
pertaining to investments. These include company laws, 
bankruptcy laws and land laws. At the moment there is no land 
law and this has been a hindrance to investment. This is because 
many plots of land have more than one land title as a result of 
irregularities and inadequacies at the land department. This 
has to be resolved as an investor would not want to establish a 
manufacturing plant on a plot of land which is in dispute in the 
future."

  [Text] The Indonesian Government cannot accept the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba because every country has the right to 
adopt its own political and economic system without the 
interference of other countries. Speaking to reporters after he 
met with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina in Jakarta 
today, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia has firmly 
adopted such a stand as the basis of its international 
relations, adding that Indonesia also believes that a country 
should not impose its will on another country, especially by 
imposing a blockade. 
  Speaking to reporters, Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina said 
his visit to Indonesia is part of his tour of seven Asian 
countries in his country's efforts to oppose the economic 
blockade imposed by the United States for the last 30 years.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Russia and the Bosnian Conflict"] </F>
  [Excerpts] There is a new development in the Bosnian 
conflict. Russia is now behind the Serbs and is trying to do its 
best to defend its traditional ally. In fact, this trend was 
already visible after NATO threatened to bomb the Serbs. Russia 
strongly opposed the threat and insisted that the settlement of 
the Bosnian conflict be referred to the UN Security Council. If 
the proposal is approved, Russia would certainly use its veto 
power to defend the Serbs. [passage omitted] 
  There are several reasons why Russia, which earlier 
supported 
the West, is now defending the Serbs. First, the Serbs are a 
traditional ally of Russia. Although Russia is no longer the 
godfather [preceding word in English] of its former satellite 
nations, it is still obligated to defend the Serbs, who used to 
be part of its hegemony. 
  Second, Russia appears to have been angry that it has 
totally 
been ignored by the West in the Bosnian conflict. The NATO 
ultimatum, for example, was obviously issued without taking 
Russia into account. Russian generals feel that Russia, a 
former superpower and former leader of the defunct Warsaw Pact, 
has been ignored by NATO. Accordingly, they have tried from the 
very beginning to obstruct NATO actions. 
  Third, in the context of international politics, Russia 
wants 
to "reemerge" as a superpower by showing its opposition to the 
Western scenario in the Balkans. The fact that its economy has 
collapsed and domestic politics is in disarray is one thing, 
while involvement in an international conflict is another. In 
any case, Russia still has military strength that needs to be 
reckoned with. 
  The Serbs are, of course, exploiting such a situation. They 
believe that the West--half-heartedly and irreversibly dragged 
into the conflict--will think twice before crushing them if 
Russia is involved on their side. 
  Of course, Russia will not intervene hastily because it has 
to be cautious toward the United States and Europe, whose 
assistance is by all means needed to support the reforms in 
Russia. Regardless of this, the Serbian policy of using Russia 
as a "shield," may, however, complicate the situation in the 
Balkans. 
  Even NATO, the United Nations, and the United States 
continue 
to have different views about the best way to settle the 
conflict. NATO's "unanimous" decision to give the Serbs the 
ultimatum was in fact not made easily because each NATO member 
feels that it has a better way to settle the conflict. Thus, 
imagine what will happen if the Russian factor is actually 
played in the delicate Bosnian conflict! Obviously, such a 
situation will benefit the Serbs the most.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Should Consider and Champion the Fate of </F>
Bosnians"] 
  [Excerpts] What was the reason behind the global 
community's previous assistance to Africa when it encountered 
famine? It was because the mass media, particularly worldwide 
television coverage, carried daily reports and screened footage 
of Africans -- infants, children, and old people -- reduced to 
skeletal forms and left hopeless without any future. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yet another episode also has been witnessed through the mass 
media to a global audience over the last 22 months, particularly 
via television: scenes of the ethnic war in Bosnia linked to 
religion and which pose as a grim reminder with regard to the 
future of mankind. 
  No accomplishment is derived from the ongoing trend of 
conflicts and tragedies. Every time one forgets such incidents, 
he or she is again jolted by what is aired over the television. 
The situation in Bosnia indicates a totally different and 
horrific kind of tragedy. Every time a tragic incident occurs, 
it proves to be more terrifying than the previous ones occuring 
several weeks before. [passage omitted] 
  Take for example the latest incidents. The latest brutality 
occurred after the NATO alliance announced its ultimatum that it 
would bomb Serbian mortar positions if they did not withdraw 
their troops by the 20 February deadline. 
  It comes as no surprise that there is a discrepancy. The 
victims of brutality have, in fact, called for effective action. 
On the one hand, there are brutalities that have claimed lives. 
On the other, we see a failure to take effective decisions. 
Indecision has in turn brought about views and evaluations 
about the existence of double standards as well as ethnic and 
religious discrimination. 
  The problem is not as simple as we might think. We have 
constantly heard about hilly regions, the responsibility of the 
democratic governments, and national interests. Viewing the 
complexity of the problem and its considerations, we will 
definitely not be able to get rid of the views that the practise 
of double standards was employed by the Western nations in 
facing the war in the former Yugoslavia. At least, the Western 
nations do not act as effectively as when facing other issues, 
for example Iraq. Geographically, Bosnia is distant but 
psychologically nearer to several developing nations, including 
Indonesia. Our society has witnessed the brutality through mass 
media on numerous occasions. 
  Our society is also affected by the discrepancy, that is the 
discrepancy concerning the factual reality with regard to the 
brutality and the ambigious and indecisive attitude which all 
point to the practice of double standards. 
  We are disappointed and frustrated from humanitarian and 
religious angles and we are making a contribution in the form of 
a concrete action. This gave rise to the recent registration of 
volunteers to fight in Bosnia. Motivation, enthusiasm, and the 
background should be given prior consideration before any 
further action is undertaken. 
  At least a concrete solidarity statement should be drawn up 
to further consolidate and mobilize public opinion and global 
solidarity for the Bosnians' fate and a strong call toward 
ending the Bosnian conflict in a just procedure. Indonesia's 
permanent representative reported our concerns to the world body 
while waiting for the order for NATO air strikes from UN 
headquarters in New York. As the chairman of the Nonaligned 
Movement, Indonesia is taking an initiative on the possibility 
of holding a conference on the issue of Bosnia. The move by the 
Indonesian representative was a follow-up to the views presented 
by President Suharto during his recent meeting with Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic in Jakarta. 
  Diplomatic measures will be time-consuming. Such measures 
are considered important because they form a realization of 
political attitudes and welfare. The mobilization of public 
opinion and effective solidarity is imperative in the effort 
toward seeking a just settlement to the Bosnian problem and the 
strife against ethnic-cleansing -- whether such an action has to 
be undertaken through diplomatic or military envdeavors. 
Therefore, it is appropriate for Indonesia, as the leader of the 
Nonaligned Movement, to utilize such a platform in its effort to 
end the Bosnian conflict. Such efforts and measures are 
imperative. The Bosnian problem can never be solved even with 
the Serbian withdrawal from their mortar bases.

  [Excerpts] President Suharto, who led a regular cabinet 
meeting on Wednesday, reminded government officials to avoid the 
increase of prices of basic commodities, particularly ahead of 
the Moslem Id-al Fitr holidays. "Market operations must be 
carried out on the right time to maintain price stability of 
basic commodities," Suharto was quoted by Information Minister 
Harmoko as telling the cabinet meeting. 
  The meeting has also reviewed the monetary situation. 
Harmoko said that the inflation rate in February reached 1.76 
percent while in January was 1.25 percent. During the first 
two-months of this year, the inflation rate reached 3.01 percent 
and 6.34 percent from April 1993 to February 1994. Expressing 
his concern over the high inflation rate in February, the 
president urged a balanced supply of basic commodities like 
rice, sugar, and meat on eve of the Id-al Fitr holidays. 
  The meeting also discussed foreign trade balance. The total 
value of exports in December 1993 declined by 4.61 percent 
compared with that of the same month in 1992, while imports in 
January 1994 increased by 3.23 percent compared with that of the 
same period of last year. However, surplus of trade balance in 
December 1993 was over U.S. $548 million. From January to 
December 1993, the surplus of trade balance reached $8.662 
billion. [passage omitted] 
  The president has also given specification on the solution 
of 
outstanding and bad credits. The president has ordered a 
comprehensive probe into the cases. Harmoko said that the 
president ordered the authorities to take tough action against 
those found involved in Bapindo's [Indonesian Development 
Bank's] loan scandal amounting to over Rp. [Rupiah] 1.3 
trillion. The president reminded the national press not to 
blow-up stories about the outstanding credit. "The press have 
the national responsibility because such reports would bring 
negative impacts on banking circle and national economy," 
Suharto was quoted as saying.

<F P=106> [By Maggie Ford in Jakarta] </F>
  [Excerpts] On the East Timor seashore a few kilometres 
from the capital Dili, lies a small new village. Built by the 
Indonesian Army, it is home to 550 people who formerly carved 
out a subsistence life in the mountains. The village is part of 
the army's attempts to win the hearts and minds of the East 
Timorese. It features electricity, safe drinking water, a 
health centre, school, church, and satellite television, foreign 
and local. But despite such efforts to upgrade their living 
conditions, the East Timorese remain far from happy about 
Indonesian rule. 
  "It will take a generation to integrate with Indonesia," 
says 
Marcus Wanandi, an Indonesian Jesuit priest who heads East 
Timor's largest school and the scion of a well-known Sumatera 
family. 
  Indonesia's development spending in the province since it 
took over in 1975 from Portugal has borne some fruit; literacy 
has doubled from only 22 percent in 1980 to 44 percent in 1990. 
From a low of 61 schools under Portuguese rule, there are now 
more than 1,000. But 45 percent of the workforce are unemployed 
or underemployed and skilled people must migrate to find jobs. 
Much-needed investment from the rest of Indonesia is stymied by 
the perceived security problem and from outside because of East 
Timor's disputed status. The United Nations does not recognise 
Indonesia's takeover of the territory in 1975 after Portugal, 
the colonial power, left in a hurry. 
  An even more fundamental problem blocking both development 
and successful integration into Indonesia is what the East 
Timorese see as Indonesia's failure to understand East Timor's 
culture. "Life for us did not begin in 1975," said Florentini 
Sarmento, head of Dili's largest grassroots aid organisation. 
"We have a different identity and a long history. East 
Timorese feel deeply misunderstood and mistreated by Indonesia." 
  Bridging the cultural gap is not made any easier by the loss 
of virtually the entire Timorese educated elite, now resident 
overseas, mainly in Portugal and Australia. Senior Indonesians 
from other areas may find it difficult to believe that the poor 
who remain behind are anything more than an extremely backward 
native ethnic group similar to the many others found in the 
archipelago. [passage omitted] 
  There are now hints, however, that Indonesia is coming to a 
realisation after almost 20 years that the approach used so far 
in trying to integrate East Timor is not very successful. At 
the same time, some formerly hardline Timorese an also willing 
to explore ways of moving forward. The recent discovery of oil 
offshore in the Timor Gap area could spur efforts to improve the 
political climate as it holds out the promise of higher economic 
growth. [passage omitted] But the development of East Timor will 
need to take into account cultural differences far more than is 
normal in Indonesia if it is to be successful. These need not, 
however, be a barrier. Indeed, to a foreign tourist, Timor's 
cultural differences would be seen a an asset, not a burden. 
  If the East Timorese were treated as a potential asset and 
as 
partners in their own development, it is far more likely that 
they would appreciate Indonesia's efforts on their behalf. If 
not, their cultural pride could create major problems for 
Indonesia for some time to come.

<F P=106> [By Maggie Ford in Jakarta] </F>
  [Excerpts] When Megawati Sukarno, daughter of Indonesia's 
first president and now leader of the Indonesia Democratic 
Party, arrived in the troubled Indonesian province of East Timor 
last month, she was met with enthusiasm. 
  The visit came as part of a nationwide tour to introduce the 
party's new leader not only to the public, but also to the 
military commanders who hold such sway in Indonesia's 
underdeveloped eastern regions. 
  It may also have given the East Timorese people hope that 
their problems with the Indonesian Government will be better 
understood. But if Ms. Sukarno's tour does not produce results, 
East Timor can also look for help from another female source -- 
Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, daughter of Indonesia's current 
president. [passage omitted] 
  The first sign that some thing new was in prospect came late 
last year when Ms. Sukarno took afternoon tea at Mrs. Rukmana's 
home. The two ladies, while not estranged, had never before been 
particularly friendly. But a few days before the meeting, Mrs. 
Rukmana had paid a personal visit to the grave of Ms Sukarno's 
father, former president Sukarno, in Blitar, East Java. 
  That visit made it perfectly clear to the political pundits 
that Mrs. Rukmana's father, President Suharto, who took over 
from the late Mr. Sukarno, had no objection to the newly 
announced political plans of his predecessor's daughter. A few 
days later, Ms. Sukarno was installed as elected leader of the 
Indonesia Democratic Party (PDI), the small opposition party 
which had been riven by factionalism, rivalry, and government 
interference for over a year. 
  Ms. Sukarno's rise to the chairmanship signals a potential 
shift in Indonesian politics where power has been concentrated 
in the hands of the Army-backed ruling group Golkar [Functional 
Group], which is also supported by the bureaucracy. 
  It followed the establishment for the first time of a 
civilian leadership in Golkar. At its party conference in 
October, Minister of Information Harmoko took over what had 
previously been a military post. Ms. Sukarno and Mr. Harmoko 
have already clashed, with a preliminary skirmish over Golkar's 
"single majority," under which the ruling group dominates all 
decisionmaking and excludes others from power in the country. 
Ms. Sukarno called for policies which took all public views into 
account, while Mr. Harmoko declared that Golkar's large election 
victories gave it the right to exercise power as the people's 
choice. 
  Meanwhile, the other presidential daughter was displaying 
her 
own intentions to become a political player. Mrs. Rukmana had 
already joined the leadership of Golkar last October when she 
was chosen as a vice chairman of the executive board. Her 
involvement in East Timor diplomacy started late last year when 
she took part in a secret meeting in London to discuss ways to 
seek recognition and reconciliation with Portugal, the former 
colonial power. Mrs. Rukmana has now been installed as chairman 
of the Indonesia-Portugal Friendship Society following the visit 
to Indonesia of retired Portuguese General Carlos Galvao de 
Melo, who will be her cochairman in Portugal. She will return 
the visit shortly. 
  Nor has Mrs. Rukmana restricted her activities to trying to 
help resolve the East Timor problem. Best known as a 
businesswoman in the past, her highway construction company is 
involved in major projects in Indonesia and Malaysia. A 
subsidiary has been set up to manage trade and manufacturing of 
Malaysian cars and Indonesian aircraft. [passage omitted] 
  Political analysts believe it is too early to say precisely 
what Mrs. Rukmana's long-range plans may be. They are also 
unsure of the effect of the rise to prominence of two women in a 
country which has little history of women in public office. But 
they believe that it is hardly surprising given the numerous 
examples of female leaders in other Asian and Muslim countries. 
Especially where a woman politician has a political family 
background, sex need be no bar to successful leadership they 
say. Ms. Sukarno's popularity in her own party and with the 
general public is not in doubt although she is politically 
untested. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo says the trade war 
between the United States and Japan will adversely affect the 
economic recovery program of the Philippines. Interviewed by 
reporters in Manila, Secretary Romulo said the trade war between 
Japan and the United States will likely push Washington to 
reconsider its focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Romulo 
believes that because of its trade rift with Japan, America 
might favor the other regions, like Europe. Last week 
Washington reinstated one of its toughest trade laws, the law 
Super 301 allows U.S. President Bill Clinton to impose punitive 
tariffs of up to 100 percent on a country that obstructs import 
of U.S. products, but Secretary Romulo said he does not believe 
Super 301 will be slapped against the Philippines. The 
Philippines had been placed under the priority watch list of 
trade violators in the past but was delisted after addressing 
U.S. concern.

  [Text] The Department of Trade and Industry has served 
notice that the government will counter attempts to hurt local 
manufacturers if foreign suppliers ship products to the 
Philippines at dumping prices. The mechanism to stop an import 
surge, according to Trade Secretary Rizalino S. Navarro, will be 
activated whenever unscrupulous suppliers injure local producers 
with shipments of competing products at artificially low prices.

here through unfair trade practices," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Navarro said, the import ban he proposed to the 
Monetary Board, policy body at the Central Bank of the 
Philippines late in February 1994 should not be treated as a 
signal that government was going back on its word to force local 
industries to be efficient by making it compete with foreign 
competitors. 
  "I am not going to open that door wider so that everybody is 
protected," he said, dousing cold water on speculations of local 
manufacturers on a government aboutface on its import 
liberalization program. The proposed ban was for a six-month 
period. It will apply on tires, refractory bricks, paper 
products, and glass products. Navarro recommended the temporary 
ban after monitoring showed a surge in imports on these four 
items. 
  Earlier, Sen. Leticia Ramos-Shahani asked the Senate to 
inquire into the reported dumping of foreign articles in the 
country at prices less than their fair market value in 
anticipation of the effectivity of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Philippines is a signatory to the 
GATT whose protocol would be submitted to the Senate for 
ratification. The agreement is set to take effect July 1995. 
  "This dumping would greatly prejudice local manufacturers or 
similar goods because they would find it difficult to 
restructure their capital requirements and update their 
factories, plant facilities, and their inventories," Shahani 
warned. Shahani said that uncontrolled dumping of goods from 
abroad would impair the ability of Philippine industries to 
compete in the world market. 
  President Ramos and the senators led by Senate President 
Edgardo J. Angara, in their third regular Tuesday breakfast 
meeting this week agreed to ask Trade Secretary Rizalino Navarro 
to create a panel of Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) 
experts to provide accurate data on the GATT which would help 
senators understand the complexities of the international 
agreement.

  [Text] The Philippines and Thailand yesterday concluded 
the first round of talks of a joint committee on bilateral 
cooperation which led to agreements on the establishment of 
business cooperation councils, countertrade arrangements, an 
exchange of trade and investment priority lists, and an 
investments guarantee accord to strengthen economic ties between 
the two countries. 
  In a press conference, Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto 
Romulo and Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri also agreed on 
a "joint approach" to trade and commodity issues in 
international forums such as the GATT and the ASEAN Free Trade 
Area (AFTA), apparently to set an example for other ASEAN 
countries in adopting a unified stand. 
  On political issues, Prasong told reporters that Thailand 
and 
the Philippines had agreed to support the move to include 
Myanmar [Burma] in the Asean Ministers Meeting in July, despite 
reservations by other member states due to the country's human 
rights record. Prasong said that as head of the ASEAN Standing 
Committee, his consultations with other ASEAN leaders on the 
issue had been "positive." He, however, refused to divulge 
details of his consultative meetings. 
  During the 1 to 4 March talks of the Philippine-Thailand 
Joint Commission at the Manila Hotel, both countries agreed to 
establish business cooperation councils in their capital cities, 
to facilitate investments and joint ventures.

  [Text] More than $1.4 billion in foreign funds came into 
the country as portfolio investments in 1993. Bangko Sentral ng 
Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] (BSP) statistics 
showed that bulk of the foreign capital was lodged in the 
equities markets. This capital placements fuelled the bull run 
in the domestic stock market in 1993, particularly during the 
later months. 
  Out of the $1 429 billion, about $808.632 million or 56.59 
percent, was invested in stocks, mostly of commercial and 
industrial listed companies. The balance was invested in banks, 
which included registered bank deposits of non-residents, 
government securities paper, utility and investment and finance 
firms. 
  Of the commercial and industrial classifications, a sizable 
amount, around $468.795 million, went to buy shares of listed 
telecommunications companies. This amount push the shares of 
Philippines Long Distance Co. last year as the highest gainer in 
the stock market. [passage omitted] 
  BSP said that these foreign funds lodged in the local 
bourses 
put the country in the international map as among the emerging 
stock markets in the region. As has been reported, the country's 
stock market registered the best ever performance in the recent 
years with a record high of 150 percent growth in 1993. Trading 
in both bourses were heavy particularly during the last days of 
December, posting at one time the highest turnover of P4.26 
billion [Philippine pesos].

the New People's Army (NPA) in the Bicol region, Quezon, and 
other parts of southern Luzon, Brig. Gen. Regino Lacson, 
Southern Luzon Command (Solcom) chief reported yesterday. 
  Lacson said that six guerrilla fronts of the NPA controlled 
533 barangays in the three zones last year, adding that these 
controlled barangays were key "promotion" areas for the NPAs. 
From these barangays, rebels took "taxation money," rice, 
livestock, and vegetable crops for their maintenance, Lacson 
said. They were the single, most important source of income for 
the rebel movement in the three zones, he added.

  [Text] Camp Martillana, Pili, Camarines Sur -- The military 
has dismantled the biggest underground group of the Communist 
Party of the Philippines-National Democratic Front-New People's 
Army (CPP- NDF-NPA), it was reported. The group was called the 
Southern Luzon Commission (SLC) which covered 15 provinces, 12 
cities, and at least 140 municipalities. 
  With the dismantling of the big rebel organization, its 
three 
regional party committees and six armed guerrilla fronts have to 
report directly to the 16-man national communist party central 
committee headed by self-exiled CPP Chairman Jose Ma. Sison. The 
dismantling of the SLC was revealed to newsmen by Brig. Gen. 
Regino Lacson, Southern Luzon Command (Solcom) officer-in-charge. 
  In a report to Defense Secretary Renato de Villa, AFP [Armed 
Forces of the Philippines] Chief of Staff Gen. Lisandro Abadia, 
and Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, commanding general of the Army, 
Lacson said that the dismantling of the big rebel organization 
came about as a result of military-orchestrated events and 
tactical campaigns in the Southern Tagalog Region, and the Bicol 
Region. 
  The campaigns, he said, left a big void in the rebel 
organization's leadership caused by mass defections and death in 
encounters of top NDF leaders, NPA field commanders and armed 
regulars. 
  The Solcom chief reported that four armed terrorist groups 
-- 
the Apolonio Mendoza Agbay, and the "A-A" and "Daba" companies 
of the mobile regional guerrilla unit (MRGU) and the urban 
guerrilla command of the SLC -- were finally crushed by military 
intelligence operatives and field troops who waged relentless 
search-pursue-and-destroy operations. 
  In Bicol, the NPA's Regional Operational Command (ROC), the 
Regional Educational and Cultural Committee, the Front Mass 
Action Committee, and the Revolutionary Agrarian Staff of the 
Camarines Sur West Guerrilla Front and the Regional NDF United 
Front Commission had been disbanded and dissolved, he said. 
  Also dissolved were the Caltex Military Sector of the 
Quezon-Bicol Zone Front Committee and the Front Guerrilla Unit 
"Aguila" in Masbate, he said. 
  The Quezon-Bicol Zone Front Committee, which used to have 
four district committees under it -- the Quirino, Onofre de 
Mesa, Mercedes and Guijo Committee -- now operates only in 
Camarines Norte, Lacson added.

  [Text] Camp Vicente Lim, Calamba, Laguna -- Some 50 armed 
men believed to be New People's Army (NPA) rebels killed 
yesterday two policemen and wounded two others during an ambush 
in Macalelon, Quezon yesterday morning. 
  Reports reaching Philippine National Police (PNP) Recom 
[Regional Command] 4 Director Chief Supt. Romeo O. Odi 
identified the fatalities as SPO4 [expansion unknown] Richard 
Villena and P02 [expansion unknown] Ruben Hutalla, and those 
wounded as P03 Bienvenido Sayson and Quezon 3d Police District 
Director Chief Inspector Benjamin Belarmino. 
  In Fort Del Pilar in Baguio City, meanwhile, Defense 
Secretary Renato S. De Villa ruled out the possibility of an 
extension on the three-year term of Gen. Lisandro C. Abadia who 
is scheduled to retire on 12 April as Chief of Staff of the 
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). 
  De Villa said that the defense department will submit before 
12 March the final list of senior military officers who are 
candidates to become the next highest official of the AFP. 
Military sources said that among those recommended were Lt. Gen. 
Arturo T. Enrile, Army chief; Lt. Gen. Thelmo Cunanan, Southern 
Command chief; Vice Admiral Virgilio Marcelo, Navy chief; and, 
Major Gen. Alfredo Filler, presently assigned at the Department 
of National Defense. 
  Enrile, a member of PMA [Philippine Military Academy] class 
62 who played a vital role in the December 1989 failed coup 
attempt, is considered the most senior among the candidates. 
Cunanan, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, 
is scheduled to retire on 14 April. Belarmino, who was slightly 
wounded and earlier reported as missing and believed to have 
been taken hostage by the rebels, reported to his superiors an 
hour after the ambush later and joined PNP and military 
operatives in chasing the rebels. 
  Also leading the government operations against the fleeing 
rebels, who are described as young men and women, are Quezon PNP 
Director Supt. Edmundo Dizon and Army Lt. Col. Domingo 
Panganiban of the 31st Infantry Battalion of the Southern Luzon 
Command (SOLCOM).

  [Text] Cambodia has reiterated its readiness for the 
formation of a Thai-Cambodian parliamentary club as proposed by 
house speaker Marut Bunnak. The issue was raised for discussion 
early this week when Cambodian National Assembly chairman Chea 
Sim met Mr. Marut at Parliament. He is visiting Thailand at the 
invitation of the house speaker. 
  Mr. Marut says the formation of the Thai-Cambodian 
parliamentary club will be raised for discussion at the upcoming 
joint meeting of Thai, Lao, Cambodian, and Vietnamese 
parliamentarians to be held from 27 to 29 March in Bangkok. He 
says the setting up of the club will create a better 
understanding between the Thai and Cambodian peoples. It is 
also expected to help solve border and trade problems that may 
arise between them. 
  Mr. Marut says Thai parliamentarians have given good 
cooperation in the project. Thailand has already set up similar 
clubs with the (?circles) of other countries.

  [Text] Indonesia has cut tariffs on 1,941 products this 
year under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) agreement, but 
Thailand will benefit from only 8 percent of them, Thai 
officials say. Business Economics Department deputy 
director-general Khanitson Nawanukok said the conclusion was 
reached after an evaluation of the Indonesian tariff reduction 
program that was implemented on January 8. 
  He said the department found that Thailand is theoretically 
qualified to enjoy the preferential AFTA rates for 69 percent of 
the 1,941 items because it has already cut its tariffs on those 
items to 20 percent or lower, the condition required for AFTA 
members to be eligible to utilise the benefits of other 
countries' tariff cuts. But Thailand would benefit from cuts to 
only 8 percent of the products because most of the cuts were 
granted to items which Indonesia does not import from Thailand, 
he said. Indonesian imports from Thailand accounted for only 1.3 
percent of total Indonesian imports in 1992. 
  Mr Khanitson said the items on which Thailand would 
immediately receive benefits were rice milling machinery and 
liquid measuring equipment of which Indonesia imported 33 
million baht from Thailand in 1992. He said there were some 
items which Indonesia imported of significant value from 
Thailand but Thailand did not receive benefits from the tariff 
cuts because the Thai tariff rate was still high, such as 
cardboard and mineral water for which Thailand has tariffs of 40 
percent and 45 percent respectively. Indonesia imported 
cardboard from Thailand worth 57 million baht and mineral water 
worth 25 million baht in 1992. 
  Other Thai products which Indonesia imports huge amounts of, 
such as nylon synthetic yarn and machinery, did not receive 
tariff cuts. Indonesia plans to reduce the tariff on these 
products in 1995-96. 
  Mr. Khanitson said Singapore and Brunei benefitted from 100 
percent of the Indonesian tariff cuts, compared to 70 percent 
for Malaysia and 58 percent for the Philippines.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday insisted the 
Government would continue to administer the country 
"righteously" despite calls from a prominent academic and 
opposition leader for him to dissolve Parliament or resign. 
Those calling for a dissolution or Mr Chuan's resignation cited 
the Government's poor performance and erosion of public faith. 
  "I have always said this Government was elected and comes 
from the people," said Mr Chuan. "This Government is lawful 
because it is elected by the people. This Government has a 
majority elected by the people. This Government works according 
to its policy declared to Parliament. It has never done 
anything that is not in line with its policy. Therefore, this 
Government has righteousness to continue its work." 
  Mr Chuan was brushing aside strong criticisms of him by 
political academic and critic M.R. [Royal title] Sukhumphan 
Boriphat and Social Action Party [SAP] leader Montri Phongphanit 
who claimed the Government had failed in its administration and 
the people had grown tired of it due to its lack of achievements. 
  The Prime Minister said any party or individual had the 
right 
to criticise a government under democratic rule but the 
government also has the right to clarify those points which are 
not true. "They should not get angry when we make our points in 
response. It should not be like that," he said. 
  Mr Chuan said democratic rule gave the people many 
alternatives to protest the national administration. First, they 
can revile it without fear of any danger. Second, the people 
have the chance to make up for mistakes by not voting for a bad 
government again. 
  Mr Chuan appeared to pay no heed to Mr Montri's claims that 
the public had grown tired of his administration as reflected in 
the low voter turnout for the Bangkok city and district council 
elections on Sunday. He said there was nothing new in Mr 
Montri's comments. "No matter whether there is an election or 
not, he always says the same thing. He said this both before 
and after the elections." 
  The Phalang Tham Party, which controlled a majority of 49 of 
the 57 seats in the City Council after the last election in 
1990, saw the number of its city councillors shrink to 23 of the 
new 55-seat City Council. Mr Chuan's Democrat Party captured 
seven seats, six more than previously. The Opposition, however, 
can boast the results of the elections were a big victory for it 
since the Prachakhon Thai Party managed to win 19 seats, 13 more 
than in 1990, while the SAP took five seats, which Mr Montri 
said was beyond his expectations. 
  The SAP leader, delighted by the increase in popularity for 
his party, challenged the Prime Minister to resign. But Mr Chuan 
chose to ignore Mr Montri's comments about public 
dissatisfaction with his government. "I have heard that comment 
but would rather not say anything in return." he said. 
  The Prime Minister was also attacked recently by M.R. 
Sukhumphan who said he was disappointed with Mr Chuan and had 
lost all hope for his government. 
M.R. Sukhumphan claimed Mr Chuan who always played an 
outstanding role in keeping alive democratic thoughts before 
becoming prime minister, had already changed and "kept his 
ideologies in the drawer". The academic said the Premier did 
nothing except make sure the government could "survive" day by 
day. He also charged Mr Chuan with lacking the courage to solve 
national problems and of possessing pessimistic attitudes and 
fears about obstacles in everything he has to do. M.R. 
Sukhumphan said the best exit for the current political 
situation was for Mr Chuan to dissolve Parliament and call a 
general election. 
  Meanwhile, Phalang Tham Party spokesman Sutham Saengprathum 
also hit out at Mr Chuan yesterday, charging him with allowing 
himself to be come a tool of the bureaucrats and foregoing the 
chance to take the lead in amending the Constitution. "The 
present Government is no different from the Chatchai Chunhawan 
Government because it just plays around with principles and 
figures to create false hopes for the people," claimed the 
Nakhon Si Thammarat MP. 
  He said public confidence in the present administration was 
eroding quickly even though it had many prominent politicians 
who were seen as capable of solving the people's problems. It is 
a pity that these politicians, after assuming office, have 
worked on bureaucrats' directives and become their tool, he 
said. Mr Sutham said the people were losing hope in the 
Government even though they wanted very much to give it more 
time.

  [Summary] A locomotive was damaged when it hit a mine 
planted on a bridge between the Hat Yai and Chana rail stations. 
The locomotive was on its way to pull a train with a load of 
rock from Chana back to Hat Yai. The incident took place at 0506 
today in Ban Thung Phra, Tambon Paching, Chana District, 
Songkhla Province, only three kilometers from the Chana station. 
The explosion damaged the front of the locomotive and the 
tracks. The driver and engineer were unhurt. 
  Authorities found two letters from the PULO [Pattani United 
Liberation Organization], one written in southern dialect and 
the other in Thai, claiming responsibility for the incident. 
They want the government explain the motive behind the recent 
torching of schools in the south which, they said, was not the 
work of the PULO.

  [Text] The prime minister, Paul Keating, has accused the 
United States of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut in its 
trade dispute with Japan. The United States has reintroduced 
its so-called Super 301 policy where it can double tariffs on 
some commodities in a bid to get Japan to open its markets. 
Speaking in Perth, Mr. Keating urged the two parties to allow 
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, APEC, to resolve 
the dispute. The prime minister says Canberra is concerned that 
America's action will harm Australia's relationship with Japan. 
  [Begin Keating recording] It is the heavy-handed 
sledgehammer 
number to crack the nut. Now, we think that is going to lead to 
a lot of bilateral trade tensions and that is why, I think, that 
we see the body which I was involved in last year in 
establishing at the head of government level -- this is the 
APEC, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -- this trade argument 
between the United States and Japan is a sitter for resolution 
within the APEC framework. [end recording]

not be fought at Australia's expense. Senator McMullan is 
expected to join trade talks with the American Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher in Canberra later today. His 
unscheduled attendance has been prompted by Washington's threat 
to use a trade clause allowing special sanctions on trading 
partners using unfair practices. Camille Funnell reports 
Senator McMullan has already moved to make his concern clear to 
the United States. 
  [Funnell] Australia is concerned Washington will strike a 
side deal with Japan at the expense of countries like Australia. 
Senator McMullan claims the U.S. has a history of hurting third 
parties in resolving its disputes with other countries. He's 
told American television there's no country in the world that 
supports the approach being used by the U.S. with Japan, 
although, he says, there's sympathy with America's wish to open 
up the Japanese market. 
  But Senator McMullan also says there's no sign the U.S. 
wants 
to do anything to appease Australian concerns about American 
markets which remain closed to Australia. Senator McMullan is 
also warning against any action that's likely to reduce Japan's 
economic recovery, saying if the world's biggest economy doesn't 
recover all countries will lose.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Australia has called on the 
United States to maintain China's most favored nation trade 
privileges. Speaking after talks with Mr. Christopher, 
Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said he shared 
Washington's concern at the detention and harassment of Chinese 
dissidents. Senator Evans said protesting at this was not a 
matter of interfering in China's internal affairs or applying 
Western standards. But Senator Evans said Australia was against 
trade sanctions, except in extreme circumstances and supported 
continued privileges for China under the MFN scheme. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Christopher has repeated an assurance that 
Washington does not intend its trade dispute with Japan to do 
harm to Australia. He gave the reassurance after talks in 
Canberra with Senator Evans and the trade minister, Senator Bob 
McMullan. Camille Funnell reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Funnell] The U.S. secretary of state told 
the Australians it was not the intention of the U.S. to start a 
trade war with Japan, but he repeated that America wanted 
greater access to the Japanese market. He says Australia should 
take heart about American assurances from the track record of 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. [passage omitted] Senator Evans 
says Australia still has legitimate concerns about the approach 
taken by the U.S. toward Japan and will continue to express its 
concern. [end recording]

  [Text] Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans and his wife 
will soon visit Vietnam at the invitation of the Vietnamese 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. We bring you a review of 
recent development in relations between Vietnam and Holland. 
  It is the first visit to Vietnam by the Dutch foreign 
minister. His visit will contribute to strengthening cooperative 
relations between the two countries in all areas. The leaders 
can consider future cooperation. 
  Vietnam and Holland have had established diplomatic 
relations 
since 1973, but with some interruptions. However, by late of 
1993, Holland decided to reopen its embassy in Vietnam. Many 
delegations from the two countries have exchanged visits over 
the past few years. Holland has developed many goodwill 
attitude to Vietnam [as heard]. At the Paris Conference, Holland 
was one of the countries which agreed to prolong the time for 
Vietnam to pay its debt over a 30 year period. The two 
countries have initiated an agreement on investment 
encouragement and protection. Vietnam and Holland have also 
concluded agreements on air transport and on river and sea 
dredging. Holland has a number of projects in Vietnam involving 
cooperation and investment. They have effectively cooperated in 
the field of health care. Now, they are hoping to cooperate in 
infrastructure building. Although Holland ranks the ninth among 
the investors in Vietnam, by now it has the 10 investment 
projects in Vietnam capitalized at $218 million, including the 
joint venture in oil and gas exploration, and another joint 
venture in producing Heineken Beer. 
  With existing relations, the visit to Vietnam this time of 
the Dutch foreign minister will surely be a landmark in 
relations between the two countries that help bring bilateral 
relations to a new level. 
  The Vietnamese people want to welcome this visit to Vietnam 
of the Dutch foreign minister and his wife, and wish it a 
success.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 9 -- Dutch Minister for Foreign 
Affairs Peter Kooijmans and his wife arrived here this 
afternoon, beginning an official friendship visit to Vietnam as 
guest of Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. The Dutch guests 
were welcomed by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and his wife, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien and other senior 
officials. Dutch Ambassador to Vietnam Mr. Dave Ader was also on 
hand. 
  This evening, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and his wife 
gave a reception in honour of the Dutch guests. On this 
occasion the Army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN runs an article 
expressing the Vietnamese Government and people's gratitude to 
the Dutch Government and people for their support to the 
national construction in Vietnam, especially their humanitarian 
aid in various healthcare projects for the Vietnamese people. 
`The Dutch Government and non- governmental organisations have 
granted help to Vietnam's healthcare and education under various 
forms: financial and technical assistance, and donation. The 
Dong Ha hospital in the central province of Quang Tri was built 
with Dutch assistance. In addition, a number of healthcare 
programmes such as malaria, TB, leprosy, immunisation, drinking 
water have also received assistance from the Netherlands. 
Together with its assistance to the Amsterdam High School in 
Hanoi, the Dutch Government has granted scholarships for 
hundreds of Vietnamese students to study in the Netherlands. In 
1993 alone it gave vietnam some USD 20 million as aid, not 
accounting the assistance through the European Community and 
various UN bodies. `The Netherlands also decided to exempt 
Vietnam's debt service payment which was worth about USD 1.4 
million, and was one of the countries who agreed to delay 
Vietnam's time of payment for its arrears at the donors' 
conference on Vietnam in Paris last year. At present, the 
Netherlands ranks ninth among foreign investors in Vietnam with 
a capital totalling more than USD 283 million, and is the second 
largest EC country which is carrying out ever broadening 
investment in the country. The paper also recalls the 
Netherlands growing cooperation with Vietnam in many fields, 
i.e. oil and gas, air service, harbour building and enlarging, 
water management, food processing industry which have led to the 
signing in 1993 of the Vietnamese-Dutch agreement on investment 
encouragement and protection and of the establishment of the 
Vietnamese-Dutch dredge joint venture.

<F P=106> [Last installment of an article by Political Bureau member </F>
Vu Oanh: "Great National Unity in the New Situation and Tasks"] 
  [Text] For overseas Vietnamese, we must help develop their 
capabilities through the exploitation of results attained in the 
renovation at home. Efforts must be made to diversify our 
international relations activities. The overseas Vietnamese is 
an important force that can introduce our country to the nations 
of the world. 
  We must on the one hand, organize overseas Vietnamese and 
urge them to help propagate our market economy and promote 
tourism in Vietnam in their country of residence. We must also 
invite scientists and business management specialists to visit 
our country (on various occasions and in various forms, 
including the possibility of joining our state agencies). 
  We must strive to create favorable conditions for overseas 
Vietnamese to visit their homeland and invest in production and 
business at home for their benefit and that of the nation. There 
are some sectors and localities where residents have a large 
number of relatives living abroad. In this case, efforts should 
be made to set up a liaison committee or an association of 
relatives of overseas Vietnamese to keep them well informed 
about state lines and policies, while conveying their relatives' 
aspirations to mass organizations or the administration. 
Efforts must be made to encourage relatives of overseas 
Vietnamese to further their studies or work abroad. 
  The state should do its best to protect the interest of 
overseas Vietnamese in accordance with international law, while 
encouraging them to strengthen unity, help one another, and 
uphold national prestige. 
  2. Efforts must be made to broaden democracy while 
maintaining social discipline. 
  Under our current politico-social system, the party leads, 
the state manages, and the people are masters. Thus, all powers 
belong to the people. 
  In exercising their powers, the people are building the 
state 
apparatus through general elections. On the other hand, they 
have the obligation of participating in formulating state laws, 
monitoring activities of the state, serving the nation, and 
living and working in accordance with the law. This is the 
dialectical relationship between representative democracy and 
direct democracy. This relationship helps broaden democracy, 
while strengthening social discipline. 
  We must live and work in accordance with the law. However, 
the law alone cannot resolve all issues in the daily life, which 
is full of complicated social problems. As a result, while 
formulating various laws we must develop our social mechanism 
and promote the people's rights to autonomy in managing the 
family, ward, village, and community activities to improve their 
daily life and to settle social issues through social contracts. 
At the grass-roots level, we should set up a conciliation 
council to help the chief of the village or ward, the people's 
committee, and mass organizations to resolve issues. This 
council should be composed of people with good educational 
backgrounds and who are trusted by the people. 
  To broaden democracy and strengthen law and discipline, 
there 
must be consistent efforts to disseminate state laws widely. 
Efforts must also be made to attach importance to disseminating 
the law on civil and human rights so that people will realize 
their obligations. At the same time, this is to arm the people 
with the knowledge to fight civil and human rights violations. 
Essential efforts must be made to clearly specify the authority 
and responsibility of heads of state agencies in accordance with 
the principle that the more authority an officer holds, the more 
responsibility he must bear. We must strive to oppose the 
usurpation of power and uphold the principle of checks and 
balances of power and responsibility. We must make more effort 
to study, perfect, and revise the law on electing and appointing 
heads of state agencies to overcome negative phenomena such as 
formalistic democracy, arbitrariness, and disorganized freedom. 
  We may exercise national power by convening a national 
congress comprising of authorized delegates with a good 
background, who are trustworthy, and who represent the people's 
strata, nationalities, and religious groups to discuss the most 
important national issues. This will be like the Dien Hong 
Congress under the Tran Dynasty or the special political 
conference of President Ho Chi Minh during the war against the 
U.S. 
  3. Efforts must be made to overcome prejudice, 
discrimination, and hatred among the people and to look to the 
future to strengthen national unity and uphold the spirit of 
mutual trust for the sake of national independence and freedom 
and happiness of the people. 
  The achievements of our renovation have helped us to 
effectively implement the market-based multisectorial economy 
under state management and to diversify our diplomatic 
activities. It is natural that we must advance further to 
establish the great national unity bloc in the new situation and 
tasks to strengthen unity among the masses in a more profound 
and far-reaching way. 
  It is necessary to say that the Vietnamese nation has a 
great 
social structure comprising various strata, nationalities, and 
religious groups living both at home and abroad. Although they 
come from different backgrounds, have different levels of 
education and capabilities, and different tastes and 
experiences, they originate from Vietnam, a nation with a 
longstanding and heroic history. The enemy's war of aggression 
that caused untold misery and loss to Vietnam has imbued in the 
heart of all Vietnamese the spirit of patriotism and pride in 
their fatherland. At present, our country is enjoying new 
opportunities while facing numerous ordeals affecting our 
national fate and destiny. 
  As Vietnamese, we all want our country to grasp 
opportunities to overcome difficulties, poverty, and 
backwardness and develop itself into a prosperous nation with a 
due position in the world community. None of us want our 
country to remain underdeveloped forever. Therefore, the 
above-mentioned goals must be included in the great national 
unity policy. Let's share similarities and accept differences. 
Let's try to get rid of prejudices, complexes, and hatred and 
work toward the goals of building a beautiful country both for 
the present and future generations. To this end, we must, first 
of all, promote the spirit of genuine concord, equality, and 
mutual respect. Let's avoid criticism, disparagement, and 
harsh treatment and renounce attempts to eliminate one another. 
It is necessary to respect the people's beliefs and protect 
their places of worship. It is important to keep the components 
of the great national unity bloc within the people's mastership 
system. If there are different political beliefs, let's sit 
down and talk in a sensible and reasonable way. Let's exercise 
dictatorship only over those who betray the country or violate 
the law and let's make sure that their cases are tried according 
to set court procedures. Leading officials in charge of state 
agencies, mass societies, and front organizations must be 
selected through truly democratic elections and must include 
people who have ethics and talents and who truly represent the 
masses. 
  4. It is necessary for the Vietnam Fatherland Front to shift 
its duty from national liberation to national defense and 
construction, bearing in mind the need to give priority to 
socioeconomic development tasks. From 1994 till the end of the 
20st century, we must focus on the following four key tasks: 
  -- Motivating all individuals, families, and the entire 
people to make personal efforts to overcome poverty and 
backwardness, effect changes for the better, and compete against 
and cooperate with one another in the spirit of fairness. 
  Steps must be taken to promote the multisectorial economy 
based on the market mechanism and under state management. It is 
necessary to effect economic restructuring in the direction of 
industrialization and modernization and in keeping with efforts 
to expand, diversify, and multilateralize diplomatic relations. 
  -- Paying due attention to the human resources development, 
regarding the human factor not only as the target of but also 
the motive behind the formulation of socioeconomic development 
programs and public utility projects to benefit the country and 
people. It is necessary to make due efforts to broaden 
democracy, implement social justice, and ameliorate the people's 
intellectual background and living conditions. Steps must be 
taken to improve the quality of cultural, educational, and 
public healthcare services. Effective measures must be adopted 
to implement the population activities and family planning 
program. 
  -- Creating preliminary conditions and opportunities for 
everyone to overcome poverty and backwardness and enrich 
themselves and society. These goals can be reached through the 
granting of the land use rights to peasants and the application 
of the share-holding system to workers. It is necessary for the 
banking system to intensify the mobilization of funds to grant 
sufficient loans to the people to increase economic activities. 
Long-term incentive measures must be worked out to make all 
economic sectors have a sense of security while investing 
talents and capital in production and business activities. It 
is important to encourage all individuals and families to enrich 
themselves and help make the country powerful and bring about 
justice and civilization in society through the movement to 
eliminate hunger and reduce poverty. 
  It is necessary to motivate the people to participate in the 
campaign against corruption, smuggling, the production of fake 
goods, and other negative phenomenon in society. Greater 
attention must be paid to charity work, humanitarian activities, 
and the movement to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty. 
  Vigorous efforts must be made to step up educational 
activities and improve everyone's cultural and professional 
knowledge. Regular refresher courses must be conducted to help 
the people improve their scientific, technological, 
professional, economic, cultural, and educational backgrounds. 
  It is important to promote the cultural quintessence of the 
nation and combine this move with efforts to learn from the 
cultural heritages of mankind. Prompt steps must be worked out 
to gain access to modern science and technology. Measures must 
be taken to preserve and restore cultural relics as well as 
oppose the depletion or pollution of the environment. 
  -- Greater attention must be paid to the consolidation of 
the 
all-people national defense network and the people's security 
system. 
  The above-mentioned tasks have been initiated and directed 
by 
party platforms, directives, and resolutions as well as by state 
laws and regulations. All those legal documents cannot generate 
practical results unless we take into account the strength of 
the great national unity bloc. The Vietnam Fatherland Front 
plays an important role because it solicits the views of the 
people and incorporate them in the formulation of party policies 
and lines as well as state laws and regulations. 
  IV. Consolidating and broadening the Vietnam Fatherland 
Front. 
  The Vietnam Fatherland Front is a political alliance which 
serves as a venue for mass organizations and representatives of 
people of all walks of life and different social classes, ethnic 
groups, and religions to unite action on a voluntary basis. It 
also serves as the political basis of the people's 
administration and is directed by the Communist Party of Vietnam. 
  All those components form an overall network of party 
leadership, state management, and people's mastery under the 
political system of our regime. They share one thing in common, 
namely to work toward the goals of national defense and 
construction. Each component is part and parcel of an overall 
structure but plays a separate role and generates a different 
result. 
  1. In its capacity both as an affiliated organization and a 
managing organ, the party cannot consolidate the front's 
structure or develop its role as a genuine mass society unless 
it observes truly democratic principles governing its leaderhip 
and refrains itself from impositions or taking over the work of 
mass organizations. 
  The party exerts its leadership through its platforms and 
lines and policies as well as through the power of persuasion 
created by the examplary conduct and vanguard role of party 
organizations and party members in the front. It is necessary 
to fully respect the independence and self-rule of the Vietnam 
Fatherland Front. The party may introduce its platforms and 
lines and policies to the front or recommend party members to 
join the front's management but is not supposed to give 
instructions to the front or have party members joint the 
front's management without going through democratic elections. 
  It is necessary for cadres and party members to clearly 
realize the importance of the front-related policies and tasks. 
Efforts must be made to avoid incorrect views, especially the 
bad practice of belittling front-related work, and the evils of 
prejudices and narrow-mindedness. Steps must be taken to 
overcome the situation in which party officials resort to 
imposition in assigning cadres to take charge of the front 
without checking if their qualifications meet work requirements. 
It is important to formulate proper policies toward cadres in 
charge of the front. Efforts are needed to overcome 
shortcomings and weaknesses, thereby improving the party's 
leadership over the front a step further. 
  2. It is necessary for state agencies to fully understand 
and 
institutionalize the duties and rights of the front, so that it 
can act as a firm political basis of the people's 
administration, and most importantly, can participate in the 
process of forming elected organs, drafting legal documents, 
managing socioeconomic activities, and overseeing the operations 
of state organs, elected government officials, and state cadres 
and employees. It is necessary for state agencies to go out of 
their way to join hands with front committees at all levels in 
ensuring strict implementation of the Constitution and laws and 
regulations. 
  3. It is important to consolidate the Vietnam Fatherland 
Front and broaden its organizations and activities. This is for 
it to serve as an effective venue for rallying people from all 
walks of life in the great national unity bloc, where everyone 
can show demomstrate their power and express their aspirations 
and where members of the affiliated organizations can achieve 
unanamity of action and help the administration in resolving the 
internal disputes among people, implementing democracy, making 
improvements in society, looking after and protecting the 
legitimate interests of people of all walks of life, and 
building and safeguarding the administration as well as 
overseeing its activities. The front is dutybound to take part 
in socioeconomic management, help with the implementation of 
socioeconomic development and national security and defense 
tasks, and motivate mass organizations to participate in the 
struggle against corruption, smuggling, and other social vices, 
thereby contributing to strengthening relations between the 
people and the party and state. 
  The front operates in the spirit of consultation, democracy, 
equality, sincere cooperation, mutual respect, and unanimity of 
action with all affiliated organizations under a common action 
program. 
  Plans must be worked out to consolidate the front committees 
at all levels, bearing in mind the need to improve the quality 
of leading cadres. It is important to see to it that more 
trustworthy and highly-competent individuals representing people 
from all walks of life and different ethnic groups, religious 
beliefs, intellectual backgrounds, and business circles join the 
front and form a highly motivated collective, which is endowed 
with cultural quintessence, wisdom, talents, and high resolve 
and which typically stands for the vitality of a country now 
moving toward progress. 
  The front committees at all levels play a key role in 
coordinating action among the front's affiliated organizations 
and administrative organs at the same level and in launching a 
motivation campaign to win the hearts and minds of senior 
citizens, notables, intellectuals, industrialists, businessmen, 
hilltribes, religious leaders, and Vietnamese residents abroad. 
  As far the consolidation and broadening of the front's 
organizations and activities are concerned, it is necessary to 
focus on both grass-roots and central level establishments and 
step up the front's public relations. 
  4. The relations between the VFF and the party and state are 
built upon the common goals of making the people rich and the 
country powerful as well as of bringing about justice and 
civilization in society. They follow a two-way course of 
action, namely the leadership and its objects. Moreover, they 
are based on the principles of equality, consultation, dialogue, 
and constructive criticism. 
  The endeavors to consolidate the great national unity bloc 
and the National United Front are strategically important to the 
overall political system and necessitate the common efforts of 
all echelons and sectors. It is necessary to first disseminate 
the contents of this resolution to all party organs, state 
agencies, front organizations, and mass societies. 
  We are convinced that the Political Bureau's Resolution on 
Great National Unity and Consolidation of the National United 
Front will create an atmosphere of concord, mutual trust, 
enthusiasm, and national pride among people of all walks of 
life, social classes, ethnic groups, and religious organizations 
at home as well as among Vietnamese residents abroad, and also a 
new strength for the goals of making the people rich and the 
country powerful and of bringing about justice and civilization 
in society come true.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- A senior trade ministry 
official on Wednesday [9 March] played down the latest U.S. move 
on invocation of the "Super 301" trade provision. 
  "The action does not represent a significant meaning for 
Japan," he said. 
  The comment came after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor said Tuesday that the office of the United States Trade 
Representative (USTR) is considering eight trade areas in which 
Japan may be the target of retaliation under Super 301. 
  The official from the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI), who declined to be identified, said the eight 
areas must have been chosen from findings in an annual USTR 
survey on global trading practices released a year ago. 
  Under the revived Super 301 law, the U.S. will list trade 
practices deemed unfair to U.S. products, using findings from 
the national trade estimate report set for release at the end of 
March. Washington would then have until September 30 to single 
out priority countries engaged in unfair trading. 
  Trade categories being named in the upcoming USTR report are 
not automatically subject to sanctions under Super 301, the 
official said. 
  The eight named are the insurance, lumber, paper products, 
flat glass, computers, supercomputers, telecommunications 
equipment and medical products markets. 
  On four-point market-opening measures to be released by 
Japan 
at the end of March, the MITI official said the package will be 
divided into two areas -- one ready for immediate enforcement 
and the other coming under further study for implementation. 
  The package will feature deregulation, import and investment 
promotion, competition policy and reforms in the government 
procurement process. He declined to give further details such 
as which areas would be given immediate enforcement.

  [Text] Washington, March 8 KYODO -- U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor denied Tuesday [8 March] that the 
United States has sought Japanese assurances to increase the 
market share of a U.S.-developed cellular phone system in Japan 
according to prearranged growth projections. 
  KYODO NEWS SERVICE reported Monday that the U.S. has 
proposed 
using "numerical indicators" that would give the cellular system 
developed and built by Motorola Inc. an additional 240,000 
subscribers after one year in the Tokyo and Nagoya areas. 
  "That report is erroneous," Kantor said. 
  Kantor, responding to a reporter's question, said the U.S. 
has not sought more Motorola cellular subscribers by the 
business trend line the U.S. firm has established elsewhere in 
Japan. 
  The Motorola system, which signed up 12,900 cellular 
subscribers in the Tokyo and Nagoya areas after two years in 
service, has 438,000 subscribers elsewhere in the country, 
mostly in the Kansai area, after four years in operation. 
  Kantor has accused Tokyo of violating a 1989 trade accord 
that promises "comparable access" to Motorola in the Japanese 
market and has vowed to impose sanctions against Japan if no 
settlement is reached through negotiations. 
  While denying the U.S. has sought trend line sales targets, 
Kantor declined to discuss whether other types of numerical 
targets are in the U.S. proposal on grounds that negotiations 
are currently continuing between Motorola and its Japanese 
business partner Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. 
  Nippon Idou offers both Motorola and a rival Japanese 
cellular phone system for its cellular service in the lucrative 
Tokyo and Nagoya areas, home to 60 million Japanese consumers. 
  The U.S. Government is set to announce by Thursday next week 
a target list of Japanese products that will be subject to U.S. 
sanctions if no settlement is reached over the cellular 
telephone dispute.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher flies to Tokyo Wednesday [9 March] night for 
the first direct top-level contact between Japan and the U.S. 
since President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa met in Washington last month. 
  During his three-day visit, Christopher will meet Hosokawa 
and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Thursday for talks on 
bilateral economic problems. 
  Hata and Christopher will also hold "two-plus-two" 
ministerial security talks with Defense Agency chief Kazuo Aichi 
and U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner on Friday 
morning. 
  Bilateral relations took a turn for the worse last month 
when 
Clinton and Hosokawa announced the collapse of bilateral trade 
"framework" negotiations aimed at redressing Japan's more than 
60 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States. 
  That prompted the U.S. Government to reinstate a trade law 
known as "Super 301" which gives it powers to impose sanctions 
against countries it holds guilty of unfair trade practices. 
The action is widely understood to be aimed at pressuring Japan 
into opening its market and reducing its trade surplus. 
  Foreign ministry sources said the failed talks are likely to 
be high on the agenda. 
  The Japanese are expected to explain their market-opening 
package and seek U.S. understanding, while expressing concern 
over the reinstatement of Super 301, according to the sources. 
  Hosokawa and Christopher are also likely to discuss China, 
since Christopher will fly to Beijing after leaving Tokyo on 
Friday and Hosokawa is scheduled to visit China from March 19 to 
21. 
  Christopher will also attend an international conference on 
aid to Cambodia in Tokyo on Thursday and deliver a speech to 
business leaders on Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The first Japan-U.S. 
foreign affairs and defense "two-plus-two" talks will be held 
Friday morning at the prime minister's official residence, 
government sources said Wednesday [9 March]. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Defense Agency Chief Kazuo 
Aichi will meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner for a discussion of 
bilateral and regional security issues. 
  Coming as concerns grow over Japan-U.S. trade relations, the 
talks are intended to promote understanding between Tokyo and 
Washington in order to prevent trade frictions from affecting 
political and security affairs, the sources said. 
  The talks are expected to focus on North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons development program and the strengthening of the 
military in China as well as touching upon the issue of U.S. 
military bases in Okinawa. 
  The meeting is also likely to consider revisions to Japanese 
defense plans in the post-Cold War world and military reductions 
by the United States, the sources suggested. 
  Until December 1990, the security talks had been attended by 
the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and the commander of the U.S. 
forces in the Pacific with the foreign minister and the Defense 
Agency director general. 
  It was agreed to upgrade the talks, but the higher level 
talks have yet to be held because of the changes in the 
international situation. 
  Wisner is accompanying Christopher on his three-nation tour 
of the Asia-Pacific region and will attend the talks for 
Secretary of Defense William Perry who did not make the trip.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, March 8 KYODO -- The U.S. Government 
Tuesday [7 March] blasted Japan's record in honoring its trade 
accords and accused the Japanese of maintaining a "one-way 
street" policy in global trade. The U.S. Trade Representative 
Office delivered a sharp appraisal of Japan in an annual review 
on U.S. trade policy priorities, vowing to put the task of 
opening Japanese markets and securing Tokyo's compliance of past 
trade agreements high on this year's U.S. trade agenda. 
  The trade report, compiled annually under congressional 
requirement, placed Japan on top of a list of bilateral trade 
policy actions that Washington plans to take this year. 
  In addition, the U.S. Government promised to seek 
congressional approval of a new global trade pact concluded last 
December under auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). 
  Washington also vowed to expand regional trade through the 
newly created three-nation free-trade zone in North America and 
to foster U.S. trade and investment opportunities in 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  Trade representative Mickey Kantor said the United States is 
determined to make global trade a "two-way" street. 
  There can be "no something for nothing," Kantor said in 
releasing this year's review of the U.S. trade agenda. 
  The U.S. Trade Representative Office (USTR) report took 
issue 
with Japan's market-opening efforts, saying Japan lags behind 
other major industrial economies in terms of openness to imports 
and to foreign direct investment. 
  Japan's trade policy, the report warned, will be held 
accountable for economic ills in the world. 
  Japan's "enormous global current account surplus, combined 
with its continuing resistance to both imports and new 
competitors in key sectors, retards global recovery and 
undermines political support for trade," the report said. 
  In another sharp rebuke on Japan's trade practice, the USTR 
report literally accused the Japanese Government of not keeping 
its word after signing a trade agreement. 
  "We presently have 33 trade agreements in effect with Japan, 
unfortunately, very few are being implemented in the way that we 
had envisioned," the report said. 
  The report said the U.S. Government cited Japan last month 
for allegedly violating a 1989 trade agreement on cellular phone 
service in Japan and vowed that Washington will put Japan's 
observance of other trade agreements under close scrutiny. 
  "We are reviewing our other agreements with Japan, and will 
not hesitate to act if they are not being implemented 
effectively," the report said. 
  The report gives the first detailed account of the U.S. 
trade 
agenda on Japan following the breakdown of trade talks between 
the two countries that marred the February 11 summit between 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. 
  Washington has since revived a 1988 trade law provision, 
known as the "Super 301," giving Clinton broad authority to 
impose unilateral sanctions on Japan over trade disputes. 
  The Clinton administration is also poised next week to 
publish a list of Japanese goods -- worth several hundred 
million dollars -- that will be subject to U.S. sanctions if 
there is no negotiated settlement over the cellular phone 
dispute. 
  In testimony at Congress on Tuesday, Kantor raised the 
possibility that up to eight Japanese industries would be 
subject to retaliatory action under the Super 301 trade weapon. 
  Kantor identified wood, paper, flat glass, computers, 
supercomputers, telecommunications, medical equipment and 
insurance as business areas where he said U.S. firms face 
barriers in penetrating the Japanese market. 
  The USTR report, however, indicated that the U.S. is still 
hopeful of settling its trade disputes with Japan at the 
negotiating table, particularly through the "framework" trade 
process agreed to last July. 
  "We stand by the framework for a new economic partnership to 
address these problems in a spirit of partnership," the report 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- An influential politician in 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government Ichiro 
Ozawa plans to visit Washington by the end of March in an effort 
to break the deadlock in stalled bilateral economic framework 
talks, government sources said Wednesday [9 March]. 
  Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito, one of the ruling seven 
parties, wants to visit the United States for talks with top 
U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the sources said. 
  According to Shinseito leaders, the government has yet to 
decide on sending Ozawa as special envoy, but Prime Minister 
Hosokawa may have unofficially asked Ozawa to go, they said. 
  Following the collapse of the framework trade talks between 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in February, the 
Japanese Government will announce by the end of March a plan to 
reduce Japan's huge trade surplus and to open up various 
markets, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. 
(IDO) has reached a broad agreement with Motorola Inc. of the 
United States over Motorola's demand for more access to the 
Japanese mobile telephone market, industrial sources said 
Wednesday. 
  Motorola Vice President Arnold Brenner arrived in Tokyo on 
Wednesday to finalize negotiations. 
  IDO said it hopes to straighten out differences over the 
issue by the end of this week. 
  The accord would help avoid U.S. trade retaliation against 
Japan. The U.S. Trade Representative Office has set March 17 as 
the deadline for an announcement on sanctions over trade issues. 
  IDO and Motorola were near agreement over the timing of an 
expansion of a network of Motorola-formula car phone relay 
stations and an allocation of radio frequencies, IDO officials 
said. 
  They said Motorola has agreed to IDO's offer to increase the 
number of relay stations, which will total 190 at the end of 
June, by an additional 159 stations. 
  But the officials said Motorola demanded that the network 
expansion be completed within the next one and a half years, 
while IDO contends that the project will take more than two 
years. 
  IDO was also resisting Motorola's demand that part of the 
frequencies allotted for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) 
formula transmission be transferred to its service in Japan on 
the ground of high costs, the officials said. 
  They said the frequency switch to the Motorola formula is 
almost impossible because it requires remodeling all NTT-formula 
relay stations, which would require an investment of tens of 
billions of yen. 
  Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's top automaker and a major 
investor in IDO, is set to help finance the project by 
increasing IDO's capital through a new share issue, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. 
announced Wednesday [9 March] it aims to import about 2 billion 
dollars worth of U.S. Auto parts in fiscal 1995. 
  Mitsubishi is the third major Japanese automaker to announce 
import targets for U.S.-made auto parts following Toyota Motor 
Corp., leader of the industry, and Mazda Motor Corp., affiliate 
of Ford Motor Co. of the United States. 
  Mitsubishi has announced a purchase plan for fiscal 1994, 
which begins April 1, incorporating imports of 400 million 
dollars worth of parts from U.S. suppliers and an additional 
1.2 billion dollars for local procurement for its U.S. car 
venture. 
  The company also said it will increase U.S. production of 
cars mounted with engines and transmissions supplied by Chrysler 
Corp. to 200,000 vehicles in 1995. 
  The company said it can boost local procurement in fiscal 
1994 by about 400 million dollars if its vehicle production in 
the U.S. expands steadily. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said it will 
announce next week an appeal for cooperation between Japanese 
and U.S. auto industries. 
  The appeal calls for the establishment of a forum for 
consultations between Japanese automakers and the U.S. "Big 
Three" -- General Motors Corp., Ford and Chrysler, association 
officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry said 
Wednesday it has granted Chrysler Corp.'s four-wheel drive 
"Cherokee" model a type certificate that allows the U.S. car 
maker to sell more than 2,000 cars of the model a year in Japan. 
  Ministry officials said there have been three models of 
American cars granted the certificate, with a condition that 
sales agents remodel the cars after importing to ensure they 
meet Japan's industrial standards. 
  This time, however, no such condition was given on the 
Cherokees, they said. 
  Currently, Chrysler plans to sell some 7,000 Cherokee model 
cars on the Japanese market at about 3 million to 3.73 million 
yen per unit. 
  In line with its domestic industrial and safety standards, 
Japan sets standards for goods to be imported to Japan. 
  It has been charged by other countries, including the United 
States, that the system is a nontariff trade barrier. 
  The ministry sent officials to the U.S. to deliver the 
certificate to Chrysler and to visit other manufacturers such as 
General Motors Corp. to explain the nature of the system and 
requirements for obtaining the certificate, officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Cambodian Co-Premiers 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen met with Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [9 March] and urged 
Japan to resume official loans to Cambodia, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  Ranariddh told Hosokawa during a 20-minute meeting that 
Cambodia is considering a number of major development projects 
and would welcome a resumption of the loans from Japan, 
officials said. 
  The two premiers arrived in Tokyo earlier the same day with 
a 
large government delegation to attend a two-day meeting of the 
International Committee on Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC), 
which begins Thursday. 
  Diplomatic sources said Japan will not announce a resumption 
of loan assistance at the conference, but will pledge some 9 
billion yen in grant aid for the coming fiscal year, which 
begins in April. 
  Japan extended Cambodia some 8 billion yen in grant 
assistance in fiscal 1993 ending March 31. 
  The last time Japan, Cambodia's top benefactor, made an 
official loan to Cambodia was in fiscal 1968, when it extended 
an offer of 1.5 billion yen. 
  But Cambodia's civil strife and sweeping changes of 
government since then precluded the extension of further loans, 
while the country's international credit-worthiness depreciated. 
  Sources said the two countries will have to negotiate 
Cambodia's arrears before a resumption of loans can be effected. 
  Officials said Hosokawa vowed that Japan will continue to 
offer Cambodia "as much cooperation as possible" to facilitate 
the country's reconstruction. 
  They said Ranariddh, the son of ailing King Norodom 
Sihanouk, 
outlined Cambodia's aid expectations of Japan. 
  In the area of social infrastructure, he said, Cambodia 
requires assistance for the building of roads and bridges. 
  Ranariddh expressed appreciation for Japanese funding for 
reconstruction of a key 709-meter-long bridge spanning the Tonle 
Sap River which runs through Phnom Penh. 
  The so-called "Japan Bridge," which was completed last 
month, 
was first built in 1963 with reparation funds from Japan for 
damage inflicted on Cambodia during World War II. 
  Ranariddh said assistance is also needed to finance various 
energy projects, particularly for electricity generation. He 
noted that Cambodia has reserves of natural gas that could be 
successfully exploited for that purpose. 
  A Japanese consortium has already started test-drilling an 
oil and gas field off southern Cambodia, the first drilling 
operation since the civil war halted foreign operations in 
Cambodia in 1974. 
  In addition to social infrastructure aid, Ranariddh said 
Cambodia wants Japan's help to improve its agricultural 
production. 
  According to officials, he said Cambodia has great 
agricultural potential, noting that land is plentiful in 
proportion to the country's small population of some 9 million 
people. 
  The Cambodian leader said his government is making efforts 
to 
facilitate an influx of foreign investment, such as drafting 
investment and banking laws. 
  Ranariddh expressed expectations for increased numbers of 
Japanese tourists visiting Cambodia to see the ancient temple 
complex at Angkor Wat. 
  Officials said he invited Hosokawa to pay an official visit 
to Cambodia in the future. 
  Delegations from 32 countries, the European Union and 12 
international organizations will participate in the ICORC 
meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Cambodian First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh expressed his sympathy Wednesday [9 
March] for the loss of Japanese lives during the U.N. 
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia last year, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The officials said Ranariddh made the remark in a meeting 
with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  "I offer condolences for the two Japanese youths who lost 
their lives in the context of Japan's international 
cooperation," he was quoted as saying. 
  The reference was to Atsuhito Nakata, a Japanese U.N. 
volunteer election worker shot to death last April, and Haruyuki 
Takada, a civilian policeman killed last May in an ambush. 
  Meanwhile, a Cambodian newspaper Tuesday reported having 
received a message from King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing in 
which the ailing monarch said he would receive the Nakata family 
at a special audience at the royal palace in Phnom Penh on May 9. 
  The Cambodia daily report said King Sihanouk praised 
Nakata's 
"immense courage and extraordinary contribution at the cost of 
his life to secure a free election and help set the foundation 
for democracy." 
  Takehito Nakata, Atsuhito's father, has retired from his 
post 
at Tomen Trading Co. to promote overseas volunteer activities. 
He has been named an honorary U.N. volunteer ambassador.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Cambodian First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh said Wednesday the royal government 
is "keeping the door open to the Khmer Rouge [KR]," Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  But Ranariddh, making the remarks in a dinner meeting with 
Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, said it will not do for 
the Khmer Rouge to try to "bargain" its way through the door. 
  Rather, the guerrilla group must enter through dialogue with 
the government on national reconciliation in a sincere manner, 
he was quoted as saying. 
  Ranariddh, who arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day to attend 
a two-day international aid conference beginning Thursday, did 
not clarify what role the Khmer Rouge could be given in the 
future political makeup of the country. 
  He previously rejected proposals to give the Khmer Rouge 
posts in the cabinet in exchange for a return of territories 
under its control and integration of its guerrilla army into the 
nation's unified armed forces. 
  The officials said Ranariddh said it is not permissible that 
the Khmer Rouge continues to control large tracts of territory. 
The guerrilla group, which held the nation under a rule of 
terror from 1975 to 1978, still controls an estimated 15 to 20 
percent of the country's territory. 
  Ranariddh said the Khmer Rouge has not responded to the 
governments repeated calls for a ceasefire despite the fact that 
repeated concessions have been made to them. He suggested the 
ball is now in the court of the guerrilla group. 
  Ranariddh made the remarks in the wake of message issued by 
ailing Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing calling for a 
ceasefire. 
  "The war between the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and the 
Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) forces has so far brought 
nothing but destruction, separation, suffering, pain, shame and 
despair for Cambodia, for our nation and especially our poor 
people," the king said in a statement dated March 7. 
  Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan has reportedly 
responded by expressing support for Sihanouk. 
  Government forces are reportedly preparing an attack on the 
Khmer Rouge's headquarters in Pailin, some 300 kilometers 
northwest of Phnom Penh near the Thai border.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Cambodian Foreign Minister 
Norodom Sirivut called Wednesday [9 March] for the forging of a 
"dependable partnership" between Cambodia and Japan in the 
political and economic realms, Japanese Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The officials said Sirivut made the call in a half-hour 
meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Both 
Sirivut and Hata serve concurrently as foreign ministers and 
deputy prime ministers. 
  Sirivut arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day accompanying 
Co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen to a two-day 
meeting of the International Committee on the Reconstruction of 
Cambodia (ICORC), which starts Thursday. 
  He was quoted as saying that in order to further consolidate 
ties between Cambodia and Japan his government is considering an 
early reopening of its embassy in Tokyo. 
  Since the fall of the Lon Nol government to the Khmer Rouge 
in 1975, the embassy in Tokyo's Akasaka District has been 
occupied by Cambodians of various political persuasions but it 
has not been functioning in an official capacity. 
  Officials said Sirivut told Hata Cambodia is requesting 
assistance from the international community from the perspective 
that its own self-help efforts are most important. 
  They said Hata called such an approach laudable and 
expressed 
hope that the ICORC meeting will prove successful in 
facilitating Cambodia's development. 
  Hata said that if Cambodia's reconstruction from years of 
civil strife goes smoothly it could serve as a model for similar 
efforts in other parts of the world.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will express Japan's support for China's open reform 
policies when he visits China from March 19 to 21, Foreign 
Ministry officials said Wednesday [9 March]. 
  He will also support China's bid to become a member of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the officials 
said. 
  Hosokawa will voice the support in a series of talks with 
Chinese leaders, including Chinese President Jiang Zemin, 
Premier Li Peng and Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's 
Congress Standing Committee, they said. 
  He will also talk about Japan's yen loans to China, they 
said. 
  When Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata visited China in January, 
Japan and China agreed to divide Japan's loan periods from five 
years to three-year and two-year periods beginning with the 1996 
fiscal year. 
  Hosokawa and Chinese leaders will also discuss boosting 
Japanese investment and cooperation between the two nations on 
environmental preservation, they said. 
  They will also exchange views on international affairs such 
as cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and North Korea's 
alleged nuclear weapons development program, they said. 
  Hosokawa is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on March 19 and 
visit Shanghai on March 21 before returning to Tokyo. 
  The last visit to China by a Japanese prime minister was in 
1991 when then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu visited China and 
Mongolia.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- A private defense panel to 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [9 March] 
discussed post-Cold War developments around the world and the 
military situation surrounding Japan. 
  The nine-member group, asked to review Japan's 
two-decade-old 
defense policies, exchanged views after listening to briefings 
from officials of the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Agency, 
the panel chairman told a news conference. 
  The group spent considerable time discussing the Foreign 
Ministry's explanation that the world is in a transition period 
after the end of the Cold War, said Hirotaro Higuchi, also 
chairman of Asahi Breweries Ltd. 
  Many group members raised doubts about the notion, arguing 
that frameworks already exist to maintain a new world order such 
as the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations and the United 
Nations Security Council, Higuchi said. 
  The next meeting of the panel is scheduled for March 16. 
  The panel, after debating overall defense matters once a 
week, will offer recommendations to Hosokawa by around summer 
for a revision of the National Defense Program Outline, which 
has served as Japan's basic defense policy since 1976, 
  Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies, 
including Japan's future role in U.N.-led peacekeeping 
operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the 
Defense Agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995. 
  Higuchi denied the possibility of the panel discussing the 
interpretation of the current war-renouncing constitution, 
saying the group will talk about defense matters within the 
scope of the current constitution.

<F P=106> [By Mie Kawashima] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- In the chilly rainy 
morning, about 230 people lined up in front of East 21, a Tokyo 
downtown shopping mall affiliated with Uny Co., and the woman at 
the front had been waiting for more than two hours. 
  At the 10 A.M. opening, the shop provided the first 150 
customers with four kilograms of domestic rice, which was sold 
out in 10 minutes. The remaining 80 bags -- some containing 
imported rice, some a domestic-foreign rice blend -- were sold 
out in half an hour. 
  "We cannot endure unappetizing foreign rice, being familiar 
with domestic rice," said Hitomi Terai, 43, a local resident and 
one of the pleased 150. 
  Terai had tried Thai rice, but "could not manage to eat it 
because it tasted dry and bad." 
  The morning queue began on February 28, a day before the 
Food 
Agency began offering full supplies of imported rice, and the 
line has since grown, said Hisao Nakaya, store manager of East 
21. 
  Such a scene has been seen every morning, everywhere in 
Japan, with the apparent disappearance of domestic rice from the 
shelves. 
  The agency has sold rice imported from China, Thailand and 
the United States to make up for a shortfall caused by a record 
poor harvest last fall and the government's limited stock. 
  The government blames consumers for the shortage, saying 
they 
shy away from foreign rice and stockpile the domestic crop. 
  The woman at the front of the line said she has no choice 
but 
to wait because her neighborhood shops sells rice only for 
restaurants and other bundle use, not for individual customers. 
  Nakaya said customers are anxious about the quality of 
imported rice, especially since a lawmaker remarked in early 
March that Thai rice being sold in Japan is infested with mice 
and cockroaches. 
  Eating foreign rice is a rare experience because Japan has 
banned imports for many years. 
  The coalition government decided in December to partially 
open the market through the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
negotiations. 
  The Food Agency plans to supply 500,000 tons of rice in 
March, equivalent to last year's volume, that will be a 
half-and-half of domestic and imported rice. 
  From April through June, the percentage of imported rice 
will 
be raised to 70 percent. 
  Terai's husband, Masahiko Terai, 46, said the queues may 
have 
swelled to twice their size from the previous day before due to 
the Food Agency's most recent announcement. 
  The agency said that retailers will not be allowed to sell 
domestic rice unless it is mixed with at least 20 percent thai 
rice in order to prevent consumers from rushing to the Japanese 
crop. 
  "The move will worsen the situation. When all official rice 
is mixed with foreign rice, people will then be after domestic 
rice on the black market," he said. 
  Black market prices for the staple have soared 60 percent 
from the end of last year. 
  Nakaya, the manager, said the measure may ease panic if pure 
domestic rice truly becomes unobtainable. However, about 30 
percent of domestic rice is said to be independent from the Food 
Agency's control and will go to the black market. 
  People panic because, Nakaya said, "rice is very special for 
Japanese. Other food would not cause such a confusion." 
  Hitomi Terai blamed the government for its policy that 
forced 
farmers to reduce their acreage of paddies in order to control 
production, resulting in the current shortage. 
  Toshiharu Nishiguchi of Beikoku Data Bank, a rice market 
research agency in Tokyo, said consumer demand differs from the 
intentions of the government, wholesalers and retailers to 
maintain a constant supply. 
  "At the end of February, wholesalers and retailers 
apparently 
had a little more domestic rice than a year earlier to sell 
later to their regular customers when foreign rice prevails. It 
may have upset consumers," he said. 
  He predicted that more imported rice will be sent to shelves 
as early as mid-March. "So the shortage, at least of imported 
rice, will ease before long."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Prosecutors raided the head 
office of Kajima Corp. and the homes of its top executives and 
former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on Wednesday [8 
March] in connection with Nakamura's alleged acceptance of a 10 
million yen bribe from the construction giant. 
  The raids covered more than 30 locations which included the 
homes of Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of Kajima, and Akira 
Miyazaki, president. 
  Meanwhile, the House of Representatives Steering Committee 
convened Wednesday to listen to Justice Ministry officials to 
discuss a request by prosecutors to arrest Nakamura, a member of 
the house, who quit the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) earlier in the day. 
  Committee Chairman Keiwa Okuda told reporters later that the 
lower house needs to decide on the request as early as possible. 
  Diet permission is required for the arrest of 
parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet 
is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late 
January. 
  Investigators from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors 
Office will soon ask Ishikawa, 68, to voluntarily submit to 
questions pertaining to the money allegedly paid in January 1992 
to Nakamura, investigative sources said. 
  Ishikawa formerly served as head of the Japan Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry, one of Japan's four top business 
organizations, and also of the Japan Federation of Construction 
Contractors Inc., an industry association of general contractors. 
  He resigned as president of the chamber last year as 
prosecutors promoted probes into the widening scandal involving 
politicians and contractors. 
  Investigators have already quizzed Miyazaki, 70, the 
president of Kajima, one of Japan's top contractors. 
  On Tuesday, prosecutors again arrested a former vice 
president of Kajima, Shinji Kiyoyama, 67, on suspicion of giving 
the 10 million yen bribe to Nakamura. 
  Nakamura allegedly received the money as a reward for using 
his influence to help prevent the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) 
from lodging a criminal complaint against contractors including 
Kajima, for bid-rigging in Saitama Prefecture. 
  Kiyoyama allegedly asked Nakamura, a senior member of the 
LDP's construction lobby, to put pressure on the FTC not to file 
an accusation with prosecutors against a bid-rigging cartel 
involving Kajima and 65 other construction firms. 
  At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chairman of the LDP's 
panel on the Antimonopoly Law. The LDP was in power for 38 
years until the inauguration of the coalition government of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last August. 
  Nakamura later served as construction minister from December 
1992 to August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  Investigators intend to question fallen LDP kingpin Shin 
Kanemaru, 79, who is being tried in a separate income tax 
evasion case, the investigative sources said. 
  Prosecutors suspect Kiyoyama first asked Kanemaru to put 
pressure on the FTC, an antitrust watchdog body. Kanemaru 
allegedly replied that Nakamura was handling the matter, the 
sources said. 
  Kiyoyama and three other former Kajima officials were 
indicted last year in two bribery cases. Prosecutors said the 
Kajima officials gave 20 million yen to former Ibaraki Gov. 
Fujio Takeuchi and 10 million yen to former Sendai Mayor Toru 
Ishii.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The lower house steering 
committee is scheduled to convene a closed-door session at noon 
Wednesday [9 March] over a request by prosecutors to arrest 
former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on suspicion of 
bribery, Diet officials said. 
  Nakamura, 44, a main opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) member of the House of Representatives, is suspected of 
taking a 10 million yen bribe from leading construction firm 
Kajima Corp. in January 1992, according to documents submitted 
to lower house speaker Takako Doi. 
  The House of Representatives is expected to hold a plenary 
session as early as Thursday to decide whether to give the 
go-ahead to Nakamura's arrest, political sources said. 
  Parties within the ruling coalition government and the 
opposition Japanese Communist Party are expected to agree to the 
arrest of Nakamura, the sources said. 
  LDP head Yohei Kono on Tuesday said the LDP will not pursue 
party interests in considering the prosecutors' request to 
arrest Nakamura. 
  At the closed-door session, Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki 
will brief committee members on the matter, the officials said. 
On Tuesday, the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
asked the House of Representatives to decide on the prosecutors' 
request for arresting Nakamura. 
  Diet permission is required for the arrest of 
parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet 
is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late 
January. 
  Prosecutors applied for a warrant of arrest for Nakamura 
from 
the Tokyo District Court after Nakamura repeatedly refused to 
voluntarily face questioning. 
  The cabinet decided to send to Diet the arrest request 
issued 
by Tokyo District Court Judge Kohei Ikeda.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Both the Construction and 
Finance Ministries and several local governments Wednesday [9 
March] announced decisions to suspend contracts for their public 
works projects with Kajima Corp. for several months in a protest 
over the rearrest of its former vice president in a bribery 
scandal. 
  The two ministries said they will prevent the major 
contractor from being offered public works projects for up to 
three months. 
  Saitama and Fukui are among the prefectural governments 
which 
will bar the company from their projects for five months, while 
Karatsu in Saga Prefecture, southern Japan, will take the same 
measure for six months. 
  Former Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama was rearrested 
Tuesday for his suspected involvement in allegedly bribing 
former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura with 10 million 
yen. 
  This is the first time the Construction Ministry has 
suspended a company from public works projects in relation to 
the alleged bribery of a Diet member. 
  Kajima is one of eight major general contractors at the 
center of investigations into a series of bribery scandals 
involving politicians and construction firms. 
  On Wednesday morning, prosecutors raided Kajima's head 
office 
in Tokyo in connection with Nakamura's alleged acceptance of the 
10 million yen bribe from the construction giant. 
  The raids covered more than 30 locations, including the 
homes 
of Kajima Chairman Rokuro Ishikawa and President Akira Miyazaki. 
  On Tuesday, prosecutors rearrested Kiyoyama for allegedly 
passing the bribe to Nakamura, a House of Representatives 
member, for his help in heading off a Fair Trade Commission 
criminal complaint over a bid-rigging cartel in Saitama 
Prefecture in 1992. 
  Prosecutors are asking the Diet to remove Nakamura's 
parliamentary immunity to allow his arrest. 
  Despite the punitive action against Kajima, the central 
Japan 
city of Nagano signed a contract with a joint venture led by the 
scandal-tainted company Wednesday for the construction of the 
1998 Winter Olympics speed skating venue, city officials said. 
  Nagano city officials approved the pact with the Kajima-led 
joint venture because its sanctions against Kajima were 
irrelevant since Kiyoyama was not a representative of the firm 
at the time of arrest.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday [9 March] demanded that the 
Justice Ministry submit statements from a former vice president 
of Kajima, Shinji Kiyoyama, to a parliamentary panel in an 
apparent bid to block an arrest of a former construction 
minister for alleged bribery. 
  The LDP's requests, made at the House of Representatives 
Steering Committee, also include questioning former Fair Trade 
Commission (FTC) Chairman Setsuo Umezawa as a witness. 
  Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who left the 
LDP earlier Wednesday, could be arrested as early as Thursday 
for his alleged receipt of a 10 million yen bribe from 
construction giant Kajima Corp., Diet sources said. 
  The committee brought the prospect of Nakamura's arrest 
closer when it met Wednesday to listen to Justice Minister Akira 
Mikazuki and a top ministry official concerning the case, the 
sources said. 
  The LDP, however, questioned the way prosecutors are 
charging 
Nakamura and criticized a prosecutor's reported assault case 
against a suspect in connection with investigations into a 
corruption scandal involving contractors. 
  Committee Chairman Keiwa Okuda also called for the ministry 
to turn in a "framework" of Kiyoyama's statements. The ministry 
refrained from giving an immediate answer. 
  Okuda told the session the legislature needs to reach a 
decision as soon as possible, the sources said. 
  Nakamura, 44, a member of the House of Representatives, is 
suspected of accepting the 10 million yen bribe in January 1992. 
  The closed committee meeting, which began shortly after 
midday, reviewed documents supplied by the Justice Ministry 
detailing the allegations against Nakamura as well as relevant 
legal provisions, the Diet sources said. 
  Mikazuki and the head of the ministry's Criminal Affairs 
Bureau, Mamoru Norisada, attended the meeting. 
  Mikazuki told the committee that Nakamura has rejected 
repeated requests to turn himself in and may destroy evidence 
related to the case. 
  Committee sources quoted Norisada as saying prosecutors now 
have enough evidence of Nakamura's involvement in the case, 
including statements from Kiyoyama, 67, who was arrested again 
Tuesday on suspicion of giving the 10 million yen to Nakamura. 
  Nakamura allegedly received the money as a reward for using 
his influence to help prevent the FTC from lodging a criminal 
complaint with the prosecution against contractors for 
bid-rigging in Saitama Prefecture. 
  Kiyoyama allegedly asked Nakamura, who was a senior member 
of 
the LDP's construction lobby, to pressure the FTC not to file a 
complaint with prosecutors against a bid-rigging cartel 
involving Kajima and 65 other construction firms. 
  Norisada told the committee that the FTC had attempted to 
carry through criminal proceedings against the contractors, but 
Nakamura had pressed it to abandon the attempts. 
  Norisada was quoted as saying that Nakamura continued to 
demand that the FTC abandon the case despite the commission's 
repeated refusals. 
  Committee sources also said that Norisada told the committee 
the 10 million yen Nakamura allegedly accepted was a "large sum, 
different from sums normally given on special occasions like New 
Year." 
  If the prosecutors' request is approved by the committee, 
the 
lower house is expected to hold a plenary session as early as 
Thursday to decide whether to give the go-ahead to Nakamura's 
arrest, political sources said. 
  Parties within the ruling coalition and the opposition 
Japanese Communist Party are expected to agree to the arrest of 
Nakamura, the sources said. 
  LDP head Yohei Kono said Tuesday the LDP will not pursue 
party interests in considering the prosecutors' request to 
arrest Nakamura. 
  On Tuesday, the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
asked the lower house to decide on the request. 
  Diet permission is required for the arrest of 
parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet 
is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late 
January. 
  Prosecutors applied Tuesday for a warrant for Nakamura from 
the Tokyo District Court, which sent a document to the cabinet 
urging it to apply for Diet permission on Nakamura's arrest. 
  Nakamura's lawyers have said he is determined to "fight with 
prosecutors," even if he is arrested.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Wednesday [9 March] the government is convinced 
prosecutors will carry out their duty with law and justice in a 
case involving former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura 
suspected of taking a bribe from major general contractor Kajima 
Corp. 
  Hosokawa, replying to questions from Hiroshi Tachiki of the 
Japanese Communist Party (JCP) in the House of Councillors 
plenary session, said the government "will wait and see how the 
investigation develops." 
  Nakamura, 44, who bolted from the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday, is suspected of taking a 10 
million yen bribe from Kajima in January 1992, investigative 
sources said. 
  On Tuesday, prosecutors asked Tokyo district court to issue 
an arrest warrant for him. The court submitted a document to 
the cabinet asking for Diet permission to lift parliamentary 
immunity on Nakamura from arrest. The cabinet in turn passed it 
to the House of Representatives, to which Nakamura belongs. 
  The Diet is currently in the middle of a 150-day regular 
session due to end in June.

  [Text] Nagano, March 9 KYODO -- A joint venture led by 
scandal-ridden Kajima Corp. concluded a contract Wednesday [9 
March] with the central Japan city of Nagano on the construction 
of the 1998 Winter Olympics speed skating venue, city officials 
said. 
  Representatives of the joint venture initialed the agreement 
in a signing session Wednesday. 
  Kajima is one of eight major general contractors at the 
center of investigations into a series of bribery scandals 
involving politicians and construction firms. 
  Nagano is among a number of municipal and prefectural 
governments that had held off for a while on concluding 
contracts with the firms involved in the scandals. 
  But Nagano city officials approved the pact with the 
Kajima-led joint venture even though a former Kajima vice 
president was arrested again Tuesday for his suspected 
involvement in the alleged sending of a 10 million yen bribe to 
former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura. 
  The officials said the city's sanctions against Kajima were 
not relevant since the arrested Kajima executive, Shinji 
Kiyoyama, was not a representative of the leading construction 
firm at the time of arrest. 
  The city invited bids last July for the design and 
construction of the rink that will be the site of the speed 
skating events in the 1998 Winter Olympic Games. 
  The five-member joint venture led by Kajima had been 
scheduled to begin work in February, but conclusion of the 
contract was delayed because the city had held off signing 
contacts with Kajima until February 25. 
  On Tuesday, prosecutors arrested Kiyoyama for allegedly 
providing a 10 million yen bribe to Nakamura, a House of 
Representatives member, for his help in heading off a Fair Trade 
Commission criminal complaint on a bid-rigging cartel in Saitama 
Prefecture in 1992. 
  Prosecutors are asking the Diet to lift immunity on Nakamura 
so they can arrest him.

  [Text] According to a public opinion poll conducted by NHK 
on the people's livelihood and political issues, the support 
rate for the Hosokawa cabinet stands at 53 percent, falling 
sharply by 16 points compared to results of a survey conducted 
three months ago. Immediately after Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa gave up the cabinet reshuffle, NHK conducted this 
nationwide opinion poll of 1,800 men and women who are over 20 
years old on 5-6 March by interviewing respondents individually. 
NHK obtained valid answers from 1,169 people, or 64.9 percent 
of the pollees. According to the results, 53 percent of 
respondents answered that they supported the Hosokawa 
administration, 31 percent did not support it, and 16 percent 
said they have no opinion, or gave no answer. The Hosokawa 
cabinet's support rate dropped by 16 percent from the 69 percent 
marked in the December poll. However, its support rate still 
exceeds that of the Kaifu Cabinet which was the highest among 
past cabinets. 
  When asked about the reasons for their support, 29 percent 
of 
the pollees answered the prime minister's personality is 
trustworthy, 28 percent said his political stance is good, and 
14 percent indicated because he belongs to the party which they 
support. 
  In answers to a question on reasons for not supporting the 
Hosokawa cabinet, 34 percent of respondents answered they could 
not expect good policies from the Hosokawa Cabinet, and 30 
percent said he lacks the ability to implement his policies. 
  To the question of what issues they want the Hosokawa 
cabinet 
to deal with most, 44 percent indicated implementation of the 
economic stimulus package and stabilization of commodity prices, 
11 percent asked for promotion of political reform, and 10 
percent called for improvement of social welfare. 
  In response to the question asking which party they 
currently 
support, 26.6 percent supported the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP]; 10.2 percent, the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ]; 9.2 percent, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; 3.6 
percent, Komeito; 6.2 percent, the Japan New Party [JNP]; 2.3 
percent, the Communist Party of Japan; 2.7 percent, the 
Democratic Socialist Party; 2.9 percent, Sakigake [Harbinger 
Party]; 0.3 percent, the United Social Democratic Party; and 
33.2 percent answered they did not support any party. 
  Comparing the results of this poll to those of the December 
opinion poll, while the support rate for the LDP as well as 
Shinseito and the SDPJ increased by 4.5 points, the JNP's 
support rate, which was second to the LDP's in the December 
survey, dropped by 9.9 points.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The economy remains mixed 
despite some new bright signs this year and it is still too 
early to predict recovery, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno 
said Wednesday [9 March]. 
  Mieno told a regular news conference that he wants to 
continue "carefully watching" conditions before judging whether 
signs of improvement can be sustained. 
  It is too early to say whether such promising signs as 
partial improvement in consumption will prevail over such 
worrying indications as a gradually worsening job situation, he 
said. 
  Mieno said, for example, that fiscal year-end factors 
apparently played a part in January's modest rebound in 
industrial production. 
  "We'll have to watch a bit longer to judge sustainability 
and 
growth potential," he said. 
  He said economic conditions differ from those of last 
spring, 
when the economy seemed to bottom out, only to slide further. 
  Last year, there were more negative factors in the economic 
mix, Mieno said, adding that the economy was dragged down by the 
yen's sharp rise, bad summer weather and political confusion. 
  The yen has recently been in "a state of remission" on the 
foreign exchange market, he said. 
  Asked about recent rises in long-term market and lending 
rates, he said they will not likely have an immediate effect on 
the economy. Higher rates are "obviously" a minus for recovery, 
he acknowledged, but noted they were just one factor. 
  Mieno said capital spending by smaller companies, which 
usually leads an economic recovery, will continue to slump. But 
he said their weak investment will not likely lead to further 
setbacks. 
  Mieno said the central bank will consider economic 
conditions 
in taking "appropriate" policy steps, but he played down the 
idea that falling short-term rates signal an imminent cut in the 
official discount rate. 
  Although market players consider it critical that there be a 
half-percentage point spread between the benchmark overnight 
lending rate and the discount rate, Mieno said the spread is not 
a decisive factor. 
  He said, however, it would be hard to imagine the overnight 
call-money rate falling below the discount rate for a prolonged 
period. 
  With the central bank taking a loose stance in funding the 
money market, the overnight unsecured call rate has recently 
moved around 2.1 percent, less than a half point above the 1.75 
percent discount rate. 
  Mieno repeated that for recovery to begin, it is not 
necessary for companies to have finished adjusting their balance 
sheets, hit by shrunken asset values after the bursting of the 
speculative "bubble" in the late 1980s. 
  But, citing the U.S. recovery, he said that if a turnaround 
begins while balance sheet adjustments are continuing, it would 
be a very "slow tempo" recovery. 
  Asked about rising public service rates, Mieno said they 
would not likely harm the economy, noting that overall prices 
remain very stable. 
  On trade matters, Mieno said cutting Japan's chronically 
huge 
current account surplus would contribute to stable growth 
globally. 
  He called for "leadership" from Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa in implementing "bold" deregulation, which he said 
would directly reduce the imbalance by facilitating imports and 
would increase the chances for investment in Japan. 
  He also urged domestic companies to "actively" develop new 
business. 
  Mieno said fiscal steps taken thus far will help promote 
domestic demand-led growth, a key component in curbing Japan's 
surpluses, but he also urged further efforts from Japan's 
trading partners.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The economy remains "mixed" 
and in a "delicate stage" with some improvements seen in recent 
indicators such as consumption and production, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Wednesday [9 March]. 
  Speaking at a regular press meeting, Fujii backed off from 
comments he made Sunday in an informal speech made in Tochigi 
Prefecture, in which he indicated "as his personal view" that 
the economy had hit bottom. 
  "This is an official press meeting," he said, brushing aside 
further questions on his earlier remarks. 
  Fujii also repeated that he is "confident that steady 
implementation of the latest 15.25 trillion stimulus package 
will put the economy on a recovery track in fiscal 1994." 
  The finance minister declined to comment on a meeting of 
cabinet ministers earlier on Wednesday to discuss Japan's 
"voluntary" market-opening package to address the ongoing trade 
dispute with the United States. 
  He described the meeting as "free talking," but declined to 
comment further. 
  The reason for the hastily-arranged meeting was seen to 
allow 
discussion over Japan's stance before Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata meet U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher, who is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo 
for an official visit Wednesday night. 
  Asked about the latest U.S. stance of not reopening trade 
talks, Fujii said that Japan would "positively" take its 
"voluntary measures" aside from negotiations. 
  Meanwhile, Fujii reiterated that the government is not 
considering a plan to boost the 10-year public works program of 
430 billion yen as part of the package.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The government on Wednesday 
[9 March] came up with the outline of a bill to establish an 
administrative reform committee in order to monitor the progress 
of Japan's economic deregulation, officials said. 
  They said the proposed legislation is expected to be 
presented to a meeting of the ruling coalition's policy-making 
officials Thursday and is likely to be approved by the cabinet 
on March 18 for presentation to the current Diet. 
  The committee is expected to promote the easing of existing 
economic restrictions, discuss the opening of government-held 
information to the public and make recommendations to the prime 
minister on the basis of its surveys and discussions. 
  Under the proposed bill, the five-member committee with a 
three-year tenure will be created in the prime minister's office 
and will function like other advisory councils appointed by the 
prime minister, the officials said. 
  One or two of the members will serve full-time on the 
committee. 
  Some lawmakers have expressed doubts about the proposal to 
establish a committee in the government to monitor the 
government's economic deregulation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Mining industry leaders 
Wednesday [9 March] asked the Trade Ministry to take steps to 
spur demand for mineral products. 
  Presidents of major mining companies belonging to the Japan 
Mining Industry Association made the request in a breakfast 
meeting with Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry 
minister. 
  Mining companies are struggling due to slack demand from the 
auto and precious metals industries, the presidents of Sumitomo 
Metal Mining Co., Mitsubishi Materials Corp., Dowa Mining Co. 
and other companies told Kumagai. 
  They also requested the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) to promote a policy to ensure "smooth purchases" 
abroad of mineral ores. 
  Kumagai told the executives the ministry will work hard to 
help the mining industry by improving fiscal and tax systems, 
MITI officials said.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 9 (KCNA) -- The fifth working-level 
contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the 
North and the South was held behind closed doors at the Thongil 
House in the northern portion of Panmunjom today. 
  At the end of the contact the head of the North side 
delegation was interviewed by home and foreign reporters on the 
spot. 
  According to his briefing, the North side once again urged 
the South side to manifest its position on the four-point demand 
including the question of discontinuing large-scale nuclear war 
exercises that stands in the way of exchange of special envoys, 
a demand raised by it at the fourth contact. 
  Then it put forward a new amendment to "agreement on the 
exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South" 
taking the South side's view into full consideration, out of a 
desire to realize the exchange of special envoys at an early 
date. The proposal involves detailed matters such as the rank 
of the special envoys of both side and their suite, the tasks of 
special envoys and the mode of their exchange, the date of their 
exchange and the timetable of their stay, procedures of their 
travels and security arrangements, news coverage and (?offer) of 
conveniences to reporters. 
  The South side created difficulties, grumbling about what it 
called "creation of obstacle" or "unnecessary things" instead of 
expressing its clear attitude toward the principled demand 
raised by our side and entering the discussion of working 
matters. 
  Our side proposed a tete-a-tete contact between the heads of 
both sides from a sincere stand to tide over the obtaining 
difficulties on all accounts and concluding the working-level 
contact. 
  There was a contact between the heads of both sides. 
  It was agreed to have the sixth contact between working 
delegates in the South portion of Panmunjom on March 12.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Return of Super 301"] </F>
  [Text] In reaction to the U.S. decision to reinstate the 
Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act, the government is 
intentionally demonstrating a cool head. A senior Foreign 
Ministry official said that "it probably is a bargaining chip to 
win concessions from Japan." While hard-liners say that Japan 
can beat the provision by filing complaints with GATT, the 
government is perplexed with the U.S.-led development of the 
trade friction issue. Unrest is prevailing in industrial 
circles, and Japanese-U.S. relations may become even worse after 
this. 
<H5>  Government Reactions </H5>
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
believes that "even if the United States opens an investigation 
according to the act, this is unlikely to result in unilateral 
sanctions." Under the Super 301 provision, the United States 
may raise tariffs on Japanese products or limit imports using a 
quantitative quota. However, the MITI believes that if these 
actions are taken without following GATT procedures, this would 
be regarded as a violation of GATT regulations, as well as those 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will replace GATT 
in 1996. 
  Referring to the fact that the reinstated Super 301 
provision 
provides 180 days for negotiations before sanctions are imposed, 
the MITI official said: "Under the new provision, the 
negotiation period is extended by six times. The United States 
has adopted a strategy of using economic sanctions as a 
bargaining chip." 
  The MITI is taking a tough stand toward this issue, saying: 
"When the United States takes unilateral action, that nation is 
most likely to impose higher tariffs on Japanese-made products. 
In that case, Japan can beat the sanctions by filing a 
complaint with GATT." 
  The U.S. Government, however, is unlikely to actually 
trigger 
a trade war with Japan. A senior Foreign Ministry official 
said: "Even if GATT supports the U.S. sanctions, that would not 
reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit. Such actions cannot be a 
sovereign remedy for the bilateral trade frictions." He then 
demonstrated the ministry's passive attitude toward the issue, 
saying: "The Super 301 sanctions and Japan's complaints to GATT 
would just produce unnecessary conflict between Japan and the 
United States. I just hope that the United States will not pull 
the trigger." 
  Because U.S. negotiators say that "the ball is in Japan's 
court" (as noted by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor), 
Japan's voluntary market-opening package is becoming the focal 
point of the issue. While Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has 
ordered that the package be formulated within this month, a 
senior MITI official demonstrated a pessimistic view of its 
effectiveness, saying: "We have already offered almost 
everything we have. The package would not look very fresh." 
  Some hard-liners in the government say: "It is unnecessary 
to prepare such a market-opening package. If Japan does so, 
this will acknowledge the U.S. claim that the Japanese market is 
exclusionary." They, however, have no alternative plans for 
rehabilitating Japanese-U.S. relations. 
<H5>  Industrial Circles </H5>
  Industrial circles are wary of the revival of the Super 301 
provision. Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Association [JAMA], stated that "we are deeply 
concerned about the revival of this sanction-oriented 
provision." But, the JAMA intends to carefully watch 
developments in this issue for the time being, pointing out that 
"the type of sanctions and other details are still unknown." 
  Auto industry circles have long been dealing with U.S. 
demands for expanded imports of auto parts. The Toyota Motor 
Corp. has prepared a plan for the voluntary expansion of 
purchases of U.S.-made auto parts. Therefore, major automakers 
are beginning to question the trade policy of the U.S. 
Government, noting: "Unilateral sanctions go against GATT 
principles. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan is a 
macroeconomic issue, not a microeconomic issue (related to such 
individual trade sectors as automobiles)." 
  Because it is questionable if the United States really wants 
to impose sanctions on Japan, some quarters demonstrated calm 
attitudes. A management official of a major automaker said: 
"If the United States limits auto imports from Japan, that 
would harm U.S. consumers. It is questionable whether they 
really intend to do so." The Electronic Industries Association 
of Japan [EIAJ] is also exhibiting a prudent attitude toward the 
U.S. decision. EIAJ Managing Director Iwao Oshima said: 
"Sanctions under the Super 301 provision may be regarded as 
violations of GATT regulations. We want to watch future 
developments." 
  On the other hand, a trading house official said, "Super 301 
will be an effective weapon because it can apply strong 
pressures on trade barriers even without actual sanctions." NEC 
Corp. President Tadahiro Sekimoto said, "Japan should reduce its 
trade surplus through such macroeconomic policies as domestic 
market expansion and trade surplus recycling." 
  Moreover, Takeshi Kondo, director of the Politics-Economics 
Research Institute under the Itochu Corp., noted: "The trade 
friction is caused by Japan's failure to deal appropriately with 
the issue. While the Japanese Government promised increased 
public investment and tax cuts, it gave no estimate of how these 
policies can contribute to reducing the trade surplus."

  [Text] The fifth contact of working-level representatives 
for the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and 
South was held behind closed doors in Tongilgak today on our 
side of Panmunjom. 
  After the contact, the head of our side's delegation gave a 
news conference to domestic and foreign reporters on the spot 
and explained the details of the contact. 
  Our side stressed a need to break at all cost the deadlock 
[kyochak sangtae] of the working-level contact and conclude the 
discussions on the agenda items at this time. It once again 
urged the South side to manifest first its clear position on the 
demand -- raised by our side at the fourth contact -- that it 
discontinue all large-scale nuclear war exercises against the 
dialogue partner, an obstacle to the exchange of special envoys; 
abandon the antinational international cooperation system; 
withdraw the plan to introduce Patriot missiles and other new 
types of weapons; and cancel the South's remarks that it cannot 
shake hands with the dialogue partner. 
  Our side pointed out that the North-South exchange of 
special 
envoys will not be able to proceed in a favorable atmosphere if 
the South does not manifest its clear position on this 
four-point demand and that even if special envoys are exchanged, 
just like the previous dialogues which underwent twists and 
turns, the dialogue will become a nominal [yumyongmusil] 
dialogue that will results in its discontinuation, resumption, 
and breakup [kyollyol] and that this would disappoint all fellow 
countrymen. 
  Out of a desire to immediately conclude discussions on 
procedural matters for the exchange of special envoys and 
exchange special envoys at the earliest possible date, it 
presented a new momentous amendment to the Agreement on the 
Exchange of Top-Level Envoys Between the North and the South, an 
amendment that takes the South side's view into full 
consideration. 
  Our side's amendment proposal includes detailed matters such 
as the rank of the special envoys of both sides, their 
accompanying personnel [tonghaeng inwon], the tasks of special 
envoys and the mode of their exchange, the date of their 
exchange and the timetable of their stay, procedures of their 
travels and security arrangements, reporters' news coverage and 
the provision of conveniences to reporters. 
  He proposed that special envoys of the two sides be 
authoritative and responsible high-ranking officials appointed 
by the top authorities of the North and the South and be 
accompanied by about 10 aides and six reporters, that the South 
side's envoy visit Pyongyang within 15 days from the date an 
agreement is reached, and our side's envoy visit Seoul within 15 
days from the last day of the South side's envoy's Pyongyang 
visit, and that each side's envoy visit the other side for three 
nights and four days. 
  Duties of the envoys presented in our side's draft of 
agreement that was revised and supplemented include discussions 
on the implementation of the Joint Declaration on 
Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, joint measures to be 
taken immediately to implement the North-South agreement, 
pending issues of mutual interest, and a meeting between the top 
authorities of the North and the South. In addition to these, 
issues on the easing of tensions between the North and the 
South, the maintenance of national self-reliance [minjok 
chajusong], the promotion of the great national unity, and the 
method to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of 
the fatherland are presented in detail in our side's draft. 
These issues are not included in that of the South side. 
  The epochal [hoekkijogin] draft of agreement revised by our 
side is a fair one that was made by taking the South side's 
intent into consideration. It is also a reasonable one that will 
enable the envoy exchange to help make practical improvements to 
North-South relations and opening a new phase in resolving the 
country's reunification issue. 
  In today's contact, our side repeatedly urged the South side 
to express a satisfactory [naptukhalmanhan] attitude in any form 
toward the four just demands we made to hasten a complete 
solution to problems regarding practical procedure [silmu 
cholcha munjerul wanjonhi kyolsokchikko] and to realize an 
exchange of envoys as soon as possible. 
  In the contact, the South side, instead of expressing a 
clear 
attitude toward our principled demands before discussing 
practical issues, repeated absurd remarks that create obstacles 
and are unnecessary, creating obstacles to the discussions on 
issues. 
  The South side even deliberately raised an issue that has no 
relation to the discussions on the practical procedure and 
blemish the atmosphere of the talks, assuming an extremely 
provocative attitude. 
  Immediately raising such absurd remarks and acts by the 
South 
side as an issue, our side has branded them as its declaration 
to give up the working-level contact and sternly warned against 
it. The South side, which was at a loss for answers, has 
attempted to make an excuse for its wrong act. 
  Regarding the South side's remarks that it has never 
conducted, even one time, a large-scale nuclear war exercise, 
our side maintained that this is a preposterous sophistry, and 
that this is not an attitude of dialogue, but rather an attitude 
of continuously pursuing a position of confrontation. 
  Our side said that the South side's attempt to not accept 
our 
side's just demand that it give up the international cooperation 
system shows that the South side gives priority to outside 
forces over the nation, and that it admits itself to the nature 
of its dependency upon outside forces and anti-national 
position. Also, our side stressed that if the South side 
continues pursuing the international cooperation system with the 
backing of outside forces, it will raise the grave consequence 
in which our nation can fall a victim of great powers. 
  Our side said: In its character, the exchange of the 
North-South special envoys must succeed if it is prepared. It 
must also satisfy the expectation of our nation as a sincere and 
fruitful dialogue. If the exchange of special envoys is either 
suspended or broken once again -- like other dialogues in the 
past -- by the nuclear war exercise or any other factors after 
it began, it will be difficult to hold the North-South dialogue 
again. Although the South side regrets its act at a time when 
the North-South dialogue is not held, an opportunity would never 
come again. 
  Based on the sincere position to overcome, by any means, the 
prevailing obstacles and to conclude the working-level contact, 
our side has proposed a tete-a-tete contact between the heads of 
the two side. Following this, the contact between the heads of 
the two sides was held. 
  The North and South side have agreed to hold the next sixth 
round of their working-level contact at the South side's area of 
Panmunjom on 12 March.

<F P=106> ["Trite Stance of Confrontation" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- At a time when the 
working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the 
North and the South is under way, the Kim Yong-sam group started 
on March 7 military exercises directed against the North in 
Inchon and Kyonggi Province which will last till the 14th. 
Commenting on this, papers here today say this clearly 
indicates that the Kim Yong-sam group has no willingness to 
resolve the questions of the peace and reunification of the 
country and is going to invariably seek confrontation and war 
this year, too. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: 
  If the South Korean rulers are willing to solve the pending 
issues between the North and the South through dialogue and 
negotiation by realizing the exchange of special envoys, they 
must not do acts getting on the other's nerve. 
  Recently, the traitor Kim Yong-sam impudently cried that 
they 
"could not be optimistic" about North-South relations and "the 
United States would not hold the third round of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks before the exchange of special envoys." His remarks fully 
revealed his sinister intention to balk the DPRK-U.S. talks, 
obstruct the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula, persistently seek North-South confrontation and thus 
slay the fellow countrymen in the North with outside forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group decided to introduce into South Korea 
U.S. Patriot missiles which had been used in the Persian Gulf 
war and is now welcoming the deployment of two groups of Apache, 
a main attack helicopter belonging to the U.S. Army, in South 
Korea. And it does not bother to conceal its plan to stage a 
large-scale nuclear war exercise with outside forces. 
  With the Kim Yong-sam group, "civilian" warmaniacs 
desperately trying to plunge the nation into a nuclear 
holocaust, left alone, is it impossible to solve the questions 
of peace and reunification through dialogue and negotiation or 
save our fellow countrymen from another war disaster. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says that the Kim Yong-sam group is 
attempting to frighten the North and ensure the "security of 
power" with reckless war gambles, but all in vain.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- These days words are 
abroad in the high-placed quarters of the South Korean 
"Democratic Liberal Party" (DLP) complaining at the call of U.S. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard for the abolition 
of the "National Security Law" (NSL), according to a radio 
report from Seoul. 
  The traitor Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the "DLP", voiced 
opposition to the call, grumbling that the speech of Hubbard was 
problematic. The "chief of the DLP's Policymaking Committee" 
expressed "apprehensions" over the official position of the 
United States calling for the abolition of the "NSL", terming it 
"an interference in the internal affairs". 
  Such outbursts of the South Korean puppet clique ignoring 
the 
unbiased public opinion are an open challenge to all the fellow 
countrymen who want to see the notorious "NSL" scrapped, bring 
the North-South dialogue to a success at an early date and thus 
to achieve the reunification of the country. It is a graphic 
manifestation of the puppets' anti-national, anti-reunification 
stand. 
  What must not be overlooked is that the puppets let loose 
such preposterous remarks as "the North's line of reunification 
through the communization of the South" and "human rights 
situation of the North", connecting the question of the 
maintenance of the "NSL" with the North. 
  Their malicious abuses and slander against the North are 
nothing but despicable attempts to conceal their grisly human 
rights problem and, all the same time, to suppress the South 
Korean people's struggle for independence, democracy and 
reunification and block the North-South dialogue and 
reunification of the country at any cost by preserving the "NSL". 
  For peace on the Korean peninsula and a peaceful 
reunification of the country the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must 
be removed and such fascist laws as the "NSL" be scrapped in 
South Korea without delay.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Japan's Nuclear Armament </F>
Maneuvers Have Reached a Dangerous Stage"] 
  [Text] According to reports, Japan's Monju, a fast breeder 
reactor built in Tsuruga city, Fukui Prefecture, will soon begin 
operating as the transportation of plutonium fuel needed has 
been completed. This is one of Japan's undisguised attempts to 
secure large quantities of plutonium for itself so as to produce 
nuclear weapons at any time and become a nuclear power. 
  Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers are accelerating to a 
very 
dangerous stage. According to data, Japan, which has stockpiled 
26 tonnes of plutonium, will increase its reserve to 100 tonnes 
by 2010. This is a huge amount, enough for over 10,000 nuclear 
bombs. 
  Japan has developed not only elements and technology for the 
production of a nuclear bomb, including the electronic 
destructive device, but also devices for long-range nuclear 
transportation. This has been proven by the fact that Japan 
developed the large long-range H-2 rocket, which can be used as 
an inter-continental ballistic missile in February 1994. 
  The world believes that it is only a matter of time until 
Japan will produce nuclear weapons. A Western paper reported 
that Japan may have already produced them. In fact, Japan could 
become a nuclear power in a very short time whenever it is 
determined to do so. These facts clearly show to what a 
dangerous stage Japan's nuclear armament has come. 
  What cannot be overlooked is that Japanese authorities and 
politicians, who are promoting full-scale nuclear armament, are 
playing mean making an issue out of the so-called nuclear issue 
of ours. Former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone recently raved 
that the UN Security Council should keep the possibility of 
imposing economic sanctions open in case we refuse special 
inspections. Japanese Foreign Minister Hata said the pressure 
for inspection on our military facilities will increase and 
urged that measures be taken to dispel suspicion over nuclear 
weapons development. 
  As everyone knows, there is no mention of "special 
inspection" in the recently announced agreement reached at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. In any regard, Japan is not in a 
position to intervene in the resolution of the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula. The reason the Japanese reactionaries 
have recently started playing mean by becoming more feverish in 
the special inspection commotion is to impede the settlement of 
the nuclear issue and find a pretext for the lawful promotion of 
the nuclear armament, which has reached the danger line. 
  It is the most vicious and shameless intention of the 
Japanese reactionaries that they are picking on others while it 
is themselves who are accelerating the nuclear armament. It is 
not difficult to estimate how enormous the effect on the peace 
of Asia and the world might be when the Monju fast breeder 
reactor begins operating and large quantities of plutonium are 
secured for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. 
  Some Japanese reactionaries even insist on becoming a 
military power and dispatching more of the Self-Defense Forces 
overseas saying that Japan lost World War II because it was 
weak. It is obvious that our country may become a nuclear 
victim when the neighboring Japan, which is making every attempt 
to realize its old dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity 
Sphere, is even armed with nuclear weapons. 
  The denuclearization of Northeast Asia cannot be realized 
when Japan is arming itself with nuclear weapons. The 
North-South joint declaration on denuclearization will be 
invalid, and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will 
be virtually meaningless. 
  It is not a coincidence that the people of Asia and around 
the world, including our people, are showing grave concern over 
Japan's nuclear armament. It is a common desire of humanity to 
live in a peaceful world free of nuclear threat. People across 
the world should block and destroy Japan's maneuver to smoke 
nuclear clouds, running counter to mankind's wish. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must correctly realize the dear 
price they must pay for their maneuvers for nuclear armament and 
nuclear power and immediately abandon their criminal nuclear 
ambition.

Association was held in Harare, Zimbabwe on February 24. 
  Chairman of the association N.T. Mawema stressed in his 
report that the Korean people achieved great success in 
socialist construction, pushed aside the anti-DPRK and the 
anti-socialist moves of the imperialists and renegades of 
socialism and firmly defended the sovereignty of the DPRK under 
the tested guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il last 
year. He called for conducting the active solidarity movement 
for defence of socialist Korea. 
  The general meeting discussed the question of significantly 
celebrating the 82nd birthday of the great leader President Kim 
Il-song and a series of measures for firm solidarity with the 
Korean people in their efforts to solve the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula through the DPRK-USA negotiation.

<F P=106> ["Famous Work on Building Revolutionary Armed Forces of </F>
Chuche" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article on the lapse of 60 years since the great 
leader President Kim Il-song published the famous work "On 
Reorganizing the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army Into the 
Korean People's Revolutionary Army." 
  In the famous work on March 9, 1934, President Kim Il-song 
indicated a highly important guideline in the building of 
chuche-oriented revolutionary Armed Forces. Thus, he opened a 
new phase in the Army building and strengthened the combat 
capability of the revolutionary Armed Forces as required by the 
developing situation so as to expand the anti-Japanese armed 
struggle. 
  The author of the article says: 
  The great leader's work is a historic work which indicated 
the way of building chuche-oriented revolutionary Armed Forces 
on the basis of a scientific analysis of the lawful requirement 
of the military and political situation and the development of 
the guerrilla Army and the prospect of the revolutionary 
struggle to accomplish the cause of national liberation. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: 
  "We must reorganize the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla 
Army 
into the Korean People's Revolutionary Army without delay as 
required by the prevailing military and political situation and 
the development of the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla Army." 
  In the work, the great leader said the Korean People's 
Revolutionary Army (KPRA) should be organised in the system of a 
regular Army and, at the same time, in such a system that it 
could strictly observe the principle of guerrilla warfare, 
taking it into consideration that the anti-Japanese armed 
struggle was being waged in the form of a guerrilla warfare 
against the regular Armed Forces of Japanese imperialism. He 
also formulated the organisational system of the KPRA. 
  He said the division, regiment, company, platoon and squad 
of 
the KPRA should be organised in a three-unit system, that the 
company should be defined as the main combat unit as required by 
the guerrilla warfare and that the KPRA units should be formed 
on the principle of strengthening the companies to the maximum. 
  In forming the units, unified command of the headquarters of 
the KPRA should be guaranteed and, to this end, the general 
staff should be strengthened and its role be enhanced as fully 
as possible, he said. 
  In the work, he put forward the policy of organizing the 
party committee of the KPRA in keeping with the reorganization 
of the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla Army into the KPRA. 
  As the great leader organized the party committee of the 
KPRA 
and enhanced its role, the KPRA party committee could smoothly 
give unified guidance to all the party committees and 
organisations within the KPRA and correctly guide the Korean 
revolution as a whole as the supreme leadership body. 
  With the great leader's unique idea of Army building fully 
embodied in forming the KPRA, the KPRA grew to be invincible 
revolutionary Armed Forces and played a decisive role in 
achieving victory in the anti-Japanese armed struggle. 
  The Korean People's Army [KPA], the heir to the glorious 
anti-Japanese armed struggle, defeated the U.S. imperialist 
aggressor forces that had boasted of being the "strongest" in 
the world. The KPA has grown stronger to be 
one-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary Army firmly prepared 
politically and ideologically and in military technique under 
the wise leadership of its supreme commander, respected General 
Kim Chong-il.

<F P=106> [Speech by Kang Song-san, member of the Workers Party of </F>
Korea Central Committee Political Bureau, and premier of the 
Administration Council, at a national agricultural meeting held 
on 25 February at Pyongyang gymnasium--recorded] 
  [Text] Comrades: Today, at a time when all of the people 
across the country are accelerating the general march of 
socialism with the overflowing dignity and honor of being 
victors, greeting the 30th anniversary of the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song's publication of the theses on the socialist 
rural question in our country, we are holding the national 
agricultural meeting with the joy of having achieved a bumper 
harvest last year. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's publication of the 
great theses on the socialist rural question 30 years ago was an 
event of historic significance in achieving the victory of the 
chuche socialist cause and the eternal grandeur and prosperity 
of our fatherland and people. [applause] 
  The period of 30 years cannot be said to have been lengthy 
in 
the course of socialist construction which brings the people's 
independent and creative life into full bloom. Furthermore, the 
30-year period is merely a short, momentary period for creating 
a new socialist life in our countryside when considering the 
fact that even after the socialist system was established, many 
legacies remained from the old society when our countryside was 
the target of feudal exploitation and imperialistic plundering. 
  Over the past 30 years, however, our party and people have 
made epochal changes in all sectors of socialist rural 
construction by vigorously advancing along the road illuminated 
by the great rural theses. [applause] 
  In his historic letter to the current national agricultural 
meeting, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song extensively summed 
up the brilliant successes that our people and agricultural 
working people achieved in implementing the rural theses under 
our party's leadership and brilliantly illuminated the brilliant 
future of our country's rural economy and its future struggle 
task. [applause] 
  The party Central Committee in its congratulatory message 
highly assessed and warmly congratulated the great victory won 
by our people and agricultural working people during the past 30 
in the implementation of the rural theses. [applause] 
  All participants of the national meeting exude the great 
emotion and happiness of receiving the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song's historic letter and the party Central Committee's 
congratulatory message, and they are also filled with even 
firmer determination to accelerate the socialist rural 
construction cause by brilliantly fulfilling the programmatic 
task presented in the letter. [applause] 
  This current national agricultural meeting was convened amid 
the great interests and expectations of all the people and the 
agricultural working people not only to sum up the brilliant 
victory won in the implementation of the rural theses under the 
wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], but also 
to discuss the struggle task of the agricultural sphere to 
accelerate the chuche socicalist cause by further consolidating 
and developing the socialist rural economic system of our 
country and by exalting its superiority. The meeting will 
become the victors' meeting summing up the implementation of the 
task illuminated in the rural theses. It is a meeting of 
singlehearted unity. It will become not only an event which 
effects a new turn in the development of the rural economy of 
our country, but also an event of historic significance in the 
struggle of our people and agricultural working people to 
accelerate socialist construction. [applause] 
  Comrades, correctly solving the rural question by winning 
victory in the socialist revolution and by establishing the 
socialist system is a principled problem related to the success 
or failure in the socialist cause. 
  We can strengthen chuche of the revolution and fortify the 
socialist bases in the rural communities politically, 
ideologically, materially, and technologically only if we 
correctly solve the socialist rural question. Also, the final 
victory of socialism can be won by removing the difference 
between urban and rural communities, as well as the class 
difference between the working class and farmers. 
  Correctly solving the socialist rural question has emerged 
as 
a more pressing issue as imperialists and reactionaries attempt 
to block the victorious advance of socialism by imperialists and 
reactionaries and crudely slander the socialist rural economic 
system in order to weaken its driving force. 
  At a time when we desperately need to elucidate the future 
road of the socialist rural communities internationally or 
domestically, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has published 
the "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country," an 
immortal classic, by deeply grasping the importance of the need 
to solve the rural question in the socialist society. As a 
result, he defined the most correct way for socialist rural 
construction. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In the 
"Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country," our 
party illuminated the basic principles and ways to finally 
solving the peasant and agricultural questions after the 
establishment of the socialist system, and rallied the whole 
party, the whole country, and all people to implement them. 
  The basic ideology in implementing the rural theses is that 
the working class firmly adhere to the principle of the party, 
state, and revolution; vigorously and highly display the 
superiority of the socialist collectivist economy by 
continuously advancing the revolution, and fully guarantee the 
independent and creative lives of agricultural workers, the 
masters of rural communities, even after the cooperativization 
of agriculture in rural communities. 
  The first to provide correct answers to all theoretical and 
practical questions in the settlement of the rural questions and 
to break new ground in the development of the revolutionary idea 
of the working class, the rural theses is a classical work and a 
great program of socialist rural construction that has been 
worked out with the man-centered chuche idea as its base. 
[applause] 
  The rural theses of our party opened a broad road for 
revolutionizing the peasants and assimilating them into the 
working class, industrializing and modernizing agriculture to 
elevate the agricultural productive forces to a high degree, and 
building affluent and civilized socialist rural communities so 
that agricultural workers will enjoy independent and creative 
lives as much as they want. [applause] 
  The rural theses sums up the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song's profound and unique ideology and theory and 
far-reaching plan of the socialist and communist construction. 
This is our party's socialist rural construction program. The 
rural theses consistently called forth all of our people and 
agricultural workers toward the large scale struggle to 
construct a new socialist farm, and made it possible to smash 
[chitbusyoborida] the attack and slander by the imperialists and 
reactionaries in the socialist rural economy system by embracing 
the world's revolutionary people with faith and future prospects 
of socialism. 
  It was inevitable to carry out the struggle by our party and 
people for the development of the rural theses by overcoming all 
obstacles and difficulties by themselves while defeating 
antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers that are being 
endlessly continued by the imperialists and reactionaries at a 
time when the country is divided. In particular, socialism was 
frustrated in various countries recently and capitalism was 
restored. As a result of such a situation, the wicked political 
and military blockade and maneuvers of economic sanctions are 
being committed by the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate 
and crush [apsal] our Republic. Therefore, the internal and 
external situation in our country was more complicated and acute 
than ever before, and new and grave barriers and difficulties 
were laid forth in the future road of our revolution. 
  Our people's struggle in the socialist rural construction 
and 
overall socialist construction were conducted under a very tense 
situation, and to strengthen the country's [word indistinct], it 
was inevitable for us to adjust the speed and scope of economic 
development. Thus, it was inevitable to put greater efforts 
into [word indistinct]. However, it was not able to surprise 
our people and agricultural workers, who are fighting for the 
just cause, in any provocation and aggressive maneuver by the 
enemies. It also could not prevent our advance. 
  Our people and agricultural workers who are endlessly loyal 
to the party and the leader are highly upholding the 
revolutionary policy put forth by the party and are carrying out 
the indomitable heroic struggle in accordance with the changed 
situation and in accordance with the demand of our revolution. 
Thus, they firmly defended socialism of our own style centered 
on the popular masses, achieved endless upsurges in all fields 
of socialist construction, and achieved a decisive victory in 
the historical process of carrying out tasks put forth in the 
rural theses. Therefore, they were able to highly rise for the 
ultimate solution of the rural question. [applause] 
  Through the vigorous struggle to implement the rural theses, 
the human remolding work was successfully promoted in our farms 
more than anything else, and the ideological and cultural life 
of the agricultural workers blossomed and developed on a full 
scale. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song presented the human 
remolding work in the rural theses as the most important task in 
socialist rural construction, uprooted the old ideology which 
remained among the farmers, and elucidated the way to put in the 
forefront the ideological revolution so that they can be armed 
with the advanced working class revolutionary ideology. 
  According to the task of the rural theses to (?carry out) 
the 
ideological revolution, the ideological and indoctrination work 
to revolutionize and achieve working classification of the 
farmers were strengthened. Therefore, all of our agricultural 
workers were firmly armed with our party's revolutionary 
ideology, chuche ideology, and socialist ideology, and also the 
farm's chuche idea was filled to full capacity. 
  Today, the old ideological trait of society which we 
historically inherited in our farms, is not regarded as a 
problem. Also, all the agricultural workers regard the advanced 
ideology of the working class and the chuche idea as a firm 
faith, and is formed with the strong main force of the 
revolution of single-heartedly uniting around the party and the 
leader through ideological will, morality, and integrity. 
  Recently, the imperialists and reactionaries are viciously 
committing a political and ideological offensive more than ever 
before to destroy faith in socialism in the people's hearts, and 
have extremely aggravated the situation of our country. 
However, our agricultural workers have firm faith only in the 
party and the leader without the slightest wavering, are 
advocating with the do-or-die spirit the party, are smashing 
[chitbusyoborigo] overflowing with faith and optimism all kinds 
of challenges by the enemies, and have firmly defended the 
socialist rural construction. [applause] 
  Our agricultural workers who have traversed the arduous 
road of struggle for independence, reunification, and socialism 
with the party endlessly trust and follow the party and the 
leader [suryong], cherishing in their hearts deep trust and 
loyalty cemented through their actual experiences. They 
unconditionally entrust their destiny and future to our party. 
  Holding aloft the slogan of loyalty -- What the party 
decides, we will do -- our agricultural workers support and 
defend every line and policy of the party; seek value and pride 
on the course of implementing the slogan; and work progressively 
with indomitable grit for the implementation of the party's 
rural policy. This is precisely the ideological and mental 
features of our agricultural working people. 
  Our peasants do not know of all sorts of rotten capitalist 
social evils that destroy one's mental, cultural life, and 
everyone of them treasures the interests of the party and 
revolution and that of the society and group as a master of the 
social group in the society in which it is politically stable. 
They, with their labor exploit, carry out their social duties as 
a socialist worker who is in charge of the nation's rice 
granaries, and highly display the beautiful communist trait of 
helping and leading each other forward under the slogan of one 
for all and all for one. 
  Such a high level of the mental and ideological feature of 
our agricultural workers, the masters of the rural areas, proves 
that our society has been highly developed and that the 
socialist political, ideological framework has been firmly laid 
in our rural areas. [applause] 
  The party and the leader [suryong] believe in the 
agricultural masses, all agricultural workers endlessly trust 
and follow the party and the leader [suryong], and a 
sociopolitical organ in which the leader [suryong], the party, 
and the masses live eternally has been formed: This is the 
grandiose reality of our rural area in which the agricultural 
workers fight vigorously with firm confidence in the victory of 
the socialist cause. [applause] 
  Under the party's leadership, all agricultural workers share 
their life and death with the party, and devotedly strive to 
complete the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause and the 
socialist rural construction. In addition, the great changes in 
the ideological and moral traits and manner of work of our 
peasants have taken place. These are the most precious success 
achieved in our efforts to implement the theses, which is 
incomparable even to millions of tons of rice and herein lies a 
firm guarantee which brings about an endless upsurge in 
agricultural production and prosperity to our rural areas. 
[applause] 
  As a result of the active cultural revolution along with the 
ideological revolution in the rural areas, our peasants have 
grown to be more powerful beings and their cultural living 
conditions have been fundamentally improved. 
  As a result of the cultivation of agrotechnicians and 
experts 
and adult education, the technical and cultural levels of, not 
only the new generation, but also our agricultural working 
people have risen very high, and the conditions for the cultural 
life of the rural inhabitants have greatly improved. 
  Regular universities and colleges of agriculture and such 
study-while-working centers for training technical personnel as 
farm colleges have been firmly built up in each province, at 
which a large number of agrotechnicians and experts are being 
trained. 
  Under the popular policy of our party, water, bus, wire 
radio, and television services have been introduced, clinics 
have developed into hospitals and cozy modern dwelling houses 
have been built in the rural areas. Newspapers, magazines, and 
various books find their way to each peasant household. Thus, 
our countryside has turned into a prospering modern socialist 
countryside good to live and work in, which is little different 
from towns. [applause] 
  All the results achieved on the road of vigorously carrying 
out the ideological and cultural revolution in rural areas, 
revolutionizing the peasant and assimilating them into the 
working class, and improving all aspects of their ideological 
and cultural life proudly show that a great turning point is 
arriving and a brilliant victory has been achieved in the 
implementation of the difficult and complicated human reform 
task presented by the rural theses. [applause] 
  A solid socialist material and technological foundation is 
laid in our rural areas because the four major tasks of rural 
technological revolution are being brilliantly implemented 
through a resolute struggle named the (?construction) of the 
rural theses. Through this, the peasants' independent and 
creative living conditions are satisfactorily guaranteed. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said in earlier days 
that the problem of technological revolution is not a matter of 
technological development to simply improve production capacity, 
but a problem of general society to completely achieve the 
independence of the popular masses. He further defined 
irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and chemical 
application as the four basic tasks of rural technological 
revolution in the rural theses and wisely led the struggle to 
achieve this. [applause] 
  The task of irrigation and electrification of the rural 
economy as presented in the rural theses was achieved on a high 
level long ago in our country since the party's policy for rural 
technological revolution had been successfully implemented. 
[applause] 
  In carrying out the rural technological revolution, our 
party 
consistently prioritized irrigation. This policy is the most 
sophisticated and unique policy based on a general analysis of 
the characteristics of agricultural production, which is much 
affected by nature, and our country's weather conditions. In 
the early days of the construction of the new society, the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song personally stood in the front line to 
guide large-scale nature transforming projects and orderly led 
the great struggle to complete the irrigation in rural areas for 
our people's long-cherished desire of the century -- to solve 
the water problem. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song presented a unique idea 
that rice farming is water farming, and the most important 
fundamental of rice farming is water. He devoted his efforts to 
establish a policy of irrigating paddies, which account for a 
large part of our country's agricultural production, and had it 
finished in a short period. Based on the results, he also 
wisely led the all-people struggle to complete the irrigation of 
nonpaddy fields so our country has the most developed and 
powerful irrigation system that could reap rich and stable 
harvests under any natural conditions. 
  Particularly, based on the brilliant achievement of the 
construction of Sohae lock gate -- a great monumental creation 
-- through the heroic struggle of our people, soldier, and 
constructors, a 2,000-ri waterway was built recently to 
completely solve the water problem in rich grain districts, and 
the great nature transforming project of connecting the Taedong 
River and Yesong River, Amnok River and Taeryong River into one 
great irrigation channel was victoriously carried out so as to 
more satisfactorily fulfill the increasing demand for water in 
our rural areas. 
  Along with the irrigation construction, the party's policy 
to 
vigorously carry out drainage works simultaneously was 
brilliantly implemented and numerous small and large pumping 
stations and thousands of kilometers of drains have been 
constructed, rivers and streams were rearranged, embankments 
were built, reforestation works were widely carried out, and 
crop damage due to standing and dirty water were completely 
eliminated in our rural areas. 
  The irrigation system in our country is a system that 
thoroughly reaches all paddies and fields from flat areas to 
mountain villages. It is the most reasonably established mighty 
irrigation system in which major irrigation networks are linked 
to circulate. In addition, irrigation methods vary according to 
geographical conditions: pumping stations, 
transportation-style, and constant irrigation. 
  Indeed, the irrigation facilities in our rural areas 
provided 
by the wise leadership of our party are perfect [word 
indistinct] which guarantees the endless development of our 
agriculture, and are brilliant creations that demonstrate the 
invincible great might of our party and people and the great 
might of popular masses-centered socialism of our own style. 
Our country has become a proud country in the world with 
developed irrigation and an exemplary country in which 
irrigation has been completed. [applause] 
  With the accomplishment of the electrification task put 
forward by the agricultural theses, the electrification of our 
farms has reached a very high level. 
  With a view to meeting the daily-increasing electricity 
demand on a securer basis, our party put forward the policy of 
simultaneously building large-scale hydroelectric and 
thermoelectric power stations as well as building small- and 
medium-size power stations in many places. Our party saw to it 
that the struggle to implement the policy was vigorously carried 
out. 
  The construction of large-scale hydroelectric and 
thermoelectric power stations was actively pushed ahead during 
the Third Seven-year Plan period in compliance with the party's 
correct electrification policy, and many small- and medium-size 
power stations were built throughout the country. As a result, 
the nation's power bases have been further strengthened. 
  Thanks to the chuche-oriented electric power and energy 
provided in our country, the electric power used by our farms in 
a year increased 8.6 times from that in 1963 and the scope of 
the use of electricity in the rural economy has been constantly 
expanded. 
  With the rapid development of and under the vigorous support 
by the chuche-oriented industry, a turning point was effected in 
the mechanization and scientification of the rural economy. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward the work of 
emancipation of peasants, who suffered various hardships for a 
long time because of difficult and arduous labor, as a lofty 
historic mission assigned to the revolutionaries of our era, and 
wisely led the struggle for mechanization and the application of 
science in the rural economy. 
  Thanks to the nation's powerful mechanical industry, the 
party's policy for building agricultural machine production 
bases has been carried to accomplishment. As a result, tractor 
and truck production bases have been firmly built and 
agricultural machine production plants have been constructed in 
the central and local areas. Accordingly, various efficient 
agricultural machines and tools suitable for practical 
situations in farms have been produced and supplied to farms on 
a large scale. 
  To meet the daily-increasing demand for tractors and 
trucks--the most important technological means in agricultural 
production--our party took a comprehensive step of epochally 
increasing productivity in the Kumsong tractor complex in the 
seventies and of constantly strengthening the material and 
technological foundation in the Sungni truck complex. Our party 
also saw to it that a new production base for truck engines was 
built. 
  As a result, the number of tractors serving the rural 
economy 
sector increased six times and trucks five times for the past 30 
years. Thanks to this, the comprehensive mechanization of the 
rural economy in our country today has reached a lofty stage and 
all farming works, from the cultivation of paddies and farms to 
sawing, seedling, weeding, harvesting and threshing, are carried 
out by machines. 
  Repair bases were firmly built in all provinces, cities, 
counties and cooperative farms in compliance with the increased 
mechanization in farms. At the same time, the work of training 
of tractor and truck operators was strengthened and the ranks of 
operators serving the rural economy were increased. 
  With the use of chemicals in the rural economy, a greater 
amount of chemical fertilizers was produced and supplied to 
farms. Thus, the amount of chemical fertilizer production for a 
chongbo [2.45 acres] of paddies and fields reached over nine 
tons, far surpassing the goal set forth in the rural theses, and 
various kinds of chemical fertilizers were combined reasonably 
and their qualitative (?constitution) was improved. 
  The scientific manuring system, in which various kinds of 
fertilizers are manured according to the characteristics of the 
soil and to the unique nature of the growing crops, was 
established. As a result, economic efficiency in the manuring of 
chemical fertilizers was enhanced and (?productivity) in each 
area was expanded. The quantity of grains produced on the basis 
of quantity of manured nitrogen fertilizer has been ensured 
satisfactorily in accordance with a (?1:10 ratio). 
  Self-reliant agricultural chemicals and herbicides 
production bases were firmly built in our country under the 
party's wise leadership and efficient agricultural chemicals and 
herbicides were produced and satisfactorily supplied to the 
farms. Thus, harmful insects were eliminated through 
agricultural chemicals. By introducing various biological 
agricultural chemicals and vegetation growth adjustment 
elements, we protected and managed grains with a scientific 
method. 
  With the implementation of an irrigation system, the 
electrification, mechanization and the use of chemicals in the 
rural economy, peasants were emancipated from difficult and 
arduous labor and the agricultural productivity was rapidly 
developed even while peasants worked easily and joyfully. This 
brilliant achievement clearly proved that we won a proud victory 
in implementing the tasks of a rural technological revolution 
set forth in the rural theses and that we have far advanced in 
industrializing and modernizing agriculture by reforming the 
society. [applause] 
  Through the persistent struggle to carry to accomplishment 
the rural theses, a great advance was effected in the domain of 
reforming social relations in conformity with the socialist 
demand in the farms. 
  Social relations in farm and ownership over production means 
are closely linked with the state's guidance system and method 
on the agricultural cooperative economy. The correct resolution 
of the issue of guidance and management of the rural economy has 
a great impact on the development of ownership. 
  The new agricultural guidance system created by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song is a most superior agricultural 
guidance system which enabled us to precisely combine the 
party's unitary guidance, the nation's political interest, 
democracy, and creativeness by brilliantly embodying the demands 
of the Chongsanri spirit and method and the Taean work system in 
the guidance and management of the rural economy. This system 
also enabled us to constantly improve and strengthen the 
management and operation of the socialist cooperative economy 
and to successfully push ahead with the work of (?developing) 
ownership and economic management. 
  Through the struggle to epochally demonstrate the 
superiority 
of the new agricultural technological system, which regards the 
management committee of a county cooperative farm as the basis, 
the difficult and complex problems in guiding and managing the 
rural economy have been excellently solved in our country based 
on the principle of collectivism and according to the original 
nature of socialism. The guidance of enterprises through the 
management committee of a county cooperative farm and material 
and technological support by the state have been strengthened. 
As a result, advanced business management of industry and 
production culture have been widely disseminated to farms, and 
differences between industry and agriculture in the fields of 
business management and ownership over production means have 
been successfully reduced. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's unique idea and 
policy 
on business units and strongholds in socialist rural 
construction have been brilliantly embodied. As a result, 
organizations in counties, including the management committee of 
county cooperative farms, satisfactorily carried out their 
missions under the guidance of the county party committee. The 
position and role of the county in the overall socialist 
construction, including rural construction, have been 
drastically enhanced. 
  Today all counties in our country are a comprehensive unit 
that (?consolidates) local economic foundation and links cities 
and farms in all fields of politics, the economy, and culture. 
They are excellently fulfilling their missions as the stronghold. 
  As the work of reforming men, nature and society has been 
successfully carried out in the farm, the party's 
agriculture-first policy and chuche agricultural method have 
been thoroughly carried out. As a result, our agricultural 
production is constantly developing. 
  The grain production in our farms has increased 1.9 times, 
and of these grains, rice production increased 1.8 times and 
corn 2.2 times in the past 30 years since the rural theses were 
published. 
  After 1973, when the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
provided a watershed of turn by standing at the van of the 
agricultural front, our agriculture has been raised onto a 
higher scientific and technological foundation. Our agriculture 
again effected a new upsurge in harvesting bumper crops by 
overcoming serious damages caused by cold weather and abnormal 
low temperatures that lasted for a long time last year in the 
wake of the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural 
theses. [applause] 
  The work to acquire new land was actively pushed ahead 
across the country, increasing the farmland area. The 
nationwide field plowing campaign improved the soil's fertility. 
With the brisk campaign of winning the title of high-yield 
county, the cities and counties producing over 100,000 tons and 
150,000 tons of grain, such as Sukchon County and Pyongwon 
County, South Pyongan Province, Anak County and Yonan County, 
South Hwanghae Province, and the cooperative farms producing 
over 10,000 tons, such as the (Sungjon) cooperative farm in 
Chungsan County, have been further increased. In particular, the 
(Yoltu) and (Samcho) cooperative farms in Sukchon County, which 
could produce only some 4,000 tons 30 years ago, were successful 
in producing some 20,000 tons of grain. 
  With the comprehensive embodiment of the [word indistinct] 
agricultural method based on the right crop-in-the right time 
principle and the early farming method and with the thorough 
realization of the demands of the chuche agricultural method 
based on the farming system by farming processes, the grain 
output per chongbo of farming land has reached a very high level 
in our country, thus bringing forth an innovation of producing 
eight to 15 tons of rice and corn from the land which used to 
produce two to three tons per chongbo. 
  With the implementation of the party's policy of developing 
various kinds of produce giving fundamental emphasis to the 
production of grain, all areas of agricultural production, such 
as meat, vegetables, fruit, cocoon, and industrial products, as 
well as grain, are developing rapidly in all units, including 
Kaechon, Unjon County, Yonggang County, (Saengsang County), 
(Changwon County), and Samsok-kuyok. 
  With the rapid development of agricultural production in the 
grand struggle since the publication of the rural theses and 
with greater state support and cooperation to systematically 
relieve the farmers of their burdens, all the cooperative farms 
in our country have grown to be mighty, large-scale socialist 
collective bases with their own solid production and financial 
foundation, and the lives of our farmers are improving with each 
passing day. 
  In our rural areas, the agricultural tax payment-in kind 
system was abolished long ago. Now our farmers do not know of 
the word tax. They, just like workers, enjoy as affluent and 
happy lives as those who live in urban areas do, enjoying all 
sorts of state and social benefits such as free education, free 
medical care, sick leave, paid holidays, fuel supply, and 
(?acknowledgement of social accomplishment). 
  With the three revolutions vigorously conducted in rural 
areas, the farmers' standard of ideological consciousness, 
technology, and culture has been enhanced, the material and 
technological base of agriculture strengthened, and the gap 
between industry and agriculture and between urban and rural 
areas has been reduced in all fields. Therefore, all the 
conditions necessary to convert cooperative ownership to 
all-people ownership are being formed more smoothly in our 
country. 
  All the successes the rural areas have achieved in the 
struggle to remake the relations among man, nature, and society 
show that a momentous upturn is being made on the road of 
ultimately solving the rural problem. With the great victory of 
the rural theses, our rural areas have been turned into the most 
advanced and prosperous socialist rural areas. [applause] 
  The brilliant victory of the rural theses is a great 
historical event that took place in the rural areas in addition 
to the land reform after the 1945 national liberation and the 
introduction of agricultural cooperative in the post-war period. 
This is the victory of our party's socialist rural area building 
program and the victory of the might of the wholehearted unity 
of our people and agricultural working people firmly united 
around the party and the leader. [applause] 
  This brilliant victory is a proud fruition which can only be 
achieved in the chuche Korea, the chollima country led by the 
great leader and the great party where the popular mass centered 
our-style socialism has firmly taken root and is in full bloom. 
[applause] 
  The great victory of the rural theses is a historical 
victory 
that enables all our people and agricultural working people to 
have even firmer faith in the justness and invincibility of the 
cause of socialism and strengthens the might of the country and 
casts more resplendent prospective for the future of our 
revolution. [applause] 
  The brilliant victory of the rural theses will give greater 
strength and encouragement to the South Korean people who are 
waging a brave struggle for independence, democracy, and the 
country's reunification and to the world's revolutionary people 
who are launching themselves into a new struggle for socialism. 
It will deal the imperialists and reactionaries a blow of 
horror and despair. [applause] 
  Comrades: The epochal change taking place in our rural areas 
with the brilliant realization of the rural theses is the 
victory of the socialist rural economic system of our popular 
mass-centered country, and the demonstration of its unequalled 
vitality. [applause] 
  Our country's socialist rural economic system is the most 
superior rural economic system of our own style which embodies 
the chuche idea. Our country's socialist rural economic system 
is not something that someone has given us, nor something copied 
from someone else. It is the most independent and 
people-oriented rural economic system our people and 
agricultural working people built on their own in conformity 
with their faith and demand by embodying the rural theses under 
the leadership of the party. 
  Different from our country's socialist rural areas, where 
the 
agricultural production continuously develops and the farmers 
lead independent and creative lives in all areas--political, 
economic, and cultural--with the embodiment of the rural theses, 
agricultural production is in a great crisis in many capitalist 
countries, including Japan, posing a great threat to the 
farmers' existence. 
  In particular, in South Korea, which shares the same border 
with the northern half of the Republic, agricultural production 
is extremely deteriorated because of the ruling bunch's outside 
force-depending policy and antipeople agricultural policy, and 
the farmers are suffering from serious destitution under all 
sorts of exploitation and oppression. As for South Korea's 
agriculture last year, South Korea suffered the worst crop since 
1980 facing an unprecedented severe agricultural crisis. The 
traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique's policy of opening rice market 
brought about serious social and political unrest, leading the 
farmers to the worst wretched life. This pitiable reality in 
clear contrast with the socialist rural areas of the northern 
half of the Republic shows more clearly the superiority and the 
inexhaustible strength of the people-centered our-style 
socialist rural economic system embodying the chuche idea. 
  Our country's socialist rural economic system is the most 
solid and vital rural economic system and advances with firm 
conviction along the road of socialism based on collectivism. 
[applause] 
  Collectivism is the life of socialist society, and the 
socialist rural economic system can be consolidated and its 
superiority can be enhanced only when they are based on 
collectivism. Socialist ownership, formed by the ownership by 
the state and all the people and ownership by a cooperative of 
the means of production is the economic basis of the socialist 
society based on collectivism. 
  Today, while perpetrating more viciously than ever before 
hindrance maneuvers against socialism, the imperialists and 
their errand boys are talking about the so-called superiority of 
the private ownership system based on individualism and 
frantically running wild to destroy socialist ownership. 
However, this is nothing but a foolish act. 
  The reactionary nature of private ownership system based on 
individualism has already been completely proven by history. If 
socialist ownership is dismantled and converted into private 
ownership it is clear that all means of production turned into 
private ownership, regardless of how it is turned into private 
property, will be concentrated into the hands of a handful of 
the exploiting classes, including the privileged classes and 
enterprises. The superiority of the private ownership system the 
imperialists and reactionaries are talking about only means none 
other than an unlimited law of the jungle competition designed 
to amass more wealth. 
  The ownership by the state and all the people and the 
ownership by cooperative of the means of production alike are 
developing rapidly in our country, and the organic combination 
of the two kinds of ownership has been successfully achieved. As 
a result, all cooperative farms have been firmly developing 
toward the direction of becoming large-scale cooperative farms 
under the ownership (?of all the people). 
  In our rural communities, firmly uniting in a comradely 
manner and helping and leading each other, all the agricultural 
working people are waging large-scale nature remaking projects, 
which are inconceivable under the private farming system or 
under the small-scale farming system, and they are constantly 
and quickly developing their agricultural production. This is 
precisely because they base their farming on the large-scale 
socialist collectivist rural economy and firmly rely on its 
superiority. 
  Our country's socialist rural economic system embodies the 
working class' most revolutionary (?position) in which the party 
and the state look after and lead to the end the peasants' 
living and destiny in a responsible manner. [applause] 
  How the party and the state of the working class deal with 
the peasants' living and their future under the socialist system 
is a principled matter related to the consolidation and 
development of the socialist rural economic system and its 
prospect. As they led peasants to carry out the revolution and, 
thus, changed the old social system, the working class party and 
state should strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, which is 
the political basis of the socialist society and should look 
after and lead peasants to the end even after the establishment 
of the socialist system. 
  Without the working class party's leadership and the state's 
support peasants cannot embark on the road of socialism, nor can 
they advance to the end along the single road of socialism, and 
nor can they enhance the superiority of the socialist rural 
economic system. 
  The incomparable superiority and vitality of the socialist 
rural economic system, which are being highly enhanced with each 
passing day in our country, are possible thanks to our party's 
leadership within the socialist collectivist economy and 
peasants being strengthened and to the state's guidance and 
support constantly being deepened. Indeed, our country's popular 
masses-centered socialist rural economic system, which has 
embodied the chuche idea, is a most superior rural economic 
system under which the agricultural working people have become 
the master of everything and everything in society serves them. 
[applause] 
  The epochal changes achieved in our country's rural 
communities on the strength of the embodiment of the rural 
theses and today's realities of our country are evoking great 
admiration among the people of the world and enjoy their praise. 
Our country has had a 5,000-long history since the Tangun Korea 
was founded on the [word indistinct] sacred land at the dawn of 
the (?history) of mankind. However, there has been no time as 
today when our rural communities are opulent and prosperous and 
when our fatherland's honor and might are being highly 
demonstrated as we witness in the era of the Workers Party 
called after the dignified name of our great party. [applause] 
  All brilliant victories and successes achieved in the 
struggle for the implementation of the socialist rural theses in 
the past are a noble result of the wise leadership of the party 
and the leader [suryong]. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song--who had provided the 
deep and strong historic roots for a solution to the rural 
question in our country and who had solved uniquely and on a 
chuche-oriented basis the peasants' question, that is, the 
agricultural question, which arose in the stages of the 
anti-imperialist and antifeudal revolution for democracy and the 
socialist revolution--presented the "Theses on the Socialist 
Rural Question," and, thus, he gave perfect ideological and 
theoretical explanations to all difficult and complicated 
problems arising in socialist rural construction, and wisely led 
the struggle for their realization. [applause] 
  Our party, the great organizer and guide of the struggle for 
the implementation of the rural theses, presented the cardinal 
direction that should be firmly grasped in the realization of 
the rural theses at every stage according to the respected and 
beloved leader's farsighted plan and ways for its realization. 
At the same time, the great leader vigorously organized and 
mobilized the entire party, the whole country, and all the 
people into the rewarding struggle for the implementation of the 
rural theses. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's leadership in solving 
the socialist rural question is a model of the revolutionary 
leadership, which makes it possible to firmly adhere to the 
socialist principles in all sectors of rural construction and 
agricultural production and to brilliantly embody them. 
[applause] 
  Attaching particular importance to enhancing the ideological 
consciousness of peasants, who are the masters of rural 
communities in accelerating socialist rural construction and in 
developing agricultural production, the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song has firmly given priority to the ideological revolution 
over all works and, at the same time, has energetically led the 
people to vigorously push ahead with the technological and 
cultural revolutions alike. 
  Even at the time when the internal and external situation 
became very difficult and complicated and when heavy and vast 
tasks arose in succession before our revolution, the great 
leader Marshal Kim Il-song presented the slogan, "Rice Is 
Synonymous With Socialism, Communism," defined the agricultural 
front as one of the main offensive fronts of socialist 
construction, and saw to it that the agricultural working people 
vigorously supported rural communities in all fields of 
politics, the economy, and culture. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has shown a brilliant 
model in scientific farming which most correctly embodies the 
inevitable demands of socialist rural construction by leading 
the struggle for the implementation of the rural theses to 
victory. [applause] 
  With his deep insight into all difficult and complicated 
problems arising in socialist rural construction, the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song has organized work in detail and 
taken measures lest we should lean toward one side and we should 
miss even one problem. 
  As the size of agricultural management becomes larger and 
its 
technical provisions gradually meet the level of demands, the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, by enhancing the superiority 
of chuche-oriented agricultural guidance system of our own style 
which uses county cooperative plant management committee as a 
basis, has seen to it that we constantly improve and strengthen 
large-scale socialist collectivist economic management and 
operation work. At the same time, he has seen to it that while 
enhancing the guidance role of ownership by all the people over 
the ownership by cooperative we prepare with foresight the work 
of gradually converting the ownership by cooperative into 
ownership by all the people. 
  With deep insight into the role of the county in developing 
agricultural production, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
has concentrated great efforts on the work of strengthening the 
county, which is a regional unit, a strong point, linking 
between cities and rural villages in all fields of politics and 
culture, and our party has firmly built county party committees 
in every period and taken active measures so that they can guide 
rural work in a substantial manner. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song created the chuche farm 
method, a most scientific farm method, which is suitable to the 
specific situation of our country, and led peasants, personally 
standing at the head of the agricultural front. Thus, he has 
created an epochal turn in the development of our agricultural 
production. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song led the entire party, 
the entire country, and all the people to wage the grand 
struggle to build socialist rural areas. In this way, he showed 
a brilliant example in leading the masses by implementing the 
popular mass line. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song always stayed among the 
popular masses, listened to their voices, and had their earnest 
desires and aspirations fulfilled, and led them to wage a new 
heroic struggle and bring about feats. 
  Last year, the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song energetically gave guidance to rural work during his 
visits to various rural areas, including a tideland in Taean, 
Yonsa County of North Hamgyong Province, the (Pyongmu) Plateau 
of Yanggang Province, Kwail County of South Hwanghae Province, 
and the Yonbaek Field, an area close to the Demarcation Line. 
[applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's visits to the popular 
masses were visits to educate and awaken them and to mobilize 
them to the struggle to implement the party's policies. They 
were also courses to analyze realities in the rural areas, learn 
the people's aspirations and earnest desires, sum up their 
experiences, and reflect all of them on the lines and policies 
of the party and state. These visits resulted in our prosperous 
and developed socialist rural areas today. [applause] 
  The entire course of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
leadership in building socialist rural areas was filled with his 
warm love and trust for all our agricultural workers. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song talked with peasants at 
dry paddies at wind-swept valleys, wet paddies on mid-summer 
days, or ondol rooms deep into the winter night, took care of 
all their working and living conditions, and extended 
considerable favors to the peasants by resolving problems facing 
them. 
  It is the great leader who first realizes our peasants' 
frustrating problems and their difficulties and resolves them. 
[applause] 
  All the popular masses-centered policies of our party and 
state concerning the rural areas are filled with the great 
fatherly [oboi] love of the great leader, who even worries about 
the peasants' [word indistinct] at a time for transplanting rice 
seedlings, their rain coats during the summer, and [words 
indistinct]. They are also filled with our party's warm favors. 
[applause] 
  Truly, a few words are not enough to fully describe the wise 
leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and our party 
Central Committee's energetic guidance in building socialist 
rural areas. [applause] 
  What do the struggle which was waged for the past thirty 
years to build socialist rural areas and all historic victories 
which were brought about in this process tell us? They tell us 
that the "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our 
Country," which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song presented, 
are the only just guideline that completely eliminates the 
legacies of the outdated society -- which remained in the rural 
areas even after the socialist system was established -- and 
ultimately resolves the rural question and that only when one 
follows the wise leadership of the party and the leader 
[suryong], one can brilliantly complete the cause of building 
socialist rural areas and build an excellent and [word 
indistinct] chuche-oriented socialist society -- which all 
people earnestly desire -- without any deviation, twist, or 
turn. [applause] 
  The cause of liberating peasants, a cause that the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song cultivated in the dawn of the Korean 
revolution and has persistently developed ever since, has 
advanced far under our party's leadership, and we will in the 
near future see the day when we will complete the historic cause 
of building socialist rural areas and fire a salute of guns on 
the complete victory of socialism. [applause] 
  The rural theses, which many people considered to be ideal 
30 years ago, have become a brilliant reality in our rural areas 
today. With the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who has 
brought about this cataclysmic change, in attendance, we today 
are summing up the historic victory of the rural theses. This 
is our people's great honor and a great felicitous revolutionary 
event. [applause] 
  Under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, we 
brilliantly solved the problem involving peasants and the 
agricultural problem, which are difficult and complicated 
problems in building socialism, from the stand of chuche. In 
this way, we showed an example in building socialist rural 
areas. We can proudly talk about this. [applause] 
  Our people and agricultural workers will also in the future 
defend and maintain the most excellent socialist rural economic 
system that the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song established and 
that our party is glorifying. They will also more vigorously 
accelerate the chuche-oriented cause of building socialism. 
  On this meaningful National Agriculture Meeting in which we 
are summing up the rural theses, with the boundless admiration 
and fervent loyalty of all people and agricultural workers, I 
extend the greatest honor and warmest thanks to the great leader 
of our party and our people Comrade Kim Il-song, who built the 
most excellent socialist rural economic system in our country, 
created a brilliant example in solving the socialist rural 
problem, and wisely led our people's long struggle -- to build 
socialism -- to endless upsurges. [applause] 
  Comrades: Today, we have an honorable task to further 
consolidate and develop the rural economic system in our country 
and score new upsurges in agricultural production based on the 
great victories of the rural theses. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song elucidated a militant 
task to thoroughly implement the policy of giving top priority 
to agriculture, the light industry, and foreign trade, a policy 
presented in his New Year's address, his historic letter to this 
meeting, and the decision at the 21st plenary meeting of the 
sixth party Central Committee, and to further accelerate the 
cause of building socialist rural areas. He also elucidated how 
one can carry out this militant task. [applause] 
  The revolutionary economic strategies and tasks to build 
rural areas the party presented are a major guideline that must 
be firmly adhered to in the struggle to fulfill our people's 
earnest desire to eat rice and meat soup, wear silk clothes, and 
live in a tile-roofed house and in the struggle to further 
glorify popular masses-centered socialism of our own style. 
They are also an encouraging banner that calls all our people 
and agricultural workers to a new worthwhile struggle and feats. 
  Scoring endless upsurges in the building of rural areas and 
light-industrial production is a key to success in carrying out 
the party's revolutionary economic strategies. As indicated in 
the old saying "Agriculture is the foundation of a nation," 
nothing is more important than doing farming well and 
satisfactorily solving the food problem. As the saying "Well 
fed, well bred" goes, when we do farming well and have abundant 
food as a result, the people's awareness will improve and we 
will be able to solve the clothing and housing problems smoothly 
and strongly defend socialism and continuously glorify it 
despite the enemy's challenges and aggression maneuvers. 
  In the supply of rice to the people, realizing the communist 
distribution of rice is our party's firm position. 
  We should continuously make innovations and advance in all 
areas of rural construction and agricultural production, firmly 
holding the party's agriculture-first policy. By doing so, we 
should further strengthen the might of the chuche-oriented 
socialist rural economic system. 
  In order to strengthen the socialist rural [word indistinct] 
and to effect a new upsurge in the rural construction and 
agricultural production, we should continue to advance, without 
deviation, along the revolutionary road that the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song elucidated in the "Theses on Our Socialist 
Rural Problems," as we did in the past. 
  Because of their truthfulness and universality, ideologies 
and theories in the rural theses have eternal vitality in the 
struggle to consummate the popular masses' cause of 
independence, and serve as an immortal banner and beacon that 
illuminates the future of socialist rural construction. 
[applause] 
  We should, above all, continue to vigorously carry out the 
ideological revolution in the rural areas, so that we can firmly 
unite all agricultural working people around the party and the 
leader, strengthen the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary 
ranks, and raise them all to be enthusiastic revolutionaries who 
are loyal to the socialist cause. 
  It is an important task we face in the course of the 
ideological revolution today to make all agricultural working 
people have firm faith in and will for the victory of the 
socialist cause. One's ideology that is unswayable and 
invariable under any difficult situation comes from a firm faith 
in the greatness of one's leader [suryong] and one's leader 
[yongdoja]. Faith indoctrination [sinnyom kyoyang] and will 
indoctrination [uiji kyoyang] are essential in helping people 
deeply experience the greatness of the party and the leader 
[suryong]. 
  We should take the greatest care of our revolutionary ranks' 
single-hearted unity hardened as firm as a rock under the 
party's leadership and should further consolidate and develop 
it. We should also have a strong will and the firm belief that 
the chuche socialist cause will achieve the victory without fail 
as long as the leadership of the party and the leader exists, 
and should consider the loyalty to the party and the leader a 
faith, consciousness, a moral, and a routine. 
  Functionaries and working people of the agricultural sector, 
in particular, should highly display the revolutionary spirit of 
self-relience and fortitude. 
  The spirit of self-relience and fortitude is the 
revolutionary spirit based on the economic view that we will 
consummate the revolution and construction with our own 
strength. It is also the invincible fighting spirit of 
defending the revolutionary banner, unyielding under any trial 
or difficulty. 
  Just like we have advanced while upholding the revolutionary 
slogan for self-relience and fortitude, we should smash all 
antisocialist maneuvers by imperialists and reactionaries and 
consummate the socialist cause, upholding this slogan in the 
future, too. "Let Us Vigorously Accelerate the General Onward 
March of Socialism With the Revolutionary Spirit of 
Self-Relience and Fortitude" is called for by our party and is a 
militant slogan that our people should uphold today. [applause] 
  Following all the functionaries and working people in the 
agricultural sector who struggled to increase food [words 
indistinct] in those severe days of war, cities and rural areas 
that were laid to ruin, in an empty land devoid of practically 
anything were reconstructed and effected a great Chollima 
upswing, we should stoutly struggle with the vigor of the 
Chollima speed of the nineties and with the revolutionary spirit 
of self-relience and fortitude. By doing so, we should 
completely implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy 
and greately advance the superiority of the chuche-oriented 
socialist rural economic system to the maximum. 
  Also, we must work so that all the agricultural workers 
enthusiastically concur with the great reality of our system and 
our socialist fatherland and strengthen socialist and patriotic 
indoctrination, so that we can have high spirit and affection 
toward our system and socialist fatherland. In addition, we 
must work so that all the agricultural workers endlessly 
treasure, firmly advocate and adhere to, and endlessly elucidate 
generation after generation the immortal leadership achievements 
of the party and the leader that infinitely devote their energy 
and efforts to provide a gracious socialist system. 
  We must further strengthen collective indoctrination in 
accordance with the intrinsic nature of socialist society among 
the agricultural workers so that they can firmly establish the 
chuche-oriented outlook on life and collective outlook on 
living, and endlessly train themselves through organized life 
and practical production to persistently and assiduously carry 
out farm work from the position of master responsible for the 
country's rice chest. We must also highly display the communist 
virtue in all fields of socialist life and decisively reject all 
kinds of capitalist ideology and out-dated conventionalities 
based on individualism. 
  Continuously pushing ahead with the technological revolution 
on farms is an important task in enhancing agriculture to a 
highly industrial and modern level, making the farmers carry out 
farm work more easily and pleasantly, and in achieving endless 
upsurges in agricultural production. We must consolidate the 
results achieved in irrigation, standardization, mechanization, 
and chemicalization in the rural economy, increase state 
investment in agriculture, and further strengthen the material 
and technological basis, so that a new epoch-making progress can 
be made in agricultural production. 
  We must manage and reinforce the existing irrigation 
facilities in the rural economy section well, and prospectively 
carry out irrigation construction which can sufficiently 
guarantee water in the increasing reclaimed land and new land. 
This is to all the more smoothly solve the demand of [word 
indistinct] irrigation water and actively promote the irrigation 
of the technological land reclamation construction to change the 
pumping water irrigation system into a natural water supply 
system, and thoroughly establish the [words indistinct] system 
so that the [word indistinct] irrigation system of our country 
can bear even more fruit. 
  We must maintain the electricity production technology which 
we have already provided even more, exert efforts to normalize 
production at a high level, quickly finish the construction of 
the on-going construction of power stations, and construct more 
small, and medium-sized power stations through an all-people's 
movement, to smoothly satisfy the demand of electricity which is 
increasing on farms. 
  We must consolidate and develop the results achieved in the 
overall irrigation of the rural economy even more to further 
enhance the mechanization level of the rural sector, and work so 
that farming can be carried out without aid from cooperative 
farms. If the overall mechanization level of the rural economy 
is to be endlessly enhanced, various modern agricultural 
machines such as tractors and trucks must be produced and 
supplied. 
  We must continue to exert efforts for the mechanization of 
the rural economy to smoothly solve the increasing demand of 
tractors and trucks in the farms, and must produce and supply 
more agricultural machines which are necessary in the 
mechanization of difficult work including rice planting, 
removing young rice plants from seedbeds, preparation of the 
ridges of rice-field plots prior to seed transplants, and autumn 
reaping. Also, we must produce and supply more agricultural 
machines that are appropriate for mountainous areas and slopes. 
  We must all the more firmly maintain repair bases including 
tractor spare part plants and agricultural machine work sites, 
expand their capacities, systematically establish the 
agricultural management and operation system, and accelerate 
chemicalization so that the utilization of agricultural machines 
can be enhanced to the utmost. Also, efforts must be 
continuously made in the land readjustment work to provide a 
more favorable condition for the mechanization of agricultural 
work. 
  Under conditions in which our country's agricultural 
development is reaching a high stage, the largest reserve in 
agricultural production is to all the more realize 
chemicalization at a high stage for the rural economy. We must 
work so that the chemical fertilizer plants can strengthen their 
material and technological basis; produce and supply additional 
varieties of chemical fertilizers needed on farms; and work to 
guarantee [word indistinct] element fertilizer including silicon 
fertilizer, slightly burnt magnesia fertilizer, and boron in 
accordance with the assortment of fertilizers. We must actively 
promote and produce organic fertilizers including [word 
indistinct] fertilizer, human decomposed fertilizer, and 
nitrogenous fertilizer whose superiority was proven in recent 
new studies, and [words indistinct]. 
  The rural economy sector should properly carry out 
management of possession and maintenance of chemical fertilizer 
in conformity with its [word indistinct], widely introduce new 
manuring methods, and increase to the maximum the [word 
indistinct] of chemical fertilizer. At the same time, the rural 
economy sector should use more varieties of [word indistinct] 
agricultural chemicals, and herbicide to protect the crops from 
damage from blight and insects and to help weed fields. 
  Vigorously waging the rural cultural revolution on a 
continuous basis is an important task of the agricultural 
working people to enhance the level of their technological 
knowledge and culture and, thus, to build rural communities in a 
more civilized way. 
  We should strengthen education in agricultural colleges and 
agricultural technical schools that study agriculture. Also, we 
should meet the needs of the agricultural sector by training 
more talented personnel with technology by including as many 
cooperative farm members as possible in education institutions, 
like farm colleges, so agricultural working people can study 
while working. We should wage the work of spreading the 
knowledge on agricultural science and technology among the 
agricultural working people through agricultural science and 
technology propaganda rooms and should actively wage mass 
cultural work . Thus, we should enhance the agricultural working 
people's technological and cultural level so that they can lead 
their rural cultural life in a more varied ways. 
  Along with this, we should build more houses for peasants 
and 
make all rural villages more cultural and sanitary and a better 
place to live. 
  By thoroughly implementing the chuche farm method on the 
strength of the firm material and technological foundation of 
our agriculture and the agricultural working people's high 
technological and cultural level this year, when we greet the 
30th anniversary of the publication of the rural theses, we 
should effect another great upsurge in agricultural production 
and lift the development of our agriculture up to the highest 
level. [applause] 
  The rural economy sector should constantly increase the 
ranks 
of county with high yield crops by vigorously waging the 
movement to win the county with high yield crops and should see 
to it that a great upsurge is effected in all agricultural 
production units by waging the struggle to produce grain crops 
of more than 10 tonnes per chongbo [one chongbo is 2.451 acres]. 
  We should not only vigorously accelerate tideland 
reclamation 
work by concentrating all-nation and all-people efforts on it, 
but should also accelerate the projects of infrastructure nets 
so that farming can be properly carried out in already reclaimed 
tidelands. At the same time, we should actively wage the 
struggle to expand tilled land by cultivating hills and idle 
land. 
  The rural economy sector should assiduously manage tilled 
land in the same spirit that peasants displayed in the struggle 
during the arduous period of the fatherland liberation war, 
upholding the slogan of "Let us not leave even an inch of land 
uncultivated," and should see to it that all sectors and units 
strictly abide by the land law. The rural economy sector should 
concentrate all efforts on farming, should farm properly 
according to the demands of the chuche farm method, and should, 
thus, attain production goals for grain crops without fail. It 
should also further develop all sectors of agricultural 
production such as the sectors of vegetable, industrial crops, 
livestock, orchard, and sericulture. The present era is the era 
of science and technology, developing agricultural science is an 
urgent task to rapidly increase agricultural production. 
  All scientists and technicians in the agricultural sector 
should accelerate the green revolution based on already attained 
successes, and should actively pioneer basic sciences and new 
agricultural science, including biology, physiological 
chemistry, cytology, and genetic engineering. Thus, they should 
actively wage research activities to enhance the level of 
intensification, modernization, and scientification of 
agricultural production. 
  We should further strengthen the industrial management 
method 
of guidance to agricultural production and further enhance the 
level of planning and organizing management activities. We 
should thoroughly embody democratic principles in managing and 
operating cooperative farms and vigorously wage the struggle to 
increase production. At the same time, we should properly carry 
out the sub-work team management system and the work team bonus 
system, and further improve and strengthen the labor, property, 
and financial management by establishing the prime cost 
calculation system of agricultural production. 
  By firmly building the material and technological 
foundation of state enterprises serving the rural economy, by 
continuously enhancing the roles of material and technological 
means of state ownership in agricultural production, by 
constantly enhancing the guidance role of ownership by all the 
people over ownership by cooperative farms, and by taking 
measures to gradually convert cooperative farms into farms under 
the ownership system by all the people in the future, we should 
see to it that the ownership by all the people is firmly 
established. 
  Further strengthening rural party work in conformity with 
the 
developing realities is a firm guarantee for accelerating 
overall socialist rural construction. Rural party organizations 
should firmly grasp the party's overall agricultural policies, 
should enhance the responsibilites and awareness of 
administrative and economic functionaries, and, thus, should see 
to it that all the agricultural working people unanimously rise 
up as one in the struggle to implement the party's agricultural 
policies and the chuche farm method, giving priority to the 
party's political work, that is, work with men. 
  Party organizations in the rural economy sector should 
enhance the role of public organizations such as the 
Agricultural Workers Union and the Socialist Working Youth 
League and should wage the movement to win the red flag of the 
three revolutions and the movement to follow and emulate the 
model set by unheralded heros in close combination with the work 
to exalt beautiful communist virtues. Thus, party organizations 
in the rural economy sector should see to it that the 
agricultural working people can devotedly work for the party, 
for the revolution, for society, and for collectives as the 
masters of the socialist collectivist economy. 
  In particular, county party committees should properly 
manage 
counties and properly carry out party guidance so that the 
county's role can be further enhanced in socialist rural 
construction. 
  All functionaries of the rural economy sector should deeply 
cherish in their hearts the honorable mission for the party and 
the revolution and mingle with the peasant masses in accordance 
with the demands of the revolutionary slogan, "We serve the 
people." They should also take the lead in the implementation 
of the party's policies while smelling soil and compost together 
with the peasant masses. Thus, they should become genuine 
servants for the people who can skillfully organize and mobilize 
the masses. 
  Comrades: With the achievement of the great victory of the 
socialist rural theses under the wise leadership of the party 
and the leader [suryong] our country's socialist might has 
strengthened to be invincible, and we have come to have greater 
assets which enable us to guarantee the country's grandeur and 
development and the people's happy life. Our struggle has 
become more rewarding and mighty, and the future prospect of our 
country's socialism has become brighter. 
  The external situation of our revolution is still serious 
and 
complicated, and our people's struggle is difficult and arduous. 
However, because of the tested leadership of the great party and 
the might of the popular masses who have firmly united around 
the party and the leader as one ideological will, no imperialist 
reactionary forces can frustrate our people who are fighting 
with courage and firm faith in the correctness of our cause nor 
can they divest the independent and creative life of our people 
and the agricultural working people. 
  History shows that the struggle of the people who are 
advancing under the banner of the revolution, that is, the 
banner of socialism, while surmounting all sorts of trials and 
difficulties, will be victorious without fail and that their 
achievements will be glorified forever along with the 
development of the times. 
  We should effect a new great upsurge in all sectors of the 
revolution and construction with the great national dignity of 
being blessed with the leadership of our party which is firmly 
leading the eternal grandeur and prosperity of the country and 
the consummation of the chuche revolutionary cause to certain 
victory while shielding the destiny and future of our 
fatherland, our revolution, our people, and our future 
generations. Thus, we should brilliantly record the nineties, 
the last era of the 20th century, and should dash toward the 
21st century, a bright and hopeful new century. [applause] 
  Let us all firmly unite around the party Central Committee 
headed by the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
and vigorously fight to expedite the completion of the socialist 
cause and the fatherland's reunification under the revolutionary 
banner of the chuche idea. [applause] 
  Long live Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party 
and our people. [applause and hurrah] 
  Long live the glorious Workers Party of Korea, the organizer 
and guide to all victories of the Korean people. [applause and 
hurrah] 
  Long live the 30th anniversary of the publication of the 
great socialist rural theses. [applause, hurrah, shouting of 
slogans]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Companies To Announce Their Targets </F>
for U.S.-Made Auto Parts"] 
  [Text] The industrial circles are very much alarmed by the 
U.S. Government's reviving of the Super 301 provision (which 
defines unfair trade practices and nations engaged in such 
practices, and sanctions against them). Yutaka Kume, chairman 
of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association [JAMA], said, 
"We are deeply concerned about the reinstatement of this 
provision, which presumes retaliation." While demonstrating 
their displeasure, industries such as the automobile and auto 
parts industries, which are a subject of discussion at the 
Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, have started taking 
actions voluntarily seeking a breakthrough in the situation. 
Auto Industry [subhead] 
  Because it is very likely that sanctions under the Super 301 
provision, if they are enacted, will apply to the automobile and 
auto parts sectors, the auto industry is wary about the United 
States' future moves. In following the Toyota Motors 
Corporation, on 4 March the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation 
revealed its auto parts purchase targets for 1995 and 
thereafter. The Nissan Motors Company and the Honda Motors 
Company are also expected to announce their plans for expanding 
imports, including purchases of auto parts, around or after 
mid-March. 
  However, except for Toyota, which opened a new factory in 
the 
United States coming into this year [as published], all 
companies are suffering from poor sales at home and abroad. 
Thus, it will be extremely difficult for them to substantially 
increase their purchases of auto parts in 1995 and thereafter. 
Given this situation, a major automaker said, "We are afraid 
that the United States will not be happy even if the companies 
present their purchase targets." 
  Meanwhile, concerning the possible implementation of the 
Super 301 provision, the auto industry believes that the 
possibility of auto parts being placed on the retaliation list 
is small, and it adds, "if high tariffs are placed on auto 
parts, it is the United States that will suffer." Thus, the 
industry believes that sanctions, if they are imposed, will be 
imposed only on finished vehicles. 
  Moreover, the United States' current complaints about 
Japan's 
poor record of importing finished vehicles are growing, and it 
charges that "Japan's sales system is closed." Given this 
situation, the JAMA is now thinking about acting as a mediator 
between the Big Three and domestic dealers. 
Electric Industry [subhead] 
  Sekimoto Tadashi, chairman of the Electric Industries 
Association of Japan, strongly reacted against the revival of 
the Super 301 provision, saying, "This presumes unilateral 
retaliation, and we regret this very much." The computer 
industry is particularly alarmed lest "the sanctions should be 
applied on supercomputers, because the United States is still 
dissatisfied with the government's procurement of 
supercomputers." 
  However, in biddings for supercomputers conducted under the 
1993 supplementary budget, Japanese manufacturers won some bids 
on the systems, which will have U.S.-made computers as 
components. In view of this, there are also those (among major 
manufacturers) who believe, "More of the systems incorporating 
U.S.-made products in them, as is required by the buyers, will 
come to win the biddings." 
Insurance Industry [subhead] 
  The nonlife insurance industry, which was regarded as one of 
the priority sectors during the failed Japanese-U.S. economic 
framework talks, intends to "promote an exchange of views with 
foreign- invested nonlife insurance companies, including U.S. 
firms, to remove their misunderstandings about the Japanese 
market" (according to a major nonlife insurance company). Since 
February, managers of Japan's major nonlife insurance companies 
and representatives of foreign-invested insurance companies in 
Japan have met to exchange views on the insurance system reform 
and other issues at the Japan and Foreign Nonlife Insurance 
Council. Such meetings will be held once a month or once every 
two months. 
Department Store Industry [subhead] 
  The government has decided to study measures to ease 
regulations governing the distribution system as one way to open 
up the market. Accordingly, the department store industry is 
different from other industries, which are in pain [over the 
revival of the Super 301 provision]. It instead is happy, and 
it says, "The import customs clearance procedures should be 
simplified to help expand imports, the high tariffs imposed on 
items such as candies and jams should be abolished, and the 
procedures for declaring the consumption tax imposed on imported 
goods should be simplified."

  [Text] Seoul, Mar. 9 (YONHAP) -- The third-round U.S.-North 
Korea high-level talks, scheduled for March 21, may be put off 
until a later date as chances are now slim for the exchange of 
special envoys between South and North Korea before the talks. 
  A Seoul government official said on Wednesday that even if 
there is a dramatic inter-Korean accord on the exchange soon, it 
would be hard to materialize it before the March 21 talks in 
view of a period of time needed in preparing for the exchange. 
He noted that it was earlier decided that special envoys would 
be exchanged prior to the third-round U.S.-North Korea talks. 
"There is no change in this decision on the part of South Korea 
and the United States," he said. 
  At least 15 days' preparatory period is necessary for the 
exchange, said the official, adding that this means that even if 
the two sides agree on the exchange at the next contact slated 
for coming Saturday, March 12, it would be physically impossible 
to exchange envoys before March 21. He said it appears North 
Korea is trying to drive a wedge into the South Korea-U.S. 
cooperative system by deliberately postponing the exchange of 
envoys until after March 21. 
  The official said that if North Korea suggests at Saturday's 
contact for the exchange of envoys after March 21, South Korea 
and the United States would not turn it down as a breach of 
agreement. In such an event, he said, the third-stage 
Washington-Pyongyang talks would be put off until after the 
materialization of the exchange of envoys. The official added, 
however, that if North Korea keeps shunning the exchange even at 
the upcoming contact, the recent U.S.-North Korea agreement on 
the North Korean nuclear issue would automatically be nullified. 
  "In this case, there exists the strong possibility that the 
conditional suspension of the '94 Team Spirit exercise and the 
planned third-round U.S.-North Korea talks would be withdrawn," 
he said.

  [Excerpts] Trade Assistant Secretary Edsel T. Custodio said 
that the Philippines should be concerned over the United States' 
move in reviving a provision of the U.S. law known as Super 301 
which if not settled could erupt into a trade war. Custodio said 
the "U.S. move is a discordant note of the emphasis in the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round (UR) negotiation." [passage 
omitted] 
  The United States will come out with a target list of 
countries which it deemed to have erected trade barriers against 
the United States. 
  Apparently, the Clinton administration's decision to revive 
the Super 301 came after its failure to settle trade disputes 
with Japan, where the U.S. has a $59.3-billion trade imbalance. 
  Although the issue is bilateral in nature, Custodio said the 
situation may reach to a point where "every man has to fend for 
himself." 
  "The point of the matter is that we are entering a stage 
under the Uruguay Round where most unilateral action based on 
national objective is subject to multilateral obligations and 
multilateral disciplines," Custodio stressed. 
  He added that the conclusion of the UR signals that it is 
now 
ready to give powers to international trading which provides a 
forum for settling disputes. "There is no room for unilateral 
action in adversarial manner," Custodio stressed. If the United 
States pursues the trade sanction against Japan, Custodio said 
"we cannot prevent other countries from picking the same tool 
where countries have to defend themselves." But if the U.S. and 
Japan dispute is taken up in the GATT (General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade) a trade war can be prevented but if not then 
a trade war looms. 
  "We are voicing our concern," Custodio said noting the 
Philippine concern is also a very valid concern of other 
developing countries. The Philippines was once subjected to the 
U.S. Super 301 for alleged rampant violations of intellectual 
property rights but we have come to successful arrangement last 
year," Custodio said. 
  Aside from being a trade tool, the United States is also 
using Super 301 as a political tool where the United States may 
impose trade sanctions against countries.

  [Text] According to a public relations official of Nakhon 
Ratchasima Province, at about 0300 today an explosion was heard 
at the house of Sawai Phrammani, permanent secretary of the 
Labor and Social Welfare Ministry, which is situated at No. 287 
on Mitraphap-Nakhon Ratchasima-Nong Khai Road, Tambon Munwai, 
Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima Province. There was an 
explosion outside the house fence near the gate. About 10 
minutes afterwards several rounds of gunfire were fired at the 
house. The explosion caused minor damage to the fence. A 
one-foot timed detonating wire was found at the site. The 
damage was estimated at about 1,000 baht. Five shots hit the 
house -- three at the windows and two on the wall. Two bullets 
were found and an investigation showed they were .38 caliber and 
fired from about 20 meters outside the fence. There were no 
casualties. Motives for the incident are under investigation. 
  Sawai told correspondents that the incident occurred at 0300 
this morning. He said the damage was slight, estimated at 1,000 
baht. Police are investigating the incident. He said he was in 
Bangkok when the incident occurred and, therefore, knows very 
little. Correspondents will have to ask his son who was at the 
residence when the incident occurred. Sawai said he has no 
comment on whether the motive was political or personal.

  [Text] Washington, March 8 KYODO -- U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor Tuesday [8 March] raised the 
possibility that up to eight Japanese industries would be 
subject to retaliatory action under the so-called "Super 301" 
trade law. 
  Kantor identified wood, paper, flat glass, computers, 
supercomputers, telecommunications, medical equipment, and 
insurance as business areas where he said U.S. firms face 
barriers in penetrating the Japanese market. 
  President Bill Clinton reinstated the Super 301 trade 
provision by executive order last week, setting in motion a U.S. 
policy of removing foreign trade barriers by targeting offending 
trading partners for retaliation. 
  Under Clinton's executive order, U.S. trading partners 
accused of maintaining trade barriers against U.S. goods have 
until September 30 to avoid being singled out for possible Super 
301 action. 
  Testifying before a House Appropriations Subcommittee that 
handles trade matters Tuesday, Kantor named the eight Japanese 
industry sectors as areas which he said do not meet U.S. 
market-opening criteria. 
  Kantor in particular cited wood, paper and flat glass as 
three Japanese market sectors where he said U.S. firms have seen 
a decline in their market share. 
  The U.S. Government is scheduled to issue an annual review 
on 
foreign trade barriers by the end of March, setting off a 
six-month process of preliminary negotiations to remove what 
Washington views as the "most egregious" practices. 
  Kantor indicated that U.S. jaw-boning is unlikely to resolve 
all trade disputes, telling the U.S. legislators that it would 
be "quite unusual" if the Super 301 priority list turns up empty 
on September 30.

  [Text] At a news conference following a meeting of the 
cabinet on 25 February, Manae Kubato, director general of the 
Economic Planning Agency [EPA], opposed the idea of setting 
targets for reducing Japan's current-accounts surplus. She 
said, "The current-accounts surplus is the most difficult 
economic factor for the government to control." She also said, 
"I understand that Japan has maintained the principles of free 
trade in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks." In this 
way, Kubota indicated that setting any kind of numerical target 
could lead to managed trade.

Sakaguchi said: "Due to the breakdown at the last Japan-U.S.

with a difficult situation. I would like to ask for cooperation 
also from the economic circles."

  [Text] Tokyo -- Ichiro Yoneyama, Defense Facilities 
Administration Agency [DFAA] director general, held a news 
conference on 7 March after returning to Japan from his trip to 
the United States. Referring to the issue of returning Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield, he said: "When I proposed to the U.S. side 
that both Japan and the United States study ways to have the 
auxiliary airfield returned, the U.S. side said if the jamming 
problem at Sobe Communications Center is cleared, the United 
States would consider returning the auxiliary airfield." The 
U.S. side's response indicated a change in the U.S. position 
that "until the auxiliary airfield's function of parachute drop 
training is transferred to another place, it is impossible to 
return it." The relocation of the auxiliary airfield and 
measures to clear up the jamming problem are a condition for the 
return of the airfield. At the news conference, Mr. Yoneyama 
said: "Both Japan and the United States are studying where to 
relocate the auxiliary airfield. We intend to discuss this with 
U.S. Forces in Japan at the earliest date." 
  On the issue of returning Naha Military Port, the U.S. side 
said, "It is not easy to return the military port, but we intend 
to tenaciously work for its return." Regarding the issue of 
abolishing live-firing exercise across Prefectural Highway No. 
104, the U.S. side said, "The United States is now studying the 
possibility of ending the live-firing exercises and will make as 
many efforts as possible to end them." In this way, the U.S. 
side repeated its past view. 
  During his stay in the United States, Director General 
Yoneyama met with Ross [name as published], deputy assistance 
defense secretary, Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state, 
and Stockpole, commander of the Pacific Marine Corps, for an 
exchange of views. 
  During a series of meetings with them, Director General 
Yoneyama proposed that both Japan and the United States study 
ways not only to relocate Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, but to 
return it. In response, the U.S. side said, "If the jamming 
problem at Sobe Communications Center is cleared, the United 
States will study the possibility of returning the airfield." 
  Explaining the results of his visit to the United States, 
Director General Yoneyama said: "The U.S. side was far more 
interested in resolving those issues than we have thought. The 
impression I got is that the United States wants to avoid new 
tensions because of difficult economic issues between Japan and

perception of the issues. It was significant for me to convey 
the views of local residents directly to concerned American 
officials."

  [Text] With regard to the Japan-U.S. friction over 
cellular phones, the United States pronounced Japan "guilty" of 
closing its market. However, Morgan Bengtson [name as 
published], president of Ericsson Japan (located in Xinato Ward, 
Tokyo) said: "With regard to cellular phones, the Japanese 
market is open. The highest priorities should be given to 
technological capabilities and prices in an open, competitive 
system. It is not good that (the market principle) is twisted 
by political pressures." His remarks can be seen as "coming to 
Japan's rescue." 
  Bengtson also said: "A trade imbalance surely exists between 
Japan and the United States. However, there is a possibility 
that U.S. policies (on the cellular phone issue) will work 
against the free trade system. It is not desirable for American 
companies to have an advantage in the Japanese market because of 
such policies." He questioned the U.S. strategy of demanding 
numerical targets by threatening the possibility of sanctions 
against Japan. 
  Ericsson Japan is a subsidiary of the major Swedish 
electrical manufacturer Ericsson Company. Ericsson Japan has 
succeeded in receiving orders for radio base stations for 
cellular phones worth about 40 billion yen from NTT Mobile 
Communications Network Company and Tokyo Digital Phone Company 
(located in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo; president, Susumu Ochiai). 
Thus, it is believed that Ericsson cannot remain indifferent to 
this Japan-U.S. friction.

<F P=106> [By Shigeru Komago in Washington] </F>
  [Text] On 28 February, the Japanese Embassy in the United 
States began to send officials to visit major U.S. newspapers to 
explain its view on the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) 
charge that Japan has violated an agreement in the portable and 
car phone sector. The embassy seeks to gain the U.S. news 
media's understanding by explaining that "the USTR's charge is 
full of errors." But some people are cool toward this, saying: 
"What Japan should do promptly is to talk with the U.S. 
Government rather than do public relations work with the news 
media." 
  The embassy, after consulting with the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, prepared a paper entitled "Refutation of the 
USTR's Claim" in English, and explained it to newspapers like 
THE WASHINGTON POST and THE WALL STREET JOURNAL individually. 
In the paper, the embassy rebuts almost all points raised by 
USTR Mickey Kantor on 15 February as violations of an agreement 
by Japan. The paper cites specific reasons in refuting the U.S. 
charge as a "misunderstanding of facts" or an "incomprehensible 
assertion." 
  The U.S. news media, in reporting on the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, took the position of criticizing the Clinton 
administration with respect to its demands for objective 
criteria, thus making favorable reports on Japan. But as far as 
the portable and car phone issue was concerned, the news media 
supported the USTR's assertion, and most major newspapers 
criticized Japan in their editorials. Given this situation, 
Japan appears to have decided that it should do public relations 
work with the U.S. news media in this regard. 
  After listening to Japan's explanation, a major newspaper's 
reporter gave a wry smile and said: "I see that the U.S demands 
are rather unreasonable. But what surprises me most is that the 
Japanese and the U.S. Governments are too different in their 
perceptions and stands." Another said: "The gaps between the 
two governments should be filled by the governments themselves. 
The news media cannot do that for them."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Komago] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 7 Mar -- It was learned on the morning 
of 7 March that Motorola Inc. of the United States made a new 
proposal on the opening of the Japanese mobile and car phone 
market. The new proposal demands that Japan increase 
Motorola-formula mobile and car phones by about 240,000 in a 
year in service areas between Tokyo and Nagoya. Japan considers 
the proposal a demand for setting a numerical target, thus it 
is opposed to it. Because of this, negotiations between Japan 
and the United States over opening Japan's cellular phone market 
may become rough at the final stage. Nevertheless, because the 
proposal is not an official one put forward by the U.S. Trade 
Representative Office, Tokyo thinks that "we will eventually be 
able to persuade the United States to withdraw the proposal."

  [Text] At the plenary sessions of both the House of 
Representatives and the House of Councillors on 7 and 8 March, 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was asked about the issue of 
setting numerical targets to reduce Japan's current account 
surplus, which is a focal issue in trade friction between Japan 
and the United States. He answered: "It is inappropriate to 
set specific numerical targets." 
  Commenting on this at a news conference on the evening of 8 
March, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said: "The 
prime minister and I share the same view that setting numerical 
targets is very difficult. However, it is unnecessary to assert 
that it will never happen (for Japan to set numerical targets). 
Mr. Hosokawa has not yet made a final decision." Takemura then 
added: "Current account surplus bears more uncertain factors 
than any other economic indexes. At least, Japan should not set 
numerical targets as a pledge to the international community and 
make a commitment to the United States." 
  Takemura's remark indicates that although Japan should never 
commit to Washington about setting numerical targets to reduce 
its current account surplus, it is possible that it will 
voluntarily set targets for reducing the surplus.

  [Excerpts] Kapar, 1 Feb--Malaysia's political system cannot 
be belittled. On the contrary, it has proved successful in 
creating public unity and national stability and in stimulating 
the economic growth rate, said Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. The 
deputy prime minister said that the policies of National Front 
(BN) leaders in decision-making, cooperation, and creating unity 
among the people are the key to domestic and foreign investor 
confidence in investing in this country. 
  Mistakes in choosing leaders, however, would make communal 
unrest possible and would turn the country from development and 
the flow of global progress. "Who will come to invest (in this 
country) if the government is unstable? Therefore, this 
country's political system cannot be belittled. Cooperation 
among Malays, Chinese, and Indians at all levels will increase 
(investor) confidence, because this is not only a success story, 
but a unique success story. It is different and unique because 
not all countries with citizens of different religions can 
record such gratifying success. Therefore, we must not belittle 
our political system and our (the government's) policy in making 
decisions," he said today as he inaugurated the Abdul Samad 
National School at Sementa during his one-day visit to Selangor. 
  Anwar first listened to a briefing and toured the West Port 
Project at Pulau Indah, Klang Port. Selangor Chief Minister Tan 
Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib accompanied him. Anwar said he 
announced an additional allocation of 2 billion ringgit to 
finance the supervision of government construction because the 
national economy is strong and makes investors confident in 
increasing their investments. [passage omitted] 
  "Our schools should be able to create harmony among students 
from various communal groups. Teachers must be alert to efforts 
to foster a spirit of cooperation, and this unity must begin at 
the school level," he said. Anwar called attention to the fact 
that although the Western educational system is supported by 
quality teaching personnel and facilities, it fails to produce 
students with morality. "The Western educational system is able 
only to produce people like cattle. They have no realization of 
learning or morality, and they do not want to create a spirit of 
unity or build up their nations or states. 
  "Our educational philosophy, however, stresses the desire to 
improve skills and capabilities in all fields, besides creating 
high character," he said. Touching on the Malay language, Anwar 
repeated the assurance that Malay will remain the official and 
teaching language. "We want Malay to be an effective teaching 
language, but we want our children to master English, because 
the Malaysia of today is not the Malaysia of 20 years ago. We 
are now considered a model country for economic development. We 
are now in a race with neighboring countries and are cooperating 
with ASEAN member states, the Group of 15, East Asian nations, 
and Islamic countries. This cooperation requires a good 
communications tool, which is the English language," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The bad business of calumny"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Ask any British businessman acquainted with 
Malaysia about the outturn of events since February 20 and he 
begins to groan like any other victim of Fleet Street 
muck-churning. He laments the abject decline of the British 
media, registers injury to his own interests, sympathy for the 
innocent bystander -- Malaysia, and the sinking feeling that a 
lot of hard work has been blown away by the grubby 
scandalmongers of the British press. It is the conduct and 
content of the painstaking effort at repairing economic 
relations with Malaysia that has been impugned and now stands 
poised to come to nought. The British businessman knows this 
better than any other and has the biggest cause for regret. 
  Right through the 1980s and particularly following the Buy 
British Last policy, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher headed a 
diplomatic onslaught at the highest levels -- including frequent 
meetings with Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed -- to rebuild and 
restore Britain's commercial esteem in this country. She had a 
big job in her hands -- not only were British interests in the 
rear of a superior queue of foreign investment, they were also, 
as part of Britain's waning industrial efficiency overall, 
severely handicapped in their competitive ability. She had also 
been rather desperate -- her country was in recession and 
unemployment was growing. It was then that, while chasing a 
considerable defence deal with Kuala Lumpur aid and arms sales 
"became incorrectly entangled for a few months in 1988". 
  This lapse, according to British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd testifying in parliament last Wednesday, was hastily 
corrected afterwards, and the whole package eventually went 
through. Malaysia, as fastidious customer, made its choice after 
intense lobbying and considerable "sweetening", including 
tie-up's as well as cheap credits and aid, swung its appraisal 
in favour of British products. Such government-to-government 
dealmaking goes on worldwide and, in democratic countries, is 
accountable in parliament. At no time were individual Malaysian 
decisionmakers greased over the composition of the eventual 
contracts and supply package -- that was left to the wisdom of 
the British Government, and its enthusiasm to help its own 
industries. 
  Aid-donating countries, including Britain, have been in the 
habit of "tying" aid-for-trade deals for years, often diluting 
the benefit of the aid to the recipient country. That Whitehall 
had fixed things in order to put together a winnable tender bid 
ought not to have been so grudgingly divulged upon inquiry as to 
whet the appetite of a vulturous press. [passage omitted] 
Malaysia wishes to protect its integrity against such 
defamations of a blimpish, contemptuous foreign press as well as 
against a government which curiously chooses to remain apathetic 
to the dignity of nation it so avidly desires to deal with. The 
Malaysian Government cannot pretend business-as-usual with 
regard to a fellow governnent which is almost certain to leave 
every business deal prone to calumny at some time to come.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry says the law in Singapore must 
take its course and the ministry cannot be expected to intervene 
in the due process of the law. This is the ministry's response 
to the U.S. Embassy here over its concern on the caning sentence 
passed by the court on an American teenager, Michael Fay. The 
ministry noted that Fay's sentencing was the outcome of a fair 
and transparent legal process. Fay was given every opportunity 
to defend himself with representation and counsel of his choice. 
It stressed that the Singapore judicial process cannot apply 
different standards to persons subjected to the same law. 
Therefore, it is not correct for the U.S. to say based on the 
facts on the treatment of other similar cases, this punishment 
is extreme. 
  The ministry pointed out that Fay is not the first teenaged 
person nor foreigner to have received the sentence of caning 
under the Vandalism Act. Twelve Singaporeans and two 
foreigners, aged 18 to 21, have received caning sentences for 
vandalism since 1989. The ministry cited some previous 
vandalism cases. In 1990, a 20-year-old Singaporean was 
sentenced to a month jail and three strokes for damaging public 
property. Last year, there was a similar case where a 
19-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three months jail and 
three strokes of a cane. The ministry said in contrast to these 
cases, Fay admitted in all to 18 counts of vandalism and six 
counts of misdeeds. These facts, among others, show that the 
court sentence meted out to Fay is neither extreme nor 
unprecedented. Fay, who is 18, was sentenced last Thursday to 
four months in prison and six strokes of a cane for vandalism. 
Fay is appealing against the sentence and he is currently on a 
[Singapore] $75,000 bail.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Get Out or Be Left Out"] </F>
  [Excerpt] On recent visits to India and China, and again in 
Vietnam last week, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has been 
consistent about one theme: Singaporean businessmen must get 
out there -- quick. Vietnam, he reckoned, could become a tiger 
cub in 10 to 15 years although, at its current stage of growth, 
he put it at 30 to 40 years behind Singapore. In that growth 
curve Vietnam has to traverse, there will be opportunities 
aplenty for builders, manufacturers, consultants and lawyers, 
suppliers of consumer goods and services. What is being asked 
of our businessmen in going to Vietnam is that they be 
trail-blazers. After a long period of French occupation which 
left little that was serviceable, and another 20 years fighting 
the Americans, Vietnam is in a rage to build a polity from 
ground up. It takes nerve and acumen for a Singaporean 
businessman to survey the ruins and say: "I smell money here." 
Are our risk takers up to it? By comparison, India is the 
easier to penetrate although its immediate profit potential may 
look less appealing. Its legal framework, financial system, 
property and repatriation rights are fairly well encoded. 
China, having a lead time of a dozen years over India in 
economic liberalisation, has advanced to the stage where 
maintaining a stable currency and keeping growth from 
over-heating now form the basis for orderly development. 
  Vietnam is different, but this is no reason for Singaporean 
businessmen to hesitate. If its bureaucrats trained in the 
communist tradition have little understanding of the forces that 
shape a market economy, they are prepared to adapt. As a sign 
of resolve, common folk and civil servants are studying English 
with a vengeance to gain access to the commercial highway. If 
its legal framework is wobbly and the banking system basic, it 
should spell opportunity, not a hindrance, for brain-service 
suppliers such as Singapore. Mr. Goh has in fact signposted the 
areas -- apart from property investments where Singaporean money 
is prominent -- in which the private and state sectors should 
pay close attention to. These include banking, 
telecommunications and land transport. Then there is 
infrastructural work -- port development, public housing, 
industrial estates -- where, it should be conceded, 
participation may be better handled by government-linked 
companies. No less a Vietnamese personage than Mr. Do Muoi, the 
party chief, has asked Singapore to help his country 
industrialise. Such invitations do not come often. 
Singaporeans have committed US$390 million in 52 projects in 
Vietnam since the investment ban was lifted in November 1991. 
But so have 500 companies world-wide signed on for US$7.5 
billion worth of investments during that period, and a flood can 
now be expected as the last of the Americans' trade restrictions 
on Vietnam have been lifted. 
  It was left to Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, 
who was in Mr. Goh's party, to give the reluctant the most 
telling prod. In persuading companies to expand in the region or 
be left behind, he spoke of competition growing more intense a 
few years from now and how opportunities would be harder to 
find. The Government will smooth the path with appropriate 
incentives and concessions. The need for an external economy 
has been accepted by investors and workers alike. [passage

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Vietnam's New Challenge"] </F>
  [Text] Winding up his five-day visit to Vietnam on Sunday, 
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, the first Singaporean prime 
minister to visit the country, warned that while Vietnamese 
leaders were committed to market reforms, the key question was 
whether they would move cautiously or speed up the process. It 
was a timely observation. Vietnam is among the emerging 
economies where Singapore companies and individuals have moved 
in aggressively to take advantage of business opportunities. 
But if long-term investor interest is to continue, Vietnam must 
speed up the pace of its market reform. With the U.S. trade 
embargo now lifted, essentially this means putting in place the 
legal and financial systems that will promote investment. The 
stakes are high. The investment pool overseas -- Vietnamese 
firms and individuals-- number over two million, concentrated in 
France, Australia, and the United States. They are keen to 
invest in their homeland but only as market opportunities 
broaden. 
  This essentially means reform of Vietnam's institutional 
framework. Priority must be given to its moribund banking 
industry, which needs to be automated and computerised. 
Vietnamese local banks are woefully undercapitalised, with 
capital adequacy of just 2 percent of their assets. Foreign 
bankers, wary about operating in Vietnam's banking environment, 
still regard it as a risky market. One of the biggest threats 
to the lending operation of foreign banks is that they are 
virtually unprotected and vulnerable in the absence of a 
mortgage law. Local banks, however, are able to take out 
mortgages against borrowers' assets unlike the foreign banks. A 
mortgage law to provide equal protection must be enacted soon. 
  This is not to say that the reform process has been at a 
standstill. The passing of the bankruptcy law is certainly a 
welcome first step. Foreign bankers have always harboured the 
fear that if a company folded, the banks would have no means to 
recover loans. But the general uncertainty has led foreign 
banks to confine themselves to the safer business of trade 
financing and offshore loans to Vietnamese projects, leaving a 
vacuum for financing of vital domestic infrastructure projects. 
Above all, Vietnam should also open the market to more foreign 
banks. It can only benefit from such a move. The domestic 
banks will get an injection of much-needed hard currency when 
they team up with foreign banks. The foreign shareholders will 
also inject sophisticated banking techniques and 
entrepreneurship. As it stands, foreign banks are not 
restricted from setting up wholly-owned branches -- there are 
currently nine foreign bank branches in the country. But 
Vietnam's State Bank, which is the central bank, is too slow in 
issuing licences. As a result, only one licence was issued for 
the whole of last year, and that was to Standard Chartered. The 
pace of change must quicken. Vietnam, after decades of war, 
must maintain the momentum of regulatory reform if it is to 
achieve its objective of becoming the new Asian tiger early in 
the next century.

first international marathon on 16 December 1992. On that day, 
Pham Van Quang drove his family car to Me Linh Square with the 
intention of creating trouble. He reasoned that many people, 
especially foreigners, visit this place each day and that his 
act might produce political repercussions. At noon, Quang 
climbed onto the hood of his car and waved a flag. He fired a 
revolver at intervals to draw people's attention. He reloaded 
his gun five times, firing a total of 19 shots. Seeing this, 
people in the vicinity immediately tried to stop Quang, but were 
driven back when he pulled the pin of an M26 grenade to frighten 
them. Quang was later arrested along with his exhibits. 
  The Ho Chi Minh City People's Court sentenced Pham Van Quang 
to 15 years imprisonment on the charge of "rebellion." After 
serving his jail term, Quang will be on parole for five years 
and will be deprived of some of his rights as a citizen.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Form Large Economic Groups Which Are Strong </F>
Enough To Compete"] 
  [Text] Soon after the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo, 
American-made Pepsi soft drinks have begun to be produced in 
Vietnam. For many years, they were imported from foreign 
countries to meet popular demand. Thus, the production of Pepsi 
did not take place in Vietnam until after the lifting of the 
U.S. trade embargo and a spectacular yet harsh competition has 
already occurred in the Vietnamese market between Coca-Cola and 
Pepsi. The question to ponder is: Two major U.S. soft drink 
companies are already operating in Vietnam. What will happen to 
our soft drink companies? Will they survive or die? 
  Some 20 U.S. construction companies have tendered bids for 
the construction of many segments of National Highway No. 1 with 
loans and funding from various international monetary and 
financial institutions. Dozens of other U.S. companies 
specializing in different sectors have also brought their goods, 
machinery, equipment, and technology to the Giang Vo Trade Fair 
in Hanoi. More American companies are expected to do business 
in Vietnam. Research results released by some American 
companies indicate that within the next two years, business 
activity in Vietnam will reach as much as 2.7 billion dollars. 
Needless to say, there will be harsh competition among American 
companies themselves, between American companies and other 
foreign companies, and between American companies and Vietnamese 
companies. 
  Therefore, it can be said that with the lifting of the U.S. 
embargo, we enjoy an opportunity and also face a challenge. It 
is an opportunity because the lifting of the trade embargo 
provides us with a very good chance -- provided that we are 
smart and vigilant -- to have access to capital and modern 
technology to develop new trades and occupations, increase 
economic activities, and generate more jobs, thereby turning the 
strong points of the outside world into our own strength. 
Meanwhile, we face a not-too-insignificant challenge. American 
companies all have huge financial assets with billions of 
dollars at their disposal. Furthermore, they have the best 
technology in the world. As for our companies, it is difficult 
to compare them with their American counterparts in all 
respects. Therefore, as far as direct business transactions are 
concerned, it will be very easy for us to lose if we are not 
wise enough. 
  As for macro-management, to be strong enough to compete in 
future business activities, we need to initiate the following 
tasks as soon as possible: 
  -- Forming large economic groups which are financially 
strong 
enough to compete. Each group must have at least several 
thousand billion dong as capital. 
  -- Taking urgent steps to train a contingent of management 
cadres who are highly professional, business-wise, and quick at 
mastering modern technology. 
  Good cadres and capital are the minimum basic conditions for 
new business activities. 
  To succeed in forming large economic groups, the first 
decisive factor rests with unity. In wartime, all of our people 
remained united in the struggle to wrest back independence and 
do away with the shame of losing our country. At present, let 
all of us unite in the struggle to make the country powerful and 
eliminate poverty and backwardness. Let our economic units 
merge into large groups to work toward our common goals. The 
workstyle that we have followed so far in which small-scale 
business activities prevail, every businessman is for himself, 
and everyone pursues short-term profits at the expense of common 
interests will only harm us and weaken our potential. That 
workstyle is no longer suitable with large-scale business 
activities in the days ahead. 
  It is also worth noting that while doing business in 
Vietnam, 
all major foreign economic companies or groups of companies must 
abide by Vietnamese law. Therefore, in macro-management, it is 
necessary for the state to perfect the legal system and where 
necessary, work out incentives to encourage foreign business 
people to invest in those preferred foreign-funded projects and 
limit investment where local investors can manage or in those 
projects which do not meet Vietnam's conditions and economic 
development requirements. 
  Competition plays an essential role in the market mechanism. 
Business operations are under state management. Nonetheless, 
the decisive factor of success rests primarily with the strength 
of each economic unit and with the potential of our country as a 
whole.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- A two-day international 
conference on the reconstruction of Cambodia opened in Tokyo on 
Thursday [10 March] with an appeal from King Norodom Sihanouk 
for a modern-day "Marshall Plan" to help put the war-ravaged 
country back on its feet. Sihanouk's message, sent from 
Beijing, where he has been undergoing medical treatment, was 
conveyed to the International Committee on the Reconstruction of 
Cambodia (ICORC) by the monarch's son, Cambodian First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh. 
  The meeting, chaired by Japan, is being attended by 
delegates 
from 32 countries, the European Union and 12 international 
organizations, including U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  "I would say that the gift of which my country has the 
greatest need, having suffered from so many years of turpitude 
and devastation, is none other than a new unconditional Marshall 
Plan gauged to specific needs," the message said. He was 
referring to a multibillion dollar plan drawn up by then U.S. 
Secretary of State George Marshall in the late 1940s to 
rehabilitate the shattered economies of post-World War II Europe. 
  The ailing monarch enumerated six priority areas for 
external 
assistance -- basic human needs in terms of sufficient access by 
the population to food and medical care, agricultural and rural 
development, infrastructure repair, environmental protection, 
education and technical training, and industrialization. 
  He placed most importance on improving conditions in rural 
communities, where about 80 percent of all Cambodians eke out a 
living, most of them "lacking even a roof over the head, 
sufficient resources, work or the prospect of finding any." 
  Ranariddh, who was accompanied to the conference by Second 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, said his government supports the "very 
just recommendations" of the king, who under the new Cambodian 
Constitution reigns but does not govern. 
  "Cambodia deserves your help because it helps itself," he 
said, adding that the government, in the five months since its 
formation after last May's U.N.-supervised general election, has 
set tough objectives for itself and accomplished a great deal in 
spite of meager resources. 
  Heeding international recommendations, he said, it has 
implemented administrative structural reforms, put its finances 
in order, stabilized the currency and worked out a satisfactory 
budget. 
  The government's next step is to present a new liberal 
investment code in line with the goal to develop a market 
economy with minimal state intervention, he said, apparently 
hinting at the unveiling of the code during the conference. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told delegates that 
the convening of the conference "demonstrates the international 
community's continued support for the new government." 
  The last ICORC meeting, held at a working level in Paris in 
September, saw 119 million dollars in fresh commitments added to 
the 880 million dollars garnered at a previous ministerial 
conference on Cambodia held in Tokyo in June 1992. 
  While most of those funds were for short-term financial 
support, this week's meeting is expected to produce substantial 
new pledges to help Cambodia meet its mid- to long-term aid 
needs. Japanese sources estimate new pledges may reach 120 
million dollars. 
  Japan, Cambodia's chief aid benefactor, will pledge some 9 
billion yen in new grant assistance, sources said. Tokyo has 
already committed some 190 million dollars, thus fulfilling its 
June 1992 pledge of 150 million dollars to 200 million dollars 
over a three-year period ending this April. 
  But despite the inflow of aid, efforts to implement 
reconstruction programs continue to be undermined by the 
destabilizing activities of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group. 
  Ranariddh said the international community can help resolve 
the Khmer Rouge problem by ensuring that all countries 
"scrupulously" and "instantly" respect Cambodia's sovereignty, 
independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity and 
inviolability. 
  Cambodian Government officials have repeatedly accused 
neighboring Thailand of allowing the Khmer Rouge to take 
sanctuary across the border. 
  Ranariddh also made reference in his speech to the 
"agonizing 
and menacing problem" of millions of land mines strewn over vast 
tracts of territory, including potentially productive farmland. 
He said removing them will take a long time and be costly. 
  The conference is to consider additional interim funding for 
the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC), which has appealed for 
10 million dollars annually for the next five years to remove 
mines. Mines kill or injure over 300 Cambodians a month, with 
the result being that Cambodia has the highest ratio of 
handicapped people in the world -- one in every 236 people.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Donor countries and 
international organizations gathered in Tokyo on Thursday [10 
March] readied their pledges of aid for Cambodia's 
reconstruction expected to total hundreds of millions of dollars. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that 73 
million dollars of fresh U.S. assistance will be provided to 
Cambodia over the next two years, while Japan was expected to 
offer 9 billion yen in new grant aid over a year. 
  Pledges made at the two-day meeting of the International 
Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC), 
participated in by 32 countries, the European Union, and 12 
international bodies, are scheduled to be tallied up for 
announcement on Friday. 
  At the outset of the meeting, Cambodian First Prime Minister 
Norodom Ranariddh conveyed an appeal from King Norodom Sihanouk 
for a modern-day "Marshall Plan" to help put the war-ravaged 
country back on its feet. 
  In a message sent from Beijing, where he has been undergoing 
medical treatment, Sihanouk said, "the gift of which my country 
has the greatest need, having suffered from so many years of 
turpitude and devastation, is none other than a new 
unconditional Marshall Plan gauged to specific needs." 
  Sihanouk's reference was to a multibillion-dollar plan drawn 
up by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall in the late 1940s 
to rehabilitate the shattered economies of post-World War II 
European nations. 
  Christopher, meanwhile, urged continued global attention to 
the problems faced by Cambodia and called for sustained 
assistance to help it recover from the disasters of its past, as 
well as "to help Cambodians take charge of their future." 
  "Events in Cambodia no longer make front page news around 
the 
world," he said. "That is in many ways a happy sign, but it is 
not a reason to shift our attention. As Cambodia moves from 
crisis to normality it is vital that we stay engaged." 
  Ranariddh, who was accompanied by Second Prime Minister Hun 
Sen, told the delegates, "Cambodia deserves your help because it 
helps itself." He said that the government, in the five months 
since its formation in the wake of last May's U.N.-supervised 
general election, has accomplished a great deal in spite of the 
meager resources at its disposal. 
  Heeding international recommendations, Ranariddh said 
Cambodia has implemented administrative reforms, put its 
finances in order, stabilized the local currency and worked out 
a satisfactory budget. 
  Sihanouk's message enumerated six priority areas for 
external 
assistance -- basic human needs in terms of sufficient access by 
the population to food and medical care, agricultural and rural 
development, infrastructure repair, environmental protection, 
education and technical training, and industrialization. He 
placed the utmost importance on improving conditions in rural 
communities, where over 80 percent of all Cambodians eke out a 
living, most of them "lacking even a roof over their head, 
sufficient resources, work or the prospect of finding any." 
  Gordon Bilney, Australian minister for development 
cooperation, echoed that "while macroeconomic assistance to 
restructure the economy remains a vital goal...specific action 
to alleviate poverty...must remain a high priority." 
  The first ICORC meeting, held at a working-level in Paris 
last September, saw 119 million dollars in fresh commitments 
added to the 880 million dollars garnered at a previous 
ministerial conference on Cambodia held in Tokyo in June 1992. 
While most of those funds were for short-term financial 
support, the present ICORC meeting is focused on Cambodia's mid- 
to long-term aid requirements. 
  Economy and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi detailed those 
requirements and expressed confidence that with the support of 
the donor community his government "can extend the `East Asian 
miracle to Cambodia'." 
  He took the occasion to unveil Cambodia's new liberalized 
investment law, which he said will not discriminate between 
Cambodian and foreign nationals, will guarantee remittance of 
foreign currencies and will offer various clear incentives. 
  Delegates from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank 
(ADB) praised the Cambodian Government for policies that have 
brought rapid economic growth, slashed inflation and turned 
about the fiscal deficit. But they warned that the 
macroeconomic situation remains fragile, with the country still 
highly dependent on external financing and suffering from a 
limited foreign exchange earning capacity. 
  The international financial organizations urged Cambodia to 
provide a vision of where the economy is headed, continue moving 
toward a market economy, strengthen the role of the private 
sector, work on rectifying the fiscal deficit and develop the 
skills of the country's work force.

  [Text] Australia has told the Tokyo conference it is to 
provide an extra $700,000 [Australian dollars] to clear land 
mines in Cambodia, bringing its total allocation for demining in 
the financial year ending next June to about $1.4 million. 
  The allocation was announced by Australia development 
cooperation minister, Gordon Bilney, who expressed concern that 
new mines were being laid by both goverment forces and the Khmer 
Rouge. He said mines were being laid without adequate recording 
of their locations. 
  Mr. Bilney said land mines threaten food production because 
they prevented about 30 percent of farmland from being used.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- The seven leading 
industrialized countries will place top priority on structural 
reforms to promote employment during the jobs summit in Detroit 
next week, government sources said Tuesday [8 March]. 
  The Group of Seven (G-7) nations apparently will adopt the 
chairman's draft statement noting that international trade will 
help boost employment, baring in mind the relation between trade 
surpluses and unemployment. 
  The statement, to be released after the two-day summit, will 
avoid singling out individual nations for criticism. But Japan 
may be the exception if the nation leaves its huge trade surplus 
untouched, the sources said. 
  The economic ministers of the G-7 countries will participate 
in the jobs summit, to be held March 14 and 15. Labor Minister 
Chikara Sakaguchi will represent Japan. 
  According to the sources, these are the main points of the 
chairman's statement: 
  -- Major industrial nations have been battling against 
unemployment. 
  -- The unemployment rate has been rising in Europe and 
Japan, whose rate is the smallest among the G-7 nations. 
  -- Each nation needs to provide equal opportunities to all 
workers, particularly those in the low-skill sector. 
  -- Structural reforms will only be effective when they are 
supplemented and supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies. 
  -- International trade is essential to boost wealth, 
employment and wages. 
  -- The development of new technology regarding data 
processing, has the potential to increase the wealth of 
participating nations.

  [Text] Dear Listeners: General Saw Bo Mya, chairman of 
the Democratic Alliance of Burma, DAB, in his letter to Thai 
Prime Minister Chaun Likphai noted that the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council [SLORC] military regime should not be 
invited to attend the forthcoming annual ASEAN ministerial 
meeting. 
  In the DAB declaration, dated 4 March, Gen. Saw Bo Mya cited 
SLORC's inability to implement basic human rights and democracy 
in Burma and looking at SLORC's present activities it clearly 
indicates their intention to cling on to power through the use 
of military force. At present, SLORC does not deserve to be 
invited to the annual ASEAN ministerial meeting. 
  The letter also noted ASEAN need to wait-and-see the 
improvements in SLORC's records before considering such an 
invitation. 
  It has been learned that Gen. Saw Bo Mya sent similar 
letters 
to other ASEAN members. The annual ASEAN ministerial meeting 
will be held in Bangkok, Thailand, in July. The Thai Government 
intends to invite the SLORC military regime as guest to the 
meeting.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The multilateral open and free global market may yet 
take some time to take off the ground. The world is watching 
with growing concern the escalating trade confrontation between 
the United States and Japan. 
  Last Thursday President Bill Clinton dropped a bombshell 
when 
he announced that his administration was reviving the Super 301 
Trade Sanctions Authority in an effort to force Japan to buy 
more U.S. goods. The U.S. move follows the failure of Clinton 
and Japanese Premier Hosokawa at the Washington summit exactly a 
month ago to resolve the two country's long-standing economic 
differences. Though it is true that the revival of the Super 301 
law does not automatically lead to sanctions, tensions are 
running high among economic circle that the likelihood of a U.S. 
imposition of sanctions, however remote it may be, cannot be 
precluded. And if the Japanese decide to retaliate, there is a 
possibility of a trade war between the world's two biggest 
economies. Of course both sides have said that they want to 
prevent such a war but the way they have been accusing and 
criticizing each other over trade issues places an element of 
doubt in the minds of economic analysts around the globe. 
  The key point of dispute between the U.S. and Japan is the 
latest huge trade surplus of more than 130 billion U.S. dollars. 
Washington is determined to force a cut in this figure. It has 
demanded that Tokyo states numerical target in opening up the 
Japanese markets to more imports. Hosokawa has refused to bow 
to this demand which he says (?amounts to many strings) and 
increased U.S. protectionism. While the confrontation between 
the economic giants continues, there is increasing anxiety among 
the member nations of GATT over the effect the present squabble 
will have or prospect for an easing of world trade problem. 
  It took GATT seven long years to conclude the Uruguay Round 
of trade negotiations last December. But the new outbreak of 
bilateral trade tension is putting the achievements of the 
Uruguay Round to detach even before they are fully operational. 
The round's final accord liberalizing trade in goods and 
services among 118 countries is due to be formerly signed at the 
meeting of foreign and trade ministers in Morocco in the middle 
of next month. The meeting will also discuss the agenda for 
further efforts to broaden world trade and endorse the 
conversion on the 45-year-old GATT into a new and more powerful 
World Trade Organization, WTO. This body is scheduled to be 
created in the first half of 1995. 
  Under the above scenario, if big powers seek to resolve 
issues outside the multilateral system by trying to steer 
straight and not leave market forces to operate, everyone, both 
developed and developing nations, is bound to suffer. A trade 
war must be averted at all costs. It is up to the U.S. and 
Japan to resume negotiations to sort out their differences and 
arrive at sensible solution.

  [Text] The UMNO [United Nalays National Organization] 
Youth Movement has urged Andrew Neil, chief editor of the SUNDAY 
TIMES, to resign for straining relations between Malaysia and 
Britain and causing British companies to incur huge losses as 
they are no longer allowed to bid for Malaysian Government 
contracts. Tan Sri Haji Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, chairman of the 
UMNO Youth Movement, said it would be good for the SUNDAY TIMES 
to promise not to publish baseless and untrue reports about 
Malaysia to ensure that the economic interests of the two 
nations are maintained. In a statement issued in Melaka, the 
movement also severely criticized the provocative attitude of 
the SUNDAY TIMES, which urged the British Government to 
retaliate against Malaysia by freezing payments to the Pergau 
hydroelectric plant project. Malaysia should be prepared for 
any eventuality, in case the British Government is really forced 
to bow to the wishes and pressure of the SUNDAY TIMES which led 
to the Malaysian Government's decision not to award government 
contracts to British companies.

  [Text] Defense Minister Datuk Sri Mohamed Najib Tun Razak 
says the British Government is seeking ways to settle a dispute 
between the Malaysian Government and certain circles in the 
British press. Speaking to reporters in the ministry after 
attending the weekly cabinet meeting today, he said the British 
step is a good sign, but the government decided not to lift the 
ban on awarding new government contracts to British companies. 
  Britain is Malaysia's traditional arms supplier, 
particularly 
main defense systems and equipment such as warships and 
aircraft. Since 1988, Malaysia has bought defense systems and 
arms worth over 4 billion ringgit from Britain, while two huge 
military projects involving British companies have yet to start.

  [Text] Malaysian labor-intensive companies have been urged 
to consider relocating their operations to the 
Malaysian-initiated export processing zone, or EPZ, to be set up 
in Danang, Vietnam. The sales launch of the EPZ in Danang with 
EPZ MASDA joint venture cooperation as developer, will be held 
on the 22d of this month. EPZ MASDA chairman, Datuk Michael Chen 
told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur that labor-intensive 
companies, especially those in the garment and shoe 
manufacturing businesses, should reconsider relocating to the 
EPZ. 
  EPZ MASDA is a joint venture between Malaysian South-South 
Corporation Limited and Quang Nam-Da Nang Export Processing Zone 
Development Corporation. The EPZ is the brainchild of both the 
prime ministers of Vietnam and Malaysia -- the result of Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr Mahathir's visit to Hanoi in 1992.

  [Text] PORT VILA, March 10 (AFP) -- Opposition 
parliamentarian Franky Stevens, son of late secessionist leader 
Jimmy Stevens, joined Vanuatu's governing coalition Thursday, 
the prime minister's office announced here. 
  Stevens is the lone parliamentarian of the Nagriamel peasant 
movement which was started by his father. 
  Government spokesperson Yvette Sam told AFP it was "highly 
probable" that Stevens could be offered one of the two 
parliamentary posts currently vacant, either deputy speaker of 
parliament or leader of government business. 
  The government received a letter Wednesday from Stevens 
which 
said he wanted to join the government's side, 
  Following Stevens' defection from the opposition, the 
governing coalition led by the Union of Moderate Parties (UMP), 
controls 25 of the 46 seats in parliament. 
  In May 1979, only two months before Vanuatu became 
independent, Jimmy Stevens -- who died on February 28 -- 
launched a secessionist movement in Espiritu Santo island which 
was eventually put down with the aid of Papua New Guinea forces. 
  When the UMP was originally formed more than 20 years ago, 
the Nagriamel movement was one of its member parties.

  [Text] The employment ministerial talks (the employment 
summit) will be held for two days, 14-15 March, to discuss ways 
to resolve the unemployment issue, which is common in 
industrialized nations, and a draft of the statement of the 
chairman of the employment ministerial talks has come to light. 
As the most important task, the draft of the chairman's 
statement calls for reforming the structure of industries that 
can create new jobs. The United States is poised to set forth a 
macropolicy for creation of more jobs at the employment 
ministerial talks, and Japan, with a huge trade surplus, will 
certainly be pressed to expand its domestic demand at the talks. 
Japan plans to seek the understanding of other nations by 
presenting plans for reform of the industrial structure, but the 
possibility has emerged that both Japan and the United States 
will confront each other over the employment issue. 
  Among the industrialized nations, with the exception of 
Japan, the jobless rate has increased since around 1990 and 
unemployment has become a social issue. The jobless rate is 
falling in the United States and some other industrialized 
nations, but four industrialized nations of the Group of Seven 
[G-7] industrialized nations still suffer a high, double-digit 
jobless rate. For this reason, the United States has proposed 
that the G-7 industrialized nations hold the employment 
ministerial talks to discuss wide-ranging ways to resolve the 
unemployment issue. 
  The draft of the chairman's statement points out that it is 
necessary to reform the industrial structure in order to raise 
the flexibility of the labor market and to create new jobs. The 
draft of the chairman's statement notes that, to that end, 
promoting the wide use of new technology through the information 
revolution, strengthening education and training to adjust to 
new technology, and liberalizing trade are indispensable. 
Reflecting the view of the United States, which maintains the 
macropolicy, is a prerequisite for reforming the industrial 
structure. The draft of the chairman's statement explicitly 
indicates that reform of the industrial structure is effective 
only when it is supported and supplemented by the macropolicy. 
  At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the United 
States 
expressed strong discontent with Japan, contending that Japan's 
policy centering on tax cuts is inadequate to stimulate the 
economy and cut its surplus. This is a factor responsible for 
the breakdown of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. 
  At the employment summit, the United States plans to 
emphasize the need for the macropolicy and that the employment 
summit will unavoidably focus its debate on the issue of Japan's 
surplus. It is highly possible that other nations will ask Japan 
to implement the macropolicy which will expand domestic demand, 
claiming "Japan's surplus is depriving other nations of 
employment opportunities." 
  Japan plans to avoid being criticized over the macropolicy 
by 
stressing its posture to work on reform of the industrial 
structure. Japan intends to explain to other nations the 
contents of plans to reform the industrial structure which have 
been compiled by the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry and to urge other nations to work on reform of their 
respective industrial structures. The plans cite such industries 
as housing, information, communications, environment related, 
medical, welfare, and other domestic-demand-oriented industries 
that are expected to grow in the future, and stresses the need 
to upgrade the existing infrastructure, to promote deregulation, 
and to raise funds smoothly to develop those industries.

  [Text] Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations] and the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of 
Corporate Executives] compiled on 7 March the agenda of their 
respective emergency proposals concerning Japan-U.S. relations, 
in which a crack is developing in the wake of the recent 
Japan-U.S. summit talks. The Keidanren, in its agenda of 
proposals, asks the government to revise the basic plan for 
public investment totaling 430 trillion yen on which Japan and 
the United States agreed three years ago and to add more than 
100 trillion yen. The Keizai Doyukai, in its agenda of 
proposals, calls on the government to 1) add 100 trillion yen 
for public investment, 2) reduce Japan's current account surplus 
to about 2 percent of its GDP (gross national product) three 
years later, 3) cut the income tax, not for one year, but for at 
least three years prior to raising the consumption tax, and 4) 
work out an action program to narrow price differentials between 
Japan and other nations. The two economic organizations have 
submitted their proposals to the prime minister. 
  On 7 March, the president and vice presidents of Keidanren 
met to compile the agenda of emergency proposals entitled "View 
on Aggressive Solution of Japan-U.S. Issues." The Keizai 
Doyukai inaugurated an ad hoc committee shortly after the recent 
Japan-U.S. summit talks broke off to study ways to compile the 
agenda of the emergency proposal. As reasons for making the 
emergency proposal, the Keidanren says, "the United States is 
moving to slap sanctions on Japan over the mobile phone issue 
after the Super 301 provision was revived, and a sense of crisis 
is growing at home." Keizai Doyukai President Masaru Hayami 
says, "Both Japan and the United States should restore mutual 
trust at the earliest date." A growing sense of crisis among 
business leaders has prompted the two economic organizations to 
compile the agenda of their emergency proposals. 
  The Keidanren, in its agenda of proposals, calls for 
increasing the amount of public investment, thoroughly relaxing 
bureaucratic regulations, taking measures to help foreign firms 
gain access to the Japanese market through the removal of import 
and investment barriers, implementing properly a competitive 
policy, and reducing areas subject to exclusion from the 
competitive policy. As for the revival of the Super 301 
provision, the Keidanren makes clear its view that Japan should 
take its case to GATT if necessary, saying, "Japan should handle 
a bilateral trade dispute with the United States in GATT, and a 
hollowing out of international organizations and systems should 
be prevented." 
  The Keizai Doyukai makes concrete proposals to Japanese 
enterprises, U.S. corporations, the Japanese Government, and the 
U.S. Government. In its concrete proposals, the Keizai Doyukai 
asks Japanese enterprises to stop exporting goods at below 
production costs, aggressively purchase equipment and raw 
materials from abroad, address Japan's traditional trade 
practices, and rebuild their structure of business and 
production, and asks U.S. corporations to make self-help efforts 
to develop goods that are salable on the Japanese market. 
  Commenting on the "reduction of Japan's current account 
surplus to about 2 percent of GDP," the centerpiece of the 
Keizai Doyukai's proposal to the Japanese Government, Keizai 
Doyukai President Masaru Hayami says: "This year, Japan's 
current account surplus is 2.8 percent of its GDP, a decrease of 
0.3 percentage points from a year earlier. If this trend 
continues every year, the target figure could be met." 
Regarding the action program on bridging price differentials 
between Japan and other nations, the president says, the action 
program and timetable should be worked out to cut in half the 
gap between the exchange rate and purchasing power parity. He 
urges the U.S. Government to stabilize the exchange rate.

  [Text] Details of a statement of demands on a competition 
policy that the U.S. Government presented to the Japanese 
Government at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks have 
been disclosed. One major point is a demand for intensified 
enforcement of the Antimonopoly Act to prevent bid-rigging. 
Other demands include increases of at least 10 percent by fiscal 
year 1995 in the personnel and budget for the Investigation 
Department of the Fair Trade Commission [FTC], and the creation 
of a system for paying rewards to those who have provided 
information on cases of unfair trade practices. The intensified 
enforcement of the competition policy is also one major point of 
the measures for promoting market opening to be worked out by 
the government in mid-March. However, with regard to the U.S. 
demands, some Japanese Government officials have refuted the 
statement, saying that "it includes proposals such as creating a 
reward system which are unsuitable in the climate of Japanese 
society" (as stated by an FTC source). Therefore, this issue 
may possibly cause new friction between Japan and the United 
States. 
  At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, this statement 
of 
demands was submitted to the working-level panel on 
"transparency and circulation connected with the competition 
policy and concerned procedures." The U.S. Government is 
demanding that, to strengthen enforcement of the Antimonopoly 
Law, the Investigation Department, which is responsible for 
direct investigations of and prosecutions for Antimonopoly Law 
violations, should be expanded. Approval has been given to the 
FTC in its draft budget for fiscal year 1994 to add 17 staff 
members to its inspection department -- a 9-percent increase 
compared to that of the previous year. However, the U.S. 
Government is demanding that a larger number of staff members be 
added. 
  Aside from demanding that the structure of various 
industries 
-- such as the construction industry -- be strengthened to 
prevent bid-rigging, the U.S. Government has also proposed 
creation of a system of paying rewards to those who provide 
information on unfair trade practices, and for taking stronger 
administrative measures against those who have violated 
regulations. Moreover, the U.S. Government is also demanding 
that those companies involved in bid-rigging be prohibited from 
participating in bidding on public works projects or on 
government procurement contracts for at least 12 months, and 
that a system be introduced for forcing these companies to pay 
compensation to the government for the damage caused by 
bid-rigging. 
  The U.S. Government also made requests concerning business 
organizations. It requested that various agencies and 
ministries issue administrative guidance so that foreign 
companies will not be excluded from or discriminated against by 
organizations of various business circles. Moreover, it should 
be guaranteed that those foreign companies which are members of 
business organizations be provided with the same information as 
are their Japanese counterparts, and that the appropriate 
information be provided to nonmember foreign companies. 
  At the same time, the United States is demanding that 
regulations concerning the offering of premiums to customers be 
eased. In many cases, U.S. companies promote sales by offering 
premiums to customers. However, the U.S. Government is not 
happy about the fact that strict Japanese regulations on 
offering premiums constitute a barrier when a foreign company 
intends to join Japanese business organizations. The U.S. 
Government is now trying to urge the FTC to increase the ceiling 
for lotteries or premiums to at least 10 million yen by the end 
of June and to abolish all regulations concerning offering 
premiums by the end of fiscal year 1995.

  [Text] At an ordinary prefectural assembly session on the 
morning of 4 March, Shinsuke Tomoyose (a member of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan) posed questions concerning a U.S. 
base issue, a law on special measures for promoting diversion of 
military-occupied land, measures to close the gap between the 
pension system on Okinawa and that on the Japanese mainland, and 
the promotion of administrative measures for peace. With regard 
to the base issue, Tomoyose said he had obtained a report on the 
environmental impact assessment at U.S. Forces facilities on 
Okinawa, which was prepared by the U.S. Marine Corps [USMC] in 
accordance with a U.S. law. He proposed that "the prefectural 
government should demand disclosure of the results of such an 
assessment at U.S. Forces facilities on Okinawa." 
  As an example of the destruction of nature by U.S. Forces, 
he 
cited U.S. live-shelling exercises across a prefectural highway, 
saying: "It is necessary to take up such matters as 
environmental problems." He pointed out that the USMC conducts 
environmental impact assessments at U.S. Forces facilities in 
accordance with a U.S. "national environmental policy law." He 
stressed that the prefectural government should demand that the 
U.S. Forces conduct an environmental impact assessment at major 
U.S. Forces facilities -- such as Kadena Air Base, Futenma Air 
Station, the live-shelling training area in Camp Hansen, and the 
Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, where parachute training is 
conducted -- and disclose the results of the assessment. 
  The report obtained by Tomoyose contains the results of the 
environmental impact assessment made by the USMC in 1987 on a 
project to construct a landing pad for Harrier jump jets in the 
northern training area. It notes that the assessment was made 
by the USMC Headquarters on Okinawa in accordance with the 
"national environmental policy law." 
  Also, in connection with efforts to enact a law on special 
measures to promote diversion of military-occupied land, 
Tomoyose said: "It should be stipulated in the law that the 
U.S. forces and the Japanese Government are responsible for 
environmental protective measures, including antipollution 
measures on U.S. bases."

  [Text] At a meeting with business leaders of the Kansai 
region in Osaka city, Koshiro Ishida, director general of the 
Management and Coordination Agency, talked about the 
government's recently announced comprehensive and emergency 
economic stimulus measures. 
  Ishida said that of 60 related laws that are required to be 
amended to implement a deregulation program covering 875 
products in the stimulus measures, the government plans to amend 
40 laws in a single package and the remaining 20 separately. 
  Under the government-announced deregulation program, which 
covers 875 items, a total of 1,591 licensing and approval 
systems will be deregulated. Director General Ishida said: 
"People may think it is easy to deregulate current systems. 
But, actually, carrying out deregulation is very hard work 
because it requires the amendment of laws. Although we want, as 
much as possible, to amend those laws in a single package, the 
more difficult ones have to be amended separately." 
  His remarks explained the government's approach to tackling 
deregulation.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 March Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The government on 9 March decided to set up 
additional working groups under the Administrative Reform 
Promotion Headquarters (headed by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa) and to have them come up with, by the end of June, 
additional deregulation measures primarily in the areas of 
market-access barriers and import controls. Keiretsu dealings 
and other commercial practices which have come under attack by 
other countries are also expected to become the subjects of 
study by these groups. 
  The U.S. Government has asked the Japanese Government to 
move 
up the target for finalizing the deregulation enforcement 
five-year plan, which is now set for completion by March 1995, 
to mid-July, when the summit of industrialized nations (Naples 
summit) will be held. The government is due to discuss measures 
including this point at the 10 March cabinet ministers meeting 
on foreign economic issues. 
  The government held a ministers meeting on 9 March to 
discuss 
issues concerning the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks and 
agreed that the market-liberalization measures now under study 
should be finalized in two groups -- the first measures by the 
end of March and the second measures by the time of the summit 
in July. 
  During a news conference on the evening of the same day, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said that the 
government will set up immediately, in addition to the existing 
deregulation working group on land and housing issues, a similar 
working group on the information communications sector and 
another on the distribution sector by the end of the month. 
These working groups will deal with issues related to market 
access and regulations governing imports, and they will study 
deregulation measures that would lead to the promotion of 
imports. 
  Meanwhile, in relation to this question, a government source 
on the same evening noted, "Even among cabinet members, views 
are emerging on the need to review Japan's commercial practices." 
  According to the Foreign Ministry, the United States has 
requested Japan to add to the "deregulation enforcement plan" 
deregulation measures concerning the distribution sector as well 
as measures for improving the transferability of land. The 
United States has also asked about the schedule for finalizing 
the plan, and it noted with respect to the deadline for 
implementing the plan, "We hope that Japan will not try to 
adhere to the implementation deadline of five years but rather 
will facilitate its implementation before that."

  [Text] The Bank of Japan [BOJ] remains cautious about 
current economic conditions given in the short-term announcement 
released on 1 March. The BOJ considers it an encouraging 
indication that there are signs the economy has hit bottom, as 
seen in increased shipments of electric appliances. But 
Kagehide Kaku, chief of the BOJ Research and Statistics 
Department, said: "It is difficult to predict precisely when 
the economic recovery will start." This means that should the 
economy deteriorate further because of worsened labor conditions 
and the yen's sharp appreciation, the BOJ intends to take prompt 
measures to induce lower short-term rates. 
  The reason why the BOJ is cautious about the economic future 
is because while there are some favorable economic factors like 
increased investments in equipment and expansion of public works 
projects, there are also unfavorable factors such as those seen 
in unemployment problems and the yen's appreciation. In other 
words, the BOJ thinks: "The current situation is a mixture of 
contrasting factors." The BOJ is particularly nervous about the 
trend of high yen value and labor conditions. The fact that the 
private sector's investment in plants and equipment are not 
expected to grow even in 1994 is also contributing to its 
thinking that "no clear indications have been identified to 
confirm the economic recovery." 
  Meanwhile, the financial market is rather optimistic 
compared 
with the BOJ, believing: "The economy is recovering after 
having hit bottom." The BOJ wants to watch how current 
long-term interest rates will increase in the future. Should 
the increase be too sharp, thus bringing about a negative impact 
on the recovery, it will act to further ease the monetary market.

  [Text] In a meeting held on 5 March in Osaka with 
businessmen in the Kansai area, Koshiro Ishida, director general

confusion among the ruling coalition parties and criticized the

would have been different if the SDPJ--which is the largest 
ruling party--had put themselves in the position of Prime 
Minister Hosokawa." Regarding Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, 
Ishida stated: "We were moving toward the view that the Tax 
System Research Council will deal with the issues of revenue 
sources following tax reductions. I do not understand his 
opinion that it was a desultory view."

  [Text] In a bid to look at the present state and future of 
the business community that is under pressure to "change" itself 
following the decision by Keidanren [Japan Federation of 
Economic Organizations] to arrange corporate contributions, the 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a written poll in mid-February of 50 
key businessmen and compiled results of the poll on 5 March. 
The MAINICHI SHIMBUN has received answers from 34 of the 
businessmen polled, and 60 percent of the respondents clearly 
indicated a preference in the direction of banning corporate 
contributions. More than 90 percent of the leading businessmen 
surveyed supported the Keidanren's decision to stop arranging 
corporate contributions. Asked to which political parties they 
wanted to contribute, a majority of the businessmen surveyed 
chose a plurality of parties from among the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New 
Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger]. In general, the leading 
businessmen surveyed supported the four political parties. The 
results of the poll revealed the position of the business 
community, which has no choice but to deal with the realities of 
funding requirements, while acknowledging the need for a change 
in the relationship between politics and money. 
  Asked to comment on Keidanren's decision to halt the 
arrangement of corporate contributions, a majority of 31 leading 
businessmen "supported" it while two leading businessmen, 
including an executive of Keidanren, "did not support" it. 
  In the poll, 25 key businessmen said that the "cause of 
corporate contributions to safeguard freedom and a market 
economy," which the business community has advocated, "is still 
valid, but has lost significance." Five business leaders said 
the "cause has disappeared completely." In this way, nearly 90 
percent of the key businessmen said "the cause has either 
disappeared or lost significance." 
  Asked whether corporate contributions should be abolished or 
continued, a total of 21 key businessmen, or 60 percent of the 
leading businessmen polled, said that "corporate contributions 
should be abolished immediately," or "they should be abolished 
after a certain period of time has elapsed." But eight leading 
businessmen said the "business community should make a certain 
amount of corporate contributions." The rest said they wanted 
to reserve comment. 
  Asked how political funds should be raised in the future, 21 
leading businessmen said they should be raised through a 
combination of public fund raising and individual contributions, 
whereas 13 key businessmen said they should be raised by "a 
combination of public fund raising, individual contributions, 
and corporate contributions." 
  Asked which political parties they supported, about 70 
percent of the leading businessmen polled said they supported a 
plurality of parties from among the LDP, Shinseito, the Japan 
New Party, and Sakigake, but only two leading businessmen 
supported the LDP, with eight businessmen declining to answer 
the question. Thus, the results of the poll showed that with 
the emergence of new conservative parties, it has become 
difficult for the businessmen to support one specific political 
party. Twenty-five key businessmen, or more than 70 percent of 
them, expressed their support for the Hosokawa cabinet. 
  Asked to which political parties they would contribute for 
the time being, 10 businessmen said they would contribute to the 
LDP and Shinseito, whereas eight businessmen said they would 
contribute to the Japan New Party and Sakigake, while seven 
businessmen showed their eagerness to contribute to the 
Democratic Socialist Party. Almost no businessmen expressed an 
intention to contribute to a plurality of political parties; 17 
businessmen "declined to answer the question." 
  Asked what they thought of the future of corporate 
contributions, a majority of 30 businessmen believed they would 
decrease. Asked about the transparency of corporate 
contributions, four leading businessmen were pessimistic, saying 
"their transparency will remain unchanged."

  [Text] The economy-related government offices in 
Kasumigaseki, Tokyo, were cool about the cancellation of a plan 
to reshuffle the cabinet, but some voiced disappointment on a 
"political vacuum" that has developed in the government coming 
into this month. 
  Since the Japan-U.S. economic consultations broke down, the 
U.S. retaliatory measures against Japan, as seen in the high-yen 
offensive, have been growing on a daily basis. It is time for 
Japan to consider taking some actions. The government, at an 
informal meeting of foreign economy issues-related ministers on 
25 February, agreed to expedite actions in four areas, like 
deregulation, but it was assumed that specific plans would be 
completed by the end of March. 
  But with the U.S. offensive intensifying, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa has announced preparation of the specific 
plans would be hurried. The government offices concerned, 
meanwhile, are lost. They cannot come up with any good ideas. A 
senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry said, "After all, the Japan-U.S. summit decided we 
should have a cooling-down period. Right now, there is nothing." 
On the other hand, some of the officials charged with the 
Japan-U.S. consultations complained, "To be absorbed only in a 
cabinet reshuffle at a time like this can mean forgetting about 
Japan-U.S. relations." 
  The cabinet reshuffle plan eventually was given up, but many 
people think the leadership and gathering power of the prime 
minister are bound to erode. These people felt uneasy, and 
said, "According to the way things are going, the restoration of 
relations with the United States will only be delayed. The 
situation is now so bad that if we do not do something, we can 
end up in a trade war." 
  Meanwhile, a senior official of the Ministry of Finance 
[MOF] 
was pleased with the outcome, saying, "This was better than 
having the coalition be damaged by enforcing the reshuffle." 
The MOF officials had strongly hoped that Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii (of Shinseito), who himself once was a bureaucrat 
serving in the ministry, would "be retained." There is even a 
mood of welcoming this development, as such. 
  But in the ministry there is a voice expressing concern that 
the restoration of relations between Prime Minister Hosokawa and 
his housekeeper, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, 
which have soured would "be very difficult," according to a 
senior official of the ministry's Budget Bureau. The MOF has 
tended to work closely with Shinseito and Komeito in the past to 
get its economic policies adopted. The same ministry official 
said, "It is possible that the rift within the Prime Minister's 
Office will impact adversely on the Diet deliberations on the 
1994 budget."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Prime Minister Urged To Quit Rough-and-Ready </F>
Technique"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was forced to give 
up a cabinet reshuffle plan, which he was very eager to realize. 
  A widening gap and amplified discord among the coalition 
parties are the net result of his bungled attempt, which he 
suddenly brought forward after returning from a Japan-U.S. 
summit. 
  "Hastiness" stalks the prime minister. Still fresh in our 
memory is his aborted "national welfare tax" concept. Having 
made one blunder after another, he must take full blame for 
causing so much confusion in politics and state affairs. 
  When he first expressed his desire to reorganize the 
cabinet, 
we questioned the propriety of a reshuffle at a time when he 
faced imminent deliberations on fiscal 1994 budget, which 
contains, as its main pillars, economic measures designed to 
overcome the recession. It does not surprise us that he ended up 
having to forgo his bid. 
  It is true that there are precedents where cabinets were 
reorganized after the compilation of draft budgets, but in those 
cases the draft budget process had invariably been completed in 
December, leaving ample time before budget deliberations began 
in the new year. In Hosokawa's case, had he reshuffled the 
cabinet on 3 March, he would have had only one day before his 
scheduled 4 March policy address to the Diet. 
  In addition, newly appointed ministers without adequate 
knowledge would have had to answer questions from the opposition 
parties on draft budget items compiled by their predecessors. 
That certainly would have brought the severe criticism that the 
prime minister had treated the people and the Diet with contempt. 
  Given the fact that he faced so many obvious pitfalls, it is 
hard to understand why he sought to ram through his initiative. 
  The prime minister tried to explain that a reshuffle was 
necessary to secure a line-up of ministers to form a cabinet 
devoted to economic reform that should constitute his next 
central objective now that political reform has essentially been 
achieved. 
  It sounded reasonable. However, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, who was asked by the prime minister what he 
thought of the reshuffle plan, disclosed that the prime minister 
asked him "to move to another post because of strong criticism 
against him (from within the coalition)." 
  However, it was evident that the prime minister's "abrupt" 
move for a reshuffle was simply to "oust Takemura." 
  Moreover, it was also obvious that this scheme had its 
origin 
in Shinseito representative secretary Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito 
Secretary General Yoichi Ichikawa, rather than the prime 
minister himself. Ozawa and Ichikawa are in rivalry with 
Takemura and their opinions are becoming far apart. Observers 
agree that it was, in fact, not only a power struggle over 
whether the future political map should consist of two major 
parties or a "tripolar" arrangement, but also a difference in 
their political styles and a personality conflict. 
  Although we respect the prime minister's exclusive 
prerogative to hire and fire his ministers, we question his 
inclination toward one party. It is said that fiduciary 
relations between Hosokawa and Takemura have loosened since the 
confusion over the failed "national welfare tax" proposal. If 
the rift between the prime minister and the chief cabinet 
secretary -- who is supposed to be his closest confidant -- is 
widening, they may have to "negotiate a divorce." Although it 
is a prime minister's exclusive right to reshuffle his cabinet, 
Hosokawa, as leader of a coalition government, should have 
enlisted the views of the coalition parties and reached a 
consensus before moving for a reshuffle. He must remember that 
he is driving a coach drawn by "eight horses," and he must 
handle the reins with extreme care if he wants to stay in his 
seat. We urge Prime Minister Hosokawa to go back once again to 
the starting point of the coalition government.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Lightness of Prime Minister's Words Is </F>
Concern"] 
  [Text] People who listened with high hopes to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's administrative policy speech were 
probably left disappointed. His speech was a bureaucratic 
composition which served only to convince us that there is some 
basis to the U.S. criticism that the Hosokawa administration is 
controlled by bureaucrats. There is speculation that the prime 
minister did not have enough time to prepare for his speech 
because of the confusion over the cabinet reshuffle. It appears 
the prime minister has given up his previous practice of using 
only his own words. 
  Originally, the prime minister was a politician who placed 
importance on speeches. In preparing for his visit to the 
United States in February, he worried more about a speech to 
Georgetown University than the important Japan-U.S. summit 
talks. The general policy speech he delivered to the Diet in 
August last year immediately after his inauguration assured us 
this was the "start of a new era." His general policy speech in 
September, which quoted from a German writer, bore his certain 
style. 
  The recent speech was his first administrative effort, but 
it 
was not a good one and was excused by an aide with the excuse, 
"the prime minister had no choice but to mention all sorts of 
matters because the speech was based on the draft budget." The 
general public wanted to hear something other than an 
enumeration of policies prepared by bureaucrats. 
  The first thing they wanted to hear was the prime minister's 
recognition of the economic recession and mention of what 
counter measures were planned. The second thing they wanted was 
an explanation of how he will rebuild relations between Japan 
and the United States. They would also have wanted to hear 
about his responsibility for the confusion within the ruling 
coalition over the proposed national welfare tax and cabinet 
reshuffle. The prime minister's speech failed to provide enough 
answers to satisfy these legitimate public concerns. 
  As far as economic pump-priming measures are concerned, the 
prime minister merely pointed out the need for "seamless fiscal 
expenditure." He made no mention of the responsibility the 
government had for allowing the economic recession to become 
prolonged. He said the Japan-U.S. relationship "is moving to a 
new level." What concerns us is the prime minister's optimistic 
view of the situation, as if he had happily accepted the 
breakdown of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. 
  In providing an abstract explanation of the political 
confusion among the ruling coalition parties, he said only that 
"these trials are only to be expected given that we have dared 
to choose a new and untrodden path." The prime minister 
probably wanted to say that a little confusion should be 
expected. What, instead, we see in his speech is that the prime 
minister has no sense of responsibility for the current 
situation in which there seems to be no policy. 
  It seems Hosokawa has tended to speak first and think later 
since the confusion over his proposal to introduce a national 
welfare tax. He told reporters recently that his administrative 
policy speech would be delivered on 7 March. The next day he 
had to go back on that. We do not intend to support the 
Nagata-cho rule [which works only in Nagata-cho where the Diet 
and the LDP headquarters are located] that "the prime minister 
must not speak about Diet schedules." 
  The prime minister sometimes has to make decisions that will 
affect lives of many people. If he is careless in what he says, 
it could affect Japan's credit with foreign nations. 
  Aides to the prime minister said: "This was the result of 
having many people work out the speech, rather than leaving it 
to one person." This amounts to a confession that bureaucrats 
played a leading role in writing the policy speech. When 
bureaucrats write a speech appealing for the need to tackle 
economic and administrative reform through deregulation, as the 
next big task following political reform, the words only ring 
hollow.

  [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll on 
26-27 February, or immediately before Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's decision to give up a cabinet reshuffle, to probe the 
public's evaluation of the six-month-old Hosokawa administration 
and their personal impressions of the prime minister. As the 
result, 60 percent of the pollees showed positive responses to 
the achievements of the Hosoakwa administration. When asked 
what is the best achievement of the Hosokawa administration, 37 
percent indicated "the enactment of the political reform laws." 
To a question asking impressions of Prime Minister Hosokawa, 
however, 54 percent said "he has no leadership," and 64 percent 
said "he has no control over the coalition parties." Thus, the 
majority of the public questions the prime minister's political 
leadership. In response to a question on impressions of the 
"Kono-led Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]," most respondents 
indicated negative images of the giant opposition, as 34 percent 
indicated the LDP's "lack of unity in the party." 
  Regarding the achievements of the Hosokawa administration 
over the last six months, 60 percent said there were "favorable" 
achievements, and 35 percent said the achievements are 
"unfavorable." Followed by "the enactment of the political 
reform laws," the pollees said the positive achievements of the 
Hosokawa administration were: "Partial liberalization of the 
rice market" (21 percent); "the 6 trillion yen income tax cut in 
advance of an enactment of consumption tax hike" (17 percent); 
and "positive discussions with LDP President Kono" (16 percent). 
  On the other hand, major responses to a question asking the 
negative aspects of the administration were: "Shinseito 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's excessive influence on the 
administration" (34 percent); "partial liberalization of the 
rice market" (29 percent); "the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan's opposition to important policies of the coalition 
government" (21 percent); and "increase in bureaucrats' 
influence on political issues" (15 percent). 
  Concerning impressions of the prime minister's "leadership," 
43 percent said "he has enough leadership," but 54 percent said 
"he has no leadership." With respect to "the prime minister's 
control over the coalition parties," 64 percent said "he has no 
control," while 28 percent said "he has adequate control."

  [Text] On 8 March, the Japan New Party [JNP] decided on 
five new party executives, including Sumio Matsuoka, who will 
succeed Satoshi Arai as secretary general. Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa (JNP representative), who had been entrusted 
with the selection of the new officials, announced the lineup at 
a meeting of JNP Diet members of both houses on the morning of 
the same day and won their approval. Because dissatisfaction 
with the former executive board has been expressed within the 
party, claiming that "the party's management and personnel 
affairs are influenced by the intention of the secretariat," the 
possibility of changing executives has been studied. The five 
new executives will soon select members of the standing 
executive committee, which is a decision-making body second only 
to the party convention. 
  The new executives are: Kunitaro Takeda, (who will remain 
as) acting secretary general; Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general; 
Eiji Nagai and Muneaki Samejima, deputy secretary general; and 
Hirotaro Yamazaki, chairman of the general committee of Diet 
members of both houses.

<F P=106> [Article by Shigeo Nakao, Osaka Municipal University </F>
associate professor: "Economic Policies Should Be Premised on 
New Financial System"] 
  [Text] Explanation of Changes in Economic Structure 
From Financial Aspect 
  Japanese businesses are in the process of changing 
their primary source of capital from bank loans to direct 
financing via securities markets. Ironically, businesses' 
alienation from banks stemmed from bank initiatives to issue 
capital stock, creating a boom in the issuance of secondary 
offerings. On the other hand, entirely different transactions 
from past Japanese-style futures trading systems is causing a 
collapse in the stock crossholding ownership system. At this 
juncture when we see a structural change in the Japanese 
economy, authorities must search for policies that are 
applicable to new financial systems. 
  The economic situation enshrouding Japanese society is 
especially serious. It seems that the 1980's when Japan was 
referred to as an economic or financial superpower are now in 
the distant past. 
  Even the automobile industry, which once considered itself 
the export elite of Japan, has begun to close plants and cut 
personnel; department stores and supermarkets continue to record 
sales declines from previous year figures, and restaurant rows 
with bright neon signs which normally prosper with festive 
yearend parties are filled with empty taxicabs waiting for the 
now rare rider. Japanese banks, which once monopolized the top 
rankings for banks worldwide, see no solution to their 
accumulations of nonperforming loans and mention is made of the 
risk of a crisis in the financial system. It is time for 
economic schools to perform on stage, but we must recognize the 
reality that there is no easy cure for the problem. 
<H5>  Structural Changes </H5>
  The overall economy has changed completely from an 
inflationary to a deflationary one. Despite the fact that super 
low interest rates prevail, below even those in the latter half 
of the 1980's, the money supply fails to grow and stock prices 
cannot free themselves from the fear of a free fall because of 
the murkiness of the future economy. The approach of cashing in 
on unrealized paper profits to offset costs of amortizing 
nonperforming loans faces problems and the markets are 
enshrouded with a bottomless fear of future uncertainty in all 
business categories. 
  The effects of the changing economy have begun to affect the 
general public in the form of layoffs, and if personal as well 
as corporate demand should cool, the problem of excess capital 
investments of the late 1980's will show up with greater 
intensity. When that happens, further production cuts will be 
made and, in the worst possible case, we can expect a spiraling 
shrinkage of material and monetary supplies. Already, in October 
1993, the industrial production index had fallen to 88.0 and the 
shipping index to 89.5 from indices of 100 in 1990, the largest 
drop since the survey was started in 1978. 
  Corporate revenue has declined drastically and, in the half 
year ending September 1993, recurring profits in the 
manufacturing sector declined 31.8 percent, recurring profits of 
the 11 automobile firms fell 90 percent, and revenue and profits 
declined industrywide to the degree that one out of five firms 
suffered losses, as reported by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN on 1 
December 1993. The notion that "prices always rise" and "the 
economy by its very nature expands" is in the process of 
undergoing instantaneous invalidation. 
  Past episodes of this nature would have called for launching 
public works projects, but this time we cannot anticipate much 
in the way of relief from that source. Government finances are 
not adequate to provide for action in this sector and, although 
the Japanese Government compiled a huge supplemental budget of 
more than 30 trillion yen for the period 1992 to 1993, the 
desired effect was not obtained because of changes taking place 
in the economic system. Further, there is very little desire to 
borrow funds, despite the super low interest rates. This 
situation reflects the severity of the debts accumulated during 
the 1980's and has a restrictive effect on any remedy that can 
be envisioned in the way of financial policy. 
  Essentially, the problem is that the economic system itself 
is changing. In other words, the system is undergoing a 
structural change as opposed to a cyclical change, and the 
situation requires an analysis in this respect. 
  Accordingly, this should not be simply interpreted as a 
period in which we witness a "revival of Keynesian theory." 
Clearly, the "market worship" ideas of the "Chicago School" 
which asserted in the 1980's that Keynesian principles were 
relics of the past have lost their appeal, and the collapse of 
socialism was accompanied by the disappearance from center stage 
of Marxism which gave the impression of attracting the 
conscience of all people. One wonders about the potential 
effectiveness of any prescription written under a Keynesian 
scenario which consists of an amalgamation of market and 
programming principles just when both these principles are in 
the process of losing social credibility. 
  The times are not so simple as to allow easy acceptance of a 
"revival of Keynesian theory." The reason is that a great 
structural change is taking place in the economy to the extent 
that Keynesian policy cannot create effective demand, and 
economic policy scenarios cannot be written without considering 
that fact. This article will not address the issue completely, 
but is designed to confirm the spread of the issue presented and 
to aid in identifying a solution for the issue. 
<H5>  Change From Indirect Financing to Direct Financing </H5>
  At one time, the main source of capital for Japanese 
business 
was bank loans; it was not popular to seek funds via capital 
markets by issuing stocks and bonds. The latter method of 
capital procurement was limited to some of the firms listed on 
the stock exchanges, and high issuing costs associated with a 
unique underwriting system (limited to underwriting securities 
firms in the Euromarket) favored maintenance of a financial 
system centered on banks rather than capital markets. 
Underwriting institutions handling corporate bonds are limited 
to a segment of influential long-term credit banks, thus 
providing for the comparative prevalence of banks in the 
Japanese financial system. 
  Such circumstances enhanced the societal confidence assigned 
to the banking industry. Between banks and securities firms, 
banks enjoy overwhelming confidence, while the custom of 
referring to securities firms in a somewhat deprecatory fashion 
as "brokerages" reflects the low social confidence placed in the 
stock market. 
  Preference given to banks in this capital procurement 
structure has been extended to banks even in the management of 
funds by individuals in that they deposit funds in bank deposits 
or postal savings accounts despite low interest rates. Such a 
trend was influenced to a degree by the fact that other options 
were not necessarily diversified. Accordingly, a low-interest 
policy provided the mechanism whereby banks served as 
intermediaries in providing low-cost funds. Further, whenever 
there was a shortage of funds, postal savings were diverted to 
public works projects in a system referred to as the fiscal 
investment and loan program. In essence, banks and post offices 
served as intermediaries and played a central role under a 
structure which supplied low-interest capital to industry. 
  In contrast to the foregoing situation, both the stock 
markets and bond markets were comparatively unpopular for 
investment of funds and were considered risky. As a former 
employee of a securities firm, I still have strong memories of 
an anecdote dating back to the 1970's when a branch manager of 
the securities firm returned from a trip to Europe to gleefully 
report that "In Europe securities firms are called banks." In 
those days, it was the "fervent desire" of securities firms in 
Japan to be elevated to the status of banks. 
  This structure in which banks play a central role in issuing 
loans changed considerably during the 1980's. Those changes were 
inspired by external pressure. The Bank for International 
Settlements (BIS) imposed the principle of maintaining a certain 
net worth and an awareness was established among currency 
authorities who supervise international financial markets that 
increasing net worth was indispensable in coping with 
instability in the financial system. In response, Japanese 
banks, which had extremely low levels of net worth, zealously 
pursued the issuance of capital instruments. 
  Due to financial liberalization, Eurobond issues overseas 
were gradually liberalized, and a wide spectrum of firms issued 
bonds in the Eurobond markets. 
  The reason why Japanese firms zealously engaged in the 
procurement of capital in the form of convertible and warrant 
bonds in the Euromarkets was the unusually low costs. And, both 
the percentage of Japanese business firms' capital procured in 
Eurobond markets and the percentage of Japanese corporate issues 
on the overall Eurobond market were huge, while many Japanese 
firms from the manufacturing and service sectors established 
financial subsidiaries in Europe and created a boom in capital 
investment and procurement. 
  Essentially, Japanese domestic bank loans recorded a 
relative 
decline and securities markets played a central role in raising 
capital for the first time. If it were a case that the 
initiative of banks in raising capital by issuing stock inspired 
corporate alienation from banks, i.e., active raising of capital 
via the securities markets, we must label the development as 
being ironic. This is because we can say that the extensive 
involvement of banks themselves in the stock markets brought 
about a decline in the social function of banks. 
<H5>  Unprecedented Alchemy </H5>
  The foregoing events have led to a substantial change in the 
financial structure of Japanese corporations and a conspicuous 
rise in their net worth. 
  A review of changes over a 10-year period shows that net 
worth of Japanese corporations which stood at 20.93 percent in 
1980 grew to 29.57 percent in 1985 and 36.4 percent in 1990. In 
contrast, U.S. corporate net worth over the same period dropped 
from 49.63 percent to 45.0 percent to 40.16 percent. The sharp 
rise in net worth of Japanese corporations and the contrasting 
sharp drop in U.S. corporate net worth are impressive. 
  On the other hand, a look at the nature of debt shows a 
decline in current liabilities, i.e., a major decline in 
short-term borrowing. Short-term borrowing as a percentage of 
total assets (capital plus debt) during the above-mentioned 
10-year period stood at 17.6 percent, 16.3 percent, and 9.9 
percent. 
  On the other hand, U.S. corporate short-term borrowing as a 
percentage of total assets during the same 10-year period stood 
at a very low 3.8 percent, 3.7 percent, and 4.3 percent and 
showed little change. 
  Rather, U.S. corporate debt structures reflect an increase 
in 
the ratio of fixed debt in excess of one year known as long-term 
debt. Such long-term debt as a ratio of total assets during the 
same 10-year period stood at 23.6 percent, 28.1 percent, and 
34.1 percent (the data cover the manufacturing sector and were 
extracted from the Bank of Japan "International Statistical 
Comparisons"). 
  The data give us the opportunity to examine differences in 
financial structures of the 1980's whereby Japanese corporations 
tended to raise capital by issuing stock, while U.S. 
corporations tended to issue bonds for the same purpose. A 
similar drop in corporate bank loan ratios has taken place in 
both Japan and the United States, but the fact that bank loan 
ratios in Japan are still about twice as high as in the United 
States demonstrates that corporate dependence on banks is 
greater in Japan than in the United States. 
  Stock markets expanded at an accelerated pace in the 1980's. 
  Effects of the low-interest policies implemented under a 
coordinated international policy resulted in the flow of capital 
into stock markets. Capital procured with extremely low interest 
rates flowed into stock markets and the alchemy of a flow of 
funds from right to left functioned efficiently; even when Black 
Monday his the New York Stock Exchange in 1987, the Japanese 
markets were enshrouded with the bullish mood that the "Tokyo 
Stock Market" was insulated. Stocks continued to rise regardless 
of volume issued, giving birth to the "myth of stock prices." 
  However, we must not forget that the "myth of stock prices" 
was the product of a desperate effort to engineer a stable stock 
ownership system. If stocks are held on a long-term basis 
through cross-shareholding and the stock in question is not 
traded in the markets, there would be no reason to sell the 
stocks. As long as underlying selling pressure (expansion of 
supply) did not manifest itself, equity financing functioned as 
an unprecedented form of alchemy. 
<H5>  Collapse of the Cross-Shareholding System </H5>
  However, such circumstances guarantee reciprocal benefits if 
stocks continue to rise in value, but the story changes if they 
decline. I would like to verify the role of banks when that 
occurs. 
  Banks not only issued loans to corporations, but also 
intervened in a wide range of corporate accounting settlements; 
in the international arena, banks offered foreign exchange 
services and foreign intelligence as well as serving on 
corporate management staffs as they dispatched officers to 
provide industrial corporations assistance in the form of human 
resources. 
  However, because banks were most aggressive in the issuance 
of capital stock as a special characteristic of the 1980's, a 
sharp increase took place in the share of bank stocks issued. 
When stock prices peaked in December 1989, financial and 
insurance stocks held a 29.7-percent share of the total market 
value of all stock issued. 
  However, transactions in financial and insurance stocks did 
not exceed 5.4 percent of total shares and 7.2 percent of total 
value traded. Bank stocks enjoyed the structural status of being 
issued but rarely traded. The reason for this was the attitude 
that nonfinancial corporations should refrain from selling stock 
of main banks on which the former were dependent for loans. 
  However, the foregoing attitude should not be interpreted as 
a situation in which holders were unilaterally forced to retain 
their bank stocks. Corporate cross-shareholding was created 
among companies in the same corporate group with the idea that 
when one firm decides to issue new stock, it can depend on other 
corporations in the same group to purchase the newly issued 
stock, to maintain continuous business relationships, maintain 
stable stock prices through the creation of stable shareholders, 
and thus create stability in the management of corporations. 
  However, systems of the foregoing nature are changing as 
stock prices fall. A look at data as of April 1992 when bank 
stocks were declining shows that financial and insurance stocks, 
which represented 25.7 percent of total stock value, had 
represented 7.2 percent of total shares traded and 11 percent of 
total value traded (data from the "Monthly Statistical Report of 
the Tokyo Stock Exchange"). Although the data indicate that 
financial stocks represent a large share of the total stock 
value and that trade in such stocks represents only a small 
share of the total volume traded, the share of both stocks 
traded and value traded have risen despite a drop in the current 
market value. This reflects a rise in the frequency with which 
bank stocks are being sold. Most likely, the fact that bank 
stocks played a significant role in the overall market drop at 
the end of 1993 can probably be interpreted as a further 
acceleration in the selling trend. 
  The fact that bank stocks--which play a central role in 
Japanese-style corporate groupings--lead in sales when overall 
stock prices are declining reflects concern for the 
nonperforming bond problem as well as concern for bank 
operations, but also probably reflects a structural collapse of 
the cross-shareholding stock ownership system which is the very 
heart of Japanese-style systems to the degree that even bank 
stocks are subject to disposal. According to the 15 October 1993 
edition of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, "Cross-sharehold of stock 
established by corporations during the bubble period with the 
objective of supporting stock prices is estimated to total 20-30 
trillion yen and there is a widely held view that this segment 
of cross-shareholding is subject to early disposition." It can 
be assumed that because of hesitancy on the part of banks to 
issue loans and the difficulty to issue new stock, corporations 
are selling stock holdings to build up cash on hand and to raise 
new capital. 
<H5>  Futures Trading as Different Factor in the Market </H5>
  What factors caused a manifestation of underlying expansion 
in supply, i.e., selling pressure in the markets, through 
excessive issuance of stock under equity financing? 
  Basically, conceivable is the fact that the excessive 
issuance of stock in the form of huge, excessive financings in 
the latter half of the 1980's created huge selling pressure. 
However, as long as cross-shareholding relationships were 
maintained and stable stock ownership operations functioned 
smoothly, selling pressure did not manifest in the markets. 
Stock withheld from the markets despite continued new issuances 
caused stocks which should have fallen to continue rising and 
equity financing functioned in the form of clever "alchemy." 
  However, at this point, I would like to draw attention to 
the 
fact that the arrival of different trading in the form of 
futures trading caused a change in the market structure. In the 
United States, long- and medium-term government bonds and 
currency are the primary objects of futures trading, but in 
Japan stock index futures became the major segment of the 
futures market. 
  The main issue presented here is the difference between 
futures trading and Japanese systems. In a world of 
cross-shareholding, a rise in stock prices is beneficial to all 
corporations and a decline in stock prices has a negative 
impact. In general, mainstream textbooks in Japan explain (by 
using advance mathematical formulas) that futures trading can be 
effective in reducing risks. However, in the United States where 
futures trading represents a huge market and as an investment 
tool encompasses financial instruments such as currency and 
bonds and a diversity of commodities such as rice and petroleum, 
it may be an effective tool for avoiding risk, but in the case 
of Japan where it was first introduced in the latter half of the 
1980's and the markets are immature, it is probably very 
important to understand how incompatible the basic mechanism of 
futures trading and Japanese systems are. 
  Moreover, as rice futures begin to trade on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, as people anticipate a rise in future rice 
prices, and futures prices continue to rise, we cannot disregard 
the relationship with the price of rice in Japan. Further, in 
Japan forward trading is called futures trading and currency 
futures tend to be envisioned, but the history of futures is 
short. 
  The foremost characteristic of futures trading involves the 
sale of the item purchased by the final settlement date and to 
earn the difference in price fluctuations, while that future 
which has been sold is repurchased by the final settlement date 
and to earn the difference in price fluctuations. 
  In the case of forward markets, it involves a contract to 
trade a specific item at a specified future date and does not 
involve a settlement of price differentials. However, futures 
trading involves the execution of an opposing transaction by a 
specific date and a settlement involving price fluctuations. 
Accordingly, even if the price should fall, if the contract 
anticipated such an event, the trader realizes a profit, but if 
the price rises contrary to anticipation, the trader must settle 
and suffer a loss. In other words, the system provides for a 
profit whether prices rise or fall and the trader profits if he 
anticipates correctly and loses if he anticipates incorrectly. 
  A mechanism benefiting all parties to a syndicate as long as 
stock prices rose served as the basic principle for 
Japanese-style cross-shareholding of stocks. However, it should 
be obvious that the nature of futures trading is completely 
incompatible with that principle. If one realizes that price 
rises do not necessarily represent a positive, we must admit 
that a major change must be made in Japanese-style systems which 
were premised on latent profits. 
  However, this writer is not saying that futures trading was 
responsible for the drop in stock prices. Drops in stock prices 
were the logical outcome of the introduction of financial 
deregulation. Even if we were to attempt an energetic control 
over futures trading, in today's environment where 
internationalization of financial markets has progressed, trades 
will be relocated to foreign markets and it is doubtful that 
price stability can be attained, while any attempt at enforcing 
controls would most likely result in financial friction. 
  Futures can be referred to as a source of profits based on 
the instability of spot prices. The reason why rice futures on 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are soaring is that magnified 
expectations are being placed on futures trading based on the 
theory that spot prices will continue to rise. That being the 
case, we cannot hold futures responsible for price fluctuations. 
<H5>  New Financial Systems and Policy </H5>
  Huge Japanese international balance of payments surpluses 
flowed into overseas areas in the form of real estate and 
securities investments. As a result, Japan emerged as the 
world's leading creditor nation. However, even such investments 
have lost tremendous value because of unfavorable foreign 
currency exchange rate changes. Additionally, overseas real 
estate investments have suffered price drops or vacancy rates 
have risen because of worsening market conditions and underlying 
debt instruments have converted into typical nonperforming debt. 
  Now if we turn our eyes to the domestic scene, we note that 
we are unable to stimulate a recovery in lagging manufacturing 
activity even if we lower interest rates and increase public 
works projects and contrarily it seems that the situation may 
deteriorate into a state of employment instability. Further, 
money which lacks a productive investment target rotates between 
postal savings and short-term securities and there are no signs 
that money can be used to stimulate production and assist in the 
recovery of the economy. A variety of proposals such as an 
income tax cut, infrastructure investments in the area of 
consumer requirements, and additional cuts in the official 
discount rate are being made, but it is uncertain whether such 
measures will have a decisive effect. 
  In the past, in times such as these when it appeared that 
all 
avenues of relief were blocked, capital investments in 
anticipation of export demand came into play but such an 
approach is no longer effective as long as trade friction with 
the United States is in the throes of intensifying. It is 
difficult to judge whether domestic market expansion measures 
will serve to reinvigorate the economy because there is the 
possibility that deregulation will destroy weak domestic 
industries, but perhaps stimulation for the economy can be 
obtained by directing efforts towards trade with Asia to include 
China in anticipation of significant growth in those areas. 
  However, if economic policies of the past have been rendered 
ineffective because of significant changes in the Japanese 
economic structure as discussed in this article, we must search 
for policies which are responsive to the new structure. If we 
were to address the issue in terms of the discussion contained 
in this article, we may find it effective to maintain interest 
rates at a low level to ensure a smooth flow of funds via the 
banks, but if corporate funds procurement from banks decrease, 
such measures will prove inadequate. I believe it is a case 
where we must formulate policies which envision a transition of 
financial systems from reliance on banks to the capital markets 
as a whole including the stock, bond and futures markets.

  [Text] Seoul, ROMPRES, 9/3/1994 -- Friendship and 
cooperation have been the traits of the bilateral relations 
between Romania and the Republic of Korea since the diplomatic 
relations were established, said Romanian President Ion Iliescu 
at his arrival on Wednesday, March 9, in Seoul where he started 
an official visit. 
  Romanian President Ion Iliescu reaffirmed Romania's decision 
to consolidate and deepen the cooperation relations with the 
Republic of Korea, underscoring the significance which he gave 
to the meeting with the Korean president, with other 
decision-makers of the Korean political and parliamentary life, 
stressing the interest in the dialogue with representatives of 
the Korean economic and business society. 
  The Romanian head of state expressed his confidence that the 
exchange of opinions with regard to the situation in the two 
countries as well as to the regional and international situation 
would be productive, leading to conclusions able to encourage a 
bilateral and multilateral cooperation as tight and profitable 
as possible. 
  The President of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-sam 
expressed 
his strong belief that the Romanian people would surpass all the 
difficulties, building the democracy and the market economy as 
grounds for the freedom and prosperity of the country. The 
Korean president noticed with satisfaction that the cooperation 
between the two countries had been developing, stressing that 
the presence in Seoul of the Romanian head of state would not 
only boost the friendship and collaboration relations but it 
would also have its merit in reducing the distance between the 
European East and the Asian Far-East.

  [Text] Seoul, ROMPRES, 9/3/1994 -- The first day of the 
state visit to Seoul of the head of the Romanian state was 
devoted mainly to the talks with the president of the host 
country Kim Yong-sam. This is the first political-diplomatic 
contact at the highest level after the establishment in March 
1990 of diplomatic relations, and it comes as a natural 
consequence of the positive course of the bilateral relations. 
  The Romanian authorities have defined the main purpose of 
the 
visit as being that of giving the political signal for the 
development of the bilateral relations on all planes, of giving 
green light to major initiatives in the economic and commercial 
spheres. Another aim is that of intensifying the dialogue 
between the government and parliamentarian factors, 
representatives of political parties, between cultural, 
technical, scientific fora, and ngo's. 
  Romania is interested in a closer cooperation with the 
Republic of Korea in a number of sectors like 
telecommunications, car manufacturing, shipbuilding, metallurgy, 
food industry. There are hopes for a growth of Korean capital 
investment in Romania through such important companies like 
Daewoo, Samsung, Gold Star, Hyundai. 
  Romania is interested to learn from the experience the 
Republic of Korea earned in its own process of economic reform. 
  During the talks, the two heads of state agreed to sign a 
joint declaration that sums up the key points of the 
political-diplomatic event marked by the state visit to Seoul of 
the president of Romania. The declaration shows that this 
summit meeting, held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere, 
enabled the two presidents to have a sincere and useful exchange 
of opinions about the international situation, including the 
situation in the north-east of Asia and the Korean peninsula, as 
well as that in the Balkans, and to examine the ways of 
extending the relations between the two countries. 
  While Presidents Ion Iliescu and Kim Yong-sam, accompanied 
by 
the members of their official delegations, proceeded to 
expressing their points of view on the relations between their 
countries and the present international evolutions, a number of 
parallel meetings between Romanian officials and their Korean 
counterparts were in progress. 
  This evening, an official dinner will be given at the 
presidential palace in honor of the president of Romania.

mutual relations and cooperation of the two counties the two 
counties and is noted that an agreement is reached on holding 
the negotiations on renewing the treaty in the near future.

perspectives for them. The ambassador notes that Germany is 
paying a great attention to Mongolia's efforts on transition to 
the new democratic system, has been rendering and will continue 
to render assistance to Mongolia in overcoming by the country 
economic crisis. 
  Central Mongolian newspapers are paying a great attention to 
the International Woman's Day 8 march, which was celebrated 
yesterday. 
  The newspaper of the Mongolian capital "ULAANBAATAR" in its 
main article notes that in all probability Mongolia will become 
soon the only country, where this holiday will continue to be

staff 
of the U.S. Senator J. Helms. She expresses bewilderment 
apropos of adoption by the State Great Hural of Mongolia of the 
law on relations of the state with church. In her view, the law 
contradicts provision of the country's constitution and 
discriminates Christianity.

<F P=106> [Speech by National Assembly Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket at the </F>
opening ceremony of the third ordinary session of the Third 
National Assembly in Vientiane on 9 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Today, the third ordinary session of our Third 
National Assembly is convened to discuss and endorse a number of 
important, urgent issues. The session is being held after the 
date stipulated in the National Assembly law, because there were 
certain urgent, significant tasks that we had to settle during 
the period that the session was expected to be convened. Our 
session is now being held in an atmosphere in which the 
international and regional situations have continued to develop 
in the manner which is both favorable and unfavorable to the 
implementation of the two strategic tasks and the restructuring 
line of our party and state. 
  As the situations have developed, various hostile powers 
have 
not abandoned their intentions of effecting change through 
peaceful means and interfering in the internal affairs of 
various countries with a view to turning the entire world into 
their orbit. The tension and conflicts between peoples of 
different nationalities, origins, and religions in certain 
countries and regions have continued. Various nations, 
particularly developing and underdeveloped ones, have made great 
efforts in struggling to safeguard political independence while 
developing their economies and societies to raise their standard 
of living. In Southeast Asia, the trend of peace, stability, 
and cooperation among various countries has become ever more 
evident, thus creating favorable conditions for the development 
of our country. 
  Our ordinary session on this occasion is also being held in 
a 
joyous atmosphere in which our entire party, army, and people 
have been striving and won initial satisfactory achievements in 
realizing the sixth and seventh resolutions of the fifth Central 
Committee, the socioeconomic development plan, and the state 
budget plan for 1993-94 as endorsed by the Third National 
Assembly in its second ordinary session. Our National Assembly 
has also promoted and expanded its role, which are thus 
beneficial to the implementation of the constitution and various 
laws. Members of the National Assembly in each constituency 
also have promoted and expanded their roles. They have visited 
the people of all strata in each region regularly to encourage 
them and to inspect, follow up, and boost implementation of the 
socioeconomic development plan, state budget, and various 
regulations and laws at the local level. 
  They have also given attention to the petitions, views, and 
problems presented by the people and brought them to the 
attention of local party and administrative committees for joint 
discussion and settlement. Through the National Assembly 
members, the people have come to clearly understand the roles 
and duties of the deputies who represent the people and have 
worked for their interests and rights to mastery. In each area 
the people have felt comfortable in earning their living and 
been confident in their future and our popular democratic system. 
  Along with these favorable conditions and achievements won 
by 
our people, we should frankly accept the fact that our nation 
and people still face many difficulties and complicated problems 
in carrying out socioeconomic development work and improving 
their living conditions. It is, therefore, required that we 
take appropriate measures to settle those difficulties and 
problems step by step. To meet the requirements of state and 
social management, the Third National Assembly has endorsed the 
Constitution and a number of laws. Following the enforcement of 
the Constitution and laws, the state and society have been 
managed more effectively. Steps have been taken to manage the 
state and society through the implementation of the laws. 
  Our country's socioeconomic foundation has developed and 
prospered. The requirements of national development have 
increased daily. Economic relations and cooperation with 
foreign countries have been also enhanced. It is, therefore, 
required that we reconsider, improve, and perfect certain laws 
which have been already enacted in order to make them conform to 
today's practical conditions. At the same time, it is necessary 
to continue to study and implement more laws to perfect our 
state and social management apparatuses. 
  Based on the said requirements, in this session, we will 
discuss and endorse the amendment of the labor law and the law 
on the promotion and management of foreign investments in the 
Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR]. The reason why we must 
urgently improve the two said laws is that the law on the 
promotion and management of foreign investments in the LPDR was 
put into effect before the enforcement of the constitution. As 
for the labor law, it is consisted of certain provisions which 
run counter to the constitution. It, therefore, needs to be 
readjusted so as to be in conformity with the constitution as 
well as the practical conditions on the socioeconomic 
development. The amendment of the aforesaid two laws is part of 
the amendment of various laws that will be done in the 
subsequent sessions. 
  After having the laws, the important point is organizing 
their implementation. Their implementation is considered to be 
a factor in determining the success and the efficiency of the 
enforced laws. In the past, we are of the view that law 
enforcement has also done its best in performing its duties. 
But, as the socioeconomic foundation has been increasingly 
expanded and the number of state and social management 
apparatuses has increased, the political quality of various law 
enforcement organizations must be raised in order to guarantee 
an ever more effective implementation of the laws. In addition, 
the tenure of these organizations as stipulated in the 
constitution has come to an end. In this session, it is, 
therefore, imperative for us to elect the chairman of the 
Supreme People's Court and the chief public prosecutor. We will 
also have to discuss the internal regulations of the National 
Assembly in order to make the organizational system of the 
National Assembly to become ever firmer and stronger so as to 
enable it to continue to efficiently implement its normal roles. 
We will also review experiences scored by our National Assembly 
in carrying out activities since the second ordinary session. 
  Distinguished assembly members, our ordinary session on this 
occasion is very significant, because contents of the issues 
that we will discuss and endorse in this session are related to 
the implementation of our party's restructuring line. They are 
also related to the raising the quality of this National 
Assembly. For this reason, it is required that all National 
Assembly members heighten their political responsibility. As 
representatives who have worked for the interests and rights to 
mastery of the people, we should comprehensively, profoundly, 
and thoroughly look at the problems and then contribute views to 
the session in a straightforward manner to successfully fulfill 
the objectives and expectations in making decisions on and 
endorsing the various significant issues that will be brought to 
the session for consideration. In this arousing and joyous 
atmosphere, as chairman of the session, I now would like to 
announce the third ordinary session of the Third National 
Assembly be officially opened. Thank you. [applause]

combat equipment to the U.S. Air Force bases in Osan and Kunsan. 
And an Okinawa-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane, 
flying above the area of the military demarcation line, 
committed photographing and electronic reconnaissance on the 
strategic in- depth areas of the North.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "The National Security Law </F>
Must Be Abolished"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported, on 3 March, U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher acknowledged that a U.S. 
official's recent remarks which demanded that the National 
Security Law [NSL] of South Korea be abolished were not an 
individual's private opinion, but the official position of the 
United States. The final acknowledgment made by the U.S. 
secretary of state on the United States' official position 
towards this law came out because the South Korean puppets were 
clamoring that U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
Hubbard's remarks calling for the abolition of the NSL in his 
speech at American University on 25 February were merely an 
individual's opinion. This proceeded from the present U.S. 
administration's acknowledgment that one of the reasons for the 
failure in progress in dialogue and negotiation between the 
North and the South of Korea lies in South Korea's NSL, and this 
is, albeit belated, very fortunate. 
  As everyone is well aware, the NSL of South Korea is a 
product and legacy of the military dictatorship and a most 
vicious, evil, fascist law blocking free dialogue and exchange 
between the North and the South by describing us as an antistate 
organization and as an enemy. Under the patronage of the United 
States, the successive military dictatorial regimes of South 
Korea used the NSL and various anticommunist fascist evil laws 
to brutally suppress the South Korean people's struggle for 
independence, democracy, reunification, incite North-South 
confrontation, and block the country's reunification. Following 
the fifth and sixth republics, the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime 
has also been mercilessly suppressing not only the South Korean 
people's struggle for independence, democracy, and 
reunification, but also young students and people who called for 
holding dialogue with us, thus blocking the road to dialogue. 
  Last year alone, the Kim Yong-sam fascist ring suppressed 
and 
blocked all patriotic struggles of the South Korean students and 
people for national reconciliation, unity, and reunification 
such as the North-South students' talks that were slated to be 
held in Panmunjom on 12 June, the fourth pannational rally in 
Seoul, the Pyongyang-Seoul university students' soccer games, 
and the North- South student bicycle race. The rascals went so 
far as to block our proposals to pay respects before the coffin 
of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan in Seoul and to hold a working-level contact 
in Panmunjom between North-South Chondoist representatives in 
order to discuss holding joint North-South celebrations for the 
centennial of the Kap-o peasants' war. 
  The truculent, fascist tyranny of the Kim Yong-sam ring 
which 
blocked fellow countrymen from expressing condolences and even 
trampled upon the patriotic and nation-loving will of 
North-South Chondoists using the NSL evokes strong opposition 
and rejection by the world's people. The indiscreet 
infringement upon human rights and the antireunification and 
antidialogue maneuvers perpetrated indiscreetly by the Kim 
Yong-sam ring under the mask of being a so- called civilian-led 
government have been so unscrupulous that even high-ranking U.S. 
officials were moved to call for the abolishment of the NSL. 
  One of the reasons why the Kim Yong-sam regime has been 
branded as a civilian-led fascist regime is because it retains 
the NSL. It is precisely because of the NSL that various 
channels of dialogue and exchange between the North and the 
South in the past have failed to make any progress and that 
numerous South Korean people who had advocated the country's 
reunification and who had visited the North were imprisoned. 
  This notwithstanding, the Kim Yong-sam ring has not only 
been 
brutally suppressing the South Korean people's just struggle for 
independence, democracy, and reunification with the NSL, but is 
also clamoring that it is impossible to abolish the NSL and the 
like today, at a time when the issue of abolishing the law has 
become an issue. The Kim Yong-sam ring's opposition to the 
abolition of the NSL proceeds from its wicked intention to 
suppress the South Korean people's just struggle with the law 
and to block the country's peace and its peaceful reunification. 
It also more clearly reveals that the rascals' clamor about a 
civilian-led government and the like is an out-and-out lie and 
that the rascals are fascist tyrants and national traitors who 
are dashing toward fascism, division, and confrontation. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to maintain the dirty 
remainder of its life on a road of fascism and confrontation. 
This, however, is a gross miscalculation. The road of fascist 
suppression and confrontation will further incite the popular 
masses' resistance and will only expedite the Kim Yong-sam 
ring's ruin. The Kim Yong-sam ring should look straight at the 
trend of the times and abolish, without delay, the NSL, an 
antireunification and fascist evil law.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Traitor Kim Yong-sam Is Unpardonable </F>
Antireunification Element"] 
  [Text] Today the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam gravely 
challenged the ardent desire and aspirations of all fellow 
countrymen for national reunification and for the great unity of 
the whole country, thus advancing along the road of North-South 
confrontation. For a little over a year since he assumed power 
as the president, the traitor Kim Yong-sam has persistently 
adhered to antireunification maneuvers, thus showing his ugly 
shape as a matchless national traitor and a most vicious 
separatist. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam was exposed to have constantly waged 
anti-Republic confrontation commotions and provocative northward 
nuclear war exercises together with outside forces ever since he 
came into office. Thus, he has aggravated North-South 
relations. Besides, he blocked [chadan] all dialogue and 
exchanges between the North and the South and laid more grave 
obstacles on the road of reunification. In fact, this is an 
exorbitant unpardonable crime even greater than all of the 
separatist maneuvers committed by former South Korean dictators 
throughout the period of their political power. 
  Just as the South Korean people have branded, the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet regime is the most vicious antireunification 
separatist regime of all the successive regimes in South Korea. 
It is the treacherous enemy of North-South dialogue and 
peaceful reunification. This is proven by the fact that the 
rascals have totally blocked North-South dialogue which was held 
even during the previous periods of military dictatorship. 
  Last year, we put forward the 10-point program of great 
unity 
of the whole country for national reunification, out of a desire 
to seek national reconciliation and unity and to expedite 
reunification in the nineties. We also put forward before the 
South Korean authorities, the issue on exchanging special envoys 
of top-level authorities between the two sides in order to 
discuss and solve pending problems, including the nuclear issue. 
  People from all walks of life in South Korea said that only 
if the people follow the 10-point program, will the peaceful 
reunification which 70 million fellow countrymen ardently aspire 
after, be achieved. They expressed a firm determination to rise 
more vigorously in the reunification movement. 
  However, traitor Kim Yong-sam, even after personally 
receiving our 10-point program for great unity of the whole 
country, rejected the magnanimous proposal of fellow countrymen 
for reconciliation and unity, and advanced the road toward 
confrontation and division against fellow countrymen. The Kim 
Yong-sam group totally froze North-South high-level talks and 
obstructed the exchange of special envoys between the two sides. 
Moreover, it confiscated letters we sent to South Korean 
authorities, representatives of political parties and public 
organizations, and figures from all walks of life in order to 
appeal for achieving reunification in the nineties with the 
united strength of the nation. By not even delivering the 
letters, the Kim Yong-sam group acted rashly. 
  In a news conference marking the 100th day of his 
inauguration, the puppet traitor said that he cannot shake hands 
with a partner who has nuclear weapons, and in talks between 
heads of ruling and opposition parties, he raved that unless the 
nuclear problem is resolved, he cannot hold a summit. During 
the early stages of his power, the puppet traitor also made 
remarks on discussing the reunification issue, and improving 
relations with the North from the standpoint of being of one 
people, as though he were going to bring about a change of 
policy on North-South relations. However, all of his remarks 
were merely cunning, deceitful tactics designed to mislead 
public opinion at home and abroad. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group viciously blocked not only dialogue 
between the authorities in the North and the South but also 
multilateral contacts between the North and the South, as well 
as reunification dialogue between peoples from all walks of life. 
  Claiming that regardless of form, North-South contacts 
unapproved by the administration, cannot be tolerated, the 
puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam mercilessly oppressed youth, 
students and people from all walks of life who aspired to 
contact and hold dialogue with the North for reunification 
through collaboration with communists and with the North. 
  As a result, last year's 12 June Panmunjom talks between 
youth and students from the North and the South, the fourth 
Seoul congress of the pannational meeting for national 
reunification, a soccer game between students from Pyongyang and 
Seoul, a bicycle race by students of the North and the South, 
and all other just advances of exchanges with South Korean 
youth, students, and people for national reconciliation, unity, 
and reunification, were suppressed and blocked. The puppet 
traitors blocked us from conveying our condolences for the late 
Rev. Mun Ik-hwan in Seoul, and our plan to hold a working-level 
contact between Chondoist delegations from the North and the 
South at Panmunjom in order to jointly commemorate the 100th 
anniversary of the Kabo farmers' war. They blocked the 
condolence call by fellow countrymen and infringed upon the 
patriotic intention of the Chondoists of the North and the 
South. This is an act that can be committed only by such 
matchlessly wicked traitors and the most atrocious fascist 
tyrants as that of the Kim Yong-sam clique. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam's antireunification color was 
eloquently 
illustrated in his theory on the uselessness of reunification 
which claimed that unless free democracy and market economy are 
guaranteed, reunification is worse than division. His 
antireunification nature was also clearly shown in his so-called 
three-stage reunification plan which assumes reunification of 
the system [chedo tongil], which may evoke confrontation and war 
between fellow countrymen, as a precondition for national 
reunification. 
  Many South Korean people unanimously criticized traitor Kim 
Yong-sam's three-stage reunification plan as keeping intact the 
main point of the Korean people's commonwealth national 
reunification plan. In his New Year address and in the New Year 
press conference early this year, rascal Kim Yong-sam made no 
mention of reunification, and merely made provocative remarks 
slandering fellow countrymen. This suggests that traitor Kim 
Yong-sam will continually aggravate North-South relations this 
year, too, and will deny reunification. This also shows once 
again traitor Kim Yong-sam's true color as an antireunification 
element. 
  All successive puppets in South Korea repeatedly committed 
maneuvers for national division. However, no group was as 
wicked and cunning as separatist maniacs as the Kim Yong-sam 
clique. 
  Today, when all fellow countrymen unanimously rise as one in 
the patriotic reunification movement in order to make 1995 the 
first year for national reunification, the Kim Yong-sam group 
wields a bayonet against the people calling for national 
reconciliation and unity and totally froze North-South dialogue 
which existed even in times of military dictatorship. The 
crimes of the Kim Yong-sam group can never be pardoned. Neither 
North-South dialogue nor peaceful reunification of the nation 
can be achieved as long as the Kim Yong-sam clique remains 
intact. 
  The Kim Yong-sam antireunification regime must immediately 
be 
overthrown so as to achieve independent and peaceful 
reunification of the nation, which all fellow countrymen aspire 
after. It is natural for the South Korean people to rise in the 
antigovernment struggle by shouting slogans, "Let us give a hard 
blow to the Kim Yong-sam separatist regime!" and "Let us cut the 
neck of the Kim Yong-sam clique, the enemy of reunification!" 
  The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, the enemy of dialogue and 
reunification, cannot avoid a hard blow by the nation.

-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- With no amount of 
repression can the Kim Yong-sam group block the South Korean 
workers' struggle for vital rights including wage hike, stresses 
NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  Bus union members in six cities under the Federation of Auto 
Workers Unions of South Korea have courageously risen up in 
struggle in the current spring season of wage negotiation. 
Their demand for vital rights including wage hike is a devand 
for the payment for their work and a demand for the rights and 
conditions for a life worthy of human beings. It is the minimum 
demand they have raised on the last line of retreat. Refusing 
to meet this demand is tantamount to forcing the workers to die. 
  Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is threatening 
a "strong countermeasure," branding the workers' struggle for 
vital rights as "collective selfishness." 
  The harsher the fascist clique's suppression, the closer the 
ranks of the South Korean workers and the fiercer their fight 
for the vital rights and democracy.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- Feelings of deep 
reverence for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are growing 
among South Korean puppet Army soldiers, the Seoul-based radio 
Voice of National Salvation (VNS) reported. 
  A Captain Kim of the 21st Division of the puppet Army, 
chatting with his pals over the situation recently, said the 
People's Army of the North under the command of General Kim 
Chong-il, the most famous general in the world, is an unrivalled 
strong Army. 
  He said: 
  "General Kim Chong-il, possessed of outstanding military 
strategy as his born gift, has built the People's Army into a 
well-disciplined, unrivalled strong Army. Unity between 
officers and men, Army-civilian unity, the arming of all the 
people and the fortification of the whole country are true looks 
of the mighty North." 
  Listening to him, a second lieutenant surnamed Choe said: 
  "The way of averting the danger of war, loving peace and 
achieving reunification, the ardent aspiration of the nation, is 
to hold in high esteem and uphold General Kim Chong-il, the most 
famous general in the world produced by our nation, as 
commander-in-chief of the national Army. Herein lies the way of 
warding off national disaster, the way for us to live, for the 
nation to live and the way of achieving reunification."

<F P=106> ["`South Korea's Nuclear Arms Development Must Be Checked'" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- The world public is 
demanding a stop to the nuclear arms development by the South 
Korean authorities. 
  The Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship Association in 
a 
statement February 24 noted that the South Korean authorities 
under the aegis of the United States worked out a policy of 
developing nuclear weapons and introduced heavy water reactors 
from the 1970s and now have stockpiled plutonium enough to make 
hundreds of nuclear bombs and are using them in developing 
nuclear weapons. 
  The statement stressed that the South Korean authorities 
must 
immediately renounce the policy of nuclear arms development that 
gravely jeopardizes the Korean nation's right to existence and 
peace and security in Northeast Asia, and must remove the 
already stockpiled plutonium and remove the heavy water reactors 
or replace them aith light water reactors. 
  The Indian paper TAMAKA DARBAR said it is no secret that 
South Korea now is possessed of all basic indices of nuclear 
armament such as the technology of nuclear development, 
operation of reactors, extraction of nuclear materials, 
manufacture of nuclear bombs, nuclear testing, possession of 
means of nuclear delivery and the established system of war by 
nuclear weapons. 
  The Nepalese paper HINDU DAINIK wrote that nuclear threat on 
the Korean peninsula actually comes from South Korea, saying the 
world recognizes North Korea's sincere efforts for the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  Jose Fanequico, executive secretary of the Mozambican 
Committee for Friendship With the People of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, in a statement urged that the United 
States and the International Atomic Energy Agency should discard 
their double- standard policy and check South Korea's nuclear 
arms development that threatens peace and security in Asia.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- Gabonese President El 
Hadj Omar Bongo donated a stone of superior quality to the Tower 
of the Chuche Idea in Pyongyang. 
  He decided to present a light grey colour rare marble, which 
was polished like mirror and engraved with his name, to 
President Kim Il-song as a gift, and let the Gabonese ambassador 
to the DPRK convey it. 
  The director of Naomi Trading Company in Hong Kong surveyed 
famous stone production centres to pick a rare natural stone and 
processed and engraved it with the letters reading "Kim Il-song, 
Kim Chong-il, Long Live the Great Chuche Idea!" and sent it to 
the Tower of the Chuche Idea. 
  More than 600 stones of good quality have been presented to 
the tower by party, state and government leaders, political 
parties, public organizations and groups for the study of the 
chuche idea of over 90 countries, international organizations 
and public figures since the construction of the tower (1982).

suffered a setback in some countries. 
  They stressed that a large number of works authored by 
Comrade Kim Chong-il serve the world's revolutionary people as a 
weapon of struggle, as a priceless asset, and resolved to deeply 
study his classical works.

<F P=106> ["Maintaining Independence, Fundamental Principle in Foreign </F>
Relations" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- To maintain 
independence in foreign relations is a fundamental principle 
which must be consistently maintained, says NODONG SINMUN in an 
article today. 
  The author of the article notes: 
  Keeping independence in foreign relations means to establish 
and develop relations with other countries on the basis of 
complete equality and mutual respect for sovereignty, to fully 
exercise sovereignty in external relations and to resolve all 
the questions by one's own judgement and decision in the 
interests of the revolution in one's country. 
  Adhering to independence in foreign relations is a 
fundamental principle that must be maintained consistently, 
first of all, because independence is the life and soul of a 
country and a nation. Independence is the first criterion of an 
independent and sovereign state. If a country acts under the 
baton of others, losing independence, it cannot be called an 
independent and sovereign state, though it has power. If 
independence is ignored in foreign relations, unequal relations 
of domination and subjugation appear and the sovereignty of the 
country and the nation is encroached upon and violated. 
  Keeping independence in foreign relations is a fundamental 
principle that must be consistently maintained next because only 
when independence is maintained can a successful contribution be 
made to the cause of global independence, the common cause of 
mankind. An independent world is one free from domination and 
subjugation, interference and pressure, a world where all the 
countries and nations fully exercise the sovereignty as masters 
of their destiny. If the people of each country are to 
contribute to the realization of global independence as a member 
of the international community, they must always adhere to 
independence in foreign relations. Only then there will be in 
the world neither commanding and submitting countries nor ruling 
and ruled nations, and full equality and freedom of the 
countries and nations will be ensured. 
  The main target of the struggle for making the world 
independent is the imperialists and other dominationist forces. 
If all the countries and nations firmly maintain independence, 
totally reject all forms of interference of outside forces and 
do not dance to other's tune nor blindly follow others, 
dominationism will become impotent and strong-arm action and the 
baton will not work.

<F P=106> ["Highly Important Work That Brought Turn in Development of </F>
Revolution" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
dedicates a signed article to the tenth anniversary of the 
publication of "On Building Up the Revolutionary Ranks and 
Further Accelerating Socialist Construction," a famous work of 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, on March 10, 1984. 
  For the validity and truthfulness of the idea and theory 
contained in it, the work has displayed a great vitality through 
its successful application in the practice of our revolution 
over the past ten years, the article says, and goes on: 
  The significance and vitality of the work lie, above all, in 
that it has helped render the solid political and ideological 
unity of our party and revolutionary ranks more unbreakable, 
their single-hearted unity around the illustrious leader. 
  Expounded in the work are all the matters that should be the 
guiding principle in strengthening the party and revolutionary 
ranks, including the task of the party organisations to continue 
with the vigorous work for strengthening the unity and cohesion 
of the party. 
  Now the Korean people are closely united around the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in ideology and purpose, in morality 
and sense of obligation, with absolute worship for the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. It is the noble traits of the 
Korean people to entrust their destiny entirely to the party and 
the leader, breathing and talking as the party does and always 
keeping step with it. 
  They are convinced that when they are guided by the dear 
leader they have nothing to be afraid of and they will certainly 
win. This is the unshakable faith and will cherished deep in 
their hearts in following the illustrious leader. 
  The significance and vitality of the work also lie in that 
it 
has helped effect a new upsurge in socialist economic 
construction. 
  In the work the dear leader stressed that a great upswing 
should be effected in socialist construction and set forth 
detailed tasks and ways of dynamically accelerating socialist 
economic construction. 
  Under his wise guidance socialist construction is making a 
confident progress along a straight road of victory and economic 
construction is rising to a new high tide in Korea today. 
  The work has displayed a great vitality in establishing the 
habit of setting store by the military affair in the whole 
society, displaying the beautiful traits of Army-people unity 
and carrying on the three-revolution team movement. 
  It was a proud fruition of our party's great idea of 
Army-people unity that our People's Army and people rose up as 
one man last year in hearty response to the order of our Supreme 
Commander General Kim Chong-il and decisively frustrated the 
aggressive moves of the enemies and firmly defended our-style 
socialism.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- Today is the 
international women's day. 
  The Korean women who had been out of society in the past are 
now leading a worthwhile life, sharing responsibility with men 
for the country. 
  Thanks to the proclamation of the law on sex equality in 
1946, the Korean women have been exercising rights on an equal 
footing with men in the realms of politics, the economy and 
culture. 
  They take an active part in the affairs of the state with 
the 
rights to vote and to be elected. 
  The women account for 20.1 percent of the total number of 
the 
deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly. 
  Many women are active in important posts of the party, the 
state, administrative and economic bodies, working people's 
organisations and other units. 
  The role of the women is great in education, culture, public 
health, commerce, textiles, production of daily necessities and 
foodstuff. 
  Many "Kim Il-song Order" and "Kim Il-song Prize" winners 
have 
been produced among them for their devoted services to the 
country and the people. 
  There are a large number of heroines of the Republic, labor 
heroines, people's teacher, people's scientist, people's actress 
and other honorary title winners and the state order bearers. 
  The state provides the women with all conditions so that 
they 
may work without any inconvenience. 
  As there are nurseries and kindergardens in all places where 
women work, they devote themselves to work. 
  The well-furnished modern foodstuff factories, garment 
factories, household goods factories and public service 
facilities built in different parts of the country relieve them 
of the heavy burden of domestic affairs. 
  The women workers with several children work six hours a 
day, 
but they are paid for 8-hour work a day. 
  And they enjoy such benefits as 150-day maternity paid leave 
as well as a regular paid leave. 
  It is regarded as an ordinary thing in Korea that a special 
plane flies to carry a woman in childbed and a medical team does 
its best for her.

<F P=106> ["Modern Village Thriving Under Tender Care" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- Full-fledged 
preparations for farming are under way in Unjong-ri following 
the 30th anniversary of the publication of the socialist rural 
theses (February 25, 1964). The repair and readjustment of farm 
machines has been completed and the reservoirs are filled with 
water. Substantial preparations for sowing have been made, and 
carrying composts to paddy and non-paddy fields and carpeting 
fields with humus soil have entered the finishing stage. 
  Unjong-ri is 30 kilometres away from the seat of Pongsan 
County, North Hwanghae Province, in the central west of Korea. 
The village surrounded with high and low mountains looks like a 
picture. It has turned into a modern socialist village good to 
live and work in under the deep care of the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il. 
  He visited it (then Tanghyon-ri, Sohung County) in winter 30 
odd years ago and told by farmers there that they had eked out a 
hand-to-mouth existence with mountain-side tilling and 
charcoal-making before the liberation of the country, he 
unfolded a bright prospect for rural construction. He said the 
farmers in the mountain areas must turn the mountains to 
advantage, if they were to be well off and that they must 
create orchards on sunny hillside, raise silkworms, and actively 
tap mountain resources to improve their living standard. Saying 
they should rezone small plots into paddy fields and build many 
modern houses, he indicated a concrete orientation and ways. 
  This place has changed beyond recognition since then. 
Two-and three-storied modern houses for hundreds of families, a 
nursery, a kindergarten, schools, a hospital and public welfare 
facilities are standing in rows along the scenic Tanghyon River. 
Thirty five hectares of paddy fields fit for tillage by 
machines have taken shape in the place where not a plot of paddy 
field could be seen before liberation. And nearly 200 hectares 
of orchards and more than 700 hectares of forests of economic 
value have been created. Tractors, rice-transplanting machines, 
rice plucking machines and other farm machines have relieved the 
agricultural working people from toil. 
  Agricultural production has grown every year, the output of 
grain jumping 3.6 times, meat 4.6 times, fruits 7.6 times and 
vegetables 21 times as against 30 years ago. 
  Tanghyon-ri was renamed Unjong (benevolence)-ri in October 
1981 to hand down through generations the deep loving care shown 
by the dear leader for the farmers there. 
  Such change as in Unjong-ri can be seen everywhere in Korea.

  [Excerpt] Fort del Pilar, Baguio City -- Defense Secretary 
Renato de Villa urged Saturday military rebels to desist from 
making unnecessary propaganda which could create an atmosphere 
inimical to their ongoing peace talks with the government. 
  He made the statement in response to a call of the Young 
Officers Union (YOU) to the new graduates of the Philippine 
Military Academy (PMA) to pursue their goals of initiating 
reforms within the military establishment. 
  De Villa was the guest of honor at the parade and review and 
awarding ceremonies of PMA's Bantay Lakas [Watch Force] class. 
The graduation ceremonies will be held Sunday with President 
Ramos as guest. 
  The 224 graduating cadets include De Villa's son Patrick. 
  De Villa said he has brought to the attention of the 
government negotiating panel headed by Professor Alfredo Tadiar 
recent propaganda tactics of the Nationalist Revolutionary 
Alliance [as published] and YOU which he said sow confusion in 
the peace process. 
  He said he has also asked the government panel to ascertain 
if statements purportedly released by the group of former Lt. 
Col. Gregorio Honasan were genuine and authentic. [passage

  [Text] An informed source in the Export Promotion 
Department told PRACHACHAT THURAKIT that the Thai commercial 
center in Los Angeles recently sent the department its report on 
Thai-U.S. trade issues involving intellectual property and 
worker rights. The report states that Thai efforts to protect 
U.S. intellectual property have gained a positive support from 
Richard Gephardt, Democratic congressman from Missouri, who is 
considered highly influential with the Clinton administration. 
  The report from Los Angeles also gave furthur details on the 
situation following an accusation from the U.S. private sector 
on Thai violation of U.S. intellectual property rights applying 
to video and musical recordings, which caused about $120 million 
in damages for the U.S. entertainment industry, and on the Thai 
Government prohibiting state enterprise organizations to set up 
their labor unions. The Thai practices prompted the United 
States to announce that it will review all GSP privileges it had 
previously granted to the country. 
  In this regard, Thailand has tried continually to solve the 
problems concerning the protection of intellectual property. 
These include issuing various rules and regulations, suppressing 
producers of illegal tapes and videos, and implementing 
international guidelines for the protection of intellectual 
property. 
  Apart from these efforts, the Thai Government has also 
proposed a draft law on the establishment an intellectual 
property and international trade court to show its improvement 
in intellectual property protection. This court will handle 
both civil and criminal cases with judicial procedures to be 
carried out within six months. "These practices have prompted 
the United States to respond positively to the outcome of the 
Thai actions. An indication is that even Richard Gephardt, a 
leading figure in the majority party of the U.S. House of 
Representatives, has highly praised the Thai actions following 
his meeting with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in January. 
However, the United States will continue to watch the actions 
of the Thai side closely because there still are several points 
that the Thai Government will have to correct," concluded the 
informed source.

<F P=106> [Article: "The Military Readjusts To Deal With Indochina"] </F>
  [Text] The opening of the door to welcome the free 
economy in Indochina has excited businessmen and investors who 
want to use the northeast as an export base for important 
markets of the region. In the past three months prior to the 
inauguration of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge the government 
and the private sector have worked to turn the border into a 
special economic area and set up industrial estates in several 
border provinces. 
  Regarding security, there has been rapid reorganization as 
well as readjustments to border operations to suit the 
development trends in the northeast. The cabinet has approved 
the National Security Council proposal to set up the Border 
Policy Implementation Center under the directorship of the 
supreme commander. Instructions have also been given to the 
Army, the Army Regions, including the Second Army Region which 
oversees 19 northeastern provinces. 
  The Second Army Region was instructed on 3 March to 
establish 
a management center for the border provinces under its 
jurisdiction. The center will operate within the framework of 
peaceful resolution of border disputes and the avoidance of 
violence, relying first on the local mechanism. It will 
accelerate the settlement of border disputes, while the 
relations with the neighboring countries are good and will 
protect interests of the local people. 
  According to Lieutenant General Anuphap Songsunthon, 
commander of the Second Army Region, his command has issued 
instructions for the establishment of the Thai-Lao Border 
Command Centers and the Thai-Cambodian Border Command Centers. 
The governors of the border provinces will head the centers. 
  The Thai-Cambodian Border Command Centers will be situated 
in 
four provinces -- Ubon Ratchathani, Sisaket, Surin, and Buriram. 
Their main objectives are to serve the Thai private sector in 
trade and investment in Cambodia and protect their interest. 
They will not support any Cambodian faction, tolerate the 
existence of foreign forces in Thai territory, or the violation 
of Thai sovereignty. They will drastically suppress activities 
of foreign armed bandits by setting up check points and 
operating rapid deployment units. It will cooperate with other 
units to suppress the smuggling of contraband, arms, and 
vehicles. 
  The Thai-Lao Border Command Centers will be set up in Ubon 
Ratchathani, Loei, Nong Khai, Mukdahan, and Amnat Charoen 
provinces to support legitimate border activities and 
drastically suppress illegal trading. They will promote 
relations between local elements and cooperation to peacefully 
solve border problems. 
  Anuphap stressed that after the friendship bridge opens the 
objectives of the policy will remain the same but will emphasize 
the strengthening of ties at the local level as well as 
promoting the use of the bridge for contacts between Thailand 
and Laos. 
  The establishment of the centers at various levels by the 
security establishment amounts to the military's support of the 
government's policy and the policy's expansion to broaden 
contacts between Thailand and Laos and Cambodia to benefit trade 
and investment, while maintaining national security and avoiding 
disputes by the use of local mechanism. 
  The establishment of the command center in each province 
amounts to adjustment of the province's conduct toward the 
neighboring country. The operational staff of the Second Army 
Region is drafting the details for the center operations for the 
regional commander to sign into formal centers quickly. 
  Regarding the protection of important economic areas, 
Anuphap 
asserts that there is no security problem in the Second Army 
Region because the main forces of the army are already located 
there. There is no need for new deployment of weapons for the 
region. Investors can be confident in the Second Army Region. 
  The above preparations by the security establishment to open 
the northeastern region to Indochina are an important step in 
facilitating investors. They amount to a new chapter in 
cooperation by the Thai military from its previous posture of 
aggressive solution of border problems. This adjustment has 
given investors greater confidence.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry's Information Department has 
reported on assistance under the triangle program for the 
reconstruction of Cambodia. According to it, Thailand has 
proposed to major donors cooperation under the triangle program 
of assistance for Indochina -- with Thailand serving as the 
center, or providing facilities and personnel for projects being 
carried out. 
  Starting in 1994, Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, 
and Indonesia begin giving assistance to Cambodia under the 
triangle program by assisting Cambodian refugees who have 
returned home for resettlement in Kompong Speu and Takeo 
Provinces. They will be given guidance in rice cultivation, 
basic farming, fishing, fresh water fish farming, vocational 
training, training in sewing and handicraft, and primary health 
care. Japan will provide financial support while Thailand and 
other ASEAN countries will provide technical assistance. 
  Under the program, which began on 1 March, 10 experts from 
Thailand's Education, Agriculture and Cooperatives and Public 
Health Ministries will spend a year working in Cambodia. One 
group of four officials will be dispatched first, the second 
will arrive in Cambodia on 4 April. Their tenure may be 
extended later. There will also be an adjustment in the format 
and method of assistance in keeping with the level of 
development which Cambodia achieves.

  [Text] Colonel Prasit Mongkhontham, deputy chief of staff 
of the Third Army Region, described the situation along the Lao 
and Burmese borders at the Phithak Thai Meeting Hall in Somdet 
Phra Ekathotsarot Camp, Phitsanulok Province at 1000 on 9 March. 
He said the forces of the Kachin minority group have signed a 
cooperation agreement with the Burmese Government. Two hundred 
armed followers of the National United Front under the 
leadership of Sanda and the Communist Party of Burma under its 
leader surrendered to Major Cho Tong, deputy commander of 
Battalion 4789, at its base in Ban Mae Chae, opposite Thailand's 
Tambon Mae La Noi, Mae Hong Son Province in order to negotiate a 
cease-fire. The Burmese soldiers did not confiscate the United 
Front members' weapons. 
  According to Prasit, about 150 members of a Burmese 
engineering battalion have been repairing the road between 
Myawadi and Ban Mae Kasa, opposite Thailand's Phop Phra 
District, Tak Province. They plan to repair the road to reach 
the Phra Chedi Sam Ong [Three Pagodas' Pass] border crossing in 
order to facilitate the conservation of forests in southern 
Burma and the control of minority groups in the area. This 
development could affect Thailand's security, particularly Thai 
villagers near the border. 
  On the Lao border situation, Prasit said the Lao Government 
has stepped up its suppression of antigovernment elements along 
the Thai border. Forces in Ban Yuap -- opposite Thailand's 
Chiang Kham District, Phayao Province -- have been augmented to 
suppress anti- Lao elements under the leadership of Generals 
Vang Pao and Thonglit, who have been active in the Mae Charim 
District and Song Khwae Subdistrict, Nan, and in Chiang Kham 
District, Phayao. It is necessary for the Third Army Region to 
force all anti-Lao elements to cease their activities as the 8 
April opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge approaches. 
  Prasit said Generals Vang Pao and Thonglit are the targets 
of 
the current suppression campaign. This will likely result in 
more Lao people fleeing to Thailand. In that case, Thailand 
will have to force them back.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A big setback for Burma's pro-democracy </F>
movement"] 
  [Text] Burma's military leaders, considered pariahs 
throughout most of the world, have however found themselves as 
welcome guests at this year's meeting of Asean foreign ministers 
in late July. Exactly what kind of guests they will be has yet 
to be determined. The junta's representatives could be arriving 
as special friends of Thailand or as guests of the regional 
grouping as a whole. 
  The invitation, which has been agreed to in principle by 
senior Asean officials meeting in Bangkok, is to be made despite 
moves by the United Nations to censure Rangoon for its brutal 
rule and continued detention of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. 
  The United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva was 
recently told that a system of repression is still in place in 
Burma which violates the fundamental rights of the Burmese 
people. Nonviolent critics of the Rangoon junta are continually 
being arrested and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment and a 
climate of fear prevails in the country. 
  Human rights are the same everywhere and their protection is 
the responsibility of the international community. Ideologies, 
national boundaries and local legal codes should not be 
obstacles to speaking out on behalf of others. Sadly, Asean 
seems to have overlooked this fact. As the saying goes, nothing 
should be allowed in the way when there's a baht to be made. 
  Rationalizing the decision, Foreign Ministry spokesman Suwit 
Simasakun said on Tuesday that "the isolation of Burma, as 
suggested by the Western countries, won't contribute to the 
development of this region". 
  The term "development" as espoused by the Foreign Ministry 
has little to do with moral principles and obviously much to do 
with economics. The current trend of thought among Asean 
leaders is that individual countries have the right to tackle 
human rights issues in their own way and that development has a 
priority over civil and political rights. 
  Since crushing pro-democracy protests in 1988 and securing 
its position in power, the reviled State Law and Order 
Restoration Council (Slorc) has embarked on a programme to 
revamp the economy, motivated by little more than 
self-preservation. Recent visitors to Rangoon have said that 
Slorc appears to be "succeeding" in breathing life into the long 
moribund economy, but Burmese have testified that their lives 
seem to be getting tougher with inflation running out of control. 
  The military junta itself has said that only when economic 
rights have been looked after will they (if ever) think about 
providing "political luxuries" such as a democratic government. 
Clearly, Slorc is rationalizing its human rights abuses now 
with the argument that it's all in the interests of economic 
progress, and that the Burmese people would rather have a full 
belly than a vote. But it has been indicated clearly that even 
if the Burmese people are allowed to vote -- as in 1990 -- their 
verdict will be disregarded if the security of the regime is not 
enhanced in the country. 
  Sadly, the West's push for trade sanctions has failed 
because 
Burma has forged closer ties with its giant northern neighbour 
China. Trade between the two countries, despite traditional 
suspicions, is flourishing and China is now Burma's biggest 
trading partner. 
  For Asean, rather disgustingly, nothing matters more than 
profits and because of this they have obviously decided they can 
no longer wait to bring Burma into their circle. With China 
willing to run a trade deficit with Burma in return for the 
development of a strategic "friendship", this would seem to be a 
perfect justification. 
  But double standards prevail within the regional grouping, 
especially when it comes to Malaysia and Indonesia. Both Kuala 
Lumpur and Jakarta, which denounced the West for not doing 
enough to protect Muslims in Bosnia, seem to have forgotten 
their objections over Slorc's treatment of the Rohingya Muslim 
minority. Of the 288,000 Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh in 
early 1992, 230,000 remain in camps along the border in 
Bangladesh because they fear military persecution. 
  Much to the disappointment of this paper, it seems Asean is 
unwilling to reverse its decision with regard to Burma's 
invitation to be in Bangkok in July. By this, the regional 
grouping has hammered another nail into the coffin of the 
pro-democracy movement in Burma. The generals in Burma marched 
into power over the corpses of young pro-democracy protesters, 
yet they are embraced with open arms by Asean. Frankly, such 
things happen only in nightmares. In this region, however, 
nightmares become realities when there's money to be made -- 
regardless of whether despots respect their own people.

  [Text] Government agencies are reportedly split in their 
opinions as to who was responsible for Tuesday's railway bomb 
attack in Songkhla. Well-informed Interior Ministry sources 
disclosed that Fourth Army Region Commander Lt-Gen Kitti 
Rattanachaya has told the Interior Ministry that "a third party" 
was responsible for the attack. However, the police and the 
southern authority have submitted preliminary reports to the 
Interior Ministry blaming southern separatist bandits. 
  The sources said Lt-Gen Kitti in his report to the Interior 
Ministry said the bomb attack was not the work of members of 
Pattani United Liberation Organisation [PULO] but that of a 
"third hand" who wanted to create more problems for the 
Government. However, Southern Border Provinces Administration 
Centre Director Wisut Singkhachonworakun and the police said 
PULO separatists were behind the attack. Mr Wisut said it has 
yet to be established which faction of the group was responsible 
for the attack on the railway track in Chana District of 
Songkhla Province. 
  Local officials have been instructed to gather information 
to 
find out if this faction is a new or old group of the PULO, he 
said. Mr Wisut said no promises had been made to the separatist 
bandits as suggested by some news reports. It was reported that 
the group claimed in a letter left at the scene of the attack 
that the Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre had 
promised the bandits they would speed up the investigation into 
the torching of schools in the South last year. He said the 
centre would try to prevent a similar recurrence but admitted 
that the task would be difficult. 
  Police Department deputy chief Phong-amat Amattayakun said 
it 
was believed that the separatists might have received support 
from overseas. Pol Gen [Police General] Phong-amat said local 
politicians should be able to help play a role in solving the 
problem of subversive activities in the South as they were 
familiar with local problems. "The incident (the bomb attack) is 
a political problem. The local politicians should know it well 
and should help solve it," Pol Gen Phongamat said. 
  Meanwhile, deputy Police Department chief for crime 
suppression Phot Bunyachinda yesterday ordered security to be 
beefed up at public buildings as well as bus and train terminals 
after Tuesday's attack. In his order to the regional police 
headquarters in the South, policemen are to set up highway 
checkpoints and conduct random searches of vehicles of 
suspicious looking people around the clock to prevent another 
attack. 
  Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday ruled 
out speculation that the bomb attack at Songkhla was designed to 
discredit him. Gen Chawalit said the police have submitted a 
preliminary report but he would have to wait for a detailed 
investigation and analysis to determine if the attack was really 
conducted by the PULO, as stated in the letter placed at the 
blast site. 
  Gen Chawalit said it was probably the work of certain 
movements that have been operating for 40-50 years already, 
which have begun using weapons. The New Aspiration Party leader 
said the public should understand that such movements are not 
ordinary criminal cases, therefore, it is not possible for 
officials to take immediate action against the culprits. Gen 
Chawalit said it was difficult to prevent such incidents from 
happening because of the continuous flow of war weapons and 
aliens across the border. He said the police were doing well in 
the fight against the sale and smuggling of war weapons, but the 
battle was still far from won. 
  Gen Chawalit said it is noticeable that the groups are 
beginning to come out of the woodwork. "The people should 
carefully watch their movements without being shaken about it." 
The Interior Minister said one should understand that the bomb 
blasts have occurred in many places and would continue to happen 
because there are many kinds of people in society, where there 
are different kinds of conflicts, both concerning personal 
issues and business. 
  The Interior Minister said he had also received reports 
about 
the bomb blast at Labour and Social Welfare Ministry permanent 
secretary Sawai Phrammani's house in Nakhon Ratchasima, but has 
not yet spoken to Mr Sawai about the matter. 
  Asked about a committee set up to look into incidents 
occurring in the South, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Banyat 
Banthatthan, with the interior minister as deputy chairman, Gen 
Chawalit said the committee was at the administrative level.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Japan's airline industry 
leader sought correction Thursday [10 March] in what he views as 
"an inequality" in the Japan-U.S. aviation accord. Susumu 
Yamaji, chairman of Japan Airlines Co. (JAL), told a luncheon 
meeting sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, 
"we want a U.S.-Japan agreement which reflects today's 
conditions instead of the position of 40 years ago." 
  International aviation should be governed by a bilateral 
agreement based on "a give-and-take principle," he said. But 
the current accord between Tokyo and Washington, a product of 
the postwar period, was influenced by "the circumstances of the 
time when the power of the United States was overwhelming," he 
said. 
  Yamaji, also chairman of the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) Executive Committee, has led the Japanese 
team in civil aviation talks with the U.S. 
  Yamaji said Japanese airlines, for example, have only two 
weekly "beyond rights" flights from Tokyo to Brazil via Los 
Angeles, while U.S. airlines have 149 weekly flights beyond 
Japan to countries in North and South Asia and Australia. 
  He also said that under the pact, Japan is forced to take a 
"rather peculiar" route to Mexico via Vancouver, rather than the 
more cost-effective route via Los Angeles. 
  "U.S. airlines are exploiting the full benefits of their 
very advantageous position stemming from the 40-year-old 
accord," he said. 
  Yamaji said U.S. airlines, bent on fully employing their 
"outdated" rights, are attempting to further grab their share 
and control of global markets, advocating free competition under 
the name of "open skies." But the attitude has angered more and 
more countries, prompting France and Thailand to end their 
agreements with the U.S., and Germany once came close to doing 
so, he said. 
  "When you talk about liberalization, you have to prepare 
rules that offer fair chances to all players," Yamaji said. He 
said Japan is not considering forming an alliance with other 
Asian countries that have disputes with the U.S. in future 
talks with Washington. 
  On a reported plan by JAL to raise its air fares in first- 
and business-class seats on overseas routes, Yamaji said it 
reflects "business judgment" made by IATA. 
  Any airline belonging to the 225-airline IATA must receive 
its approval for a fare hike. The plan is then accepted by the 
transport authorities of each country. 
  JAL's latest move came at a time when global airlines are 
aiming to trim fares in order to survive the intensified race. 
  JAL has decided to slash fares for economy class, Yamaji 
said. JAL, which suffered around 50 billion in pretax losses in 
the latest accounting year, is expected to incur a similar loss 
in the current year that ends in March.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Pioneer Electronic Corp. 
said Thursday [10 March] it has agreed with Cable Television 
Laboratories Inc. (Cablelabs) of the United States to develop 
digital signal transmission technology for North American cable 
television systems. The agreement calls for the two parties to 
join hands in developing and standardizing a technique called 
16VSB -- vestigal sideband -- which is suitable for high volume 
data transmission, the leading audiovisual equipment maker said 
in a press release. 
  Digital signal transmission technology is viewed as a key 
element that will play a part in the next-generation digital 
CATV network, it said. 
  Under the agreement, Pioneer will be responsible for 
development of transmission technology and special 
semiconductors, and Cablelabs will provide technical facilities 
and testing assistance, the company said. Pioneer said it 
expects results by the spring of 1995.

"Information Superhighway" championed by the administration of 
President Bill Clinton.

  [Text] Naha, March 9 KYODO -- A group of 907 plaintiffs 
filed an appeal against the state with the Fukuoka High Court on 
Wednesday [9 March], protesting a lower court's rejection of 
their plea to suspend U.S. military flights from the Kadena Air 
Base in Okinawa Prefecture due to noise pollution. Their 
lawyers said their clients have also criticized the ruling of 
the Okinawa branch of the Naha District Court for failing to 
reflect an appropriate amount of compensation. 
  On February 24, the branch court ordered the state to pay a 
total of 807.45 million yen to 768 residents around the U.S. 
Kadena Air Base in compensation for noise pollution. 
  The court rejected the suit by the other 139 plaintiffs on 
the grounds that they did not suffer the same level of 
inconvenience. The ruling rejected demands for a halt to night 
flights at the base in line with a Supreme Court decision in 
February last year involving Yokota Air Base in Tokyo and Atsugi 
Air Base in Kanagawa Prefecture. 
  The group of 907 residents demanded a halt to flights to and 
from the Kadena base between 7 P.M. and 7 A.M., 1.15 million 
yen each in damages for noise-related suffering and compensation 
for future annoyance until a night flight ban is imposed. 
  Kadena Air Base is under the control of the 18th Tactical 
Fighter Wing and is considered a key base of the U.S. Air Force 
in East Asia.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher asked Thursday [10 March] for Japan's support 
if the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development 
program is brought to the U.N. Security Council for discussion, 
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said. Christopher made the 
call in talks with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in reference to 
North Korea's suspected nuclear development program and ongoing 
inspections of its seven declared nuclear facilities, the 
officials said. 
  Hata told Christopher that Japan will fulfill its role as a 
member of the United Nations in such a case, and gave high marks 
to Washington's "tenacious" negotiations with Pyongyang, they 
said. The two men agreed in the meantime to continue 
cooperation to solve problems regarding North Korea's alleged 
nuclear weapons program, the officials said. 
  North Korea announced a year ago that it would withdraw from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) but suspended the 
decision after negotiations with the United States. 
  Late last month, Pyongyang said it will allow inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of seven of its 
nuclear facilities and the IAEA inspectors entered Pyongyang on 
March 1. 
  Washington and Pyongyang are scheduled to hold a third round 
of high-level talks beginning March 21 in Geneva on the 
condition that North Korea comply with a four-point accord that 
includes successful completion of the nuclear inspections. 
  Christopher arrived in Tokyo from Australia on Wednesday on 
the second leg of a three-nation tour which also takes him to 
China on Friday. 
  The secretary of state urged Japanese support in pushing 
China's leadership to improve its human rights record, the 
officials said. Christopher told Hata that the U.S. considers 
improvement in China's human rights record as an important 
condition to extend most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status to 
Beijing. 
  Hata noted that Japan has been urging China to improve its 
human rights record. 
  Christopher and Hata both expressed concern over the recent 
emergence of ultranationalists in Russia, the officials said. 
  Christopher said he does not think a spy scandal involving a 
high-ranking CIA official will affect U.S.-Russian ties in the 
long term, they said. He also said Washington welcomes Moscow's 
initiative in the conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  On Friday, Christopher and Undersecretary of Defense Frank 
Wisner will hold "two-plus-two" security talks with Hata and 
Defense Agency chief Kazuo Aichi. 
  Christopher is scheduled to deliver a speech before Japanese 
business leaders later the same day.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of States Christopher met separately 
with Prime Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata this 
afternoon. During the meetings, he said the United States will 
make a decision on the resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic 
trade talks which were broken off at the recent Japan-U.S. 
summit after examining a package of measures to open the 
Japanese market which Japan plans to map out during this month. 
  At his meeting with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Secretary of 
State Christopher said: While the United States has been working 
on the reduction of its federal budget deficit, Japan has yet to 
fulfill its responsibility for cutting its trade surplus with 
the United States and expanding imports. What is important is 
the visible trade result. I hope that Japan will take measures 
in wide areas. 
  The U.S. secretary of state also indicated that the United 
States will make a decision on whether to resume the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks, which remain suspended, after 
examining the package of measures to open the Japanese market 
which Japan plans to map out during this month. In response, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa said: We are fully aware that Japanese 
and U.S. economies are in a difficult situation. The government 
is doing all in its power to map out a package of measures to 
open the Japanese market to reduce Japan's trade surplus with 
the United States. 
  At the meeting prior to the Hosokawa-Christopher meeting, 
Foreign Minister Hata expressed a sense of crisis in the 
Japan-U.S. relations. Foreign Minister Hata and Secretary of 
State Christopher agreed on the following point: The Japan-U.S. 
relationship is an allied relationship based on the security 
arrangements, and both Japan and the United States have common 
responsibility for the world prosperity. The two countries 
should seek to resolve issues pending between them through 
dialogue in order not to heighten tension between them in the 
economic area. 
  During the meeting between Foreign Minister Hata and 
Secretary of State Christopher, the issue of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear development was raised. Foreign Minister Hata 
said Japan highly appraises tenacious effort by the United 
States to hold talks with North Korea. Japan would fulfill its 
responsibility as a UN member if talks on nuclear inspections 
end in failure. In this way, the foreign minister indicated that 
Japan would cooperate with economic sanctions to be imposed by 
the UN Security Council.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher urged Japan on Thursday to come out with a 
tangible and comprehensive market-opening package by the end of 
the month, Foreign Ministry officials said. Christopher made 
the call in a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at 
his official residence, saying Japan has not yet produced 
results in correcting its trade imbalance or boosting imports. 
  Hosokawa told Christopher the Japanese Government is working 
on a market-opening package that is "substantially meaningful," 
the officials said. 
  Earlier in the day, Christopher met with Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and agreed the United States and Japan should make 
efforts to prevent existing tension from escalating and try to 
solve problems through negotiations, they said. 
  Christopher told the prime minister that the U.S. is trying 
to reduce its fiscal deficit and to strengthen its 
competitiveness. 
  Christopher noted the need to improve bilateral economic 
relations and remove the current negative elements, the 
officials said. 
  The prime minister told Christopher that he is devoting 
great 
energy into pushing for "changes" in Japan because they are 
important for consumers and the public. Hosokawa explained that 
although other countries may think the speed of change is slow, 
it is not easy to transform systems that have long existed in 
Japan, they said. 
  Christopher expressed respect toward Hosokawa's efforts, 
including political reform, they said. 
  Christopher told Hosokawa that the U.S. and Japan have good 
relations in the political and security fields, noting the 
planned "two-plus-two" security talks on Friday and the 
International Conference on Aid to Cambodia which began in Tokyo 
in a two-day session. Christopher and Hata, both of whom 
attended the opening day session of the Cambodia aid conference, 
are scheduled to meet again Friday in a security forum session 
to be joined by Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi and 
U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner. 
  During the 45-minute meeting with the prime minister, 
Christopher conveyed President Bill Clinton's message to 
Hosokawa, the officials said. In the message, Clinton gave high 
marks to the February summit and a breakfast meeting with 
Hosokawa in Washington and noted that he respects the prime 
minister very much as a best friend, they said. 
  On the international front, Christopher urged Hosokawa to 
convey the U.S. stance to place importance on China's human 
rights record in considering extension of its the 
most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status when Hosokawa visits 
China from March 19 to 21, the officials said. 
  Christopher, who will visit Beijing on Friday after wrapping 
up the three-day trip to Japan, said if no improvement in 
China's human rights record is seen and Washington does not 
extend MFN status, the entire economic system in Asia would be 
negatively affected. Hosokawa replied that he will bear that in 
mind when he visits China, officials said. 
  Earlier, Christopher held two-hour talks with Foreign 
Minister Hata. 
  Hata told Christopher tension exists over economic problems, 
and that although it is unlikely to negatively influence 
bilateral ties immediately, the two countries should not 
underestimate it, they said. 
  Hata was also quoted as saying it is important that Japan 
and 
the U.S. keep their ties in good form because Asia, Europe and 
the rest of the world are watching. 
  Ties between Tokyo and Washington turned sour last month 
when 
Hosokawa and Clinton announced the collapse of the trade 
framework negotiations aimed at redressing Japan's huge trade 
surplus with the United States. The two sides have since been 
in a cooling-off period. 
  Japanese figures show Japan registered a third straight rise 
in its trade surplus with the U.S. in 1993, gaining 15.2 percent 
to 50.19 billion dollars, the third-largest amount. U.S. 
figures put the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 1993 at a 
record 59.3 billion dollar. 
  Christopher told Hata that Washington wants to closely watch 
what Tokyo hammers out as a market-opening package and then 
decide on what to do with the framework talks, the officials 
said. 
  Christopher, who arrived in Japan late Wednesday night for a 
three-day visit to Japan, called for "tangible" results and said 
the U.S. does not want "ambiguities" or just procedures, they 
said. 
  The officials said Hata and Christopher did not discuss 
specific economic problems. They did not take up the U.S. 
Government's reinstatement last week of a trade law known as 
Super 301, which gives the administration power to impose 
sanctions against countries it determines guilty of unfair trade 
practices, they said. 
  Japanese officials believe the action is aimed at pressing 
Japan into opening its markets and reducing its trade surplus. 
  Christopher and Hata agreed Japan and the U.S. have 
commitments to their alliance relations based on a bilateral 
security pact and that both countries have joint 
responsibilities for maintaining peace and prosperity throughout 
the world, they said. 
  Christopher expressed worries about possible deterioration 
of 
the relationship of trust between Japan and the U.S., noting 
voices in the U.S. that Tokyo is not sufficiently making 
efforts to reduce its current account surplus or to boost 
imports while the U.S. is fulfilling its responsibilities to 
reduce its fiscal deficit and strengthen competitiveness, the 
officials said. 
  The two men agreed that Tokyo and Washington should both try 
to offer ideas to seek a solution, they said. 
  Hata told Christopher that Japan is making "voluntary" 
efforts and is compiling a package of market-opening measures, 
such as deregulation and import-promotion steps. He added Japan 
is making such efforts not only for the sake of relations with 
other countries but for the improvement of its own people's 
lives. 
  Earlier in the day, Christopher told reporters that Japan, 
in 
the course of its reforms, could benefit from advice from the 
U.S. 
  "I think there is a change and reform taking place in Japan 
and, if they'll permit an outsider to be heard, it may be 
helpful to express our views about the importance of the 
relationship we have with Japan," Christopher said. He 
mentioned security, diplomacy and economy as areas in which the 
bilateral relationship has particular importance.

Christopher and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata agreed Thursday 
[10 March] that the United States and Japan should make efforts 
to prevent existing tension from escalating and try to solve 
problems through negotiations, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  During a two-hour meeting at the Foreign Ministry, Hata told 
Christopher that there is "tension" between Japan and the U.S. 
over economic problems. 
  Christopher was quoted as saying the economic row should not 
affect security and political relations between the two nations, 
the officials said. 
  The secretary of state told Hata the U.S. wants to watch 
closely what the Japanese Government will hammer out as a 
market-opening package and then decide on what to do with the 
collapsed bilateral "framework" talks. 
  The officials said Hata and Christopher did not discuss 
specific economic problems. 
  They did not take up the U.S. Government's reinstatement 
last week of a trade law known as Super 301, which gives the 
administration power to impose sanctions against countries it 
determines guilty of unfair trade practices, they said. 
  Japanese officials believe the action is aimed at pressing 
Japan into opening its markets and reducing its trade surplus. 
  Hata told Christopher the "tension" between Tokyo and 
Washington is unlikely to immediately have a bad influence on 
the entire bilateral relationship. But the foreign minister 
noted that the two nations should not underestimate the tension, 
the officials said. 
  He was quoted as saying it is important to keep Japan-U.S. 
ties in good form from a global point of view because Asia, 
Europe and the rest of the world are keeping their eyes on the 
two. 
  The Tokyo-Washington ties took a turn for the worse last 
month when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill 
Clinton announced the collapse of trade framework negotiations 
aimed at redressing Japan's huge trade surplus with the U.S. 
which totaled some 60 billion dollars last year according to 
U.S. figures. 
  Christopher and Hata agreed Japan and the U.S. have 
commitments to their alliance relations based on a bilateral 
security pact and that both countries have joint 
responsibilities for maintaining peace and prosperity throughout 
the world, they said. 
  Christopher expressed worries about possible deterioration 
of

helpful to express our views about the importance of the 
relationship we have with Japan," Christopher said. He 
mentioned security, diplomacy and economy as areas in which the 
bilateral relationship has particular importance. 
  Christopher cited "the need to strengthen our economic 
relationship so that there is a balance in our overall 
relationship." 
  He denied that he is trying to take his "message" directly 
to 
the Japanese people because the U.S. has failed to get it 
through to them via talks with the Japanese Government. "I 
think it's always desirable to communicate directly, when one 
can, to the people of a country," he said, adding that the U.S. 
message "can be strengthened if we convey it ourselves, not 
because it's been misrepresented." 
  The coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
has undertaken political reform and financial deregulation since 
coming to office last August. 
  Christopher, who leaves Japan on Friday after a three-day 
stay, made the comments after a meeting with Cambodian 
Co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, who are in 
Tokyo for a conference on aid to Cambodia.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Cambodian First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh said Thursday [10 March] the 
government remains open to a dialogue with the Khmer Rouge, but 
not "negotiations" that would imply further concessions to the 
guerrilla group. 
  "Our doors are still open," Ranariddh told reporters after 
he 
and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen held talks with U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher. "No negotiations, but we are ready 
to talk," Ranariddh said, adding that the Khmer Rouge "have to 
be more reasonable." 
  Ranariddh and Hun Sen arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday to 
attend 
a two-day international conference on aid to Cambodia which 
began Thursday. In his address to the conference, Ranariddh 
urged the international community "to help...solve the question 
of the Khmer Rouge as best it can" by seeing to it that the 
provisions of the October 1991 Paris peace agreements on 
Cambodia are strictly implemented. 
  In a barb clearly aimed at neighboring Thailand, which has 
been repeatedly accused by the Cambodian Government of allowing 
the Khmer Rouge sanctuary across the border, Ranariddh urged all 
signatories of the Paris agreements to fully respect them. 
  Ranariddh's father King Norodom Sihanouk, in a message read 
out at the conference, held out an olive branch to the Khmer 
Rouge, saying that "the door remains open to the most moderate 
elements and I do not despair of their future integration, there 
being an irresistible spirit towards total national 
reconciliation." 
  Christopher warned in his address that considering that the 
Khmer Rouge has not yet disarmed, "the future of democracy in 
Cambodia can hardly be taken for granted."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Cambodia's Second Premier 
Hun Sen told former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe on Thursday 
[10 March] his country hopes to borrow expertise from Japan's 
Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to train retired Cambodian soldiers in 
technical skills. He urged Watanabe to use his political 
influence to help Cambodia get SDF assistance, Japanese 
officials said. 
  Watanabe, however, said it would be difficult to realize 
such 
a project as the Japanese Constitution allows SDF dispatch 
abroad only for United Nations peacekeeping operations. 
  Hun Sen suggested the experts could also be retired SDF 
personnel, the officials added. 
  Hun Sen and his co-premier Norodom Ranariddh, who are 
currently in Japan to attend an international conference on 
assistance for Cambodia's reconstruction, met Watanabe at a 
Tokyo hotel.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Vice Defense Minister 
Shigeru Hatakeyama said Thursday [10 March] it is possible that 
North Korea has developed a long-range missile capable of 
hitting targets more than 2,000 kilometers away. 
  "North Korea has placed stress on its military. Looking at 
the facts that it has developed the Nodong-1 through upgrading 
Scud missiles and has improved its technologies, we cannot 
totally deny that it may produce a further upgraded one," he 
said. 
  Hatakeyama, speaking at a news conference, discussed a 
report 
by the authoritative JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY that North Korea is 
developing two new ballistic missiles, one of which is capable 
of landing anywhere in Japan. Pyongyang last year test-fired 
the Nodong-1 ballistic missile with an estimated range of 1,000 
kilometers -- capable of striking Seoul and western parts of 
Japan. 
  Hatakeyama, however, said the Defense Agency has not 
independently confirmed the JANE's report. According to JANE's, 
U.S. intelligence satellites have detected a new "missile 
simulator," a hardware mock-up of a missile, at the Sanum Dong 
research facility in North Korea. 
  The weekly said the new two-stage missile has been given the 
provisional designation Taepo Dong-2 (TD-2) by U.S. 
intelligence. The mock-up was 32 meters long, comprising an 18 
by 2.4 meter diameter first stage and a 14 by 1.3 meter second 
stage rocket. 
  The TD-2's dimensions indicate the missile would have a 
range 
far greater than the 2,000 kilometers of the Taepo Dong-1 
(TD-1), also under development by North Korea, the magazine 
said. Jane's said U.S. officials also believe the missile has a 
much improved targeting capability and is possibly able to 
achieve a range of 3,500 kilometers, putting it in striking 
distance of Guam.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- French Trade Minister 
Gerard Longuet on Thursday [10 March] criticized Washington's 
retaliatory trade policy against Japan. The global community 
regards Japan's huge trade surplus as "a problem" for the world, 
but resorting to steps like Super 301 is an "overreaction," 
Longuet said. 
  Longuet made the remarks in his meeting with his Japanese 
counterpart Hiroshi Kumagai. 
  France and other European countries are against trade 
policies accompanied by sanctions, Longuet said. "Such a step 
is unlikely to solve problems on a long-term basis." 
  Kumagai said Japan will not leave unattended the soured 
economic ties with the United States following the breakdown of 
trade "framework" talks in February. 
  Longuet called for global economic cooperation with Japan in 
such fields as automobiles, aircraft and energy. He also 
proposed Japan and other Asian countries step up cooperation for 
industrial development. 
  Kumagai shared the view with the French trade minister, who 
arrived Tuesday for a visit lasting through Sunday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- French Trade and Industry 
Minister Gerard Longuet on Thursday [10 March] harshly 
criticized Washington's reinstatement of the Super 301 trade law 
as an "unjustified attack" on Japan. 
  In an address to the Japanese-French Club, an official 
bilateral discussion forum, Longuet also called for more 
Japanese investment in France. 
  "The U.S. has used Japan's structural trade surplus as a 
pretext for launching unjustified attacks against Japan and 
making unilateral decisions," Longuet said, citing the 
reinstatement of Super 301, which paves the way for trade 
sanctions. France condemns such actions, he said. 
  The trade law gives the United States broad powers to impose 
sanctions against countries it judges to have unfair trade 
practices. Its reinstatement is widely seen as a move to 
pressure Japan to reduce its more than 60 billion dollar trade 
surplus with the U.S. 
  Referring to the U.S. Government's role in clinching a 6 
billion dollar private-sector contract from Saudi Arabian 
Airlines, Longuet said Washington's trade tactics run counter to 
the philosophy of free trade. 
  A European consortium, Airbus Industrie, also submitted a 
bid 
for the aircraft deal, which is expected to save the 
near-bankrupt U.S. aircraft industry. 
  Washington is exploiting its "almost exclusive political, 
military and monetary trump cards" to safeguard commercial 
interests, Longuet said. This is "not a very good solution." 
  Instead Japan's overall trade surplus should be addressed on 
a multilateral basis, Longuet said. 
  Citing improved foreign access to public works bidding, 
Longuet said Japan is "going in the right direction" with its 
efforts to deregulate the economy. 
  Paris is satisfied with Tokyo's recent 15 billion yen 
stimulus package, he said. He said he hoped that the 
liberalization of Japan's economy will lead to closer bilateral 
economic ties, and urged more bilateral investment and joint 
ventures. 
  While France represents some 20 percent of the European 
economy, only 7 percent of Japanese investment in Europe goes to 
France, he said. 
  Longuet urged French companies to overcome their "lack of 
courage" and set up business in Japan. Japanese investments in 
France are 10 times higher than French investments in Japan. 
  He arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for talks with Japanese 
Government and business leaders and to attend an international 
conference on assistance to Cambodia.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Thursday [10 March] expressed hope to visit France 
before this year's summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major 
industrialized nations set for Naples in July, a Foreign 
Ministry official said. Hosokawa made the remark in a meeting 
with Gerard Longuet, the French trade and industry minister, at 
the prime minister's official residence Thursday [10 March]. 
  Longuet invited Hosokawa to France as early as possible, the 
official said. Hosokawa did not make clear when he wants to 
visit France, the official said. 
  Longuet was quoted as telling Hosokawa that France and Japan 
can cooperate in helping reconstruct Cambodia from years of 
civil strife and contribute to the international community 
together. 
  He also lauded Hosokawa's courage to institute national 
reforms, including the recently achieved political reform, the 
official said. 
  Longuet arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for talks with 
Japanese 
Government and business leaders and to attend an international 
conference on assistance to Cambodia, which opened its two-day 
session at a Tokyo hotel Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Japan will send only the 
labor minister from among cabinet members to the Group of Seven 
(G-7) "Jobs Summit" in Detroit on May 14-15, a top government 
spokesman said Thursday [10 March]. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told reporters 
the 
government has decided to send only Labor Minister Chikara 
Sakaguchi to the Detroit meeting as other ministers invited to 
the meeting are unable to go because of Diet business. "There 
is a perception that deliberation on the (fiscal 1994) budget is 
more important, so the government made a decision to have only 
the labor minister attend," Takemura said. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has invited officials of the 
other G-7 major industrial countries -- Japan, Germany, Britain, 
France, Italy and Canada -- to the meeting to discuss ways to 
create new jobs. 
  From Japan, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International 
Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and Economic 
Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota were also invited 
to the meeting.

  [Text] Wakayama, March 10 KYODO -- Police rounded up a 
group of 106 Chinese early Thursday [10 March] in Susami, 
Wakayama Prefecture, on suspicion of illegally entering Japan. 
  The Chinese had rented about 10 cars after landing in the 
coastal town aboard several small boats, and were apprehended 
while making their way to Osaka and Nagoya, police said. 
  Police suspect there is a syndicate organization which 
plotted the entry attempt. 
  In late November, a group of nearly 100 Chinese sneaked into 
the country through a tiny port some 10 kilometers northwest of 
Susami.

  [Text] Wakayama, March 10 KYODO -- Police on Thursday [10 
March] arrested a group of 91 Chinese for allegedly trying to 
sneak into Japan through a coastal town in Wakayama Prefecture 
and 16 other Chinese on suspicion of harboring the illegal 
immigrants. 
  Police caught the Chinese group in a sweep after they landed 
in Susami aboard several small boats early Thursday and tried to 
make their way to Osaka and Nagoya in 13 cars rented by the 
others, they said. The 16 Chinese accomplices had their 
passports, police said. 
  The 91 illegal immigrants, including 12 women, reportedly 
told police that some of them had come from China while others 
came from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
  Police suspect that a syndicate organization is behind the 
massive human smuggling scheme. Police had been tipped off by 
local residents who reported seeing the cars with Osaka and 
Nagoya plates. 
  There were two similar incidents of illegal entry by Chinese 
reported in the same vicinity in late 1993. Nearly 100 Chinese 
attempted to enter the country in November through a tiny port 
some 10 kilometers northwest of Susami but were detained by 
police. 
  Meanwhile, police in Nagoya arrested Karmann Tang, 26, from 
Hong Kong, on suspicion of preparing to help the illegal 
immigrants. Tang had 24 Shinkansen bullet trains tickets from 
Nagoya to Tokyo, police said. 
  He was quoted as saying that he was to meet the Chinese in 
Nagoya and send them to Tokyo and that his company had gone to 
"a remote beach" to pick up the immigrants. 
  Two men who appeared to be Chinese rented two trucks at a 
shop in Nagoya on Monday and police are investigating their 
connection with the case, they said. 
  Of the 91 Chinese who tried to enter Japan, the oldest is a 
39-year-old man and the youngest a 16-year-old girl, they said. 
The other 16 people arrested in Wakayama are between 22 and 36 
years old, and had passports from Singapore or Hong Kong, they 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Honda Motor Co. said 
Wednesday [9 March] it will open a showroom in Beijing on April 
6 to promote automobile sales in China. The showroom, the first 
such facility to be opened in Beijing by a Japanese automaker, 
will exhibit Legend and Accord models, Honda said. 
  At the same time, Honda's Hong Kong-based sales subsidiary, 
Honda Motor (China) Co., will launch active automobile-marketing 
efforts in China, company officials said. The wholly owned 
subsidiary was established in February 1993 to market and 
service Honda motorcycles, for which Chinese demand is 
increasing, the officials said. 
  Honda so far has sold automobiles in China through trading 
companies. The officials said Honda decided to have the 
subsidiary promote direct automobile marketing in China after 
Honda's auto exports to the country hit a record 12,200 vehicles 
last year.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Domestic rice prices in the 
free market almost stopped rising Wednesday [9 March] after a 
period of increases following a government decision to 
distribute state-controlled rice blended with foreign rice, a 
private rice market survey agency said. 
  The rice databank said 60 kilograms of "Koshihikari" rice 
produced in Niigata Prefecture were traded at between 53,200 yen 
and 53,600 yen in Tokyo and Osaka free markets, only 300 yen 
higher than a week before. 
  Although the price of "Kirara 397" in Hokkaido is still 
rising, rises in other brands have been shrinking, the 
Tokyo-based agency said. 
  A free rice market official in Osaka said most consumers who 
persist in eating domestic rice seemed to have purchased what 
they want prior to the distribution of government-controlled 
rice, which will be blended with foreign rice to counter the 
domestic crop shortfall in 1993.

Thursday [10 March] an additional 30,000 tons of rice, harvested 
in Japan, will be supplied to the market between this month and 
June as an emergency measure to meet a shortage. 
  The 30,000 tons, equivalent to two days' national 
consumption, are part of the agency's prefectural branch stocks, 
agency officials said. However, it is up to prefectural 
governments to determine when to put the extra rice on the 
market, the officials said. 
  The shortage is caused partly by delayed imports of foreign 
rice, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Several trading firms have 
filed applications with the Food Agency to become government 
designated importing agents of rice, agency sources said 
Thursday[10 March]. It is the first time in almost a quarter of 
a century that new trading firms are trying to enter the rice 
import business, they said. 
  Under the designated agent system, established in 1957 when 
Japan was still importing rice, the government imports the grain 
but consigns the actual importing to approved trading companies. 
Japan later halted rice imports, and since there have been no 
new participants in the business, although the agency accepts 
applications every March. [sentence as received] 
  The number of designated trading firms has long remained at 
about 20, according to the sources. 
  With the government's decision last December to partially 
open the rice market next year, more traders are now eager to 
enter the business. The sources refrained from revealing the 
number and names of new trading firms that applied this year, 
but Okura and Co., a medium-ranked trading firm, said it has 
applied. 
  In order to become a designated agent, a trading firm must 
be 
a joint-stock corporation set up in Japan with capital of more 
than 100 million yen, and must have staff knowledgeable in rice 
trading, according to the agency. The agency will examine the 
applications and soon announce the results, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Cold weather is likely to 
hit northern and eastern Japan from April to September, the 
months for growing rice, the Meteorological Agency said in its 
long-term forecast on Thursday [10 March]. 
  Last year's cold weather brought about a poor harvest of 
rice 
crops throughout Japan, forcing the government to import rice 
from foreign producers as an emergency measure. 
  The northern and eastern regions of Japan are known as rice 
producing areas and officials said the expected cold weather for 
a second year in a row may possibly result in another poor 
harvest.

  [Text] At today's upper house plenary session, Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reiterated that the national defense 
program, which defines the government's basic thinking on 
defense, needs to be reviewed. He said that such a review does 
not necessarily have to aim at cutting back on the defense 
forces. 
  Questioning the cabinet at this afternoon's session, Yutaka 
Takeyama of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] asked about the 
review of the national defense program being carried out. He 
noted that regional tensions remain high even after the end of 
the Cold War, as on the Korean peninsula, for example. He said 
that the current situation does not warrant a cutback in the 
Self-Defense Forces [SDF]. 
  In reply, Prime Minister Hosokawa said that a review needs 
to 
be carried out of the concept of the program, including on the 
question of what Japan's basic defense capabilities should be. 
He stated that the review is currently under way in the 
government, and he insisted that the review is not necessarily 
aimed at reducing defense. 
  Yutaka Shimomura, a member of the Niin Club [upper house 
floor group], was the last speaker at the interpellation session 
today. He noted that the Hosokawa government retains high 
popularity, although it is perhaps not as popular as it once 
was. He said this means that Mr. Hosokawa should keep in mind 
that he must live up to the expectations of the people and that 
Mr. Hosokawa himself should come up with measures to make this 
possible. 
  In his response, Hosokawa stated that his government was 
born 
surrounded by the warm expectations of the people on reform, and 
that it continues to receive the support of the people as it 
proceeds with these reforms. He said he continues to be 
committed to the structural reforms of politics and the economy 
to give a new priority to working people.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>
  [Text] NHK TV conducted a nationwide poll of 1,800 people 
aged 20 or over on 5, 6 March and got answers from 1,162 of 
them, or 64.9 percent. Results of the poll show that 84 percent 
of those surveyed said the government's economic stimulation 
measures were inadequate while only 4 percent said the measures 
were adequate. Asked what they expected the government to do to 
stimulate the economy, 32 percent said the government should 
expand public works projects, and 22 percent said taxes should 
be cut. 
  Asked about the first Hosokawa cabinet budget bill for 
fiscal 
1944, 38 percent said it contained no characteristics of the 
Hosokawa cabinet because it had no economic stimulation plan and 
had been compiled by bureaucrats; while 22 percent it did have 
Hosokawa cabinet characteristics in that it planned to increase 
funding for public works projects to stimulate the economy and 
attached importance to consumers. 
  The government has decided to cut 6 trillion yen in taxes 
for 
one year in 1994, and to draw a conclusion within this year on 
post-1994 tax cuts and ways to secure financial resources to 
compensate for the shortfall incurred through tax cuts. 
  Asked about this plan, 44 percent said they thought highly 
of 
it, while 45 percent said they had no strong feelings for or 
against it. This showed a clear division of support for the 
tax-cut plan. Asked how they would use the extra income from 
the proposed tax cuts, 35 percent said they would spend more on 
consumer goods and tourism, while 32 percent said they would 
save the money. 
  Asked to comment on the national welfare tax that was 
scrapped soon after Prime Minister Hosokawa announced it, 54 
percent opposed it, saying it was merely a replacement for the 
consumption tax, that it had been abruptly announced without 
full debate, and that the existing tax rate was already high. 
However, 29 percent expressed support, saying the new tax 
system was needed to support an aging society, to ensure 
financial resources to compensate for the planned tax cuts, and 
to improve the people's welfare. 
  Asked about the relationship between the level of social 
security and burden on society of senior citizens, 63 percent 
said the present social security system should be maintained 
even if the people's burden increased a little, while 20 percent 
said Japan should build itself a high-level social security 
system even if it greatly increased the tax burden on the people. 
  Asked about foreign rice imported after Japan suffered a 
shortage, 75 percent said they felt uneasy or very uneasy about 
eating it, while 23 percent said they felt quite happy about 
eating it. 
  Asked about government measures for farmers following its 
decision to partially open the Japanese rice market, 33 percent 
said the government should reduce protection for them and that 
the farmers should strengthen their management through free 
competition. Meanwhile 28 percent said government funds should 
be used to consolidate the foundation of agriculture, while 19 
percent advocated the need for the government to subsidize 
losses in farmers' incomes.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Daiwa Securities Co. 
Chairman Sadakane Doi was unofficially appointed Wednesday [9 
March] as the next chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers 
Association, association officials said. The appointment of 
Doi, 65, to the post will be officially determined on July 1 at 
a meeting of directors. 
  Masaru Aratani, 69 , a former deputy president of the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange, is currently chairman of the association. 
  This is the first time since the revelation of the series of 
stock scandals in 1991 that an official from one of the "big 
four" brokerage houses will head the securities industry 
organization. Before the stock scandals involving loss 
compensation by major brokerages to big customers were revealed, 
the big four -- Nomura Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co., 
Yamaichi Securities Co. as well as Daiwa -- customarily took 
turns to supply the association's chief. 
  The outcry against the malpractice forced the big four to 
take a back seat, but the prolonged securities business slump 
and intensifying competition led many smaller brokerages to call 
for leadership from the big players, according to the officials. 
  The officials said the association will ask the Finance 
Ministry to end its restriction on the association personnel, 
set in the wake of the scandals. The ministry has advised the 
association that its head should not double in the post and as 
chief of his own company.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- A top trade ministry 
official on Thursday [10 March] supported the accelerated 
regrouping of the cement industry in Japan. "Reorganization is 
an inevitable move facing the industry," said the official at 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who declined 
to be named. 
  The comment followed a merger accord reached earlier in the 
day between Sumitomo Cement Co., the fourth biggest cement maker 
in Japan, and the eighth largest Osaka Cement Co., a move that 
will create the nation's second largest cement maker with a 
market share of about 18 percent. 
  The merger is expected to speed up the collapse of joint 
sales alliances formed among Japan's cement makers a decade ago. 
Of the five joint sales entities, two -- one led by Onoda 
Cement Co. and the other by Ube Industries Ltd. and Chichibu 
Cement Co. -- have already been dissolved. Another, led by 
Sumitomo Cement Co., will be disbanded by the end of this month. 
  The latest move by Sumitomo and Osaka would lead to 
extinction of one of the remaining two alliances -- the one led 
by Nihon Cement Co. -- because Osaka belongs to the group. 
  The alliances were established as an exception to the 
Antimonopoly Law under the MITI's strong administrative guidance 
as part of the cement industry's streamlining efforts. But the 
long recession in Japan has prompted business tie-ups beyond the 
framework of the original alliances. 
  Mergers could have more cost-cutting effects than under the 
alliances in which cement makers cooperated in such sales fields 
as unification of product brands and distribution systems, the 
MITI official said.

  [Text] Washington, March 9 (YONHAP) -- As IAEA nuclear 
inspectors were reportedly experiencing difficulties in North 
Korea, the United States and South Korea have decided that 
Washington will be compelled to postpone a third round of talks 
with Pyongyang unless the Stalinist state changes its attitude. 
  As of Thursday (KST), the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) team had not been able to inspect the 5-megawatt nuclear 
reactor and radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon, sources in New 
York and Washington said. 
  Moreover, even if South and North Korea agreed to exchange 
special envoys at their sixth working-level contact at Panmunjom 
on Saturday, it would be too late for the exchange to occur 
before March 21, when the United States and North Korea are 
scheduled to hold the next high-level meeting in Geneva. 
  The United States has said these two conditions -- IAEA 
inspections and an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys -- 
are prerequisites to the third round of talks between Washington 
and Pyongyang. 
  North Korea wants to continue its negotiations with the 
United States on normalizing relations and economic assistance, 
among other things. 
  The sources said, however, they will have to wait until the 
weekend to see whether the IAEA inspection team is permitted to 
inspect the two nuclear facilities at Yongbyon before returning 
to Vienna. 
  In this connection, Deputy State Department Spokeswoman 
Christine Shelly said she understood the IAEA inspectors were 
encountering "some difficulties" in Yongbyon. 
  "We, of course, regret that they (IAEA inspections) have not 
proceeded as smoothly as we would have liked up to this point" 
she told a regular weekly press briefing. 
  But noting that there is still some time left, Shelly urged 
North Korea to meet its commitments that they have made. 
  She also recalled that the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
high- level talks can be held only when South and North Korea 
exchange special envoys to discuss the nuclear question. 
  Prior to Shelly's remarks, the U.S. State Department was 
reported to have conveyed the American position on inter-Korean 
envoy exchange talks to the North Korean Mission to the United 
Nations in New York on Tuesday (EST). 
  North Korea has said it did not agree to exchange special 
envoys as a precondition for further U.S.-North Korean talks. 
It is also refusing to open the five-megawatt reactor and the 
radiochemical laboratory to IAEA inspectors.

  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has 
reportedly reconfirmed its policy on postponing the third round 
of high-level U.S.-North Korean talks slated for March 21 in 
Geneva if Pyongyang delays an inter-Korean envoy exchange by 
insisting on four requirements as conditions for the exchange. 
  At a high-level strategic meeting presided over by Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang on Thursday morning, the government 
discussed other measures against North Korea in the wake of 
Wednesday's unsuccessful meeting on exchanging envoys, informed 
sources said. 
  Among the measures is resumption of preparation for this 
year's joint "Team Spirit" military exercise with the United 
States if North Korea does not cooperate in international 
inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites and if the third 
round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks is postponed. 
  The meeting focused on whether the next high-level 
U.S.-North 
Korean meeting should be held if an agreement is reached before 
March 21 to exchange envoys after this date, sources said. 
  In case either North or South Korea sends an envoy to the 
other side, instead of a mutual exchange, the government will 
support holding the next high-level Washington-Pyongyang meeting 
on March 21 as scheduled. 
  The government will discuss this policy with U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State for Military and Political Affairs Robert 
Gallucci when he arrives on Thursday evening. 
  Attending the meeting were Deputy Premier and Unification 
Minister Yi Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Senior Presidential Secretary for 
Foreign and National Security Affairs Chong Chong-ok.

  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- In case the inter-Korean 
working-level contacts fail to make any progress, it is only 
natural that the third round of high-level talks between 
Pyongyang and Washington will be suspended and that Team Spirit 
will be resumed, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang confirmed on 
Thursday. 
  Yi noted, in a meeting with journalists, that holding the 
third round of high-level talks and suspending "Team Spirit," 
the annual South Korean-U.S. joint military exercise, had been 
decided on condition that South and North Korea exchange special 
envoys. 
  Last month, Pyongyang told Washington it would allow 
unrestricted IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] access to 
seven declared facilities and accept Seoul's proposal to hold 
working-level talks on exchanging presidential envoys. 
  In return, Washington was to suspend this year's Team Spirit 
and conduct high-level talks with North Korea later this month. 
  "Given the North Korean attitude we saw at the working-level 
contacts until yesterday, I doubt if North Korea really intends 
to exchange special envoys with the South. Inter-Korean 
contacts, if they are only for show (to others), are 
meaningless," Yi said. 
  Yi avoided making any decisive remarks on whether Team 
Spirit 
would be held. 
  "I cannot affirm that because it is a subtle military 
problem. I think we'll have to watch the progress of the 
inter-Korean working- level contacts, expecting that Pyongyang's 
attitude will change at the sixth contact slated for Saturday 
[12 March]." 
  He said now is not the time to comment on whether 
international sanctions may be imposed on North Korea if the 
special envoy exchange is not realized. 
  On reports that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspectors had found a damaged seal at the North Korean nuclear 
facilities, Yi said he was briefed on the results of the IAEA 
inspection. 
  "But that is a problem for the IAEA to cope with, anyway," 
he 
said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials in Seoul vernacular newspapers published 
on 10 March on the North-South contact held on 9 March at 
Panmunjom. 
  The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean on page 3 
carries an 800-word editorial entitled "Are We That 
`Desperate'?" The editorial refutes Chief ROK delegate Song 
Pyong-tae's remark "that the envoy exchange is a pressing issue 
that cannot be put aside even for a minute," and calls on Song 
to disclose if his remark represents the government's official 
view or is his personal opinion. The editorial notes the issue 
on exchanging special envoys is "not the supreme task nor a 
pressing issue, but what we hope for to occur." 
  The editorial deplores that "the South side disclosed all 
our 
cards" and that "we begged the North side for the exchange of 
special envoys, which resulted in North Korea's assuming a 
haughty attitude toward our demands." Recalling that President 
Kim Yong-sam expressed his hope for the North-South summit at a 
news conference, the article concludes that our side's 
mishandling of the affair is a by-product of 
"unification-related government officials' flattery, pursuit for 
personal achievements, and excessive loyalty to fulfill the 
president's hope." 
  Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean carries on page 3 a 1,000-word 
article by An Hui-chang entitled: "The Prospect for Exchanging 
Special Envoys Before 21 March Grows Dim." The article analyzes 
North Korea's counterproposal of two additional demands, 
including maintenance of national self-reliance, on the agenda 
for discussion by the special envoys, as attempts by North Korea 
"to break the ROK-U.S. cooperative system by not agreeing to the 
envoy exchange" and "to size up our government's determination 
to exchange special envoys." 
  The article interprets "North Korea's attempt to itemize the 
special envoys' missions in seven points as an intent to hinder 
the ROK side from focusing on the nuclear issue." Commenting on 
North Korea's suggestion to add to the envoys' mission 
discussions on how to preserve national independence, the 
article notes "North Korea added this condition to put pressure 
on the ROK side by raising the issue of U.S. troops stationed in 
the ROK and to use this as a card during the future North 
Korean-U.S. talks." The article concludes "such being the case, 
chances are slim that the special envoys will be exchanged 
before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks." 
  The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries 
an 
800-word editorial entitled: "How Long Do We Have To Be Dragged 
About by the North?" Pointing out North Korea's insincere 
attitude to evade the envoy exchange by presenting two 
additional demands on the envoys' mission, the editorial calls 
on the government "not to vacillate or hasten negotiations. Our 
side should make it clear to the North that practical 
discussions on the envoy exchange is a precondition for the 
third round of U.S.-North Korean talks, which the North longs 
for." The editorial condemns the North for always putting 
forward "preposterous conditions after reaching an agreement in 
principle" and predicts that North Korea will make further 
attempts to "gain more concessions," while repeatedly putting 
forward additional conditions. The editorial warns the ROK 
Government not to get entangled in North Korea's foot-dragging 
tactic and calls on the government "to convince the U.S. side 
that the North Korean-U.S. talks should be suspended until the 
North and the South reach an agreement on the pending issues." 
  The editorial concludes: "If North Korea continues to put 
forth additional conditions for the envoy exchange, our side 
should demand that the North disclose its position on its real 
intention for the envoy exchange." 
  The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean carries on 
page 2 a 900-word article reviewing the thorny conversations 
between the two chief delegates, adding that a tense air 
surrounded the contact. The article adds that the chief 
delegates held private talks for 20 minutes after the contact, 
but ROK delegate Song declined to give more details. 
  The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean carries on page 2 a 
900-word article by Yu Sung-u and the conservative Seoul TONG-A 
ILBO in Korean carries on page 3 a 1,000-word article by Pak 
Chae-kun. Both articles review the conversations between the 
two delegates and describe the atmosphere at the talks as tense.
