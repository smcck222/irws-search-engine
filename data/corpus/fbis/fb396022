  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korean 
Chondo-kyo [religious organization] delegates met in Beijing on 
Thursday morning and agreed that 15 North Korean Chondo-kyo 
delegates would attend ceremonies taking place in Seoul on March 
21 to mark the centenary of the Tonghak peasants uprising. 
  An official at the Seoul's Chondo-kyo headquarters said that 
at the Beijing meeting, the two sides decided to adopt a joint 
statement at the Seoul ceremonies and to discuss procedural 
matters at Panmunjom on North Koreans' coming to Seoul. 
  He said, however, that it is not certain if North Koreans 
could attend the Seoul ceremonies because the Seoul government 
plans to allow the two sides' Panmunjom contacts to discuss 
procedural matters only when the exchange of special envoys is 
realized. 
  The Beijing contact was attended by Pang Chin-kyo, 
Chondo-kyo 
chairman, and Hong Chang-hwa, an official of Chondo-kyo College, 
from Seoul, and Yu Yong-mi, chairman of the North Korean 
Chondo-kyo Central Committee. 
  Materialization of North Korean delegates' visit to Seoul 
would depend on the outcome of the South-North contact slated 
for coming Saturday [12 March] at Panmunjom on the issue of 
exchanging special envoys, the official said.

  [Text] Japan's KYODO news agency reports from Beijing on 9 
March that in the upcoming Chinese People's National Congress 
meeting, the government action report that Premier Li Peng will 
present is supposed to mention China's friendly relations with 
North Korea first in its foreign policy division, thereby 
stressing the complete restoration of North Korea-China 
relations. 
  KYODO reported this citing Chinese sources, and said that 
while China's top priority last year was on the development of 
Sino- Japanese relations, the order of priority has changed this 
year. 
  KYODO said that China will list North Korea-China friendly 
relations first on China's priority list in Premier Li Peng's 
foreign policy action report apparently to proclaim the complete 
restoration of Sino-North Korean relations which have cooled off 
since the establishment of Sino-ROK relations in August 1992.

  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea recently 
reshuffled a number of economy-related ministers, suggesting a 
drastic change in its economic policy, NAEWOE press, the 
official North Korea watcher here, said on Wednesday. 
  Change may be forthcoming given that Pyongyang appointed 
Hong 
Sok-hyong and Kong Chin-tae as State Planning Commission 
chairman and vice premier, respectively, about two months ago, 
according to NAEWOE. 
  Four ministers were also replaced recently -- the forestry 
minister, Academy of Sciences president, mining industry 
minister and chairman of the State Commission of Science and 
Technology -- by unknown figures, NAEWOE said. 
  North Korea established a new Commission on Protection of 
the 
Environment last February, but its Chairman Yi Kon-il was 
replaced by Hwang Sang-chun recently. 
  The exact reason for the ministerial changes is not known, 
NAEWOE said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
introduced a minimum wage system for foreign-invested 
enterprises to prepare for possible foreign investment in the 
future. 
  The system, however, appears to offer little incentive for 
foreign companies seeking to invest in North Korea on the 
strength of its cheap labor, as the minimum wage set for 
foreign-invested firms is much higher than the country's general 
wage level. 
  Late last year, North Korea's Administrative Council 
established a labor regulation laying down standard labor 
practices for foreign-invested firms, according to the Korea 
Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA). 
  The regulation, consisting of 48 articles in eight chapters, 
provides a minimum wage level and procedures for employing, 
dismissing and punishing employees and for settling labor 
disputes at foreign-invested firms. 
  In Article 26, the regulation stipulates that the minimum 
monthly wage paid by foreign-invested firms shall not be less 
than 220 won (about 100 U.S. dollars). 
  This minimum wage level for foreign-invested firms compares 
with monthly pay of 30 to 50 dollars for ordinary North Korean 
workers and the 73-dollar minimum monthly wage for workers in 
the free trade zone. 
  KOTRA officials say the higher minimum wage for 
foreign-invested firms will hinder the Stalinist country's 
efforts to attract foreign investment. 
  The regulation also provides that joint-venture firms with 
foreign equity investment shall give priority either to workers 
of North Korean partner companies or to those recommended by the 
relevant employment office when they hire workers -- another 
stumbling block to active foreign investment -- according to the 
officials. 
  Foreign firms operating in North Korea have previously set 
working conditions for their employees through negotiations with 
their North Korean partners or North Korean government 
authorities.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles from ROK vernacular papers published on 10 March on the 
U.S.-ROK trade meetings held on 8 and 9 March and the annual 
trade policy report released by the U.S. Trade Representative, 
USTR, on 8 March. 
  The independent-moderate Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN in 
Korean, which focuses on economic issues, publishes on page 2 a 
1,000-word article by Yi Tong-chu reviewing the ROK-U.S. trade 
meeting. The article reports the United States had a much 
stronger tone than in previous meetings in its demands and that 
the meeting was held amid worry and concern over the effect of 
the Super 301 restoration on the ROK. 
  The article says our government had been optimistic that the 
meeting would focus on "the development of general cooperation" 
but the U.S. side extinguished that optimism by "raising 
individual subjects, such as the protection of the intellectual 
property right, IPR, and further opening of the motor vehicle 
market." 
  The article reports the United States demanded strengthened 
regulation on software reproduction and revision of our revised 
IPR regulations in the IPR sector; and lower tariffs, lower 
domestic tax, and amendment of automobile taxes in the motor 
vehicle sector. 
  The article reports that in response to the U.S. demands, 
our 
side explained that we are strengthening investigation of 
copyright violations and asked the United States to drop the ROK 
from the priority surveillance list for the IPR and advocated 
our position that the ROK has already made substantial tariff 
cuts on motor vehicle imports. 
  The article concludes that the meeting only reconfirmed the 
two sides' positions and predicted stronger trade pressure from 
the United States. 
  The MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 300-word 
article by Washington correspondent Kim Kyong-su on the USTR's 
annual trade policy report. The article reports "the USTR 
positively appraised ROK's contribution to a successful Uruguay 
Round, but urged early implementation of laws to protect 
patents, trademarks, and copyrights." 
  The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 5 
a 1,000-word article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok 
on USTR's annual trade policy report. The article reports that 
the USTR reported the ROK has taken positive action in lowering 
tariffs on agricultural and manufactured goods, but stressed 
continued pressure on the IPR and motor vehicle sectors. 
  The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean publishes on 
page 8 a 500-word article on USTR's annual trade policy report. 
The article also reports that "the USTR positively appraised 
ROK's opening effort, but urged improvement in the IPR and motor 
vehicle sectors."

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Kyong-won, president of the Social Science </F>
Institute: "Korean-U.S. Relations Without Anticommunism"] 
  [Text] "Korea offers the worst investment conditions for 
foreign businesses." "The Korean people distrust all 
foreigners." "The Korean Government does not want foreign 
corporations that have invested capital in Korea to succeed in 
business." These are the American complaints often heard these 
days. In the latter half of the 1980's, when surpluses in 
Korean trade with the United States grew, the United States 
strongly pressured Korea to open its markets. 
  There is a critical difference in the American mood between 
now and then. In the 1980's, the United States had called on us 
to open the market under the premise that the two countries 
would continue to maintain a close alliance. Now what it says 
is different. It now makes a brave show of nerves, saying that 
if Korea should ever reject American businesses, they would 
depart Korea, for there are many other countries welcoming them, 
for instance, China, Vietnam, and so forth. 
  They say that if Korea does not want to maintain close U.S. 
relations, they would be compelled to regard the Korean-U.S. 
alliance ties maintained to date just as "a chance occurrence in 
history, and that there is not necessarily any reason for 
maintaining the alliance ties any longer." 
  Why have things turned out like this? The most important 
reason, in my view, is that communism has fallen and the Soviet 
Union has collapsed. Up to now, Korean-U.S. alliance ties have 
been based on the common perception of threat -- they were both 
facing a "communist threat." 
  Of course, the Korean-U.S. security relationship is still 
maintained as it is because of the threat from North Korea. 
From a long-range viewpoint, the fall of world communism has 
rendered anticommunism meaningless, and Korean-U.S. relations 
without anticommunism have made new "adhesives" necessary. 
Unlike in the past, the United States, in particular, is now in 
the position that it has to regard economic interests more 
seriously than military considerations. For this reason, it is 
looking for a new bonding agent in its economic relations. 
  How should we cope with this situation? First of all, we 
should consider where the most important interests lie. Russia 
is roaming amid confusion; China is growing at a horrible speed, 
and Japan is now standing on the crossroads of maintaining the 
existing situation or reform. At this point, the United States 
is the only superpower in the world and is located outside the 
Northeast Asian region. In what shape should we build our 
relations with the United States to make them most conducive to 
the political independence and survival of our nation in the 
future? On this question, we should form a forthright, 
clear-cut, national consensus. Otherwise, our foreign policy 
will become adrift without any distinct direction and economic 
and national security policies will be in danger of conflicting 
with each other. 
  To state the conclusion first, it is essential for Korea to 
maintain relations with the United States, the superpower 
outside the region, although it might be important to keep 
relations with Northeast Asian countries. The Republic of Korea 
needs a geopolitically steady balance of power in Northeast 
Asia. Without U.S. participation, a stable balance is 
impossible in today's circumstances. There is no denying that 
Korea needs the United States. 
  Second, we must seriously think about the economy. Our 
self-reliance does not dictate that we should reject, based on 
emotionalism, whatever is called for by a great power. That is 
not our national identity either. 
  When foreign businesses create employment opportunities 
here, 
is that indeed a minus factor for us? If Korea should close the 
market only to protect domestic industries, could such a 
protected industry be competitive with foreign business 
corporations in the world market? Will it be possible for us to 
develop high technologies, which require enormous sums of 
investment capital, ourselves? The economic "space" called 
China is now increasingly broadening to an extent hardly 
imaginable. To make inroads into that economic sphere, will it 
not be to the advantage of our businesses to establish strategic 
ties with American businesses? 
  If the answers to those questions are that we also need 
American businesses, we should open the door to the Korean 
economy on our own, without waiting for the U.S. calls. Before 
opening the markets, we should resolutely carry out "change and 
reform," without wasting time, in order to change those things 
that need changing first. 
  Finally, we should explain our position to foreigners 
fairly, 
squarely, and clearly in a straightforward manner. If we decide 
to open the door, we should also explain if we need to make 
necessary preparations for market liberalization. Importance is 
attached to some indirect and implicative expressions in the 
Oriental culture. In the West, particularly in the American 
culture, we need to bear in mind that clear-cut and direct 
expressions are taken seriously. 
  There is no mistake that building new Korean-U.S. relations 
without anticommunism will be one of our most difficult tasks 
ahead. I believe, however, that it will be the most worthwhile 
work. Our relations with the United States based on 
anticommunism had been inescapable, but were not necessarily 
desirable. Now both Korea and the United States have finally 
come to participate jointly in the positive work for prosperity 
and freedom.

  [Text] The Government has permitted Alexander &amp; 
Alexander, 
a U.S. insurance company, and Willis Faber &amp; Dumas, a British 
insurance company, to establish agents in Korea, the Ministry of 
Finance said yesterday. 
  The permission was granted on condition that they close 
their 
existing representative offices in the nation, the ministry said. 
  When the insurance companies obtain approval from the 
government after completing the procedure of investment by 
foreigners, they will be able to establish agents who are 
allowed to sell policies issued by domestic insurance companies. 
  The agents are required to conclude contracts with domestic 
insurance companies to sell policies on their behalf. But the 
agents are not allowed to sell policies issued by foreign 
insurance companies, the ministry said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- Trade, Industry and 
Energy Minister Kim Chol-su and his Romanian counterpart 
Cristian Ionescu agreed Thursday to hold the first meeting of 
the Korea-Romania Joint Economic Committee as soon as possible. 
  In their meeting, Kim proposed that Romanian industries set 
up subsidiaries and stage goods fairs here while Ionescu, who is 
visiting with Romanian President Ion Iliescu, suggested that the 
two countries exchange trade delegations and private-sector 
visits in a bid to narrow the current trade imbalance. 
  Seoul sold goods worth 80 million U.S. dollars to Bucharest 
and imported products worth 6 million dollars to record a 
74-million-dollar surplus last year.

  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has decided 
to scale back tariff concessions on nine industrial items in its 
list of Uruguay Round commitments due to be submitted to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on Friday. 
  The Economic Planning Board presided over an international 
policy meeting Thursday and decided to impose duties of 3 
percent to 4 percent on the nine industrial imports rather than 
abolishing them, as agreed earlier with the United States in the 
GATT-sponsored negotiations last December. 
  In its country schedule, Washington also scaled back tariff 
concessions recently on the grounds that Japan and the European 
union had failed to make comparable offers. 
  Subject to 3-percent duties are three copper products -- 
tube 
or pipe fittings of copper and alloy, stranded wire copper 
cable, plated bands and the like. 
  Under 4-percent tariffs came computer equipment -- input and 
output units, printers, monitors and cathode-ray tube terminals 
-- and semiconductor devices -- piezoelectric crystals and 
crystal vibrators. 
  With the changes, Korea presented non-tariffication offers 
on 
965 manufactured items instead of the initial 974. 
  The United States had proposed abolishing tariffs on some 
electronic, non-ferrous and wood products last December but, 
rebuffed by Japan, it submitted smaller tariff concessions in 
the industrial section at the GATT on Feb. 28, a Finance 
Ministry official said. 
  Seoul, accordingly, decided to offer tariff cuts instead of 
none on the same nine items that Washington had scaled down, he 
said. 
  It again followed Washington in setting rates, levying the 
same 3 percent tariffs on copper goods as the United States and 
other major countries and slashing the current 8-percent duties 
on electronic goods 50 percent to 4 percent, as was done by the 
Americans. 
  Together with its agricultural country schedule, Korea will 
submit the revised list of industrial offers to the Geneva-based 
GATT headquarters on Friday. 
  The schedules of every country undergo screening until March 
21, and those drawing complaints from concerned exporting or 
importing countries will have to go through extra consultations. 
  Seoul officials say they will actively participate in the 
screening process to protect their country's interests. 
  Once the screening is finished, the overall Uruguay Round 
accord -- whether it is revised from the Dec. 15 version or not 
-- will be signed at a ministerial meeting in Morocco in April.

  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government on Thursday expressed its regret over the recent 
Amnesty International (AI) report that human rights conditions 
have not improved in some sectors in South Korea under the new 
administration. 
  Ham Myong-chol, the Foreign Ministry's director-general for 
international organizations, said the government's regret was 
contained in a message it delivered to the Amnesty International 
through the Korean Embassy in London. 
  The government pointed out in the letter it was not 
desirable 
that AI published such a report at a time when follow-up 
measures were being taken in the country to better institute the 
democratic system. 
  "It seems that AI was not fully aware of the new 
government's 
democratization policies and that it observed Korea's human 
rights conditions from the past's biased point of view," Ham 
said. 
  He said it was especially regrettable that AI prepared the 
report based only on the statements by those involved and their 
families. 
  The official said the instances cited in the report were 
cases of actual law violations such as espionage activities. 
"There can be no political prisoners nor any acts of torture in 
Korea since the birth of the civilian-led government," Ham said.

  [Text] The Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] 
revealed today the arrest of Yi Pok-hon, 32, who, following 
orders from North Korea, had conspired with an international 
criminal group to remove [chego] figures engaged in anti-North 
activities abroad after he received terrorist training in North 
Korea. The NSP requested an arrest warrant for him on a charge 
of violation of the National Security Law [NSL]. 
  When he was placed on the wanted list on charges of fraud in 
1990, Yi went to Malaysia and joined the international criminal 
group Asia Sharon, which is involved in drug smuggling and 
contract violation. He is under suspicion of visiting North 
Korea six times. 
  The NSP reported that during his visit to North Korea, Yi 
was 
warmly received by Kim Chong-il and received an order from (Choe 
Sung-kap), a leading member of the Committee for the Peaceful 
Reunification of the Fatherland, to remove Pak Kap-tong and Yi 
Sang-cho, who are carrying out anti-North activities, by winning 
over the head of a South Korean gangster organization. 
According to the North Korean order, he was engaged in 
conspiracy [amyak]. 
  The NSP also reported that Yi arranged the sale of North 
Korean weapons to 50 Asia Sharon members in June 1993 to assist 
them in special military training [tuksu kunsa hullyon] in North 
Korea. Thus, he served as a channel between the international 
criminal group and North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- A South Korean man who 
had allegedly been working for North Korea abroad was arrested 
by the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) on Thursday. 
  The spy suspect was identified only as Yi Pok-hon, age 32. 
  An NSP official said on Thursday Yi fled the country in 
April 
1990 soon after he was placed on a wanted list on swindle 
charges. 
  Later in September 1991 he joined the "Asia Sharon," a 
criminal organization, based in Dacca, Bangladesh, and worked 
for North Korea while at the criminal ring, the official said. 
  Yi is suspected of having entered North Korea six times from 
April 1992 through November 1993 to receive espionage training 
and instructions. 
  The official said he was first picked up by North Korea in 
April 1992 when he called at the Pyongyang Embassy in Bangkok to 
solicit its help in giving shooting training to "Asia Sharon" 
gangsters. 
  The instructions he received from North Korea were to 
assassinate anti-Pyongyang Koreans abroad and win over bosses of 
organized criminal rings in South Korea. 
  The NSP official said Yi gave 1.5 million dollars to North 
Korea for giving military training to "Asia Sharon" members and 
also supplied some espionage items such as forged passports, 
visa cards and traveler's checks to Pyongyang. 
  He is further alleged to have arranged a contract for the 
sale of 500 million dollars' worth of North Korean weapons to a 
guerrila organization in a Southeast Asian country. 
  Yi was arrested by public security authorities of China on 
last March 8, deported to Korea and was carried away by the NSP 
on arrival at Kimpo Airport.

<F P=106> [By reporter U Chong-chang] </F>
  [Text] How will the Agency for National Security Planning 
[NSP] change after the revision of the NSP Law? 
  This happened one year ago, at the time of the NSP 
investigation into the "South Korean Workers Party Incident." 
NSP anti-Communist investigators set out, unarmed as always, to 
arrest suspected spies. It is said that even though clearly 
aware of the fact that the suspects were armed with pistols 
brought in from North Korea and metal pipes with 30-cm blades, 
the investigators went empty-handed. 
  Why did they do this? The reason is simple. It was a silent 
protest against the social climate in which if during the arrest 
process a suspect happens to be injured, he is suddenly treated 
as a "champion of democracy." "So what if he fires his gun. He 
only has a few rounds in it. If you're unlucky and you get hit, 
you die...this was the mood of the anti-Communist team at that 
time," said one investigator. 
  This is an example showing the image of the NSP one year 
ago. 
A year has passed since then and the situation is worse now, say 
NSP personnel. A year ago, they could work even if it meant 
being prepared to take a bullet. Now, however, things have grown 
so bad they have to worry more about being "prison bound" than 
work, they say. This is because prison sentences are clearly 
stated in the penal regulations of the revised NSP Law. 
  Since the passage of the NSP-Law Reform Bill in the National 
Assembly last 7 December, NSP personnel have lost heart and 
their morale has dropped. However, they all sympathize with the 
"broad principle" that the NSP must change, casting off its old 
image. Thus, they seem not to be particularly dissatisfied with 
the revision of the NSP Law itself. 
  Since the birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration, however, 
due to the fact that the NSP's own reform efforts, centered 
around NSP Director Kim Tok, are not acknowledged in political 
circles and to the adoption of inequitable penal regulations 
effecting only NSP personnel, they are saddened on the one hand, 
and worried about the enormous psychological burden they will 
have to bear in the investigation process on the other. 
  The main framework of this revised NSP Law tied the hands of 
the NSP in two stages. The first greatly reduced NSP 
jurisdiction; the second called for penalties heavier than those 
given to ordinary public servants when, due to an abuse of power 
by NSP personnel, there is an infringement of civil rights or 
involvement in politics. Representative of this reduction of 
NSP jurisdiction are the establishment of an Intelligence 
Committee, the abolition of security-inspection authority, the 
prohibition against involvement in politics, and a reduction in 
investigative authority. 
  The establishment of the Intelligence Committee signifies 
the 
birth of a genuine surveillance organization of the legislature 
for keeping watch on the NSP. To makes its appearance after the 
revision of the National Assembly Law, the Intelligence 
Committee, by its function of examining the NSP's budget, can in 
actuality observe all NSP activity. 
  Security-inspection authority has been understood as the 
NSP's "means of control" over the various ministries and offices 
of government and organizations at each level. With the 
disappearance of this jurisdiction, the NSP lost its influence 
over these organizations. With the expansion of the prohibition 
against participation in politics, no NSP employee may be 
involved in any political activity, such as support for or 
obstruction of the formation of political parties or entrance 
into such parties, or support for or obstruction of a specific 
political party or specific politician. With the reduction of 
the NSP's investigative authority, investigations into the 
crimes of encouragement and praise of the enemy 
[komuchanyangjoe] and negligence, provided for by NSP Law, will 
be handled by the public prosecutor's office. 
  Of these, the establishment of the Intelligence Committee, 
abolition of security-inspection authority, and prohibition 
against political involvement are included in the revisions to 
the law made by the NSP itself. They are also part of the 
self-reform being pursued by the NSP since NSP Director Kim Tok 
took office. 
  Actually, since the appointment of Director Kim Tok, the NSP 
has been walking the path of transformation by the large-scale 
reshuffling of its organization and adjustment of its 
operational direction. Unlike former presidents, after taking 
office President Kim Yong-sam has made clear on several 
occasions that he would prevent the NSP from carrying out 
political operations. 
  The NSP's abolition of the Intelligence Coordination and 
Deliberations Council [Chongbo Chojong Hyopui Hoe], known as the 
"Council for Countermeasures on Agencies Concerned [Kwangye 
Kigwan Taechaek Hoeui]," was one change made following the 
president's intentions. Misunderstood as organizations 
exclusively responsible for political surveillance, some 
"associated bureaus" were eliminated during the agency's 
reorganization. The number of nationwide branch offices, set up 
separately from province and city branch offices, was also 
greatly reduced. 
  Since the security-inspection authority provided room for 
criticism, the over 200 organizations subject to such authority 
was greatly reduced to over 100. To cast off its bad name of 
being a veiled organization, a public information office was 
created within the NSP. In its Public Service Center, phone 
lines were opened for dealing with various civil appeals 
connected with the NSP. 
  Through this series of self-reform measures, the NSP was in 
the middle of transforming from the negative "power-agency" 
image of the past to a new one as an "intelligence agency." 
These NSP efforts are all included in the NSP Law Revision Bill 
laid out by the government ruling party, said the NSP director's 
special aid on legal affairs Cho Man-hu. 
  "The government ruling party's bill on NSP-Law reform was 
prepared by the NSP itself," said Cho. "The purpose of the 
revision is to give the NSP jurisdiction as an intelligence 
agency directly subordinate to the president, but to prevent the 
misuse of power." Cho also said, "As proposals for blocking the 
abuse of authority, the regulation against the infringement of 
civil rights and the article calling for control by the National 
Assembly's Intelligence Committee were put there by the NSP," 
and, "The parts about abolishing security-inspection authority 
and punishing personnel who have become involved in politics 
were also first proposed by the NSP." 
  "Isn't the call for unconditionally heavy penalties for the 
wrongful exercise of authority and political involvement of only 
NSP personnel, despite this, a severe legal inequality?" 
countered Cho. For the most part, NSP personnel are 
disinterestedly accepting the reduction of their authority, but 
concerning the penal regulations on wrongful use of authority 
and political involvement, they are very perplexed. 
  It is a well-known fact that the NSP and its predecessor, 
the 
Korean Central Intelligence Agency, were able to wield unlimited 
power as the highest power organizations not because of the law, 
but because of a problem of administration. It is true that, 
because "the interests of the president were the interests of 
the NSP director," the NSP has moved centered around one man, 
the ruler. NSP personnel came to be involved in politics and to 
abuse their authority to protect a regime with a weak support 
base. 
  The revised law, however, requires a maximum of seven years 
confinement for NSP personnel involved in politics and a maximum 
of seven years confinement for wrongful exercise of authority. 
This is some five years longer than penal codes applying to 
general public servants, says Cho. Also, in the case of 
political involvement, even if personnel do not directly involve 
themselves in politics, the law requires that they be punished 
if only traces of involvement are found. It even calls for the 
punishment of attempted political involvement. The morale of NSP 
personnel cannot help but drop. 
  These are the articles that will have the most influence on 
the NSP's future activities. There is a strong probability that 
political involvement being a crime will restrict intelligence 
collection and that the wrongful exercise of authority is 
dealing a psychological blow to anti-Communist investigations, 
worry NSP sources. 
  These are the words of special assistant Cho Man-hu: 
  "The NSP must not be involved in politics. However, 
intelligence collection is a normal NSP activity. The NSP is 
being vilified for the wrongs of past governments, but after 
taking office, Director Kim Tok has prohibited NSP personnel 
from entering other organizations and has eliminated bureaus 
associated with politics. With the opportunity provided by the 
birth of the civilian government, a mood is forming centered 
around Director Kim Tok, in which NSP personnel want to do 
right. We led the revision of the NSP Law as well. But many are 
secretly disappointed because of the penal regulations. However, 
the NSP should not be a burden to the nation or the president. 
So, although unsatisfactory, I believe we have no choice but to 
accept it. I'm sorry for our personnel, but the only words we 
have to give them concern principle: `Please work with a sense 
of mission, with a feeling of being reborn.'" 
  Another area to be influenced every bit as much as 
intelligence collection is anti-Communist investigations. The 
newly created regulations on the wrongful exercise of authority 
prohibit illegal arrest and confinement and call for confinement 
of up to seven years for the violation of this. For cases in 
which a person was not allowed to see a lawyer, the notification 
of arrest was not made, or a person was prevented from seeing 
family, the regulations call for confinement of up to one year 
or a 5-million-won fine. 
  One anti-Communist investigator explained the difficulty of 
anti-Communist investigations this way: 
  "The persons arrested by the NSP are high-level, hard-core 
criminals. Because they generally use assumed names, even if 
they are arrested, usually only their faces and the fact of 
their crimes is known, not their names and addresses. A long 
time is required just to verify their identities, such as taking 
finger prints and sending them to the police to learn their 
names. This is why aliases rather than true names are used in 
the espionage incidents reported by the NSP. According to the 
revised NSP Law, notification of arrest must be made immediately 
and violations are punished by up to a one year's confinement. 
How is it possible to notify someone when you don't know the 
arrested person's name or address? 
  "It also calls for punishment if a subject's right to see a 
lawyer and family is infringed. If a lawyer or family member 
comes to visit, but just leaves after waiting for a while and 
then accuses the investigator in charge of not allowing them to 
visit, an investigation into the matter is neglected while the 
investigator is up till dawn being accused and charged. If we 
permit a subject to see a lawyer without any justifiable reason, 
regardless of the time, we can't even carry out an investigation 
properly. It is my understanding that in general criminal 
investigations as well there are times when the subject is not 
permitted to see a lawyer. I believe there is a problem with 
indiscriminately making public an investigation into political 
offenses such as espionage." 
  There is a high probability that the revised NSP Law will 
limit the activity of NSP personnel due to the strictness of its 
penalties, he says. However, just because the NSP-Law Revision 
Bill passed the National Assembly does not mean that the NSP 
will change right away. It must be followed by the revision of 
associated legislation, such as the National Assembly Law, for 
establishing an Intelligence Committee and must afterward be 
officially announced by the government to have authority. 
  "Having been dragged out seven years, beginning in 1987 when 
the opposition had a majority in the National Assembly, we 
actually feel unencumbered now that the NSP Law has finally come 
to an end," react some NSP personnel to the NSP-Law revision, 
"We hope the NSP will no longer be brought up by the political 
sector as an object of denunciation." 
  How will the NSP change in the future? 
  "With the improvement of its manpower-management system, the 
specialization of its staff, and the reform of its operations to 
make them scientific as core tasks, we will directly link all 
the NSP's capabilities with the national interests and security, 
developing the NSP into an institution of the people," said 
special aid Cho Man-hu, "We will do our best to develop the NSP 
into an organization which is loved by the people and which 
concerns itself with the national interests, into an advanced 
intelligence agency living and breathing among the people."

<F P=106> [By reporter Im Ho-chun] </F>
  [Text] The half-joke-half-serious phrase, "the future will 
be a police era," is circulating among those in the intelligence 
field. There is a high probability that the police will surpass 
the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] and Defense 
Security Command [DSC] in intelligence capability and that an 
era will come when police information is treated as the "highest 
class" intelligence. 
  This talk is not circulating because the police's 
intelligence capability, that is its collection, analytical and 
interpretation capabilities, is better than other agencies. It 
is because, confronted by an era of civilian government, the 
activities of the NSP and DSC, long exercising tremendous 
influence, have been relatively reduced. 
  "Can police intelligence continue like this?" -- words 
casually dropped by Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u after his 
appointment as minister. The words of Minister Choe became 
widely known in political circles and there are many people who 
interpret them as instructions to strengthen police intelligence 
capability. Those in police intelligence were also greatly 
encouraged by this one statement. 
  In connection with this statement, there are those who 
ponder 
the fact that last year the National Police Administration 
created a new position in its Intelligence Bureau: Intelligence 
Analyst. Some look at this and speculate, "The police have gone 
into full-scale research to strengthen their intelligence 
capabilities." Although the duties of the intelligence analyst 
are not yet known in detail, attention has focused on the fact 
that at a delicate point in time, a senior superintendent, with 
the rank of police-station chief, was put in the position. 
  One thing to be considered carefully in connection with the 
reduction of the activity of the NSP, considered the highest 
intelligence agency, is the activation of the Telecommunications 
Secrecy Protection Law. Actually, it is no secret that a 
considerable portion of the NSP's intelligence collection 
depended on wire tapping. 
  In an inspection of Korean Telecommunications by the 
National 
Assembly's Transportation and Communications Committee held 
October 22 of last year, Democratic Party lawmaker Yi Yun-su 
divulged, "The NSP has exclusive use of 9,000 telephone 
circuits. Of these, over 5,000 are used for eavesdropping." 
  Rep. Yi demanded that they "reveal precise details," but 
Korean Telecommunications representatives equivocated, saying, 
"We don't yet have a grasp of it." "Considering that the police 
have only 885 dedicated circuits and the DSC has only 383, 
although both have similar intelligence duties, this supports 
the view that the NSP depends for a considerable portion of its 
intelligence on wiretapping," insisted Rep. Yi. 
  The intelligence activities of the NSP were dealt a fatal 
blow last year when the Telecommunications Secrecy Protection 
Law passed the National Assembly. The decoration of the pages of 
daily newspapers by articles entitled, "NSP Employees Stop 
Work," is not unrelated to this. "It's not that we have stopped 
work altogether, as they are saying on the outside, but it is 
true that morale has dropped considerably," said one NSP source, 
indirectly conveying the mood within the NSP. 
  The DSC, which stirred up a controversy because of its 
surveillance of civilians, already cut off its arms and legs 
last year. Beginning with a sudden change of the DSC commander, 
the DSC reorganization led into the abolition of its 
intelligence office (Office II), which was responsible for 
intelligence collection against civilians, together with the 
movement of municipal and provincial-level security units to 
within military bases. Also, over 400 veteran intelligence 
agents who had been working in rear areas were moved to forward 
areas. The DSC is now powerless in any arena other than 
national-defense-related intelligence. 
  Such variables external to the police thus encourage the 
idea 
that, as far as intelligence goes, this is the "era of the 
police." 
  In the vicinity of Seoul's Sogang University and in front of 
Ehwa University, there are several offices with signs reading, 
"Council" [as published]. In their names, these offices do not 
fit in with the mood of a university neighborhood. 
  These offices are actually intelligence offices subordinate 
to the Police Administration's Intelligence Bureau: they collect 
various kinds of information tied in with politics, economics, 
and the college area. The Police Administration has three such 
offices within Seoul. The entrance to the National Assembly 
building and political party buildings are also the 
responsibility of police officers belonging to these 
intelligence offices. The police's intelligence organization is 
this broad. 
  Police intelligence activities tie the nation together as 
with a spider's web. Those active in the front lines of 
intelligence collection are the intelligence-section detectives 
of each police station. Also, taking responsibility for one 
police box each within their respective jurisdictions, they 
gather information on important figures living in their areas 
and public opinion within their jurisdictions. Thus, they in 
fact have every quarter of the entire country covered. 
  The police station intelligence department is divided into 
Intelligence Sections I and II. Pure intelligence-collection 
activities are the responsibility of Intelligence Section II. 
Although there are places with less than ten police officers, 
20-30 detectives are active for police stations in areas of 
Seoul with concentrations of major organizations and in areas 
near universities. 
  Information collected at each police station is sent to the 
municipal or provincial police intelligence-management 
department. This once again goes up to the National Police 
Administration, where the administration's intelligence analyst 
interprets information based on this. 
  Even apart from this intelligence system with its vertical 
organization, the National Police Administration, municipal and 
provincial police also have separate, horizontal organizations. 
The Seoul Municipal Police have an Intelligence-Management 
Department with Intelligence Sections I and II. Other municipal 
and provincial police also have similar structures. The 
Intelligence Bureau within the Police Administration has 
Intelligence Sections I through IV. This is the place that 
epitomizes nationwide police intelligence. 
  Intelligence Section I is responsible for general affairs; 
Section II, for collecting information on politics; Section III, 
on economics and society; and Section IV, on academia and 
religion. Intelligence Sections II, III, and IV manage 
Intelligence offices 1, 2, and 3 respectively. It would not be 
far off the mark to say that the entire public is confined 
within the police intelligence network. 
  Besides this, the police even have officers dispatched to 
the 
Blue House, NSP, DSC, the courts, and public prosecutor's 
offices. Of all government departments, the police have the 
greatest number of government workers dispatched to other 
places. Although not attached to duty, there is even a 
designated person responsible for the media. 
  However, this does not mean that police intelligence has 
tremendous influence. Although its collection capability is 
outstanding, it has been considered to be relatively behind in 
its analysis and interpretation capabilities. "Police 
intelligence is rock-bottom intelligence: a collection of all of 
the most detailed but trivial information," said one 
intelligence police officer, "Accessing high-class information 
is not an easy thing." 
  Let us look at an example. There was a police officer in his 
fifties working at the Namdaemun police station in Seoul. He has 
now moved to a different police station within Seoul, but many 
people remember his activity when he was in charge of the 
Samsung Group as a member of the intelligence section. As an 
intelligence-section "detective," his rank was not that high, 
but there was not a Samsung Group director who did not know his 
name. This was because concerning internal information on the 
Samsung Group, and particularly information about the movements 
of the group's head, he was the quickest and most knowledgeable. 
  Among the intelligence he collected was information unknown 
to even the NSP, the leader of intelligence agencies. Long 
"frequenting" the Samsung Group headquarters, it was possible 
for him to collect even trivial information on things such as 
the exchange of the air purifier in the C.E.O.'s office. 
However, his activities never got him much credit. The 
information he collected was, in a word, fragmentary. Police 
analytical capabilities were unable to thread this voluminous 
information together to make a product. Even if they could have 
been said to have made a "product," it was always behind that of 
the NSP and DSC. This is because the police intelligence of the 
Fifth and Sixth Republics had no influence. 
  The main reason the police were unlikely to access 
high-class 
information and so could not help but fall behind the NSP, was 
"money," say sources associated with police intelligence. "The 
NSP pours out bundles of money. Naturally, high-class 
information follows," said one police-intelligence source. 
  Concerning the question, "Will a time come when the police 
surpass the NSP and DSC in intelligence capability?" present 
theories are unlikely to give a clear answer. This is because, 
although there are clear signs of this, there is still no 
movement in that direction. 
  "I have not heard a concrete commitment from Minister Choe 
concerning the strengthening of police intelligence 
capabilities," said Senior Superintendent General Yi Su-il, the 
National Police Administration's Intelligence Bureau Chief. "It 
is only speculation based on various circumstances. There have 
been no concrete efforts taken within the Police Administration 
to improve its intelligence organization and it is technically 
impossible to change an intelligence organization in a day." 
  "The establishment of the position of Intelligence Analyst 
was only a separation of the existing intelligence-analysis 
personnel," said Yi. "It is unrelated to movements to 
strengthen intelligence capability." 
  However, one source associated with the police said, "The 
attempt by President Kim Yong-sam and Minister Choe Hyong-u, 
representative victims of the past abnormal intelligence 
activities of the NSP and DSC, to strengthen the legal 
intelligence activities of the police in conjunction with an era 
of civilian government is only natural." The source also said, 
"Internally, the police will be deliberating on proposals now." 
  "The quality of intelligence has a deep correlation with 
money," said one National Police Administration source, "even if 
there are efforts at improvement, because if there is no budget 
support the results will not be remarkable." "Even if it 
changes, it won't change much in a short time," he forecasted. 
  Always crowded out by the NSP and DSC, even while having the 
most massive organization and number of personnel of the three 
intelligence agencies, the police now appear to be gradually 
gaining strength. One police officer said, "Within the limits of 
what is not damaging to the public, intelligence collection must 
proceed, appearing to be and not to be at the same time."

  [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- Han Chu-sok, former Air 
Force chief of staff, was released from jail Thursday as the 
Seoul High Court, taking his confession into account, commuted 
his sentence to a suspended three-year term plus a fine of 160 
million won. 
  The retired general had been condemned to five years' 
imprisonment and a fine of 160 million won at a lower court 
after being convicted of taking bribes in connection with Yulgok 
military modernization projects. 
  Presiding Judge Ko Hyon-chol said the court was commuting 
his 
sentence after finding that his voluntary appearance before the 
prosecution and confession to graft, even though it was not 
fully detailed, was tantamount to self-surrender. 
  He thus became the fifth of seven senior military officers, 
accused last spring of alleged graft related to the Yulgok 
project and promotion in the military, to be released with a 
suspended sentence in the appellate court in light of their 
confessions. 
  Four others are former Defense Minister Yi Chong-ku, former 
Naval Operations Chief of Staff Gen. Kim Chol-u, former Air 
Force Chief Chong Yong-hu and former Marine Corps Commandant Cho 
Ki-yop. 
  Of the two others, former Defense Minister Yi Sang-hun was 
released on suspended sentence in a lower court. Only former 
Chief of Naval Operations Kim Chong-ho remains jailed after 
being sentenced to three years' imprisonment at his appeal.

<F P=106> [By Song Yong-chol and Kim Chang-hyok] </F>
  [Text] "Senior Paek, I'm waiting to see how you get 
Minister Choe Hyong-u under your control." 
  These are the words, said half in jest, of Rep. Kang 
Sam-chae, who moved from the position of Policy Coordination 
Office II Director to Director of Planning Coordination with the 
reorganization of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] which 
followed the cabinet reshuffle in December of last year. 
  The person he called "Senior Paek" is Rep. Paek Nam-chi, who 
switched places with Rep. Kang to be appointed director of 
Policy Coordination Office II. This is the position with overall 
control of DLP-government deliberations on noneconomic sectors. 
  Rep. Kang and Rep. Paek have worked closely together in the 
Democratic-Party faction, which could also be called the 
chinjong [the home of a married woman's parents. This refers to 
the remnants within the DLP of the Democratic Party of which Kim 
Yong-sam was head until his "marriage" with the Democratic 
Justice Party and Republican Party to form the DLP] of President 
Kim Yong-sam. Rep. Choe Hyong-u, appointed home affairs minister 
in the cabinet reshuffle (former secretary general), is their 
senior in the Democratic-Party faction. 
  Was Kang showing that he thought that if Minister Choe were 
"under control," there would be no problems in their 
relationships with other ministers? Was he encouraging Paek not 
to be daunted just because added to the stern Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang there was now an influential home affairs minister? Or 
was it a joke coming from his composure, the result of a 
stabilized relationship between the party and the 
administration? Maybe it was all three. 
  Actually, not that long ago, soon after President Kim took 
office, the relationship between the DLP and the administration 
was more than a little shaky. There were many occasions when 
senior government officials would go to the DLP headquarters on 
Youido for party-government deliberations only to leave 
embarrassed at the resentful scolding given them by the party 
side. This was particularly severe for officials of the health 
and education ministries, which experienced many scandals such 
as the herbalist-pharmacist dispute and college-entrance 
examination irregularities. 
  With the passage of time, however, the once up-in-the-air 
relationship between the DLP and the administration is 
experiencing a soft landing. Government ministries and offices 
are faithfully going through the process of party-government 
deliberations and some "powerless departments" have actually 
come to use party-government cooperation to depend on the party 
for policy momentum. 
  President Kim's intentional care played a big part in bring 
about this change. Before approving important cabinet policies, 
President Kim would ask, "Has this gone through party-government 
deliberations?" The administration's posture changed markedly as 
this became more frequent, according to a DLP source. 
  President Kim may have his own reasons for thus setting out 
to ensure "party-government cooperation." This is said to be 
because Kim is from a minority faction of the ruling party. 
Thus, the situation cannot be the same as one in which a 
majority-faction president would inherit power from a past 
administration. 
  As the influence of the DLP grew owing to the care of 
President Kim, the relationship between the party and the 
government grew stable. Only last year, measures supplementing 
the financial real-name system were taken under the leadership 
of the DLP, to include a revision of the Enforcement Ordinance, 
built around a relaxation of excess-profit taxes on real estate, 
and the issue of long-term, low-interest, unregistered bonds. 
  The early party-government relationship was much dependent 
on 
the "comradely solidarity" of Democratic-Party-faction members 
in the party and the cabinet. Although it was not carried 
through, First Minister of State for Political Affairs Kim 
Tok-ryong, Director of Planning Coordination Paek Nam-chi, and 
Policy Coordination Office II Director Kang Sam-chae's putting 
their weight behind the progressive labor-management policy of 
Labor Minister Yi In-che is one example of this. This year too, 
Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u and Political Affairs First 
Minister So Chong-won are leading party-government cooperation 
together with Directors Kang and Paek. 
  Recently, however, even some not belonging to the 
Democratic-Party faction have started to participate in 
party-government cooperation. Party President [PP] Kim 
Chong-pil, in a formal meeting with the Yi Hoe-chang Cabinet 
after the party and government reorganization late last year, 
called the attention of the government side to the DLP's 
position, stressing, "After President Kim's five-year term is 
over, it will be the ruling party, the DLP, which is judged for 
the results of his management of the government. 
  Once every week, PP Kim meets with President Kim to report 
on 
operations and to see to President Kim's requests. The mood of 
this weekly meeting is completely different from that of the 
weekly meetings between PP Kim Yong-sam and President No Tae-u 
during the Sixth Republic. There was tension in the meetings 
between President No and PP Kim, but the present President 
Kim-PP Kim meetings have changed, showing a completely vertical 
relationship. 
  In the relationship between the Blue House and the DLP, at 
first, the Blue House had control of everything. Now, for most 
important policies, the Blue House determines direction, the DLP 
supports this, and the administration follows behind. 
  Political-reform bills, such as the Integrated Election Law, 
the Political Party Law, and the Political Funding Law, 
presently undergoing negotiations between government and 
opposition parties, were created based on President Kim's ideas 
on an "election that does not take money." Late last year when 
the regular session of the National Assembly was adrift due to 
the budget and the autumn-harvest-grain problem, the DLP laid 
out a compromise bill on the Agency for National Security 
Planning Law, bringing the National Assembly back to normal. It 
is said that this was done following the ideas and at the 
request of the Blue House. 
  Contrarily, there were many cases in which the DLP intended 
to do something, but had the brakes put on by the Blue House. 
The DLP Special Committee for Social Reform and party officials 
presented proposals, such as the abolition of the up-myon-tong 
system, a prohibition of government-service employees from using 
private vehicles to commute to work, a reform of the reserve 
armed forces system, and a proposal to make use of the Yongsan 
War Memorial, only to be reprimanded by the Blue House for "not 
even giving thought to the plausibility of realizing" them. 
  In this process, voices began to be heard pointing to the 
runaway leadership of the Blue House and to the powerlessness of 
the DLP. "In the past, there were many bureaucrats in the Blue 
House, and members of the administration-transition team were in 
the minority. Therefore, its leadership of the party was weak. 
Now, however, a considerable number of the 
administration-transition team and many from the DLP are in the 
Blue House. Thus the inner mind of the president is silently 
conveyed to the DLP," explained one Blue House source concerning 
this. 
  As examples of this, the source brought up the fact that 
since President Kim took office, the number of events to which 
party officials are called has grown considerably and that a 
large number of Blue House figures participated in this year's 
DLP New Year's celebration. 
  DLP channels within the Blue House are Chief Secretary Pak 
Kwan-yong, Chief of Political Affairs Yi Won-chong, and 
Party-Government Affairs Secretary Yun Won-chung, all from the 
DLP. Chief Secretary Pak and Secretary Yi deal with the three 
main leaders, Secretary General Mun Chong-su, Policy Committee 
Chairman Yi Se-ki, and Assembly Floor Leader Yi Han-tong. 
Secretary Yun generally deals with mid-level party officials.

<F P=106> [By chief editor Chong Mun-hwa] </F>
  [Text] Active during the 1970s and 1980s in the front lines 
of the nationalist-democratic struggle against the military 
regime, former People's Party [Minjungdang] [PP] Policy 
Committee chairman Chang Ki-pyo was released in early November 
after completing a one-year jail term for "negligence" in 
connection with the "Yi Son-sil Incident." In view of his 
relative importance and influence in opposition circles, the 
course of action Chang Ki-pyo takes is predicted to have 
considerable influence on the nationalist-democratic movement 
and on the problem of making a political force out of the 
opposition camp. 
  In 1989, during his time in the National Democratic Alliance 
of Youth and Students, Chang Ki-pyo seriously raised in the 
students movement the issue of transforming the opposition into 
a political force, giving birth to the PP. With its failure in 
the 1992 general election, however, the possibility vanished for 
the PP to be an independent political force of the opposition. 
In his very first interview after being released from prison, 
Chang Ki-pyo showed a strong attachment and intention to build 
an independent political party uniting all the opposition, and 
set up the construction of a "new, progressive, 
political-party-oriented political organization" as his 
immediate task. 
  I met with Chang Ki-pyo in his Tongjak Cultural Center 
office, which he created as a base for regional activity when he 
ran for office as a PP candidate in Kap-ku, Tongjak in 1992. 
There I heard his perceptions on the domestic situation during 
this transition period and his ideas on the progress of the 
nationalist-democratic movement and the problem of making a 
political force out of the opposition. 
  [Chong Mun-hwa] First of all, in the opposition movement 
too, 
people are evaluating the reform policies of Kim Yong-sam's 
civilian government in a variety of ways. What is your 
evaluation of these reform policies? 
  [Chang Ki-pyo] The series of reform measures carried out 
by the Kim Yong-sam administration after its inauguration, 
forcing the military to withdraw from politics, the 
personal-assets registration of senior government officials, the 
implementation of the real-name financial system, the refusal of 
the Blue House to accept political funding, and so on, were 
immensely well done. These were epoch-making measures which 
liquidated the vestiges of the military dictatorship. Some, 
including the media, criticize this as a one-man show without 
the support of the legal system, but that is not appropriate. In 
a nation with a president-centered system, it is right for the 
president to boldly carry out reform. The National Assembly 
began last year, but what reforming has it done? There had also 
been a public servants personal assets registration law before, 
but because the presidents were not determined to carry it out, 
it was never put into practice. The series of reform measures 
was just and it is excessive criticism that really impedes 
reform. 
  Overall, the Kim Yong-sam administration's reform has great 
significance and should be highly evaluated historically. It is 
regrettable that the media, opposition parties, politicians not 
presently in office, and so on, are not supporting the Kim 
administration's reform as they should and are not leading it 
into an even deeper reform. 
  [Chong] Although it is a fact that the Kim administration's 
reform has contributed to the consolidation of procedural 
democracy, some criticize that the administration is 
strengthening an anti-masses stance with its delay in amending 
labor law, its conglomerate-centered, economic-growth policy, 
and its opening of the rice market. What do you think of this? 
  [Chang] From a political standpoint, I think the Kim 
administration will further the reform. As for economic 
problems, however, I don't think it will be able to solve them. 
Hence, it seems that the administration will have a hard time 
gaining continued public support. Early on, the administration 
intended to induce economic growth by correcting the 
conglomerate-based economy, but it changed this to a 
conglomerate-centered policy. For the solution of economic 
problems, there must be technological development through 
guaranteeing business and worker autonomy and educational reform. 
  Concerning farm and labor issues, it is not right to 
identify 
the Kim Yong-sam administration with the military governments of 
the past. I don't even think the response of the administration 
to the labor-management dispute in Ulsan this year was a bad 
one. The struggle of the Ulsan workers is just, but they should 
have controlled themselves. Only then can there be progress in 
both the labor movement and the reform. The Labor Law must be 
revised, but the efforts of those in the labor movement are 
lacking as well. The nationwide struggle to obstruct the opening 
of our rice market is significant, but we must consider policy 
on the assumption of an opening. History is developing in the 
direction of globalization; the world is becoming a global 
village. 
  [Chong] Since the birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration, 
the influence of the nationalist-democratic movement is 
receding. How do you evaluate the present stage of the movement 
and in what direction do you think it must go to overcome this? 
  [Chang] At present, the opposition is not much supported 
by the public. People commonly say that this is because it is 
radical and excessive, but this is not an appropriate analysis 
of the causes of the problem. The core of the problem is that 
the opposition is unable to present a good alternative. The goal 
which has long been presented by the opposition is the 
withdrawal of the military dictatorship; their ideological 
alternative was reflected in a socialist society in which 
ideological workers and farmers were the masters. The former has 
been achieved; the latter has already been confirmed as being 
unrealistic. The movement has no goal. It is unable to present 
alternatives for even everyday problems. If it is to present 
good alternatives, it must have new ideology. Some in the 
movement are still clinging to Chuche Thought or 
Marxist-Leninism. Therefore, they are unable to get public 
support. Only when they gain a new sense of the developmental 
stages of world history and develop a new ideology and policy 
befitting it will they will be able to gain public support. Past 
socialist ideology is a product of the 20th century. The 
conservative-progressive concept of former days has already been 
superseded as a standard of measure. Also, the 
neo-conservativism represented by Reganism and Thatcherism 
failed as well. A new, progressive ideology can come out of an 
accurate analysis of the developmental trends of modern society. 
  The developmental trends of modern society are toward 
globalization, toward an information society, and toward a mass 
society. A recognition of the fact that knowledge is the main 
dynamic of production demands of us a tremendous change. 
Technology is important and we must have educational reform. The 
sovereignty of the masses demands pluralization and 
decentralization. There must be a change in our fundamental 
understanding of the developmental trends of world history. 
Having this sense of world history, a new, progressive ideology 
should be set up under the following five fundamental principles. 
  First is the realization of a democracy based on the 
sovereignty of the masses, the overall dissemination of 
democracy, and the realization of a communal democracy. Second, 
an economic system and labor process must be achieved which 
guarantees the self-realization of labor. Third is the 
establishment of a social security system with a new philosophy. 
Welfare policy must be productive and guarantee opportunity. 
Fourth, we must set up an environmental development strategy 
capable of symbiosis with nature. Fifth, we must prepare an 
international policy based on peace, cooperation, and common 
prosperity. We must escape from past international relationships 
of domination and exploitation. These five principles are 
universal worldwide. For our country, we must present plans for 
the unification of our people. 
  We must leave behind obligatory, emotional unification 
plans. 
Unification policy should be developed within the context of 
world history and a Northeast-Asian developmental strategy. 
Unification must be one in which the masses are sovereign. It 
must be democratic, peaceful, and creative. North and South must 
change in the process of unification. There must be an easing of 
tensions and a reduction of military spending. 
  What is important, together with the creation of a new, 
progressive vision, is that the form of "opposition" political 
forces is no longer appropriate. Institutional political forces 
must encompass the opposition. The opposition too must operate 
within the framework of the system. Institutional political 
forces and the opposition must play the game with one set of 
rules. The opposition must not concentrate on a competition of 
criticism, but on a competition of alternatives. We must compete 
with one set of rules and in one arena. We should become a part 
of the institutional political forces, not remain as an 
opposition political force. Social movements and political 
capabilities must be divided and reorganized into 
institutionalized political forces, citizens-movement forces, 
and class, mass-movement forces. 
  The opposition movement must take actions that are 
politically responsible. It must overcome the fact that it is 
understood by the masses as critical and constraining movement. 
It must be acknowledged as a political force responsible to the 
public. Aiming for political power, it must seriously develop 
ideology and policy and set out as a professional political 
force, capable of representing the political intentions of the 
people. It must form a new political force. 
  [Chong] Through what channels and with what methods will you 
form an institutional political force? 
  [Chang] That is a question to discuss and decide with 
members of the opposition movement. My personal thoughts are 
that the opposition is unlikely to build an independent, 
progressive party in the near future. Channels must be arranged 
for and preparations made. The opposition must carry out 
activities for which the public can have sympathy and show 
support. A minimum unit and framework is needed for this. If 
this activity works out well, there can be a large-scale 
expansion of participation by expert intellectuals. The 
opposition concept is not necessarily limited to 
nationalist-democratic-movement forces. It should comprehend all 
of society's talented who, while not of the established 
political sector, pursue a progressive vision with a positive 
determination to put theory into practice. For this, there first 
needs to be traffic direction within the camp of the 
nationalist-democratic movement. 
  A cooperative relationship with the Democratic Party [DP] is 
important for the political growth and development of the 
opposition. Only when the opposition has secured considerable 
independence through its activity and power will unity and 
solidarity with the DP become possible. The greatest objective 
of my activity, however, is for the opposition to create new 
alternatives, and so gain public sympathy and support. A new 
political organization is needed to change the content of 
opposition activity. Also, we have to go fundamentally in the 
direction of a political party. The strategy of creating a new 
party is efficient, whether in working out our relationship with 
the DP or for promoting a reorganization of politics. We will 
create a new political organization directed toward a new and 
progressive political party. This is right in principle, but it 
is also tactically desirable. 
  [Chong] Evaluations of PP activity have been unfavorable and 
attempts to form an independent, progressive party are 
repeatedly failing in the arena of real politics, how will you 
get your forces together? 
  [Chang] A common evaluation of the PP's failure is that 
the people will not yet support a progressive party. I do not 
agree with this evaluation. It was because of our shortcomings 
that we couldn't get support. The opinion that we were not 
supported because the political level of the public is low is 
erroneous. Antiquated progressivism won't work. We must 
reconsider it and give it new content. Lacking political 
ability, we were unable to inform the public of the true content 
of the PP. Another shortcoming was the severe friction within 
the PP. We failed because of our own shortcomings and those of 
the movement and PP. The public does have a problem. It is 
regional enmity. 
  Things will change a great deal in the future. Without a new 
progressive ideology, we cannot overcome economic problems, 
political distrust, and so on. Independently, a general 
consensus is being formed that the opposition must not continue 
in its present form. We can form ranks different from those of 
yesterday's PP. 
  [Chong] How are you going to overcome obstacles, such as the 
general perception that it would be difficult to create an 
independent party? 
  [Chang] In carrying out political party activities, the 
question of activity funding is also difficult. In the future, 
Labor Union Law Article 12 must be revised and the masses must 
participate in political activity. The most central problem is 
that we must present epoch-making alternatives and policy with 
which the people can sympathize. 
  [Chong] What do you think of the question of solidarity 
among 
the Popular Political Alliance [Minjung Chongchi Yonhap], which 
decided on the creation of a progressive political party, the 
Committee for the Promotion of a Progressive Political Party 
[Chinbo Chongdang Chujin Uiwonhoe], and others? 
  [Chang] I believe solidarity with forces espousing 
socialist ideology unlikely. 
  [Chong] What about solidarity with Chonguk Moim [National 
Gathering] president Kim Kun-tae, who is discussing the 
construction of a new political organization? 
  [Chang] In political ideology and policy, I believe that 
Kim Kun-tae and I think the same. If there is a difference, it 
is only the issue of an independent party. I believe it 
important for the opposition to establish itself as a political 
force distinct from the established political sector, as a new, 
progressive political force capable of squarely participating in 
a competition of visions with neo-conservativism. I plan to work 
with Kim Kun-tae. 
  [Chong] What do you think of the Yi Son-sil spy ring 
incident? 
  [Chang] The Agency for National Security Planning 
announced that Yi Son-sil was a North Korean spy. I had no idea 
Yi was a spy. I cannot understand this incident at all. The PP 
tends to be anti-Chuche Thought. I don't know how North Korea 
intended to approach us. The claim that North Korea did it is 
unbelievable and even if North Korea did it, I think it was to 
stop exchange between the North and South. Personally, I feel 
that my treatment was completely unfair. But as a main PP 
executive, I regret that I was unable to stop Yi Son-sil 
beforehand and I regret causing concern to the public and to 
persons who have cared for the PP.

  [Text] The nation's principal data network operator 
yesterday announced a trial service of new technology that will 
ultimately let customers send data through the air as easily as 
through phone lines. The announcement by Dacom kicks off a race 
for a market share among foreign and domestic equipment makers, 
as all major carriers are scurrying to tap the latest market 
service, known collectively as wireless data transfer. 
  The idea of wireless data transfer is to use radio waves to 
free traveling executives and other people on the go from having 
to plug laptop computers and other data devices into telephone 
lines. 
  "This marks our major initiative in the wireless data market 
as we expect a three-way race with Korea Mobile Telecom and 
Korea Telecom," said Dacom spokesman Yi Song-ki. 
  Dacom is installing base stations, or radio transmitters, to 
launch the trial service in a 5-km radius area around its 
Yongsan headquarters in Seoul by August. It plans another trial 
service in Taedok Science Town near Taejon. 
  Dacom's system, modeled after the Modacom service of 
Germany's Deutsche Bundes Post-Telecom, uses a wireless 
packet-switched messaging technique. A tall powerful radio 
transmitter sends data in short bursts known as packets. Each 
packet holds about three- quarters of a page of text (about 128 
English words). Longer transmissions are broken up and 
reassembled at the receiving end. 
  "The real advantage of our system is that we can rapidly 
establish a nationwide network through connections to our 
existing (wired packet-switched) Dacom Network Service," said Yi 
Un-tae, a manager at Dacom's technology development department. 
  "It will allow business people carrying easy-to-use wireless 
devices to move into new, unexpected places," he said. Dacom 
expects to offer a commercial service by the latter half of next 
year. 
  Just as Dacom is trying to steal the thunder in the domestic 
wireless industry, cellular monopoly holder Korea Mobile Telecom 
plans to launch its own digital messaging system by June, which 
would provide packet-switched data over its existing cellular 
channels. 
  Korea Telecom, the nation's state-owned public telephone 
operator, is working on its own wireless data system, officials 
said. 
  Although these networks are to operate in the same general 
radio- frequency range of 800 megahertz, their technological 
modes are different, so they require their own terminals. 
  Dacom customers would have to buy one of Motorola's 
palm-size 
messaging device InfoTac or bigger and higher-capacity PDT-220 
terminals. The prices are high: 2.15 million won for an 
InforTac terminal and 5.6 million won for a PDT-220. 
  A Korea Mobile Telecom subscriber would have to buy a $1,000 
wireless modem, the size of a cigarette box with a small 
protruding antenna, that snaps onto a notebook computer and 
allows data files to be sent over cellular telephone networks. 
  Officials expect the price of terminals to drop sharply as 
more and more customers sign on. No one is sure how big the 
market will be. The industry says there will be about 10,000 
subscribers by the end of next year. They foresee that number 
burgeoning to 100,000 to 500,000 by the end of the decade. 
  Dacom says one advantage of its system is that it is well 
tested in the market, while Korea Mobile Telecom's rival 
Cellular Digital Packet Data system is still an emerging service 
overseas. 
  Two public radio frequency systems similar to Dacom's are in 
operation in the United States: Ardis, a joint venture between 
Motorola Inc. and the International Business Machines Corp., and 
Ram Mobile Data, a partnership of RAM Broadcasting and BellSouth. 
  But Dacom says its system, with a carrying capacity of 
19,200 
bits of information per second, is much faster than Ardis' 4,800 
bits and Ram's 8,000 bits. 
  Korea Mobile Telecom's CDPD system, which also uses the 
clearer and faster digital format of ones and zeros of computer 
code, boasts the same transmission capacity as that of Dacom. 
It would allow a file containing a page and a half of text to 
be sent in one second. 
  Although wireless data is new and virtually unheard of here, 
companies hope it will thrive for some of the same reasons that 
have helped the domestic cellular industry attract half a 
million subscribers in its first nine years: it provides vital 
mobility to key people. 
  Here are some of the possibilities: Credit card companies 
would use wireless networks to authorize credit in places where 
a dial-up (wired) service is unavailable (taxi drivers, for 
example, would accept credit cards). Postal couriers would use 
hand-held terminals and a wireless network to accept signatures 
written with an electronic pen and to notify the company's 
package-tracking center. 
  Delivery services and car rental companies would depend on 
wireless networks to keep track of their packages or vehicles. 
A small set-top box on a vending machine would send out 
wireless messages telling its owner that certain products are 
out of stock. Airline ticket agents would come out from behind 
the counter to confirm tickets and assign seats for passengers 
standing in line at airports. Department stores would exchange 
price lists and sales figures instantly, making point-of-sale 
management possible. Police can check, on the spot, whether a 
number plate is on the wanted list in a computerized data base. 
  The wireless data transfer is the telecommunication 
industry's latest whispered promise that soon, and very soon, it 
will unite telephones and computers into a single wireless 
go-anywhere device.

  [Text] Brunei has confirmed that it is in favour of 
inviting Burma to an annual meeting of foreign ministers of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Bangkok in July, 
Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said yesterday. 
  Brunei believes the time is "appropriate" to invite Burma, 
Squadron Leader Prasong quoted Brunei Foreign Permanent 
Secretary Lim Jok Seng as saying. 
  Dato Lim conveyed the message from his foreign minister, 
Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, to Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong 
during a, 30-minute meeting at the Foreign Ministry yesterday 
Dato Lim is in Bangkok to attend a meeting of ASEAN senior 
officials, who on Monday agreed in principle to invite Burma to 
their foreign ministers' annual conference. 
  With Brunei's endorsement, Thailand's attempt to bring Burma 
out of isolation has won the support of all ASEAN partners, 
officials noted. 
  But Sqn Ldr Prasong acknowledged that ASEAN member states 
remain undecided as to whether to invite Rangoon as guest of the 
grouping, or to let Thailand issue the invitation as host 
country. 
  A Foreign Ministry official pointed out that Burma should be 
invited as Thailand's guest with the endorsement of other ASEAN 
members. 
  The Foreign Minister reiterated that the invitation would 
strengthen security in the region and encourage Burma to bring 
about political and economic reforms. 
  Meanwhile, a senior member of the military junta in Rangoon 
has met opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi Voice of America 
reported yesterday. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES quoted Intelligence chief Lt-Gen Khin 
Nyunt of the State Law and Order Restoration Council as saying 
that the meeting "produced nothing useful," VOA said in a report 
monitored.

Kumagai attended a meeting at a Tokyo hotel on the morning of 2 
March to exchange views with leading manufacturers of industrial 
machinery. Kozaburo Nishimura, chairman of the Japan Society of 
Industrial Machinery Manufacturers, said: "Since intensifying 
Japan-U.S. friction has resulted in the yen's appreciation, we 
are now faced with a difficult situation. Therefore, I hope 
efforts will be made to prevent Japan-U.S. relations from being 
impaired." Many participants called for steady implementation of 
the economic stimulus package. Concerning Japan-U.S. ties, 
Minister Kumagai stressed: "Japan should resolutely carry out 
whatever is achievable and settle economic problems existing 
between our two countries as soon as possible."

  [Text] Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation, attended the international steel trade conference 
held in Washington in late February. On his return home, he 
held a news conference on 1 March, and, speaking in fairly high 
spirits, Saito said: "In front of American manufacturers, I 
denounced in strong terms their inappropriate law suits against 
Japan for dumping iron and steel products." 
  On the issue of setting macroeconomic targets to help reduce 
the trade surplus -- which the Japanese Government rejected -- 
Saito reiterated that "he, personally, thought such targets 
should be presented." 
  Saito seemed to be satisfied with the results of the 
meeting, 
which was attended by senior executives of American and European 
steel makers. 
  He said: "Some of the participants from Europe and the 
United States supported our assertion." Saito reportedly handed 
out copies of his draft speech to the U.S. Commerce Department 
and other agencies in an effort to win the understanding of U.S. 
Government officials on the stand taken by Japanese makers. 
  Since an antidumping tax is imposed on surface-treated steel 
plates, one of the main Japanese steel plate products, such 
plates are no longer exported to the United States. At the 
Washington conference, Saito said: "Since the United States 
itself decided that Japan was doing nothing wrong in its export 
of heat-stretched and cold-drawn steel plates, we have resumed 
the export of these products. Although the market conditions 
for these products is on the advance now, slow changes have been 
seen in the prices of surface-treated steel plates." 
  Saito's comments revealed that he believes the charges 
against Japanese makers of dumping are simply groundless. 
  It is questionable, however, as to how far Saito's arguments 
have affected the American steel industry. And Chairman Saito 
himself was not so sure about the effects, because he appeared 
to be trying to convince himself when he said: "Without giving 
up our hopes, we must take advantage of such opportunities to 
speak out."

  [Text] According to Seoul Radio, on 9 March the South 
Korean puppet vice foreign minister made the absurd remark 
[tangchi anun chapsorirul chechyossumnida] that it is unclear if 
the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks will be held, mentioning the 
nuclear inspection and North-South dialogue. 
  As has already been reported, an International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] inspection team started inspections of us on 1 
March, according to an agreement reached in DPRK-U.S. contacts 
in New York, and our country's organizations concerned are 
cooperating in the inspection team's activities. 
  Our position is to sincerely implement agreements regarding 
the IAEA inspections to guarantee the continuity of nuclear 
safeguards. Despite this fact, the puppet vice foreign minister 
said that the agency's inspections of us are unsatisfactory. 
His remarks are indeed extremely absurd and preposterous. 
  The puppet vice foreign minister also said that the 
South-North dialogue is not going smoothly. If we have to say 
something about this, we can say that the South is entirely 
responsible for this. 
  In the fifth working-level contact for an exchange of 
special 
envoys of the North and South, the South side, instead of 
expressing a clear attitude toward our side's principled demand 
before discussing practical problems, made preposterous 
sophistries that our demand creates obstacles and that it is 
unnecessary, thus creating obstacles to the discussions of 
problems. 
  The South side even deliberately raised an issue that has no 
relation to the discussions of the practical procedure and 
blemished the atmosphere of the talks, assuming an extremely 
provocative attitude. 
  The puppets are now saying that the North-South dialogue is 
not going smoothly, after they themselves created deliberate 
obstacles to working-level contacts. This is no more than 
avoiding their responsibility. 
  Never should it go unnoticed that the puppets keep insisting 
that progress in North-South dialogue is a precondition for the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  As we have already elucidated, in the agreement reached at 
the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, it only mentions the 
resumption of working-level contact for the exchange of special 
envoys of the North and South as one of the steps of 
simultaneous action [tongsi haengdong chochi]. There is no 
indication about the realization of the exchange of special 
envoys. 
  The two sides of the DPRK and U.S. did not agree to the 
steps 
of simultaneous action with something as a precondition. The 
reason that the puppets are continuously babbling about some a 
precondition is ultimately to create an artificial barrier to 
put the brakes on the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. This is 
nothing but a nasty scheme. 
  This is being vividly proven by the fact that the so-called 
puppet vice foreign minister confessed that consultations are 
being continuously carried out with allies, including the United 
States, on the issue of referring the North Korean nuclear issue 
to the UN Security Council. 
  Under the pretext of dialogue, the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique 
is pursuing behind the scenes the anti-Republic maneuver of 
isolation and suffocation under the international cooperative 
system [kukche kongjo cheje]. This will ultimately only lead to 
the road of pressing for destruction.

<F P=106> [By Jerry Esplanada] </F>
  [Excerpt] Fort Del Pilar, Baguio City -- President Ramos 
yesterday said rightist extremists were still dividing the ranks 
of the Armed Forces [of the Philippines] and trying to derail 
the peace process. Speaking before this year's 224 graduates of 
the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) here, the president said, 
"There are still those among us who -- instead of helping to 
rebuild -- offer the counsel of reaction and retreat, who want 
to stop reform by fair or foul means." Mr. Ramos said he was 
referring to people who were pushing for a "short-cut change 
outside of our constitutional system." 
  Defense Secretary Renato S. De Villa also said rightist 
groups were "creating an atmosphere not conducive to the peace 
process." De Villa cited recent press statements issued by the 
Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance [as published] and the Young 
Officers Union (YOU) criticizing graft and corruption in the 
government. 
  Peace negotiations between the government and rightist 
rebels 
have stalled over several issues, including disagreements on the 
"talking points." In the government's program of rebuilding and 
reforming society, Mr. Ramos said, "Our Armed Forces must be the 
bedrock of support to government." 
  In the face of the "confusion of the times," he urged the 
PMA 
1994 Class, called "Watch-Force," to "talk of programs for 
growth, not coups and military adventurism. We debate policies 
and reforms, not who does what to whom, and when we look at the 
world, we think of catching up, not of falling farther behind," 
he said. 
  Mr. Ramos, however, cited several hopeful signs that the 
country was moving toward peace. Most of the brightest rebels, 
he said, "are now realizing that the battle of ideas is best 
fought in the hearts and minds of our people, and not in urban 
centers turned into bloody battlefields." 
  Mr. Ramos also predicted that the 25-year communist 
insurgency would soon collapse. He said the country had regained 
its internal political stability and was in a position to 
achieve high economic growth. "The communist insurgency will 
soon end altogether," he said. "Our brothers in the hills, who 
waged war under a failed concept of revolution, are coming to 
see the practical wisdom of working together for peace." 
  Mr. Ramos was apparently referring to the several thousand 
New People's Army guerrillas whom officials said had applied for 
amnesty under a reconciliation policy he launched after taking 
office in 1992. 
  The military has estimated the present strength of communist 
rebels around 8,000, from a peak of more than 25,000 in 1987. 
Officials have said more than 40,000 people, mostly civilians, 
have died in fighting between government forces and rebels since 
the Marxist insurgency began in 1969. 
  Mr. Ramos also said Muslim rebels in Mindanao "are seeing 
that talking peace and development are better alternatives than 
violent secession." 
  He also stressed that all over the world, military forces 
"are redefining their missions to put people's protection, 
relief work and conservation of the environment on par with 
combat duty." 
  "The AFP's [Armed Forces of the Philippines] concurrent 
mission of community development and environmental protection 
possesses the attributes most conducive to economic development 
and nation building," he said. 
  Mr. Ramos also stressed the need to begin the long-term task 
of modernizing the Armed Forces to meet the needs of the new 
time. "Though the Cold War is over, our strategic importance in 
our Asia-Pacific region remains, and we must be prepared to meet 
both the challenges and opportunities this strategic importance 
confers," he said. 
  Mr. Ramos asked the new AFP officers to be "models of social 
responsibility'' and "paragons of citizenship." He also reminded 
them "never to mistake an increase in personal wealth and power 
as a replacement for growth in moral strength and character. Our 
country will ask you always to place integrity above careerism, 
honor above self-interest, loyalty to country above loyalty to 
individualism and class," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bangkok -- The commerce minister said it is 
necessary for Thailand to have the agreement on garment trading 
with the USA to help the private sector in terms of exporting 
the products which come under the current garment controlling 
quotas. Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon said the agreement 
will be signed if the US approves Thailand's demands and 
conditions. 
  "The discussion will be going on as long as the US cannot 
agree on the conditions. We propose to set up the quotas," he 
said. 
  Uthai said Thailand will emphasize exporting high quality 
products. He added that the import tax structure on raw 
materials will be reduced so that the production cost will be 
considerably lower, allowing Thailand to compete with foreign 
countries. 
  President of the Thai Garment Industry Association, Wirot 
Amatakunchai, said that even though the world garment trade will 
enter free trade under the GATT agreement, and that in the next 
ten years the garment quota will be increased by 2.34 percent, 
it is still likely that the Thai garment industry, on the 
contrary, will encounter increased obstacles. 
  Wirot said Thailand now faced problems regarding the cotton 
price which has increased by 30 percent. He added, that it has 
been rumored that the price of cotton will be reduced by 30 
percent this year. 
  "Garment traders therefore try their best to keep the cotton 
in stock. The production cost in the meantime has increased by 
20 percent following the cotton price rise," he said. However, 
Wirot said it was expected that the situation will improve next 
month. Thailand now imports 80-90 percent of cotton used. Wirot 
made his statement during the seminar entitled "Summary on the 
Uruguay Round Trade Talks on General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) and the Repercussion on Thai Garments".

toward newly liberalized countries in the region. These 
countries are Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar [Burma], and Vietnam. The 
call was made by the Philippine delegation to the special

  Delegation head Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo 
Severino called on ASEAN to eventually accept these newly

said the inclusion of these four countries in ASEAN could 
prevent future conflicts and promote political stability and 
economic progress.

<F P=106> [By Jim Hatton] </F>
  [Excerpts] PHNOM PENH, March 10 (AFP) -- Government troops 
are in position to attack Pailin, the last Khmer Rouge 
stronghold, but have delayed the assault because of an emotional 
appeal for peace by King Norodom Sihanouk, a military spokesman 
said Thursday. "Our forces are based at the same positions of 
Sala Krau, 10 kilometers (six miles) north of Pailin, and 
Samlot, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Pailin, and along Road 
10," General Chum Chheang told AFP. 
  "We did not move our forces up because of the king's appeal 
recently that we and the NADK (Khmer Rouge) must stop fighting. 
So our forces are waiting for the order from the government," 
the general said in Phnom Penh. "I strongly believe that the 
Royal Cambodian Armed Forces have sufficient capability to 
capture Pailin if there is the order from the government," he 
added. [passage omitted] 
  Khieu Samphan, the nominal leader of the Marxist Khmer 
Rouge, 
issued a statement from his jungle base on Tuesday, accepting 
the monarch's proposal. [passage omitted] 
  But Chum Chheang cast doubt on Khieu Samphan's statement. 
The 
Khmer Rouge leader "never rejects the king's proposals, but he 
always practices the opposite," Chum Chheang said. "He always 
says this and does the other way." 
  Cambodian forces began first serious moves to take Pailin, 
some 300 kilometers (185 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh, last 
Saturday when they captured Sala Krau and Samlot and began 
advancing along Road 10. 
  In addition to the three-pronged assault, an elite unit of 
200 paratroops was stationed to the west of Pailin to cut off 
any retreat of the Khmer Rouge across the border with Thailand, 
some 10 kilometers (six miles) away. [passage omitted] 
  There had been unconfirmed reports that government forces 
had 
begun shelling Pailin with long range artillery, but Chum 
Chheang denied this. "I did not receive any report from the 
front line as saying government troops have started shelling," 
he said. 
  The general also denied Khmer Rouge accusations that the 
Cambodian government would buy guns with the money provided by 
the International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia, 
which began Thursday in Tokyo. "This is not true," Chum Chheang 
said. "We can not take development aid to buy guns." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> ["Rejection" issued by the National Army of Democratic </F>
Kampuchea spokesman on 9 March -- place not given] 
  [Text] I. On 8 March, AFP fabricated a deceptive report 
saying that the invading forces of the Vietnamese communist 
puppets and the two-headed government had captured certain areas 
in the Pailin region. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
[NADK] spokesman totally rejects this false report, which is 
based on the darkest and most unscrupulous political motives. 
  II. The Vietnamese communists and the Western alliance -- 
with France as the leading cat's paw -- are using the invading 
forces of their Vietnamese communist puppet lackeys and the 
two-headed government to attack the people and the NADK 
resistance in Pailin in order to allow the Vietnamese communists 
to swallow the Cambodian race completely and allow the alliance 
to incorporate Cambodia into its arena. AFP -- France's 
propaganda apparatus -- has stepped to the forefront by playing 
an active role in fabricating deceptive propaganda in its 
psychological war. 
  The general public is aware that ever since the creation of 
the two-headed government, France has urged other countries to 
assist the Vietnamese communists and their puppets and become 
directly involved in establishing [as heard] the two-headed 
government, so as to employ the latter in attacking the 
Cambodian nation and people and the NADK resistance in the 
political, military, economic, and propaganda fields. France 
has carried out these actions with the dream of furthering its 
neocolonialism in Cambodia. 
  III. The Vietnamese communists and the alliance have made 
all- out efforts to prod the Vietnamese communist invaders and 
the two-headed government in their military campaign against the 
people and the NADK resistance in Pailin in order to cover their 
most shameful and serious defeat on the Anlung Veng battlefield. 
So far, though, the invading forces are not even close to 
Pailin; much less having captured this or that area in the 
region. This is why their French masters have strived to invent 
this deceptive story -- to prevent their lackeys from being 
perceived as too inferior. 
  IV. Based on past experience as well as recent experiences 
on the Anlung Veng battlefield, the invading forces of the 
Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government -- 
mercenaries that are inflaming the war in accordance with the 
strategy of the Vietnamese communists and the alliance to oppose 
the king, national reconciliation, peace, and the Cambodian 
nation and people -- can never prevail over the national forces, 
the people, or the NADK resistance. They will certainly be 
defeated, dispersed, and decimated. As for the foreign 
warmongers, they will be severely condemned by the Cambodian 
nation and people, no matter what. 
  If France continues to collude with the Vietnamese 
communists 
to inflame the war, which is meant to do away with the Cambodian 
race, the Cambodian nation and people and the Cambodian national 
resistance forces will oppose and condemn it. On the other 
hand, if France joins the king and the Cambodian nation and

<F P=106> ["Rejection" issued by the National Army of Democratic </F>
Kampuchea spokesman on 9 March -- place not given] 
  [Text] I. On 7 March, the Hanoi Vietnamese communists 
ordered their lackey puppets in the two-headed government to 
claim once again that the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
[NADK] had used Thai territory to defeat them on the Anlung Veng 
battlefield. This is a dirty and base accusation; no one except 
the notoriously cunning Vietnamese communists could think of 
playing the trick of the thief shouting: Stop thief! 
  II. For what purpose did the Vietnamese communists order 
their puppets to level this accusation? It was based on the 
following: 
  1. Covering their most shameful and severe defeat on the 
Anlung Veng battlefield. The Vietnamese communists and their 
alliance have claimed various unreasonable pretexts to fool 
their lackeys into further inflaming the war to serve their 
strategic policies. 
  2. Covering the shipment of Vietnamese forces and armaments 
to Cambodia in accordance with what the Vietnamese communists 
call Cambodian-Vietnamese military cooperation, which they 
agreed upon with the puppet Chea Sim in Hanoi in early March. 
The Vietnamese communists have painstakingly implemented the 
strategy and tactics of launching attacks in western Cambodia 
and shipping Vietnamese men and women to the eastern part of the 
country. 
  3. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the NADK have 
always respected and will always respect the Kingdom of 
Thailand's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They have 
never done anything that affects the Royal Thai Government or 
the Thai people. The PDK and the entire Cambodian nation and 
people want to coexist peacefully with all neighboring 
countries, especially Thailand and the Thai people, who respect 
other countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity. The 
Thais are different from the Vietnamese communist puppets and 
the two-headed government, who -- relying on the Vietnamese 
communists and the Western alliance -- have implemented the 
policy of further inflaming the war, both inside and outside the 
country, and then denounced other people without any sense of 
responsibility. [Dated] 9 March 1994 [Signed] The NADK spokesman

<F P=106> [Interview with Chea Sim, National Assembly chairman and </F>
acting head of state, by an unidentified AKP correspondent; 
place, date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Recently, a high-ranking Kingdom of 
Cambodia National Assembly delegation headed by Your Eminence 
paid an official friendship visit to the SRV, the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR], and the Kingdom of Thailand. What 
was the outcome of these visits? How do you evaluate them? 
  [Chea Sim] First of all, let me express my most sincere 
thanks to you, the AKP special correspondent, for giving me a 
chance to inform the people of the outcome of this trip. It can 
be summed up in these words: Our delegation's visit to these 
three friendly countries was certainly very fruitful. Although 
it was the first of its kind, this trip made major and important 
contributions. First, it strengthened and expanded the bonds of 
friendship and mutual cooperation between our state and people 
and the states and peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand who 
share our common borders. Second, it opened a bridge of 
excellent cooperation between our legislative organ and those of 
the three neighboring countries. Third, it elevated our national 
prestige in the region and on the international stage. 
  As the messenger of the Cambodian people and a contributor 
to 
the defense and advancement of our nation's superior interests, 
our delegation did its best to accomplish everything with a high 
sense of responsibility in order to promote and encourage new 
developments in Cambodia's relationship with its neighbors in a 
new form and in line with the new regional and international 
trends. In this context, the talks and negotiations we 
conducted with the top leaders of the three countries enabled 
our delegation to hold consultations and exchange views in 
greater depth concerning all aspects of our bilateral relations, 
both present and future, which must proceed in a new and 
progressive form. 
  Our delegation sought to acquire a firm foundation capable 
of 
guaranteeing the durable interests of our country. All of these 
top leaders unanimously agreed that the existing traditional 
relations of friendship and mutual cooperation between our 
states and peoples must be further strengthened and expanded; 
good neighborliness is an important factor in the development of 
each country; mutual understanding, respect, and trust and a 
sense of solidarity must be based on respect for each nation's 
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and right to 
self-determination; and bilateral cooperation must be 
implemented on the basis of the principles of equality and 
reciprocal benefit. 
  As for problems that remain to be settled, we agreed that we 
will work jointly to solve them peacefully. This is the only 
good way to guarantee that the sense of good neighborliness will 
last. 
  Because of their geographical proximity to Cambodia, the 
three countries expressed their wish to cooperate with and 
assist Cambodia in its national rehabilitation on the basis of 
the principle of mutual help. This is an excellent fundamental 
line that will guide our future relationships. 
  At the same time, the top Vietnamese, Lao, and Thai leaders 
all affirmed their resolute support for peace and national 
reconciliation in Cambodia. They consider this to be not only 
an important factor for the stability and development of each 
country, but also a contribution to the strengthening of 
regional and international stability, friendship, and 
cooperation. 
  These prominent dignitaries reemphasized their respective 
countries' resolute and unwavering support for the Royal 
Government of Cambodia -- headed by His Royal Highness Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh as first prime minister and Samdech 
Hun Sen as second prime minister -- both in the rehabilitation 
and reconstruction of Cambodia and in the realization of 
Cambodia's national reconciliation. 
  The Vietnamese, Lao, and Thai leaders expressed their 
distinguished respects for His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk 
Varaman, our venerated monarch, and solemnly wished him a prompt 
recovery so that he could pursue his noble and historic royal 
crusade. 
  It should be noted that during our visit to these three 
countries, our delegation was accorded the great honor of 
meeting with all the top leaders of each country. For instance, 
in the SRV our delegation met with His Excellency [H.E.] 
President Le Duc Anh; H.E. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet; H.E. 
National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh; and H.E. Do Muoi, 
secretary general of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central 
Committee. In the LPDR we met with H.E. President Nouhak 
Phoumsavan, H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon, and H.E. 
National Assembly Chairman Saman Vignaket. In the Kingdom of 
Thailand, we met with H.E. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai; H.E. 
Dr. Marut Bunnak, chairman of the National Assembly; and H.E. 
Senate Chairman Michai Ruchuphan. Even better, our delegation 
was graciously accorded an audience with His Majesty King 
Phumiphon Adunyadet of the Kingdom of Thailand at the royal 
palace in Bangkok. 
  Aside from discussing bilateral relations, our delegation 
learned about and exchanged experiences on parliamentary work 
and other issues of importance to our country's development, 
such as agriculture, irrigation, industry, electricity, 
education, financial systems, and the market economy. 
  Our delegation also visited industrial estates, construction 
projects, bridges, and hydroelectric dams. It was an important 
opportunity for members of the delegation and of the nine 
National Assembly commissions to gain a better understanding and 
experience for future use in the service of the nation and 
people. 
  Concerning the relationship between our National Assembly 
and 
the assemblies of the three friendly countries, we agreed to 
expand mutual contact through exchanges of delegations at the 
top level and at the level of committees, representatives, and 
house secretariats. We exchanged documents to help promote the 
spirit of friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation 
between our states and peoples. 
  Based on this visit, we can draw the conclusion that the 
foundation of our National Assembly-to-National Assembly 
relationships has already been established. 
  It should be noted that the legislative organ of each host 
country accorded our delegation a great honor by arranging an 
excellent reception for us at a high protocol level. This 
clearly shows the common desire and wish for friendship and good 
neighborliness. Although the visit to each of these countries 
was brief, each had profound political significance and was 
replete with a great feeling of friendship and mutual regard.

accompanied by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas. During the 
occasion, Robaina conveyed Cuban President Fidel Castro's 
written message to President Suharto. 
  According to Alatas, the written message, among other 
things, 
clarified the itinerary of the minister's visit to Indonesia and 
other countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia. 
  During the meeting, Suharto briefed his guest on Indonesia's 
development program. On bilateral relations, Suharto said the 
Indonesian Government observes the principles of mutual respect 
of sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in 
internal affairs. He said bilateral cooperation based on mutual 
benefit could be developed through a desirable manner. 
  Meanwhile, in his clarification to newsmen, Robaina said 
that 
cooperation between the two countries will be upgraded. As such, 
it would be necessary to study sectors which need to be 
developed. 
  Robaina said the Cuban Government was satisfied with 
Indonesia's leadership as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement.

  [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said 
the recent visit by four Indonesian journalists to Israel is a 
source of much regret. The action was clearly contradictory to 
Indonesian foreign policy. The visit was premature and could 
send the wrong signals about Indonesia's diplomatic position 
toward the Middle East in general, and the country's endorsement 
of the Palestinian struggle in particular. 
  The minister said this when he received three of the four 
journalists at the Foreign Ministry office in Pejambon, Jakarta 
on Thursday, 3 March. The three journalists were from MEDIA 
INDONESIA, INDONESIAN BUSINESS WEEKLY, and EKSEKUTIF. The 
REPUBLIKA journalist was not present because he is still abroad. 
  As disclosed by the Foreign Ministry Directorate of 
Information on the afternoon of Thursday, 3 March, the three 
journalists clarified their reasoning and the background of 
their visit to Israel. They admitted that the Israeli 
Government hosted their stay, but they had to pay their own air 
fares. 
  Minister Alatas said that although their visit to Israel 
might be understandable from a journalistic point of view, on 
the other hand, it could have sensitive political implications. 
The visit was premature, and it is feared that Israel might 
take advantage of it to champion its interests, particularly in 
lieu of the agreement on the declaration of principles for 
setting up a provisional Palestinian government. 
  He said: "We welcome the declaration, but we should not be 
proceeding too far ahead or assuming that we will move rapidly 
toward a process of opening diplomatic relations. The journey 
is still a long way from finished, and any hasty moves could 
backfire on Indonesia and damage its interests." 
  Indonesia, as the most populous Muslim nation, is seen as 
having a major and important role in dealing with any particular 
international issue that could easily influence other nations. 
The foreign minister said: "Because of Indonesia's reputation, 
we can only change our position after a very cautious 
evaluation."

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The Armed Forces (ABRI) must be 
prepared to ensure a smooth transfer of power in the national 
leadership, Minister of Defense and Security Edi Sudrajat said. 
Edi told a military seminar on Wednesday that the national 
leadership succession will be one of the most critical issues 
facing the nation in the coming years, along with democracy and 
human rights. 
  ABRI's task will be to ensure that the transfer of power 
takes place in a constitutional manner, said Edi, a retired army 
general who headed ABRI for a brief period last year. This is 
the nearest admission by the military regarding the likelihood 
that President Suharto will relinquish power at the end of this, 
his sixth five year term in office, in 1998. 
  The ruling political organization Golkar [Functional Group] 
has declined to be drawn into the succession debate, saying that 
it was unethical, preferring to leave it until nearer the time 
of the next election in 1998. 
  Edi's statement followed remarks made by the incumbent 
himself that he had no intention of remaining president for life 
and that he would know when to step aside. Suharto is now 72 
years old. Edi also made the point in his speech on Wednesday. 
"Whatever happens, the national leadership succession process 
must get underway because the time has come for that." He 
expressed appreciation for Suharto's long service to the 
country, but pointed out that succession was inevitable because 
nobody could hold the post forever. 
  The remarks were made during a gathering of middle and 
senior 
ranking ABRI officers organized by the Army's Strategic Reserves 
Command, an elite force once headed by Suharto. The meeting was 
held to mark the command's 33rd anniversary. 
  Edi said in his speech that ABRI must continue to attempt to 
define its position and role in the nation, especially to ensure 
the success of the next 25-year long term development which 
begins on April 1. "ABRI always stands above the interests of 
all social, ethnic and religious groups," he said. "Its chief 
task is to maintain national unity and cohesion and it must 
fight for the interests of the people." 
  The military must play an active role in national 
development 
and set a positive example for the rest of society, he said. He 
warned that the problems facing the nation will become even more 
complicated in the coming years, but cautioned the military to 
remain loyal to its oath and motto. He also said that ABRI must 
continue to be loyal to the state ideology Pancasila and the 
1945 Constitution. History has shown ABRI's important role in 
the nation's life and this will remain true in the future, he 
added. 
  The minister also discussed the allegation that certain 
groups in society now seek to replace Pancasila with other 
ideologies, notably liberalism. 
  "We have to remain vigilant. History has shown that liberal 
democracy, which Indonesia adopted in the early 1950s, was 
doomed to failure," he said. "It does not fit with the nation's 
identity." He did not specifically name the groups but said that 
vocal opposition exists to the security approach to development 
and ABRI's role in politics. Edi said the government has no 
intention of loosening its security grip in the coming years 
because such an approach was still necessary to ensure 
development, economic growth and a more equitable distribution 
of income. The aversion of some people to security baffled him, 
he said, stressing that people are concerned with security every 
day.

  [Text] Today in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Commission 
heard the agreed declaration on East Timor. Indonesia agreed to 
take measures to release Timorese political prisoners soon and 
to allow special rapporteurs access to East Timor. We have 
Ramos Horta [resistance representative abroad] live from Geneva. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Are you satisfied with the 
agreed declaration? 
  [Horta] I am very pleased, obviously, although, as in all 
situations, an agreed declaration means concessions from both 
sides. The declaration does not condemn Indonesia for human 
rights violations in East Timor, but on the other hand, at the 
moment, it forces it to invite a special rapporteur -- 
responsible for investigating summary executions -- to visit 
Timor in June. It is also hoped that the rapporteur 
investigating torture and the working group for disappearances 
will visit before the end of the year. 
  [Correspondent] Does this declaration open the door for the 
release of political prisoners, as Indonesia has signed? 
  [Horta] I think so, I think so. 
  [Correspondent] Including Xanana [jailed Timorese resistance 
leader]? 
  [Horta] Yes, I believe so. It includes Xanana and other 
prisoners. I think that Indonesia will have to bring to the 
Geneva negotiations in May some concrete confidence-building 
measures. Indonesia will not be able to turn up empty-handed 
again, as it did in New York and Rome. Yesterday, I spoke on 
the phone to the UN secretary general's representative, who is 
mentioned in the resolution, and I said that now the secretary 
general also has the moral obligation of pressuring Indonesia 
into coming to the May negotiations with some concrete steps. 
  [Correspondent] Can I assume that you are optimistic that 
Xanana Gusmao will be released soon? 
  [Horta] Well, I am not optimistic or pessimistic. I hope 
that Xanana Gusmao and others will be released, because it is 
also in Indonesia's interest. There is a lot of pressure in 
Indonesia on Suharto not to give in regarding Xanana Gusmao's 
release, but Indonesia's international interests, its image 
abroad would improve a great deal if President Suharto were to 
make such a gesture.

  [Text] The Australian Government has opened tenders for the 
rebuilding of up to 16 medium span bridges in Cambodia in an aid 
project worth $8.5 million [Australian dollars]. The project 
followed the construction of six bridges along Cambodia's 
national Route-5 from Phnom Penh to the border with Thailand. 
  The federal minister for development cooperation, Gordon 
Bilney, said the latest bridge project matches Australian 
engineering expertise with Cambodia's development priority. The 
bridge rebuilding is part of a nearly $17 million worth of 
development projects Australia is funding in Cambodia this year. 
  Mr. Bilney also announced the $600,000 grant for credit 
scheme in Cambodia aimed at helping people at the village level 
start small businesses and agricultural schemes.

imposition of a curfew in parts of northern Bougainville. North 
Solomons Province Administrator Sam Tulo says the curfew comes 
following the murder of a police officer last week and an 
incident during which two rebels were shot dead. Mr. Tulo says 
all the attacks took place in northern Bougainville where rebels 
have stepped up action, particularly around the Wakunai 
government station. He says the situation is also tense in 
central Bougainville, where clashes between rebels and 
government troops have resulted in the death of one man and the 
wounding of four others.

  [Text] PORT VILA, March 8 (AFP) -- The opposition Vanuaaku 
Pati (VP) Tuesday rejected an offer to join the ruling coalition 
government saying it would not be getting enough ministerial 
portfolios. Last week the VP helped to elect Jean-Marie Leye, 
candidate of the main ruling party, the Union of Moderate 
Parties, president of Vanuatu after two earlier attempts had 
failed. 
  In return for this help in the electoral college vote, the 
VP 
asked for four ministries in the government, including the 
finance and lands portfolios. Later Prime Minister Maxime Carlot 
said the opposition party would get "at least two" ministerial 
portfolios. But government sources said the offer made in 
writing Friday by Carlot contained only one ministerial 
portfolio, labour and training -- which was to be created -- and 
two parliamentary posts, leader of government business and first 
deputy speaker. 
  VP coordinator Peter Taurakoto told AFP Tuesday that his 
party had refused the offer because it was not in line with the 
verbal "gentleman's agreement" between Kalpokas and Carlot. "The 
door is not closed and we're still ready to help if the 
government sees there is a need," Taurakoto said. 
  The ruling coalition government has 24 members in the 
46-seat 
house where the VP has nine members. 
  Leye was elected March 2 by 41 of the 55-member electoral 
college.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States will hold two days of regular talks on semiconductor 
trade in Hawaii in mid-March, a Japanese trade official said 
Thursday [10 March]. The March 22-23 talks will follow a 
meeting from March 16 that will focus on calculating the foreign 
share in the Japanese semiconductor market for the 
October-December quarter last year, said an official at the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
  Under a 1991 trade pact, Japan and the United States agreed 
to a 20 percent goal for foreign market share by the end of 
1992. In the final quarter of 1992, the foreign market share 
exceeded the goal, reaching 20.2 percent under a U.S. formula. 
  According to the U.S. formula, the foreign share since has 
been in a downward trend, standing at 18.1 percent for the 
July-September quarter last year. Under a separate Japanese 
accounting method, which includes chips manufactured in Japan by 
foreign companies for their own use, the foreign share had risen 
above the 20 percent level for three successive quarters from 
the final quarter of 1992, but fell to 19.7 percent in the 
July-September quarter last year. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has said he is 
concerned about the decline and insisted that Tokyo is not 
abiding by the bilateral trade agreement. It is viewed by the 
United States as a commitment but as a nonbinding target by 
Japan.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Sin Chang-uk] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that during inspection of 
Yongbyon, which began 3 March, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] inspection team discovered that some seals, which 
were installed by IAEA to confirm nuclear safeguards of nuclear 
facilities in North Korea, were destroyed. As a result, it is 
highly likely that considerable controversies will be touched 
off concerning the guarantee of transparency of North Korean 
nuclear development. 
  In the course of inspecting seven nuclear facilities in 
North 
Korea on six occasions in 1993, the IAEA inspected six 
monitoring cameras, 40 seals, and three radioactivity sensor 
facilities. In the event that damage of these facilities is 
confirmed, suspicion that nuclear material was transferred from 
North Korean nuclear facilities to some other place will be 
raised. Thus, there is a possibility that the continuity of 
safeguards of North Korean nuclear facilities may not be 
recognized. 
  A source in Washington said that with discovery of such seal 
damage, the conclusion of the results of IAEA's inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities will be the focus of people's 
attention. The likelihood that the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. high-level talks slated for 21 March in Geneva will 
be held as scheduled is doubtful. 
  It was reported that in the course of IAEA's inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities, disputes arose between IAEA and 
North Korea over the issue of continuing the inspection and the 
damage to the seals. 
  The team has to leave Pyongyang on 14 March as the IAEA 
inspection team was granted two-week entry visas upon its 
arrival in Pyongyang on 1 March. 
  This being the situation, this week will likely be the 
climax 
of IAEA's inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, and the 
possibility of resolving the issue of the exchange of special 
envoys between the North and the South before 21 March is very 
slim because North Korea has continually showed an attitude of 
rejection. 
  Another source observed that North Korea will likely drag on 
the controversy surrounding the inspection and the issue of 
North-South special envoy exchange even after 21 March when the 
third round of high-level talks are scheduled to be held. Thus, 
the possibility of high-level talks being held on the scheduled 
date is slim. 
  Meanwhile, Christine Shelley, a U.S. State Department 
spokesperson, on 9 March said that the U.S. Government regrets 
the fact that the IAEA nuclear inspection of North Korea is not 
proceeding smoothly and expressed the hope that North Korea will 
keep its promise to sincerely allow IAEA inspections until the 
inspections are concluded. Commenting on friction between North 
Korea and IAEA over nuclear inspections, Shelley said that she 
hopes the IAEA can settle the inspection issue and that the 
inspections will be concluded. Shelley stressed that regardless 
of progress in the North-South working contact, the exchange of 
North-South special envoys, with satisfactory nuclear inspection 
results, are a precondition for holding the third round of 
high-level talks agreed to by North Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Chong Chang-won] </F>
  [Text] An International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
reliable source said: In the course of its inspection of 
nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, North Korea, the IAEA inspection 
team discovered today that some seals of main nuclear facilities 
were damaged and is taking follow-up measures. 
  The source said that seals for reactors of five megawatt and 
over, which had been used for extracting plutonium, were not 
damaged and that some seals in the radiochemical laboratory -- a 
nuclear waste reprocessing facility -- and in the nuclear fuel 
producing plant seemed to have problems. 
  The source explained: It is a convention for an inspection 
team to confirm if nuclear materials in containers with damaged 
seals are identical to those listed in the first report 
submitted by a country that is subject to IAEA inspections, as 
soon as seal damage is confirmed. This enables the inspection 
team to determine if nuclear materials have been diverted to 
other purposes. 
  (David Kyd), information director of the IAEA, said: I am 
unable to comment now on the question about seal damage in North 
Korea's nuclear facilities. I will report the details of the 
result of the ongoing inspection on North Korea to the next 
meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors. 
  Saying that the inspection team is now smoothly conducting 
inspections at Yongbyon, Director (Kyd) hinted that the question 
about the seal damage, which caused arguments between the 
inspection team and the North Korean authorities, has been 
solved smoothly. 
  The inspection team will continue to inspect nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon until this weekend and will leave 
Pyongyang around 15 March after winding up its inspection early 
next week.

<F P=106> [Article by Kunlachada Chaiphiphat: "The ARF dilemma: </F>
Success or substance?"] 
  [Text] If the lifting of the US embargo on Vietnam was the 
first big regional event in the Year of the Dog, the inaugural 
Asean Regional Forum [ARF] in July promises to be another 
spectacular. 
  As expectations mount and eyes begin to turn to Bangkok, 
Asean officials are fretting over how to ensure the forum is a 
success when it brings together at least eighteen ministers from 
Asean, its seven dialogue partners and three observer countries. 
  Drawing from their experiences with the Asean Free Trade 
Area, which was launched with much ceremony and high 
expectations in 1992 only to run out of steam later, Asean 
officials are setting deliberately low targets for the opening 
round of the ARF. 
  At the heart of debate is what form the security dialogue 
should take, whether to allow off-the-cuff discussions to enable 
the attending ministers to develop a rapport or to prepare a 
pre-arranged forum to ensure its smoothness. 
  Many security experts believe the forum will build its own 
momentum given the unprecedented gathering of foreign ministers 
from regional powers like Japan, permanent members of the UN 
Security Council, and from states with conflicting territorial 
claims such as Vietnam, China, Brunei, Malaysia and Philippines. 
  There were some concerns expressed by the admission of 
countries like China, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea because 
they are new to regional security talks. Unlike Asean which has 
a relatively long history of practising collective conflict 
resolution such as in the case of Cambodia, these other nations 
have traditionally discussed or solved their security concerns 
on a bilateral basis. 
  "There should be some basis for them to start with," said 
one 
official involved with the preparations for the meeting. "The 
most difficult thing is to make them feel easy to talk," he said. 
  Those officials who support a freewheeling discussion argue 
that in order to set up an atmosphere of cordiality and mutual 
confidence, the ministers attending the forum should be left to 
decide and agree which model of dialogue to adopt and which 
topics to discuss at the meeting. 
  "They can talk about anything from weather to health, any 
topic that will enable them to achieve consensus. The fact that 
they meet is significant and that they will meet again is a plus 
for Asean," said the official. 
  Ambassador Tommy Koh, director of Singapore's International 
Policies Study Institute, a government's security think-tank, 
said recently that such a security institution should start with 
something not too difficult but not too easy. 
  "The ARF is new. It would be foolish to take up difficult, 
contentious issues that might sink it. But on the other hand it 
must not chicken out," he said. 
  "We must prudently take on easy issues and later consolidate 
them through the gradual gaining of self-confidence and mutual 
trust," the former ambassador to the United Nations said. 
  In order to make the forum germane is another challenge. To 
make it relavent the forum should take up issues of regional 
interest and non-regional members' interests. But Koh said it 
is the Asean way to take one step at one time. "We don't have 
in mind how it is going to be. Let's see first how it starts," 
he said. 
  The 27-year-old grouping has existed as a successful forum 
for political cohesiveness despite its 1967 founding goal as a 
regional economic grouping. 
  For Thailand, the host of this year's Asean meetings and the 
ARF, the dilemma is similar: Which is worse? To be too daring 
or too cautious. 
  There is a risk of sinking the forum if discussants are 
allowed to air what they want to say, which over time incites 
antagonism rather than fostering mutual confidence, a necessary 
precursor to the formalization of a security mechanism. 
  There were some concerns that picking a topic like the 
Spratly Islands which are claimed by China, Vietnam, the 
Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia will be tantamount to looking 
for trouble even though the issue is well worth discussing in 
the context of regional dialogue and in attracting the regional 
powers' attention.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Cambodia's mine-clearing 
authority made an appeal Friday [11 March] for millions of 
dollars in funding from international donors gathered at a 
meeting on Cambodian reconstruction. 
  Ieng Muli, minister of information and chairman of the 
Cambodian Mine Action Center, said the governmental agency 
requires 10 million dollars this year and next to finance its 
humanitarian programs, which include a land-mine awareness 
campaign, minefield marking, mine clearance and training of 
mine-removal experts. 
  Speaking on the closing day of a two-day meeting of the 
International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia, he 
said the funds are urgently needed to free land for the 
resettlement of refugees and displaced persons and for 
cultivation. The proposed budget would allow the center to 
clear 4,000 hectares of land per year with its existing 40 
platoons of mine removers totaling 2,400 personnel, most of whom 
have been trained by overseas engineers. 
  Ieng Muli said an additional 12 million dollars would be 
needed in the next two years for even wider-scale mine clearance 
to allow for construction of infrastructure and other 
development projects to take place. 
  "Mines are one of the most serious obstacles to Cambodia's 
growth and prosperity," he explained. 
  It is estimated that between eight million and 10 million 
land mines have been indiscriminately laid in Cambodia, 
especially in the western part of the country. 
  The mines kill or main some 300 Cambodians every month, with 
the result that the country now has over 40,000 amputees. The 
proportion of these amputees to the population is the highest in 
the world -- one for every 236 persons. Vast tracts of 
once-productive agricultural land are now unusable because of 
mines. 
  Ieng Muli said that so far the center has identified 1,787 
minefields covering an area of 3,231 million square meters. 
Only 7.28 million square meters of this has been cleared of 
mines since the agency was set up under the United Nations 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia. 
  Ieng Muli said that in five to eight years "the mine problem 
will be controlled and Cambodians can carry out their daily 
functions free from the threat of mines." But he added that it 
will take at least two decades to tackle all the facets of the 
problem.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Cambodian First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh on Friday [11 March] warned the Khmer 
Rouge guerrilla group to accept a cease-fire as called for by 
King Norodom Sihanouk or risk missing "the last train" to a 
peaceful settlement. 
  "The last train will definitely leave and if they don't want 
to join it...," Ranariddh told reporters at the Japan National 
Press Club. 
  The Cambodian leader said the royal government, whose forces 
are reportedly readying an assault on the Khmer Rouge's main 
base at Pailin, "strongly supports" King Sihanouk's cease-fire 
appeal recently conveyed to both government and Khmer Rouge 
forces. 
  "We agree to proclaim such a cease-fire," he said, with 
Co-Premier Hun Sen at his side. "The ball is now in the Khmer 
Rouge camp." 
  The king, who is undergoing medical treatment for cancer in 
Beijing, called March 7 for an "immediate ceasefire on all 
fronts," as continued internecine warfare would spell "the death 
of Cambodia and our race." 
  Ranariddh said the government wants to "leave the door 
open...to those moderate elements of the Khmer Rouge to join the 
national community." 
  Khmer Rouge radio on March 7 reportedly broadcast that Khmer 
Rouge President Khieu Samphan had sent Sihanouk a letter on 
March 5 in which he said the guerrilla group would fully agree 
to a cease-fire on the basis of a proposal put forward by the 
king on November 21. 
  In the proposal, which would require an amendment of the 
Cambodian Constitution, the monarch suggested the Khmer Rouge be 
given a role in the government if they turn over territories 
under their control and integrate their guerrilla army into the 
nation's unified armed forces. But Ranariddh said the Khmer 
Rouge has not responded to the government call for a ceasefire 
some months back. 
  He said the Khmer Rouge no longer constitute a "military 
threat" to the government, but merely a source of insecurity. 
  "I think that the Khmer Rouge can definitely not any more 
prevent Cambodia from going forward," he said. 
  The guerrilla group, which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978, 
still controls an estimated 15 to 20 percent of the country's 
territory. 
  Ranariddh, who was visiting Japan to attend an international 
conference on Cambodian reconstruction, said that providing an 
improved standard of living for the populace will deprive the 
Khmer Rouge of its support base. 
  "To fight and to win over the Khmer Rouge in a lasting 
manner, we do not need only arms and weapons. We need more than 
that -- the development of the country," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Donor countries and 
international organizations concluded two days of talks on the 
reconstruction of Cambodia on Friday [11 March], having pledged 
over 700 million dollars in new aid for the next two years. 
Delegates said the donors pledged a total of 486 million 
dollars of aid projects and programs for this year and half that 
amount for 1995. 
  The meeting of the International Committee on the 
Reconstruction of Cambodia [ICORC], chaired by Japan, was 
attended by delegates from 32 countries, the European Union and 
12 international organizations. 
  One senior Japanese Foreign Ministry source said the amount 
pledged was more than expected, particularly in light of the 
so-called "aid fatigue" believed to have set in among many donor 
nations. 
  "Tokyo seems to be a lucky place for Cambodia," said another 
senior Japanese official, referring to the last such meeting 
here in 1992 when participants pledged 880 million dollars. The 
pledges came in answer to a call from ailing Cambodian King 
Norodom Sihanouk, read out at the meeting on his behalf, for a 
modern-day "Marshall Plan" to help the war-ravaged country back 
on its feet. 
  Many, if not most, of the delegations participating in the 
two-day meeting pledged fresh funds toward the roughly projected 
200 million dollars that Cambodia will require over the coming 
year. 
  Japanese parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Syozo Azuma 
pledged on Tokyo's behalf the equivalent of 87.7 million dollars 
in grant aid for the coming year, while U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher announced 73 million dollars in new U.S. 
assistance to Cambodia over a two-year period. 
  Among international financial institutions, the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) announced it will provide Cambodia with 
some 129 million dollars in loan assistance for 1994-97, as well 
as technical assistance of some 28 million dollars for the same 
period. The World Bank said it is planning to offer Cambodia 
roughly 75 million dollars in reconstruction assistance in the 
coming fiscal year. 
  The first ICORC meeting, held at a working-level in Paris 
last September, saw 119 million dollars in fresh commitments 
added to the 880 million dollars pledged at a previous 
ministerial conference on Cambodia held in Tokyo in June 1992. 
While most of those funds were for short-term financial 
support, the present ICORC meeting is focused on Cambodia's mid- 
to long-term aid requirements. 
  At the outset of the meeting, Cambodian First Prime Minister 
Norodom Ranariddh conveyed an appeal from his father Sihanouk, 
who has been undergoing medical treatment in Beijing. 
  "The gift of which my country has the greatest need, having 
suffered from so many years of turpitude and devastation, is 
none other than a new unconditional Marshall Plan gauged to 
specific needs," Sihanouk said in the message. Sihanouk's 
reference was to a multibillion-dollar plan drawn up by late 
U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall in the late 1940s to 
rehabilitate the shattered economies of post-World War II 
European nations. 
  Japan was the largest donor at the conference, followed by 
the U.S. and france, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Of the 15.77 million dollars committed to the Cambodia Mine 
Action Center, the U.S. was the largest contributor, followed by 
Japan and Australia, they said. 
  During the meeting, Cambodia explained its economic and 
development policies. Cambodia's shift toward a market-oriented 
economy seems to be progressing steadily, the officials said. 
International organizations such as the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) positively evaluated 
Cambodia's reconstruction efforts, they said. 
  The participants of the conference also agreed to hold the 
third ICORC meeting next year in Paris as scheduled, but timing 
of the conference has not yet been set, the officials said. The 
Cambodian delegation also expressed its intention during the 
conference to join the Yokohama-based International Tropical 
Timber Organization (ITTO), the officials said. The ITTO 
consists of 23 timber producing countries such as Brazil, 
Colombia and Peru, and 26 consumer countries such as Australia, 
Japan, Canada, China and the U.S.

  2. The participants unanimously expressed their full support 
to the only legitimate government of Cambodia and to its two 
prime ministers, His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh and 
his Excellency Mr. Hun Sen, in their joint efforts for national 
reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. They expressed their hope 
that through these efforts Cambodia will fully recover its 
stability, prosperity and security throughout its territory. 
<H5>  II. Necessity for Enhanced International Assistance </H5>
  3. The participants paid respectful attention to His Majesty 
the King's message addressed to the meeting and fully took note 
of the priority sectors and activities mentioned in his message. 
  4. The participants shared the view that the reconstruction 
of the devastated national economy is the chief and 
indispensable component for achieving peace, stability and 
national reconstruction, and thus, constitutes an integral part 
of the implementation of the Paris peace accords. The 
international community which has fully committed itself to the 
peace process should strengthen its assistance to the 
reconstruction of Cambodia in order to consolidate the fruits of 
the peace process. 
  5. The participants welcomed the reports by the Cambodian 
delegation and the international organizations on the progress 
in Cambodia's economic reform policy. They particularly took 
note of the further progress in transition to market economy and 
trade liberalization as well as the enhanced tax revenue and the 
reduction of monetary financing of the budget which resulted in 
improved macroeconomic stability, namely reduced inflation rates 
and stable exchange rates. They shared the view that such 
determined and substantial adjustment efforts should continue 
and deserve strengthened international assistance. 
  6. The main source of Cambodia's medium-term economic growth 
and reduction of poverty resides in the agricultural sector. 
Particular emphasis should be put on the development of this 
sector as well as on the improvement of the infrastructure, 
especially the transport and water infrastructure, which will 
create a greater capacity for economic growth. This will also 
enable the benefits of growth to spread throughout the country. 
  In this connection, with a view to promoting the 
development of human resources, the participants stressed the 
need to formulate long-term policies for sustainable development 
of the basic social sectors, giving priority to health and 
education, while at the same time meeting the most pressing 
requirements. They concurred that well-targeted and 
well-coordinated international assistance, taking fully into 
account these priorities, and implemented with the participation 
of the beneficiaries, is called for. 
  The participants stressed the vulnerable position of women 
in 
their double roles as mothers and income-providers and that 
these double roles have to be taken into account both in 
formulating development strategies and in the implementation of 
projects. 
  7. In this respect, the participants recognized that 
capacity building involving equal attention to the contributions 
of women is of crucial importance in achieving market-oriented 
reforms, in pursuing the goal of reconstruction in a coordinated 
manner and in effectively absorbing international aid. In this 
regard, they commended the continuing efforts of the ADB and the 
UNDP in the implementation, in close association with the IMF, 
of the technical assistance for strengthening marco-economic 
management. They reaffirmed that this is an area requiring full 
and sustained international assistance, particularly technical 
assistance. 
  8. The participants noted with satisfaction the joint 
statement by the UN resident coordinator on behalf of all UN 
agencies resident in Cambodia as it demonstrates the 
increasingly coordinated approach adopted by these agencies in 
support of Cambodia's reconstruction and development efforts. 
<H5>  III. Financial Requirements of Cambodia </H5>
  9. The participants highly appreciated the government's 
efforts for preparing its strategy document entitled "The 
National Program To Rehabilitate and Develop Cambodia." 
  10. The participants commended the World Bank for its 
intensive efforts to harmonize its economic work with the need 
for support to ICORC, in particular by preparing a comprehensive 
report on the economic situation in Cambodia describing priority 
projects and programs in all the sectors of Cambodia's 
development and reconstruction, and by assisting the chair in 
compiling pledges made by the participants. 
  11. The donors expressed their full and clear support to the 
ambitious economic and social development and reform program 
elaborated by the Cambodian authorities and pledged a total 
amount of approximately 486 million U.S. dollars of aid 
projects and programs for 1994. 
  12. The participants welcomed the progress in the 
discussions between the IMF and the Cambodian Government on a 
policy framework paper leading to a loan program under an ESAF 
[Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] arrangement of 
approximately 120 million dollars over 1994-1996. They also 
welcomed the intention of the World Bank to extend a new 
structural adjustment lending of approximately 60 million 
dollars provided that an agreement is reached on the medium-term 
reform policy. They also noted the ADB's operational program 
which envisages a lending level for the medium- term (1994-1997) 
amounting to about 266 million dollars. 
<H5>  IV. Specific Issues </H5>
  13. The participants acknowledged that mines are one of the 
serious obstacles to the reconstruction efforts of Cambodia. 
They recognized the urgency of demining to free land for the 
resettlement of refugees for the expansion of agriculture and 
for the reduction of mine casualties. They acknowledged that 
the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) continued to need 
international assistance and support through funding and/or 
provision of experts. They strongly condemned any laying of new 
mines. 
  Based on this recognition, an amount of 5.4 million dollars 
had already been deposited in the UNDP Trust Fund. New pledges 
of approximately 15 million dollars have been announced as 
assistance to CMAC through various channels including the UNDP 
Trust Fund or NGO [nongovernmental organization] projects. In 
addition the UNDP is financing a capacity building program from 
its own resources amounting to 800,000 dollars. Some countries 
announced plans to dispatch experts. It is expected that a 
total of 30 technical advisers will be in the field. 
  14. The participants shared the view that the international 
community, in the spirit of Rio declaration and acting in 
conformity with the recent International Action Plans and 
Agreements on the Environment, including Agenda 21 and Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, should cooperate and strengthen 
aspects of environment protection in their assistance program. 
They welcomed the first participation of Cambodia in the Ninth 
Session of International Negotiating Committee for a Framework 
Convention on Climate Change in February. 
  They encouraged the Mekong Secretariat and other bilateral 
and multilateral agencies to continue and enhance their present 
efforts in the environmental sector. Particular attention 
should be paid to the conservation of the water, flora and fauna 
of the Tonle-Sap Lake and its surroundings as well as to the 
proper management of the tropical forests in Cambodia. In this 
regard they welcomed the intention of the Government of Cambodia 
to become a member of the International Tropical Timber 
Organization (ITTO). 
  15. The participants welcomed the appointment of a special 
representative of the secretary general of the United Nations 
pursuant to Resolution 1993/6 of the Commission of Human Rights. 
They shared the view that the establishment of the Cambodia 
field office of the United Nations Human Rights Center, with the 
agreement of the Cambodian Government, was important, in the 
present juncture, and that it should be properly funded in order 
to enhance respect for human rights as well as for the rule of 
law. 
  16. The participants congratulated the NGO's, both foreign 
and Cambodian, on their important role in the development of 
Cambodia in the past and expressed the hope that this would 
continue and expand in the future. 
<H5>  V. Next meeting </H5>
  17. The participants agreed that the next ICORC meeting will 
be held in Paris, hosted by France next year. 
  The participants underlined the importance of ICORC as a 
gathering to give political impetus to the international 
assistance to Cambodia. 
  The participants also urged the World Bank to bring, in 
connection with the other international agencies, a strong 
technical support to reinforce the effectiveness of the 
international assistance, having in mind the constitution, in 
due course, of a consultative group.

<F P=106> ["`International Cooperation System' Sought Behind Scene of </F>
Dialogue" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- South Korean puppet 
Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang told a "press conference" Thursday 
that "the third round of the talks between the United States and 
the North of Korea could not be held "unless a progress was made 
in the exchange of special envoys between the two parts of 
Korea." Earlier, the puppet deputy minister of foreign affairs 
said Wednesday that whether the third round of the talks will be 
held or not is "uncertain" because "the nuclear inspection of 
the North is not satisfactory" and "the North-South dialogue is 
not going smoothly." 
  As was already reported, an inspectors' group of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] started its activities 
on March 1 according to the agreed conclusions reached at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and the competent organ of the 
DPRK is rendering a proper cooperation to it. We are willing to 
honestly implement the agreement concerning the IAEA's 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards. 
  Nevertheless, the deputy foreign minister grumbled that the 
"IAEA's inspection of the North is not satisfactory." This is 
really preposterous. 
  As for the "rough going of the North-South dialogue" he 
talked about, the responsibility for this rests entirely with 
the South side. 
  At the fifth working contact for the exchange of 
presidential 
envoys between the North and the South, the South side took a 
provocative stand by deliberately bringing forward matters 
unrelated to the discussion of working procedures to spoil the 
atmosphere of the talks. 
  The puppets are now crying that the North-South dialogue is 
not going smoothly after intentionally creating difficulties in 
the working contact. This is a ruse to avoid the responsibility. 
  And it must not go unnoticed that they are persistently 
arguing that the progress of the North-South dialogue is a 
precondition of the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  As we have already stated, the agreed conclusions reached at 
the DPRK-U.S. New York contact include the issue of the 
resumption of the working contact for the exchange of special 
envoys between the two halves of Korea as a step of simultaneous 
action and they do not mention the realization of the exchange. 
The DPRK and the United States agreed on the steps of 
simultanous action without preconditions. 
  The puppets' clamour about the preconditions is nothing but 
a 
despicable attempt to balk the third round of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks by intentionally creating obstacles. 
  The "international cooperation system" sought by the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique behind the curtain of dialogue to isolate 
and stifle the DPRK will result only in precipitating their own 
doom.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Just Denunciation on the One </F>
Who Infringes Upon Human Rights"] 
  [Text] According to reports, Amnesty International, the 
London-based human rights organization, issued a report on 9 
March on traitor Kim Yong-sam's first year in office. 
  The report pointed out that Kim Yong-sam has done next to 
nothing to end human rights violations and enumerated human 
rights violation cases in detail. The report said South Korean 
peace activist Kim Sam-sok and his sister, Kim Un-chu, were 
beaten and sexually assaulted by the Agency for National 
Security Planning after their arrest on national security 
charges in September, 1993. 
  It was a just denunciation and protest on the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet group which, under the cloak of a so-called civilian-led 
regime, has turned South Korea into a barren land devoid of 
human rights. 
  As everyone knows, traitor Kim Yong-sam took office a year 
ago raving that he would make South Korea a more democratic 
society and resolve the human rights issue. Nonetheless, the 
current situation in South Korea clearly shows that it was an 
imposture of a political prostitute who attempted to win the 
people's favor by hiding the rebellious nature of the 
treacherous regime that has changed its nameplate from a 
dictatorial system to a civilian one. 
  In order to make South Korea a democratic society and 
resolve 
the human rights issue, the National Security Law, the most 
vicious law in the world, and other fascist evil laws should be 
abolished first and foremost. The Agency for National Security 
Planning; the Defense Security Command; and other suppressive 
organs, which are the breeding center of human rights 
violations, should be dissolved as well. 
  Raving about human rights while keeping intact the evil laws 
and suppressive organs that systematically and physically 
infringe upon human rights is in fact preposterous. However, 
traitor Kim Yong-sam, saying he will carry out reforms, left 
intact all the evil laws and went so far as to enhance the 
suppressive organs' role. 
  Under such conditions, the patriotic students and the people 
who called for independence, democracy, and reunification have 
been mercilessly suppressed by the police and put behind bars. 
Workers who called for the right to live have been trampled 
under the puppet soldiers' combat shoes. Until last October, 
compared to the same period of No Tae-u's early days in office, 
the number of students and people who have been arrested 
invoking National Security Law has increased by 2.5 times. This 
fact clearly reveals how malicious the Kim Yong-sam fascist 
clique's suppressive maneuvers are. 
  In addition, the innocent people have been terrorized in 
broad daylight and patriotic students have been kidnapped only 
to be found in a deep valley or at sea as corpses. Universities 
and work places have been raided by the police and those who 
have different ideologies have been arrested and executed. 
Brutal medieval-type torture, such as sleep and water 
deprivation and sexual assaults, are openly carried out in South 
Korea. All of these can only be committed in South Korea. 
  According to materials, approximately 340 people are wanted 
by the South Korean police and there are now some 300 long-term 
prisoners. Among them, there are long-term prisoners who have 
spent their days in a cell for 42 or 44 years. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who advertised himself as being a 
civilian-led government's leader, is an infringer of human 
rights, surpassing the Fifth and Sixth Republic dictators who 
gained notoriety for their military dictatorship. South Korea 
is an area in which human rights is infringed upon and a living 
hell in which no one can live. 
  This notwithstanding, the fascist clique did not stop there 
and raved that it is acceptable to proceed with torture on 
political detainees. In doing so, they encourage human butchers 
to commit brutal torture and killings. 
  The fact that traitor Kim Yong-sam clamors about his 
so-called respect for human rights and democratic development is 
nothing but a sophistry to hide his ugly color as a ringleader 
of human rights violations. Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a wolf in a 
lamb's skin. The reason why human right violations are openly 
committed in South Korea is because the present regime has 
sprung from the deep root of the Fifth and Sixth Republics' 
military dictators. 
  It is self-evident that the Kim Yong-sam regime, which has 
sprung from the deep root of the military dictatorial regimes, 
can only but take the road of human rights violation. The Kim 
Yong-sam regime is a succeeding regime of the Sixth Republic. 
  At a time when human rights is most valued around the world, 
how can a brutal human rights situation be permitted in South 
Korea? Amnesty International's indication that nothing has been 
done to improve the human rights condition in South Korea is 
just. 
  As long as South Korea remains as a U.S. colonial country 
and 
traitor Kim Yong-sam holds power, South Korea's human rights 
situation will never be improved. As a crazy dog should only be 
caught after being beaten to death with a stick, the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique, which runs amok in trampling on human 
rights and committing manslaughter, will receive a stern trial 
of the history. 
  The South Korean people will never tolerate the Kim Yong-sam 
ring, a fascist tyranny for the century.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
South Korean opposition Democratic Party reportedly said in a 
commentary March 8 that the Democratic Party would push ahead to 
the last with the drive for the abolition of the "National 
Security Law" (NSL), complaining that the Kim Yong-sam group was 
opposed to the abrogation of the "NSL", an anti-reunification 
fascist law. 
  The position of the party strongly calling for the abolition 
of the "NSL" was manifested earlier at a press conference called 
by the chairman of the party on March 5.

<F P=106> ["Sinister Political Plot" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
accuses the Japanese authorities of charging the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea with its "nuclear issue." 
  The analyst says: 
  The Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said on March 
4 
that "it is important to wrest a more drastic step" from the 
DPRK, which has accepted an inspection of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, while Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said 
Japan would continue "strongly urging" the DPRK to totally 
withdraw its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty, alleging that the DPRK's nuclear 
development is a factor of instability in the Asia-Pacific 
region." 
  Their remarks came at a time when an inspection for the 
continuity of safeguards is under way according to the agreed 
conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. This 
is aimed at throwing a snag in the way of the third round of the 
DPRK-U.S. talks and hampering the solution to the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  In this way, the Japanese reactionary forces are attempting 
to find a justification for legally pushing ahead with Japan's 
nuclear armament which has reached a danger line, charging the 
DPRK with the "nuclear issue." 
  We can never remain an onlooker to the nuclear armament 
sought by the Japanese reactionaries. If Japan were armed with 
nuclear weapons, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, 
even though it were realised, would be meaningless and the 
North-South joint declaration on denuclearization, too, would be 
reduced to a sheet of paper. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must promptly stop their sinister 
political plot and ponder over the matter.

<F P=106> ["Chuche Idea Is Greatest Revolutionary Idea at Present </F>
Time" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- Prof. Aleksandr 
Kabalov, doctor of philosophy at Moscow University, in a press 
interview with a KCNA correspondent in Russia on March 4 
stressed that the chuche idea is the greatest revolutionary idea 
at the present time. 
  Saying that the chuche idea clarifies a man-centred 
viewpoint 
and stand toward the world, he added: 
  The chuche idea defines people's struggle for independence 
as 
the driving power of social development. 
  We fully support the formulation that the popular masses are 
the creator of history. The principle of the chuche idea that 
the popular masses are the masters of their destiny and the 
world and play a decisive role in shaping their destiny and 
transforming the world makes an outstanding contribution to the 
development of the revolutionary idea of the working class. 
  The chuche idea raises the question of leadership of party 
and leader, in the revolutionary movement and the communist 
movement, which is the most correct idea. 
  The chuche idea is the greatest revolutionary idea which 
gives scientific answers to the new questions raised by the 
present time, he pointed out, and said: 
  It is a very important feat of the chuche idea that it gives 
a new scientific world outlook to mankind. 
  The chuche idea is the supreme idea that is of universal 
significance on a world-wide scale. 
  The chuche idea founded by Comrade Kim Il-song is now 
developed and enriched by Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il is developing the chuche idea in depth 
with his outstanding ideological and theoretical activities and 
brilliantly applying it in the realities of Korea. 
  He said that during his Korean visit he saw the shining 
achievements made by the Korean people in revolution and 
construction by applying the chuche idea.

<F P=106> ["Ours Is Invincible Socialism With Strong Chuche Character" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- Our socialism is now 
exalting its dignity and honor as socialism with a strong chuche 
character because it has the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at 
the head of the cause of socialism and is under his outstanding 
guidance, declares NODONG SINMUN in an article today. 
  The author of the article says: 
  Today our socialism is giving full play to its advantages 
and 
vitality as socialism with a strong chuche character, which was 
chosen by our people themselves and has been built by them with 
their own efforts, because it fully embodies the chuche idea. 
  The chuche character of our socialism finds clear 
expression, 
above all, in that all the lines and policies, strategies and 
tactics are worked out from the stand of chuche and they are 
carried into practice to the letter. 
  In our country today all the lines and policies of the party 
and the state are shaped in conformity with the aspirations and 
demand of our people and the specific conditions of the country 
on the basis of the chuche idea. The dear leader who regards 
the people as his teacher and respects their will to the maximum 
makes it a rule always to find himself among them and work out 
all the lines and policies in conformity with their aspirations 
and demand. All the lines and policies of the party and the 
state in our country serve for the creative life of the popular 
masses and contribute to the increase of the chuche character of 
our-style socialism. 
  The chuche character of our socialism also finds 
manifestation in regarding the popular masses as the driving 
force of socialist construction and resolving everything by 
enhancing their role. 
  The question of bringing up the popular masses to be the 
driving force of socialist construction has been successfully 
solved in our country under the wise guidance of the dear 
leader. He gives scientific answers to the questions raised by 
the times and revolution with his extraordinary intelligence and 
energetic ideological and theoretical activities and guides the 
popular masses to keep the socialist idea as their creed. He 
has brought up our people to be a people strong in independence 
by guiding them to break through difficulties and trials in 
their way by their own efforts in the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance with high consciousness of being the driving force 
of socialist construction. 
  The strong chuche character of our socialism is powerfully 
demonstrated in that it is confidently advancing along its path, 
not wavering under any circumstances. 
  Ours is a people who have keenly realized in the course of 
building socialism under the leadership of the party that only 
socialism provides them with genuine freedom and happiness and 
the cause of socialism is invincible. 
  The imperialists' moves to blockade and stifle our socialist 
system politically, economically and militarily, hating it as a 
thorn in the flesh, have been intensified as never before. But 
our people are taking great strides in socialist construction, 
united around the dear leader in one mind.

  [Text] Functionaries and working people of the local trade 
sector, who are upholding the party's trade-first policy, are 
strengthening the production base of export items and are 
actively increasing exports. 
  From January 1994 until now, they increased exports by 1.5 
times over the same period of last year by carrying on a 
vigorous struggle to thoroughly implement the great leader's New 
Year's address and the decisions made at the 21st plenary 
session of the Sixth party Central Committee. 
  Cities and counties in South Pyongan Province are 
concentrating great efforts on developing local trade. 
Normalization of production of export items at a high level has 
been achieved at 50 production bases in the province. The 
province has actively carried out a struggle to create new bases 
and to increase exports to bring about the five-fold increase of 
exports in February over the same period of last year. 
  In Nampo, prospective production bases of export items have 
been prepared based on the city's geographic and economic 
conditions and on a close estimation of overseas demand 
[taeoejok suyo]. From the beginning of this year until now, the 
city increased exports 2.9 times over the same period of last 
year by diversifying and varying trade [muyogul tagakhwa 
tayanghwa hamurosso]. 
  In this city, Chollima district and Kangso district set 
examples in exporting. These districts have prepared excellent 
bases for producing various metal products, farming products, 
and local specialities and properly carried on production 
organization and technological guidance. They keep 
overfulfilling monthly export plans at 120 percent or more. 
  South Hamgyong, North Hamgyong, Chagang, and North Hwanghae 
Provinces also scored gains in exporting, with deep interest in 
the development of local trade, upholding the party's 
trade-first policy. 
  These provinces are operating well Kyongamsan Export Garment 
Plant, Hamhung Silk Plant, and other plants and are increasing 
exports in various ways -- such as processing trade [kagong 
muyok], joint operation [habyong], and joint venture [hapchak]. 
  Najin district, Huichon, Chonchon county, Hwangju county, 
and 
Yontan county take the lead in implementing monthly export plans 
by developing mulberry fields and increasing the production of 
straw goods, industrial art products, and other export items. 
  Enthusiastically implementing the party's trade-first 
policy, 
working people in Kaesong are well carrying on production 
organization to achieve the goal of diversifying goods of Koryo 
ceramics, industrial art products, Koryo ginseng, handicrafts, 
and other specialities of the city and adding 30 more kinds of 
export items this year. 
  They explored many export sources [suchul wonchon] by 
displaying their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativeness so 
they could fulfill the city's overall export plan for February 
at 140 percent. Encouraged by this success, they continue to 
effect innovations in producing export items.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- The Korean Scientific 
and Educational Film Studio has recently released several 
scientific films on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the 
publication of the great socialist rural theses. 
  "Agricultural Know-How" Nos. 14 and 15, scientific films 
which will help raise the standard of technical and cultural 
knowledge of the agricultural officials and working people, 
include "Mysterious Chongbang Bacterium No. 10", "Hedge Sweet 
Potato", "New Silkworm Disinfectant","Wormwood Is Used as Feed 
Additive", etc. 
  "Mysterious Chongbang Bacterium No. 10" invented by the 
stockbreeding institute of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences 
is several times stronger than the old one in dissolving fibrin, 
rich in protein content. It helps increase the fattening rate 
20 percent while saving grain feed 20 percent. 
  "Hedge Sweet Potato" shows that if sweet potato is 
cultivated 
with the hedges of village houses as the support for its 
runners, the harvest is raised ten times that when it is planted 
in fields. 
  The scientific film "Drying Grain by Solar Heat" introduces 
a 
new method invented by the Kim Che-won University. 
  Besides, there are among the newly released films many 
scientific films showing various aspects of the Korean rural 
communities prospering under the bright rays of the rural theses 
and introducing advanced techniques of farming, stockbreeding 
and fruit-growing.

  [Text] It has been learned that the United States Senate 
decided on 2 February to establish Radio Free Asia which will 
carry news and commentaries on developments in Asian countries, 
including Myanmar [Burma], the PRC, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. 
In this connection, the director general of the Political 
Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has 
invited the charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy and expressed 
regret over the matter. 
  The director general said that there are countless public 
and 
private radio stations in Asia broadcasting 24 hours per day. 
He said the latest developments on Myanmar are being reported 
by Radio Burma and foreign broadcasting stations, including VOA, 
and that they can be tuned in for 24 hours. Furthermore, those 
interested can get news on Myanmar and international events from 
the satellite service. Local people now have the right of 
continuous access to both Myanmar and international news. 
Therefore, the establishment of Radio Free Asia is not 
necessary and it amounts to interference in the internal affairs 
of Asian countries, including Myanmar. Such an attempt cannot 
be viewed as a constructive contribution toward promoting 
Myanmar-U.S. relations.

the Ye-Tavoy railway line project. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Maung Aye said that during 
the time the SLORC holds state powers, it is constructing new 
railway lines in states and divisions in order to provide smooth 
transportation. He expressed his satisfaction at seeing local 
people willingly and competitively participate in the project in 
order to bring about development in their respective areas. He 
said the state is providing vast sums of money, both in local 
and foreign currencies, for the railway construction projects. 
He urged the departmental authorities and local people to 
participate actively and cooperate in the project. He also 
spoke on forest conservation, expansion of agricultural 
enterprises, and expansion of oil palm and rubber plantations. 
  Next, SLORC Secretary-1 Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt addressed the 
meeting. He said he had come to Ye along with the deputy 
commander in chief of the Defense Services and ministers to 
inspect the progress in the construction of the Ye-Tavoy 
railway, which is being undertaken for the sake of local 
development, and to provide the necessary assistance. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that during the time it holds state 
powers, the SLORC is working for national development and to 
improve the standard of living of the indigenous people. He 
said the prevalence of law and order and local peace and 
tranquility are the main prerequisites for carrying out national 
development tasks. He said all citizens should work hand in 
hand, in unity, and with zeal and diligence in the name of 
national progress. The SLORC has invited the armed 
organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold in order 
to work hand in hand. 
  He said that armed organizations in Mon State understood the 
state government's invitation and held an initial round of talks 
with us. Preparations are underway for the second round of 
talks. He expressed his hope that the armed organizations in the 
Mon State will return to the legal fold following the second 
round of talks. 
  Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that the USDA is 
the most fundamental organization for the entire Union and that 
the objectives and aims of the organization are based on the 
spirit of patriotism in striving for the emergence of a modern 
nation. Therefore, he said, he urged the entire general public 
-- including public servants -- to work for the further 
expansion and strengthening of the USDA. He said while it is 
necessary for all armed organizations in the jungle to make 
joint efforts in striving for the emergence of Myanmar as a 
modern nation, it is necessary for all indigenous people to 
participate with diligence and zeal. [passage omitted] 
  After the meeting, the deputy commander in chief of the 
Defense Services, secretary-1, and ministers returned to Tavoy 
at 1615 and spent the night there.

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, March 11 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- 
Malaysia's prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, said Malaysia 
sympathised with the workers in Britain who faced losing their 
jobs in the wake of Kuala Lumpur's decision not to entertertain 
British companies in awarding government contracts. 
  Nevertheless, the government could do nothing to withdraw 
the 
decision because when contracts were given to British companies, 
the government was assailed by baseless allegations by the 
British mass media and even some political leaders of that 
country. "As such, if we do not give contracts to British 
companies, there will be no accusations. Should we give profits 
to the British companies so that they (the media and some 
political leaders) can hurl accusations at us?" he told 
reporters here Friday. 
  Trade Union Congress (TUC) General Secretary John Monks was 
reported to have written to British Trade Minister Richard 
Needham to express the concern of trade unions about the 
damaging consequences for jobs in British industry if the 
current restriction on the involvement of British companies in 
government projects imposed by the Malaysian Governemnt was not 
lifted. News reports today said TUC also wrote to the Malaysian 
Trade Union Congress (MTUC) to seek its help in appealing to the 
government to withdraw the decision. [passage omitted] 
  Asked to comment on the TUC concern, Dr. Mahathir said it 
should urge the newspapers in Britain -- the source of the 
problem that led to Malaysia's action -- to stop publishing lies 
about the country rather then asking help from the British 
Government and MTUC to resolve the situation. By right, they 
should urge their newspapers. We ask for very little... That 
is, don't tell lies, he added. Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia's 
request was not difficult to fulfil because all that was needed 
was courage to tell the truth. Say what is true. If people are 
not involved in bribery, don't say there is bribery. If it is a 
loan and not a grant, say it is a loan and not a grant. He said, 
however, that the mass media in Britain appeared to consider 
telling lies as forming part of press freedom. Malaysia does not 
agree with that view because press freedom was limited to 
reporting the truth and did not extend to making false 
allegations or condemning someone, he added. 
  If they (the newspapers in Britain) continue to do so, it is 
difficult for us to consider the interests of the workers in 
Britain. We must give priority to our nation, he said when 
asked if the government would withdraw its decision should MTUC 
make an appeal on behalf of TUC. Dr. Mahathir was also asked if 
he would write to THE SUNDAY TIMES, London to seek that it 
correct its report containing the allegations of bribery made 
against Malaysian politicians and himself by reporting the 
truth. It's of no use for me to write to THE SUNDAY TIMES which 
does not in the least feel at fault because they are the one who 
started all this, he said. 
  He added, however, that THE FINANCIAL TIMES (London) had 
asked him for an explanation of the cabinet decision. I 
received a letter from THE FINANCIAL TIMES, not SUNDAY TIMES, 
asking me to give my views. I might give some explanation. 
  He said Malaysia's action had nothing to do with allegations 
in the British press about a linkage between Malaysia's purchase 
of military equipment from Britain and British aid for 
construction of the Pergau hydroelectric dam in Kelantan.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Despite having depreciated against some major 
currencies of late, the Malaysian ringgit is still fundamentally 
strong. Its current down-slide is mainly due to a temporary 
adjustment process. Many partners have been forced to sell 
their right to [word indistinct]. This is due to measures 
instituted by Bank Negara, the Central Bank, to curb speculative 
inflow of funds. 
  Most foreign currency payers had been buying huge amounts of 
Malaysian currency given its high interest rate and because they 
wanted to gain by investing from the booming stock exchange. 
The solid fundamentals and confidence in the Malaysian economy 
had never been stronger. It is therefore not surprising that 
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange performed extremely well. It 
recorded a volume of 107.8 billion shares in volume valued at 
387.3 billion ringgit in 1993. This was unprecedented and 
surpassed even the total volume and value of shares traded over 
the past 20 years. 
  What happened was that funds flood in significantly, putting 
extreme pressure on the liquidity in the banking system and 
pressure on interest rate. Therefore, the Central Bank had to 
intervene to bring about stability in the financial system. Of 
course, mopping up the excess liquidity in the bank system was a 
costly affair for Bank Negara. However, had it not been done 
the price of inaction would have been even more damaging. It 
would have resulted in runaway inflation. Therefore, Bank 
Negara's recent spate of measures are to ensure that funds only 
flow in for genuine investment purposes. The move is also vital 
in ensuring the country's economic growth and stability. 
  These measures are long-term and should not be construed as 
moves to further regulate the economy. But at the same time, it 
does not go against the principles of liberalization, which 
Malaysia opposes. But being a small economy, there has to be 
certain amount of protection of the local currency. It cannot 
be left entirely to global market forces. This is because there 
are companies large enough which can struggle against the 
ringgit and in the process disrupt the steady growth of the 
economy. After all, it is the rule of the Central Bank to 
maintain price stability by keeping a check on inflation. 
  Economic growth is meaningless if accompanied by too high an 
inflational rate. Therefore, Bank Negara should be lauded for 
its cautious policy [word indistinct]. The result can be seen 
the government being able to record an overall balanced budget 
in 1993 [as heard]. The Central Bank has always proved a guiding 
hand in moving the economy towards a more sustainable growth 
fund. It is in this light that foreign institutions should see 
the role of Bank Negara and the measures it is taking. After 
all both Malaysians and non-Malaysians alike stand to gain from 
the continuous prosperity of the country. Its future depends on 
the ability to strike a fine balance between growth and 
stability. And Bank Negara has done a fine job in achieving 
both.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sabah Residents Face an Uncertain Future"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan, president of PBS 
[Sabah United Party], was sworn in as Sabah chief minister by 
Sabah Governor Mohamed Said Keruak last night. [passage omitted] 
Sabah residents are now facing an uncertain future under a state 
government which has only a two-seat majority in the elections, 
which saw the PBS win 25 seats and the National Front 23 seats. 
  The only consolation for Pairin against the background of 
this unstable political situation is a clause in the Sabah state 
Constitution which allows him to appoint six more state 
assemblymen. The appointment, announced by Pairin last night, 
has enabled PBS to have 31 seats in the Sabah State Legislative 
Assembly. 
  While the said clause is a unique feature of the Sabah 
Constitution, it is also the biggest obstacle toward democratic 
process and people power in that state. The people's right to 
elect state assemblymen of their choice is definitely curtailed 
by such a clause and the PBS has suddenly increased its slim 
majority. The clause is also unfair to nearly half the Sabah 
voters who voted in favor of the National Front candidates in 
the recent election. In this connection, Justice Minister Datuk 
Syed Hamid Jaafar Albar noted that the said clause is against 
the Malaysian Constitution and should be reviewed. To ensure a 
fair political process, the clause should indeed be reviewed. 
  The Sabah residents now must share the burdens of PBS's weak 
government because PBS leaders will always think of their 
precarious position first. In such a situation, they will pay 
more attention to their political survival rather than the 
people's welfare. 
  People are also interested in knowing how long the new Sabah 
government will last and to what extent the PBS election 
promises will be fulfilled. [passage omitted] This explains why 
he has said he wants to meet and hold talks with Prime Minister 
Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed to discuss various issues. In 
view of the massive anti federal propaganda waged by the PBS 
during its election campaigns, Pairin's sincerity in this case 
is questionable. Besides, because of the solid presence of the 
National Front in Sabah, Pairin's initiative is out of place. 
The truth is that Pairin is distressed over the fact that a 
weak Sabah government may make PBS supporters change their minds 
and loyalty. Even though he is now chief minister, Pairin is now 
apparently scared of his own shadow.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Spare the Rod, Mr. Clinton?"] </F>
  [Text] What is one to make of the President of the United 
States intervening on behalf of an 18-year old American citizen 
living in Singapore who had been punished for breaking the law 
after an open trial? The rights of Michael Fay, the boy in 
question in a case of vandalism, had not been violated. This 
was acknowledged by the U.S. Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Ralph Boyce. 
For the record, President Bill Clinton was not suggesting that, 
either. He was careful to confine his protest to the Singapore 
Government to the caning portion of the sentence, the part he 
found "extreme". He said he hoped this would be "reconsidered" 
-- after paying due recognition to Singapore's sovereign right 
to exercise the law in its jurisdiction. Indeed it would; an 
appeal is pending against the sentence, which was four months' 
jail, six lashes and a fine of $3,500. As with all appeals, the 
courts will dispose of this one without undue delay and in 
strict conformity with the law and the facts of the case. The 
verdict will take no account of extraneous influences and 
factors, a fact which Americans who are known to cherish the 
primacy of the written law should have no difficulty 
appreciating. 
  Incredulity would be the reaction of many a Singaporean who 
learns that the world's most powerful politician, upon prompting 
from a reporter's question in the White House last Friday, has 
taken a personal interest in a case which concerns neither 
political hostage-taking nor a breach of national security. The 
President must be a busy man. The strain of putting out fires 
abroad (Bosnia, Somalia, difficult relations with China and 
Japan) and shepherding a controversial health-reform package at 
home has now been compounded by a deepening personal crisis as 
he and his wife, Hillary, face an investigation into a land deal 
they were party to in their early years. But then, incredulity 
might turn to approval among some that Mr. Clinton, burdened as 
he is had stood up for a fellow American in his belief -- that 
privilege he is entitled to -- that the boy had been dealt with 
harshly. American politicians have to answer to demanding 
constituents, yes. A subject for political enjoinment can be as 
big or as trivial as the public chooses to make it. Singaporeans 
who find his intervention objectionable need to understand that 
heroic gestures go down well with the American public. Though 
this case clearly qualifies as interference by the White House, 
they gain nothing by overreacting. Better a cool and dignified 
response. Singaporeans have no reason to be defensive about the 
stringency of the laws they live by and which foreign nationals 
domiciled here are subject to. This principle is accepted, it 
is non-negotiable. 
  The Government's response to American pressure has been 
proper, firm and clinical. It has set out the facts of past 
prosecutions for vandalism and the equal weight of the law 
applied, whoever the accused was. Thirteen Singaporeans were 
among 15 persons aged between 18 and 21 who received jail and 
caning sentences in the last five years. This should end the 
argument. The American Chamber of Commerce here, while "shaken" 
by the caning order, volunteers that Singapore's aggressive 
enforcement of law and order (its words) is one reason this is 
an attractive place to live and do business in. Singapore 
neither seeks nor gets chuffed by such observations. It is just 
one of numerous societal benchmarks it chose to set for itself. 
Governments whose nationals have breached these standards must 
accept that it is improper to do anything which might influence 
the course of justice. An Australian arrested with eight other 
foreign students, including Fay, last October jumped bail. He 
is thought to have fled the country. Cases against a Malaysian, 
a Hongkonger and a second American are pending. The Malaysian 
and British authorities have kept clear -- decorously. The U.S. 
Government, having monitored the Fay case since his arrest, as 
is its convention of helping nationals in distress abroad, 
should have known when to back off.

visit to the SRV, noting that relations and cooperation between 
Laos and Vietnam, especially between the National Defense 
Ministries of the two countries, are growing stronger with each 
passing day. 
  On the evening of the same day, Comrade Gen. Doan Khue 
hosted 
a reception in honor of our Lao military delegation. The VPA

past and consulted each other on various issues for future 
cooperation. On the afternoon of the same day, the Lao military 
delegation paid a visit to the 308th Division and the 102d 
Armored Regiment located 30 kilometers northwest of Hanoi. At 
the 308th Division, the delegation was warmly welcomed by Major

and heard a report on the division's performance from Comrade 
Lieutenant Colonel (Van Su Kao), division chief of staff. 
  On the evening of 7 March, the delegation visited the VPA 
political and military academy and was welcomed by Comrade Major 
General (Xuan Te Thien), chief of the academy, and many staff 
officers. The academy chief expressed gratitude for having the 
honor to welcome the high-level LPA delegation. Our comrade 
national defense minister also planted a tree at the academy to 
mark his visit. 
  On 8 March, a ceremony was held between the two sides to 
sign 
a cooperation agreement in various fields for 1994. Signing the 
agreement for the Lao side was Comrade Lt. Gen. Siphon 
Phalikhan, deputy minister of national defense and chief of the 
LPA General Political Department. The VPA was represented by 
Comrade Nguyen Thoi Bung, deputy minister of national defense in 
charge of foreign affairs. The high-level LPA delegation 
returned home on the afternoon of the same day. 
  The visit to the SRV by our high-level military delegation 
was crowned with brilliant success.

  [Text] Vientiane, March 11 (KPL) -- The first village based 
detoxification and rehabilitation programme for opium addicts in 
the Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] opened this week in 
Pha Lavek, Vientiane Province, according to a UN Drug Control 
Program's [UNDCP] press release. 
  The UNDCP highland integrated rural development project 
started the three week-long trial with support from a medical 
back-up team from the northern drug dependence treatment centre 
in Chiang Mai, Thailand. 
  Twenty-one addicts voluntarily enrolled at the new unit in 
Nam Khian village, Pha Lavek, to take gradually reduced levels 
of twice- daily administered opium tincture. Medical check-ups, 
vocational training, and social activities are also part of the 
programme. 
  The participants in the detoxification programme are 
accompanied by community health workers from their own village 
who will continue to assist with rehabilitation upon their 
return home. 
  The team from Thailand, led by Dr. Charun Chittiwuthikan, is 
providing training for health workers in detoxification 
procedures, including the proper dosing of opium addicts to 
minimise withdrawal symptoms. 
  Village elders and government officials joined project staff 
and the community for the detoxification programme's opening 
ceremony. 
  A village "shaman" and a "witch doctor" performed 
traditional 
ritual at the new unit, including discarding used opium pipes 
into a nearby stream. Specially composed songs in the Hmong 
language warning of the perils of opium dependency were sung, 
and prizes for children's anti-opium art and a poetry 
competition were presented. 
  Within the project area there are estimated to be 97 addicts 
of whom 70 have said they want to end their drug dependency. 
There are an estimated 40,000 addicts living in the Lao PDR. 
  Many of the addicts said they had become opium dependent 
after taking the drug for a health problem and now wanted to 
give up the habit mainly for economic reasons. 
  UNDCP's highland integrated rural development project, which 
started in July 1989, is implementing development activities to 
create economic and social conditions which eliminate the need 
to grow opium for commercial purposes. Establishing an efficient 
and effective community based health care system is an integral 
part of the project.

  [Text] In a 10 March statement, United States Ambassador 
to Thailand David Lambertson noted that there had been no new 
developments following the U.S. warning six months ago about 
three Thai companies supplying workers to work under the 
chemical weapons plant project in Rabta, Libya. He said that 
although the Thai Government tried to solve the problem and 
arrested the Thai businessmen for sending workers to Libya 
without official permits, there has been no change in the 
situation. 
  The three companies are: the SPC Suphachok, or SPC 
Supertrade; V and M Engineering; and an affiliated firm of 
Wintrade and Winman. The ambassador said the three will be 
barred from doing business with American companies. 
  Wirot Sakunmuthita, owner of the V and M Engineering 
Company, 
has denied the charges, but admitted designing and overseeing 
the construction of a "safety bunker" in a complex which the 
United States believes is the chemical weapons factory. Wirot 
said his arrest was politically motivated and carried out under 
U.S. pressure. He said he has cancelled all contracts to build 
"safety bunkers" in Libya. 
  Following the arrest in October of Thai businesses sending 
workers to Libya, Libyan Leader Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi threatened 
to expel Thai workers from his country. Although no concrete 
action was taken afterwards, hundreds of Thai workers left Libya 
for home. There are about 20,000 Thai workers left in Libya.

  [Text] The companies planning to build a pipeline to 
transport natural gas from an offshore field in Burma to 
Thailand have for the first time revealed the route the pipeline 
will take. 
  Human rights and environmental groups fear that its 
construction will lead to extensive deforestation and the 
displacement of villagers and refugees in order to secure the 
route. 
  Several refugee camps in the area have already been burnt 
down and their inhabitants ordered out, although no explanation 
was given by the Thai authorities. 
  North of the route, Mon rebel leaders are coming under 
increasing pressure to sign a ceasefire with the Burmese 
government. Mon troops are at present skirmishing with Burmese 
soldiers. 
  Assuming that the national oil companies of Burma and 
Thailand -- the Myanmar [Burma] Oil &amp; Gas Enterprise (MOGE) 
and 
the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) -- can come to an 
agreement on the price Thailand will pay for the gas, the 
pipeline will come ashore between the towns of Ye and Tavoy in 
Burma and follow the Tavoy and Zinba river valleys up toward the 
border of Thailand. 
  It will then cross highlands of dense virgin forest to enter 
Thailand at Ban I-Tong (Nai Et Taung in Burma) in Kanchanaburi 
Province. 
  From Ban I-Tong, the pipeline will follow a road down to 
Thong Pha Phum and then head south to a new power plant to be 
built in Ratchaburi. 
  Total, a French state-owned oil company which has signed a 
production-sharing agreement with the Burmese government for the 
offshore field in the Gulf of Martaban, will be responsible for 
constructing the pipeline in Burma while PTT will build it on 
the Thai side. 
  The pipeline's chosen course was revealed in a letter dated 
Jan 12 from Joseph Daniel, Total's director of communications, 
to Yvette Pierpaoli, a French refugee worker. A copy of the 
letter has been obtained by THE NATION. 
  The letter claims that by following the river valleys in 
Burma -- where there are only "scattered shrubs" -- and the 
existing road in Thailand, the pipeline's environmental impact 
would be minimized. "Only the very last (two to three) 
kilometres in Burma... will require cutting some trees," it says. 
  "No population displacement is required on the Total 
pipeline 
course which follows a region which as far as we have seen is 
perfectly quiet," it adds. The letter claims that surveys along 
the course have been carried out by foot, car and helicopter 
since last April. 
  The route was confirmed by a PTT source who wished to remain 
anonymous. The source said a decision on the route was made 
several months ago. Talks between Burma, Thailand and Total 
were being held yesterday in Bangkok over the price of the gas. 
  The route is significant in that it helps to explain recent 
events at the border. On April 7, last year, the 9th Division 
of the Royal Thai Army reportedly burned down two villages -- 
Aung Tha Pye and Democracy Village -- just south of Ban I-Tong, 
displacing 500 people in all, most of them ethnic Tavoyar 
refugees. 
  At the time, the PTT denied knowing about the evictions and 
claimed the pipeline would follow the old "Death Railway" route 
from Amherst in Burma through Three Pagoda Pass, well north of 
Ban I- Tong. 
  More recently, Mon and Karen groups have come under 
increasing pressure to sign a ceasefire with the State Law and 
Order Restoration Council (Slorc) which rules Burma. Both Mon 
and Karen soldiers are active in the area where the pipeline 
will be laid. 
  Sources claim that Burmese troops from Kaleinaung approached 
the border on Feb 20 near Sangkhla Buri, roughly 30 kms north of 
Ban I- Tong and 10 kms south of Three Pagoda Pass. Over the 
last few weeks, the Mon National Liberation Army, which has its 
headquarters in the area, has reportedly fought intermittent 
battles with Slorc soldiers, who gained control of Three Pagoda 
Pass and Nai Et Taung several years ago. 
  At the same time, the 7,000 Mon refugees in the Loh Loe 
refugee camp near Sangkhla Buri have been ordered by Thai 
military authorities to move to Hlakhani -- located on the 
border around five kms from the Slorc military camp at Three 
Pagoda Pass -- by the end of this month. 
  Phisan Phalatsing, a leader of the Mon community in 
Thailand, 
fears that this will leave the refugees extremely vulnerable to 
attacks by Slorc. 
  "It's quite clear that the Mon are being pressured to agree 
to a ceasefire so that the pipeline can be built," he said at a 
protest held two weeks ago in front of the UN building in 
Bangkok. 
  A leaflet handed out by the Thai-Mon protesters stated that 
"Onshore and off-shore natural resources -- such as timber, 
fish, oil and gas -- left over by Mon forefathers in posterity 
are being sold at a pittance by the Slorc to benefit a small 
military clique. Mons, who are the real owners, have no voice 
whatsoever in the disposal of this inheritance." 
  Meanwhile, within Burma, 20,000-30,000 villagers have been 
conscripted to build a railroad from Ye to Tavoy and to upgrade 
the road which runs between the two coastal towns. The railroad 
is considered important for Burma's national development but 
will also make it easier for Slorc troops to secure the area 
where the pipeline will be laid. 
  Conditions at the worksites are reported to be appalling and 
have led many villagers to escape to Thailand, adding to numbers 
in refugee camps. 
  The PTT source contacted yesterday said Thailand had 
preferred a more southerly route for the pipeline but Burmese 
authorities consider the chosen route to be the best in terms of 
security. He admitted to being ignorant, however, of the 
measures being taken to secure the route. 
  "If the pipeline's impact is too harmful, the project will 
have to be dropped," he said. But he expressed hope that the 
money paid by Thailand for the gas would be spread among the 
Burmese people and used to develop the country. 
  "Funding of the pipeline will have to come from outside 
sources, so the Myanmar government will be under pressure to 
develop the pipeline in a proper way," he said. Talks over 
financing have yet to take place, he added.

  [Text] The Thai and Cambodian governments have agreed to 
maintain their existing aviation pact until October -- giving 
another breathing space to the three partly Thai-owned airlines 
operating between the countries, before Cambodia's national 
carrier takes off later this year. 
  The Thai government is trying hard to convince Cambodia to 
support the three airlines, including Kampuchea Airlines, 
Cambodia International Airlines, and SK Air in addition to Thai 
Airways International [THAI] and Bangkok Airways. 
  Cambodia however has already established a solid 
relationship 
with Singapore for its aviation future. 
  Aviation Department Director-General Sisuk Chantharangsu met 
Keo Saphal, the Director-General of Cambodia's Aviation 
Department last month. Both agreed to extend the current 
aviation agreement with some changes. They plan to meet again 
after October. 
  The amended agreement calls for each country to be allowed 
to 
increase its weekly capacity from currently 1,800 to 2,000 
seats. Thailand plans to give this additional quota to THAI and 
Bangkok Airways, while Cambodia will give it to Cambodia 
International Airlines, an industry source said. 
  Currently, Kampuchea and Cambodia International Airlines 
have 
seven flights a week while SK Airlines has four. 
  Thai businessmen are involved in ventures with all three of 
Cambodia's airlines, a result of the country's political 
instability. In November last year, the Cambodian government, 
together with Singapore Airlines (which holds 40 per cent) set 
up Royal Air Cambodge (RAC) as Cambodia's official national 
airline to replace Kampuchea. 
  The emergence of RAC will affect the three pioneering 
airlines. RAC was due to start flying by the middle of this 
year, linking Phnom Penh, Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
Flights to Japan Taiwan and Vietnam will commence later. 
Initially the new airline will use 130-180 seat Boeing 737s. 
  The industry source said Thailand's Aviation Department had 
expected the February meeting to result in the cancellation of 
the flights of the other three airlines. This was not the case. 
  "At first they (officials at the Thai aviation agency) 
thought Cambodia would have RAC benefit from aviation rights. 
It is likely that RAC is still poised for (taking over these) 
operations after October; therefore they (the Cambodian 
government) prolonged the present agreement," the source said. 
  He added that Thai investors failed to satisfy the Cambodian 
government, having yet to begin improving the airports, as they 
had earlier promised to do. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak had helped 
negotiate with the Cambodian government for the three airlines' 
continued operation. 
  Singapore Airlines now has the potential to control 
aviation-related businesses in Cambodia in the future, including 
catering, cargo, ticketing and reservation systems, the source 
said. 
  Meanwhile, the source said, Thailand approved Vietnam's 
first-ever request for transit rights in Bangkok for 
France-bound flights, starting next season. Vietnam's move is 
expected to threaten THAI's operations on that route. 
  "We have yet to estimate the damage from Vietnam's approach 
to the market. Vietnam's economy is rapidly growing, but we are 
going to lose chances. THAI will be affected," the source said.

  [Text] On 9 March, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called 
together six cabinet ministers from ministries involved with 
trade, including the Foreign Ministry and the Finance Ministry, 
to discuss deregulation and other new, market-opening measures. 
It was decided at the meeting that the compilation of the 
market-opening package would be carried out in two stages: 1) 
to work out by the end of March as many firm measures as 
possible; and 2) to work out by June details in areas expected 
to require more discussion time, in time for the G-7 summit 
meeting of major industrialized nations in Naples in July. 
  The government had planned to work out its complete, new, 
market-opening package by the end of March. However, it has 
become clear it cannot compile practical measures in such a 
short time because many government ministries and agencies have 
already implemented deregulation, among other measures, to the 
greatest degree possible. As a result, the government changed 
its plan. It decided to do its utmost to work out a 
market-opening package by the end of March, but would compile it 
in two stages, with June as the deadline for completion of the 
unfinished portion. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura made a comment at 
a news conference held the same evening. He said: "There may 
be some areas where only basic guidelines can be determined by 
the end of March. However, a complete package, to be worked out 
by June, will include these areas."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Urged To Return To Starting Point"] </F>
  [Text] "Super 301 Provision" is a popular name used to 
refer to the 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Law of the 
United States. It was approved by Congress, where the Democratic 
Party held the majority, only for a two-year period, 1989-90, 
because the then Republican administration was negative about 
invoking the provision, which calls for sanctions against unfair 
trade partners. 
  Activation of the 301 provision is planned if negotiations 
by 
the U.S. Trade Representative, after it one-sidedly determines 
unfair trade partners and unfair areas of trade, fail to produce 
agreements. It is highly possible that the Super 301 provision 
is against the GATT, which prescribes international trade rules. 
  President Clinton revived this ill-famed provision by 
issuing 
an executive order. During his presidential campaign two years 
ago, Clinton pledged that he would revive the provision. 
However, we have to say that the decision to enact the 
provision at this time is nothing but an act to apply pressure 
on, and to force Japan to, make compromises at the new 
Japan-U.S. economic talks, which are currently ruptured. 
  The President might have decided to revive the Super 301 
while considering U.S. congressional intentions and other 
matters. However, we cannot understand the bullish manner of 
threatening trade partners, saying that retaliation will be 
imposed if you do not compromise. It was a matter of course for 
the Japanese Government to file a strong protest against this 
decision. 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese Government should not end this as 
a mere chorus of criticism against the United States. It seems 
that the United States does not want to develop this into a 
trade war. In addition to other measures he took, the President 
called Prime Minister Hosokawa and explained the circumstances. 
  It is indispensable for the government to remain calm, to do 
whatever it has to do to improve the situation, while pointing 
out the unreasonableness of the United States. The government 
should exert its positive efforts to enrich contents of new 
market liberalization measures. 
  We believe that it is important for the government to go 
back 
to the starting point and review the reasons why the new trade 
talks started. 
  Discussions on whether or not an introduction of "numerical 
targets" is right, overshadowed the Japan-U.S. discussions, 
which have been held since September last year. However, we are 
certain that Japan pledged the following two points at a meeting 
held last July between former Prime Minister Miyazawa and 
President Clinton: 1) that, as a medium-range target, Japan will 
make a "quite significant reduction of it's trade surplus"; and 
2) that Japan will introduce market-opening measures in several 
fields, including automobiles and auto parts, and to establish 
"objective criteria to measure outcomes of the market-opening 
measures. 
  Speaking of reducing the trade surplus, it is viewed as a 
rough criteria to lower the trade surplus to about 2 percent of 
Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in three or four years. 
  The ratio grew to as high as 3.8 percent in the quarter 
between January and March last year. After that, it dropped to 
3 percent during between July and September due to a rapid 
appreciation of the yen. As a matter of fact, the government, 
in its economic preview for fiscal 1994, predicted the rate to 
drop to 2.8 percent. What do we need to do to make this trend 
of decline take root? 
  It is important to increase imports by stimulating domestic 
demands. However, we have no choice but to change the Japanese 
economic structure, which can survive only by exporting far more 
goods than it imports. We are of the opinion that the Hosokawa 
cabinet has to change the economic structure while accepting a 
strong yen, which is a product of the trade surplus, and to map 
out action plans with clear political intentions. 
  It is worthwhile to study the possibility of launching 
policies -- such as spelling out future tax reductions to be 
introduced after next fiscal year, additional measures of the 
10-year plan for public investments, and concrete deregulations 
measures -- which are easy to understand and will be highly 
assessed by international society. 
  Regarding negotiations in individual fields, it is said that 
considerable progress has already been made in the fields of 
government procurement and insurance services. The auto 
industry has begun to prepare voluntary plans to expand its 
purchases of [foreign] auto parts. 
  In a news conference after the Japan-U.S. summit, President 
Clinton touched on the objective criteria issue and showed his 
flexible stance by clearly stating: "We are not asking for 
something like the Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord." We hope 
that both countries will show wisdom and put the negotiations 
back into orbit by making such a remark upon occasion to break 
the deadlock.

  [Text] In relation to the issue of expanding the share of 
car and mobile phones using the U.S. Motorola system in the 
Japanese market, the Japan Mobile Communications Corporation 
(also known as IDO), which takes charge of business operations 
in the Tokyo and central Japan areas, decided on 4 March to 
build an additional 159 Motorola-system ground relay stations 
and accept most other Motorola demands. With this, the Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT], Toyota Motor Corporation 
-- IDO's major shareholder -- and other concerned parties have 
begun discussing financial and other support measures, and there 
is now a strong possibility for IDO and Motorola to reach a 
final agreement early next week [week of 6 March]. As a result, 
the U.S. trade representative's (USTR) announcement of a list of 
Japanese products subject to trade sanctions under Provision 
1377 (on telecommunications) of the U.S. Trade Act, originally 
scheduled for 17 March, can probably be avoided. 
  Since U.S. President Bill Clinton has made the decision to 
revive the Super 301 Provision (on the identification of and 
sanctions against countries guilty of unfair trade practices) of 
the U.S. Trade Act on 3 March, and overall U.S. criticism of the 
closedness of the Japanese market is on the rise, Japan seems to 
have decided to make major concessions to avoid any further 
deterioration in Japan-U.S. relations. 
  According to an informed source, IDO and Motorola, through 
their unofficial negotiations so far, have agreed that IDO would 
purchase Motorola-made equipment for 159 relay stations, which 
would be the basis for expanding business operations using the 
Motorola system, and install them in the IDO business areas, as 
Motorola demanded. They are further discussing the final details 
for: 1) IDO's reallocating a portion of the frequencies it uses 
to service NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation] 
system car and mobile phones for the Motorola system; and 2) 
IDO's purchase of around 100,000 units of Motorola car and 
mobile phones. 
  In view of this development in IDO-Motorola negotiations, 
Toyota Motor and Tokyo Electric Power Company, Inc., IDO's major 
stockholders, and the MPT have entered into deliberations on the 
means for financial support. Concrete measures being considered 
include a debt guarantee for IDO's borrowings and offering 
low-interest loans from the Japan Development Bank. 
  It is also reported that the USTR has likewise begun its 
final assessment and examination of the IDO-Motorola agreement, 
and will announce its decision on the imposition of sanctions 
against Japan in a few days. 
  In late January, IDO proposed to build 134 additional relay 
stations for the Motorola system by the end of March 1997 to 
expand the Motorola-system service area to a size comparable to 
that of the NTT system. 
  Motorola countered with a proposal for IDO to build 159 
relay 
stations by February 1995, increase the number of its service 
frequencies, and purchase 225,000 Motorola cellular phones. 
  IDO started its Motorola-system services as a result of the 
June 1989 Japan-U.S. telecommunications agreement. As of the 
end of 1993, the NTT system accounted for about 310,000 
terminals, and the Motorola system, 10,000-odd units of all IDO 
subscribers. This became the basis for the USTR's 15 February 
claim that "the Japanese Government has violated the 1989 
Japan-U.S. agreement." The USTR then indicated that the United 
States was considering a list of Japanese products to be subject 
to sanctions under the U.S. Trade Act. 
  While the Japanese Government had refuted the charge, saying 
"the 1989 agreement merely provided for the allocation of 
frequencies," it has decided to compromise in the end to avoid a 
deterioration of bilateral relations.

  [Text] It is likely that Japan will send only Labor 
Minister Chikara Sakaguchi to the ministerial talks on 
employment (the job summit) of seven industrialized nations 
including Japan, the United States, and Europe. The ostensible 
reason given by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura is 
that the summit will be held during the House of 
Representatives' Budget Committee session, and "we cannot delay 
deliberations on the budget by sending three or four people to 
it." But it appears that ministries and agencies are actually 
reluctant to send their ministers because they think the summit 
might turn into an arena for Japan-bashing by other nations 
because of Japan's huge trade surplus. 
  The job summit will be held in Detroit 14-15 March to 
discuss 
ways to deal with the seven nations' common problem of 
unemployment. From the United States, which is the host nation, 
seven cabinet members including President Bill Clinton and Vice 
President Alvin Gore will attend the summit. The six nations 
other than Japan have decided to send their finance ministers 
and labor ministers. Initially, the Japanese Government thought 
about sending its finance minister, labor minister, 
international trade and industry minister, and director general 
of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA]. It is now feared 
(according to a source in the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry [MITI]) that because Japan is the country with the 
lowest unemployment rate among the participating summit nations, 
it is likely the other nations will levy demands on Japan like 
those for market liberalization and expanded domestic demand. 
Furthermore, since the venue of the summit is the auto industry 
town of Detroit, "The United States will try to put pressure on 
Japan in connection with the suspended Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks," according to these views. 
  This means that if the MITI minister, who is in charge of 
negotiations in the auto sector, wants to participate in the 
summit, he must have something to offer. But MITI is in the 
process of hurriedly working on measures, and the minister 
cannot present something which is only half complete. The frank 
position of MITI is that its minister should not go there, if 
possible. 
  The EPA, on the other hand, is worried that, "although our 
basic position is that we want to send our minister, if the MITI 
minister does not participate, then our minister will become the 
target of criticism instead." The Ministry of Finance has no 
intention of sending either its finance minister or deputy vice 
minister, and will send only a deputy chief of the International 
Finance Bureau. 
  But there are also concerns (in the Foreign Ministry and the 
Labor Ministry) that if Japan does not send ministers to the 
summit, "it will only incite criticism against Japan." On 8 
March, officials of the Labor Ministry were close to obtaining 
support from the Liberal Democratic Party [as published] on 
sending the labor minister to the United States. The Foreign 
Ministry itself says "there has been no final decision made," 
but it appears the best that will happen is to send one minister 
-- the labor minister.

  [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], is reportedly preparing to visit the United 
States to break an impasse in the Japan-U.S. relations. Asked 
by a group of reporters about Mr. Ozawa's visit to Washington at 
the prime minister's official residence on 10 March, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa said: "I have not heard of it at all." Asked 
by a reporter if he has ever discussed the issue with Mr. Ozawa, 
the prime minister said: "I have not discussed it with him. 
When I inquired of each ministry and agency about his reported 
visit to Washington, all of them said they did not know about 
his visit to the United States."

  [Text] "For foreign semiconductor manufacturers to expand 
their market share in Japan, they must tackle the consumer 
electronic products sector, selling more discrete semiconductor 
devices, for instance." That is the conclusion of a report 
prepared by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan 
(EIAJ; chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto), which looked at the 
relationship between conditions in the Japanese semiconductor 
market and market shares of foreign-made semiconductors in 
Japan. Copies of the report have been distributed to U.S. 
Government offices and U.S. manufacturers. 
  With statistics on the Japanese market share of foreign-made 
semiconductors in 1993 expected to be announced soon, and with 
intergovernmental talks expected to begin shortly, the 
association, through the report, is seeking the understanding of 
the U.S. industry of Japanese market conditions and is urging 
U.S. industry to increase its own efforts. 
  The report has five parts, and runs to more than 60 pages in 
English. So far, parts one and two have been distributed, and 
the remainder of the report will be issued by the end of next 
week. 
  The association said it had taken about half a year to 
prepare. Copies are being sent to the Semiconductor Industry 
Association (SIA), manufacturers affiliated with the SIA, U.S. 
Government offices, research organizations, and news media 
organizations in the United States. 
  The report presents the trend of market share held by 
Japanese and foreign semiconductors in the consumer product and 
in industrial product areas from 1990 up to the third quarter of 
1993. It claims that in that period the market share of foreign 
semiconductors grew from 12.8 percent to 16.7 percent of the 
total semiconductor market in the industrial product area and 
from 2.9 percent to 5.5 percent in the consumer product area. 
  But the breakdown of products bought in the second and third 
quarters of 1993 shows that among foreign semiconductors, 
integrated circuits for bipolar-type digital-processing, which 
account for only 5 percent of the total Japanese market, held 
the largest share. These circuits are used mostly as logic 
elements in computers. On the other hand, the foreign share of 
the less-integrated, discrete semiconductor devices, which 
account for more than 20 percent of the total Japanese market, 
was only 6.2 percent. 
  The report notes that while the consumer semiconductor 
market 
accounts for less than 5 percent of the total U.S. semiconductor 
market, it represents about 40 percent of the total Japanese 
market. The report therefore suggests that foreign 
semiconductors can win a bigger share by putting the emphasis on 
sales of semiconductors in this area -- primarily by increasing 
sales of discrete devices. 
  As an illustration of the openness of the Japanese market, 
the report also points out that instances of foreign 
semiconductor makers cooperating with Japanese finished-product 
makers from the design-in stage jumped six-fold in the six years 
between 1986 and 1992.

  [Text] The reason the Electronic Industries Association of 
Japan compiled a report on the Japanese industry's position on 
the Japan-U.S. semiconductor issue, and distributed it in the 
United States, is that it wants to prevent the issue from 
reemerging as a bilateral political controversy. 
  Since foreign semiconductors have succeeded in taking up 20 
percent of the Japanese market, as provided in the Japan-U.S. 
semiconductor agreement, the Japanese electronic industry claims 
that "we already maintain a good relationship with the U.S. 
industry." It has so far remained calm. However, the 
possibility remains that the U.S. Government, which now takes a 
tough attitude toward Japan in economic issues, may again take 
up the semiconductor issue. 
  The semiconductor industry has not shown signs of being 
affected by the U.S. Government's recent revival of the Super 
301 provision (on the identification of and sanctions against 
countries guilty of unfair trade practices) of the U.S. Trade 
Act, and the tension in bilateral relations. While the share of 
foreign semiconductors has shown some decline since 1993, U.S. 
makers have been making moderate remarks all along -- such as: 
"We believe our company's share in Japan will continue to grow. 
We do not have any complaints against Japan" (according to a 
Motorola executive). 
  In fact, the U.S. semiconductor industry's hands are quite 
full with meeting the U.S. market's booming demands. It has 
limited capability to supply the Japanese market. This is in 
great contrast to the past situation when both the U.S. 
Government and industry were unanimous in their criticism of 
Japan. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. Government may still take up the 
semiconductor issue because semiconductors are a model case for 
setting numerical targets, which is the key issue in the present 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, and this is being used as a 
"tool" in the overall negotiations. The share of foreign 
semiconductors in the fourth quarter of 1993 will be announced 
in mid-March, to be followed by bilateral semiconductor talks at 
the government level. 
  Earlier this month, the U.S. Semiconductor Industry 
Association [SIA] issued a report saying the share of foreign 
semiconductors in Japan will be 25-30 percent in 1996. While 
"this is merely a forecast, and is not a demand being presented 
to the government" (according to a SIA official), the 
semiconductor agreement is scheduled to be reviewed in the 
second half of 1994, and there is a possibility that the U.S. 
Government may make this a new demand. 
  As the semiconductor issue is facing a delicate political 
timetable, the important thing is to make sure that face-saving 
measures will be ready for the U.S. Government, which has 
"brandished its fist." Although the U.S. industry does not seem 
to have any misgivings about the semiconductor issue, it is not 
in a position to go against the government's wishes. 
  At a news conference given by the U.S. and Japanese 
semiconductor industries in June 1993, a Texas Instruments 
executive stated that "it is better not to have government 
intervention"; he was said to have incurred the U.S. 
Government's ire. Later, the SIA "revised" its comments and 
claimed that it "supports the Clinton administration's 
result-oriented trade policy." 
  Therefore, the Japanese position at present is to try to win 
the U.S. Government's understanding while working to prevent the 
setting of new market-share targets -- which would be the worst 
scenario for Japan -- and, at the same time, seek new forms of 
bilateral cooperation, such as "design-in" (joint development 
from the design phase).

<F P=106> [Report on interview with French Foreign Trade Minister </F>
Gerard Longuet by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter Shota Kobayashi 
in Paris on 8 March] 
  [Text] Paris, 8 Mar -- During the interview, Foreign Trade 
Minister Longuet criticized the United States for having 
reinstated the Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act (which identifies nations engaging in unfair 
trade practices and imposes sanctions against them), saying: 
"The nation has unilaterally brought the bilateral confrontation 
into the present trade system." Longuet expressed deep concern 
over the U.S. Government's intervention in private-sector trade. 
Moreover, he stated that he would urge Japan to open markets in 
the public works and high-technology fields during his visit to 
Japan. With regard to voluntary export restraints on Japanese 
cars to the European Union (EU), he mentioned his intention to 
introduce regulations on the total number of Japanese cars, 
including cars produced within the EU area. 
  Regarding the U.S. Government's reinstatement of the Super 
301 provision, Longuet stressed: "It is a surprise to us to 
learn that the United States made a one-sided decision, which 
targets Japan, its largest trade partner, with the signing of 
GATT's Uruguay Round agreement near at hand." He said: "Such a 
method has already gone down in history." He then pointed out 
that long-term multilateral negotiations through such 
organizations as the World Trade Organization (WTO) are 
important for the sake of maintaining the trade balance. 
  Citing the White House's announcement on the sale of private 
U.S. airplanes to Saudi Arabia, Longuet expressed his 
displeasure and said: "The United States has a strong tendency 
to politically intervene in private-sector trade." He added: 
"The country is trying to promote foreign trade while 
disregarding market economy rules." 
  On economic relations with Japan, Longuet touched on the 
fact 
that France's trade deficit with Japan for 1993 decreased to 24 
billion francs (a franc equals about 18 yen) from 30 billion 
francs the previous year. He expressed dissatisfaction, saying: 
"The main cause of the decrease is a drop in imports due to the 
economic recession in France." 
  Longuet indicated that, to correct the trade imbalance, he 
would continue to urge Japan to open markets in the service 
fields, including high-technology products such as helicopters; 
public works; and the agricultural products field. 
  He also stressed: "The main point at issue lies not in 
individual sectors but in Japan's structural trade surplus." 
Longuet expressed expectations for his visit to Japan, saying: 
"I believe that as the Japanese-U.S. relationship is now facing 
difficulty, this is a good opportunity for us to bring about a 
better understanding of Japan's claims to the United States and 
European nations." 
  With regard to Japan's voluntary restraint of exporting 
automobiles to the EU, he pointed out: "The drop (in sales) of 
Japanese cars was small in 1993 compared with the drop in sales 
on the EU market as a whole." The minister stated that the 
French Government would ask Japan to set a goal for voluntary 
export restraints so that it can adjust the excess of exports 
for 1993 during the following two years -- 1994 and 1995. 
  Exports of Japanese cars to the EU last year decreased by 20 
percent from the previous year to reach 980,000 units, and the 
decrease was larger than the drop in sales on the European 
market (which registered a 16 percent decrease). For this 
reason, it is believed that he made the remarks taking into 
consideration the idea of introducing regulation on the total 
amount which includes locally-produced automobiles.

  [Text] The government, which will begin providing the 
fourth yen-based loan to China in 1996, has decided to give 
priority to measures for tackling environmental problems, the 
development of inland regions, and projects for upgrading 
infrastructures which could serve the people's livelihood. The 
government will send a fact-finding team composed of 
working-level officials to China on 7 March to survey the 
possibility of implementing the projects by area. Based on the 
results of the survey, Prime Minister Hosokawa will notify the 
Chinese side of Japan's basic plan for the fourth yen-based loan 
when he visits China on 19 March. As for the size of the fourth 
yen-based loan which has become a focal point, the prime 
minister will not present the Chinese side with the size because 
of a delay in China's formal request for the loan. The two 
countries are expected to continue coordination of their views 
on the size for an accord within this year. 
  The fact-finding team, which will leave Japan on 7 March, is 
made up of officials from the Foreign Ministry, the Finance 
Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the 
Economic Planning Agency, and other officials from the Overseas 
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF). It will examine the 
feasibility of about 70 projects presented unofficially by China 
from the standpoint of providing the fourth yen-based loan to 
China as a "symbolic loan" to finance the projects for 
Japan-China cooperation," (according to Foreign Minister Hata). 
  For the project for tackling environmental problems, a 
centerpiece of the fourth yen-based loan, the government is 
likely to incorporate aid for measures to tackle acid rain that 
would "eventually benefit" Japan. Taking seriously a conspicuous 
delay in China's measures to deal with pollution resulting from 
that country's rapid industrialization, the government plans to 
provide China with Japan's advanced desulfurization facilities 
in the fourth yen-based loan that serve to prevent air and water 
pollution. 
  Japan and China are presently studying the possibility of 
reviewing China's reform and open up policy that places its 
priority on production-related facilities and the development of 
coastal regions and of providing preferentially funds for 
industrial development in inland regions. 
  China has asked for Japan's cooperation for construction of 
a 
Beijing-Shanghai bullet train line and the fact-finding team 
will examine the demand for intercity traffic. The government 
plans to continue Japan's aid in the fourth yen-based loan for 
priority projects for construction of water supply facilities 
and sewages which were implemented under the first, second, and 
third yen-based loans to China to help it improve people's 
livelihood. 
  The Japanese Government explains that Prime Minister 
Hosokawa 
will present the Chinese side with Japan's basic plan for the 
fourth yen-based loan, but will not present it with the size of 
the loan because China has yet to make a formal request for the 
loan following a delay in its domestic procedures and the 
failure of working-level Japanese and Chinese officials to 
finalize details of the loan. 
  Japan started providing China with 330.9 billion yen in the 
first yen-based loan for 1979-1984 and expanded to 800 billion 
yen in the third yen-based loan for 1990-1995. It has been 
decided that duration of the fourth yen-based loan will be 
shortened to three years out of concern over expansion of 
China's military buildup.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has decided the system of controlling exports of 
strategic materials, including machine tools which might be used 
for producing weapons of mass destruction, will be simplified 
successively beginning 1 April. Since the international system 
for controlling exports of nuclear weapons and missiles has been 
strengthened, many more items have now been placed under 
control. Therefore, MITI has decided to take this measure to 
lessen the office work of businessmen engaged in export, such as 
trading firms. In practice, a blanket permit system [hokatsu 
kyoka-sei] will be introduced for applications for exports to 
Western countries--those countries unlikely to become involved 
in conflicts. Once an application is approved, no further 
separate applications will be necessary for a period of three 
years. Moreover, procedures for applications will be 
simplified, and part of the permit-issuance authority will be 
transferred to local bureaus of industry and international trade. 
  There are many varieties of materials and mechanical 
equipment which can be used for producing such weapons of mass 
destruction as nuclear weapons, biological and chemical weapons, 
and missiles; in addition to machine tools needed for producing 
nuclear weapons, there is equipment for producing rockets as 
well as carbon fiber and super alloys. Concerning the export of 
strategic materials, the international control system has been 
improved by such countries as Japan, the United States, and 
European nations. As a result, the number of items under 
control has increased, and the number of permits issued by MITI 
increased from less than 20,000 in 1991 to 80,000 in 1993. 
  According to the blanket permit system, once the application 
is approved, individual applications for exports of materials 
under control will be exempted for a certain period of time. 
This system will be applied for a period of three years to 
applications for exports to Western countries which have joined 
international export control systems such as the Australia Group 
[as published] (participants in the conference on control of 
materials that can be used for producing chemical weapons), as 
well as applications for export for a period of two years to 
affiliated companies established in countries other than the 
United States and European nations with the capital of parent 
companies. MITI estimates that with the introduction of the 
blanket permit system, the number of applications for export 
permits will be reduced by about 60 percent. 
  Moreover, the system of requesting preliminary examinations 
prior to the application will be abolished. Procedures for 
applications will be largely simplified and the examination 
period shortened. Moreover, the authority of issuing permits to 
applications for exports to those Western countries which are 
participants in the export control system will be transferred 
from MITI to local bureaus of industry and international trade 
hopefully beginning this fall. 
  A blanket permit system will also be introduced for export 
of 
cargoes as well as for transactions in service based on the same 
contract. Presently in cases of applying exports of machine 
tools and programs for operating these tools, separate 
applications are requested for permits, even if exports are 
based on the same contract, because these permits are issued on 
the basis of different laws and regulations. Therefore, 
dissatisfaction has been voiced among those engaged in the 
export business.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 6 Mar 94 Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to play its 
part in portraying a better image of Japan. Beginning this 
spring, the ministry plans to begin improving the look of 
Japanese ambassadors and other diplomats by having them listen 
to advice from experts so they can present their best 
impressions when appearing in television interviews. As stated 
by a Foreign Ministry source, it is felt "there are not many 
diplomats who are used to the mass media." Therefore, the 
ministry plans to launch a campaign to promote diplomacy in a 
manner "which makes Japan visible" by making on-the-job 
improvements in its diplomatic stance, a stance which has often 
been described abroad as being "hard to understand." 
  Those who are to newly undergo this "media training" program 
are mostly diplomats who have the greatest chance of being 
interviewed by the mass media, such as ambassadors and directors 
of overseas centers for public relations and cultural affairs. 
Japanese diplomatic missions overseas will sign contracts with 
consultants who will review video recordings of the interviews 
of various diplomats and check on minute details--such as their 
pronunciation, accents, pauses in speech, gestures, and even 
their tastes in neckties. In this way, the consultants will 
determine how the diplomats can most effectively appeal to their 
audiences in future interviews with the mass media.

  [Text] The government is having trouble drawing up its 
foreign economic policies after the breakdown of the new 
Japan-U.S. economic consultations. Giving up plans to reshuffle 
the cabinet has weakened the Hosokawa administration's 
leadership, and the concerned ministries and agencies are not 
working vigorously enough. At the informal 9 March cabinet 
meeting, it was decided that the government would back off from 
its original decision to announce its policies in a single 
package before the end of March; instead, part of these policies 
would be compiled in late March, and the remainder, before the 
Naples Summit (of leaders of the advanced countries) in July. 
While the automobile industry is now preparing to issue 
voluntary plans for the purchase of additional U.S.-made parts, 
this is not likely to meet U.S. expectations of a large-scale 
increase. Although the government wants these foreign economic 
policies to be a stepping stone toward reconciliation with the 
United States, the United States is not likely to be pacified by 
the first batch of measures to be announced. There is now a 
strong possibility that tension in bilateral relations may 
continue for some time. 
  The government has basically decided on including the 
following measures concerned with the priority negotiation areas 
at the framework talks in the first batch of economic measures 
to be announced by the end of this month: 1) the stationing of a 
permanent Transport Ministry inspector in Detroit to facilitate 
the issuance of certificates for American cars; and 2) 
expediting procedures for approving new insurance products. 
  Furthermore, the package is also expected to include the 
implementation of the government procurement action plan, the 
formulation of a guideline on the Antimonopoly Law in relation 
to public works projects bidding, and import-stimulation 
measures in the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  However, the above measures have either been predicted 
previously or have already been announced. Even the officials 
in charge admit that they are "not impressive" (according to a 
senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry official). 
While the merit of the economic measures actually depends on 
how far new policies can be drawn up, concrete measures 
regarding deregulation in the flow of commodities, and 
improvement of customs procedures have not been finalized, 
although they are actually being discussed. Officials of the 
Cabinet Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs, responsible for 
compiling deregulation measures, lament that "the ministries are 
all reluctant." 
  With regard to macroeconomic measures, even the agenda has 
not been decided upon. The government is unable to take any 
action on the extension of the income tax cut beyond 1994, an 
issue in which the United States shows great interest, because 
this has to wait for the ruling coalition parties' consultations 
on tax reform to reach a conclusion. As to setting a voluntary 
target for reducing the current accounts surplus, while some 
cabinet members are in favor of this idea, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa takes a negative position. There is evident 
vacillation in the cabinet. 
  A factor contributing to this lukewarm attitude toward 
compiling economic measures is the internal strife within the 
administration, as evidenced by the abortion of the cabinet 
reshuffle plan. While Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura is supposed to be responsible for compiling the foreign 
economic measures, cynics in the concerned ministries and 
agencies ask: "Does he really have the full confidence of the 
prime minister?" The bureaucrats doubt if they can have the 
full support of the ruling coalition parties if they come up 
with deregulation measures, which businesses are expected to 
oppose fiercely.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's administration 
still enjoys a high support rating despite the split among the 
ruling coalition parties and their meanderings. To find out 
why, the ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll in late 
February, asking pollees to answer freely as to why they do or 
do not support the Hosokawa administration. An analysis of the 
poll results was then made. 
  According to the analysis, the high support rating seems to 
be backed by a feeling of disgust and revulsion toward the 
Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] long reign and an expectation 
for the new administration. Although the prime minister himself 
is very popular, a negative appraisal of LDP politics seems to 
be linked to a high support rating for the Hosokawa 
administration rather than a positive appraisal of the 
administration. 
  On the other hand, complaints against the prime minister, 
such as his "indecisiveness," and criticism of some of the 
administration's specific policies, such as the "national 
welfare tax" and the "rice issue," were given as primary reasons 
for nonsupport. 
  In the latest poll, the support rating for the Hosokawa 
administration was 57 percent. Among 1,231 respondents who 
indicated support for the administration in response to a 
free-to-answer-question on reasons for their support, 18 percent 
accounted for the majority with these respondents saying they 
supported the administration because "it was not an LDP 
administration." There were other remarks which indicated a 
deep-rooted distrust of the LDP. For example, some respondents 
said: "I do not like the LDP at all because it is corrupt and 
causes too many problems, so I am fed up with it," while others 
said: "I am tired of the long [LDP] reign." 
  The next group of supporters, also at 18 percent, gave 
"expectation" for the administration as the reason for their 
support. Among their remarks were: "Although there are many 
problems at the moment, I hold expectations for the future"; 
"Politics will change"; "It is likely to bring about a new wave 
in politics"; and "Maybe Japan will change." Thus, it seems 
people still hold deep-rooted expectations for the new 
administration after over six months have elapsed since its 
inauguration.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held talks with 
new leaders of the Japan New Party [JNP], including newly 
elected Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka, at a Tokyo restaurant 
on the evening of 8 March. According to those present, the 
prime minister stressed that he intended to proceed with his 
idea of forming a unified parliamentary group among the ruling 
coalition parties. He said: "Unless the ruling coalition 
parties become unified, we cannot compete with the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP]." 
  The prime minister instructed JNP leaders to form a new 
organization such as a policy study group, which would include 
LDP members who were willing to act in concert with the ruling 
coalition on such issues as tax system reform and deregulation. 
  Touching on "conditions for partnership," the prime minister 
mentioned the following four points: 1) promotion of tax system 
reform to prepare for an aging society; 2) maintenance of the 
Uruguay Round structure; 3) implementation of deregulation and 
administrative reform that produces practical results; and 4) 
cooperation in coming elections. The prime minister stressed: 
"We need to get together under a united aim and increase group 
members." 
  On the current state of the ruling coalition, the prime 
minister said: "Although I intend to accept the views (of 
various parties), harmony within the overall coalition is 
important. It would be inappropriate for one of the coalition 
parties to expand." 
  He added: "Some LDP members have not yet made up their minds 
to join Sakigake [Harbinger], Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] or 
JNP. As dozens of LDP members share with the JNP a similar 
sense of values, it would be best for them to join our study 
group." 
  With the upper house election set for summer next year, and 
the next general election also in mind, the prime minister said: 
"Our aim is to sweep out political corruption. I intend to 
achieve it." His comments restated his intention to place 
emphasis on the task of dealing with political corruption 
involving the general contractor scandal. 
  Secretary General Matsuoka, who was elected on 8 March, held 
a news conference prior to the talks with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, and touched on relations with Sakigake, with which the 
JNP has promised to merge. Matsuoka clarified an intention to 
strengthen the cooperative relationship with the party in the 
future, saying: "We would like to cooperate with Sakigake as 
the core of the coalition administration." 
  On the prime minister's idea of forming a unified 
parliamentary group, Matsuoka said: "If we are to win 
elections, this is a natural idea. At present, though, is it 
appropriate to discuss the possibility the coalition will be 
divided into two or three groups?" 
  His remarks raised a question about the policies of Sakigake 
and other parties, and indicated a cautious stance toward an 
early merger with Sakigake. 
  It is also reported the prime minister did not issue any 
concrete instructions on the issue of merging with Sakigake at a 
general meeting of JNP lower and upper house members on the same 
day. The reality is that differences between the two parties 
have not been narrowed.

  [Text] Top officials of Keidanren [Federation of Economic 
Organizations of Japan] and Rengo [Japanese Trade Union 
Confederation] held a meeting at a Tokyo hotel on 8 March to 
discuss establishing a third-party organization aimed at 
promoting administrative reform, and deregulation in particular. 
They agreed that the third-party organization should be managed 
by the private sector without members who are ex-governmental 
officials. Japan-U.S. relations have become stressed due to 
Japan's surplus. Both Keidanren and Rengo believe that Japan 
should aim at reducing the surplus by promoting structural 
reform, particularly through deregulation, and that deregulation 
conducted mainly by bureaucrats may be limited in its effect. 
Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa and other top officials 
intend to make a formal proposal on their demands to top 
officials of the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA], 
including Director General Koshiro Ishida on 24 March. 
  The concept of setting up a third-party body is based on the 
recommendations previously made by the "Economic Reform Study 
Council" (known as the Hiraiwa Council) and the Ad Hoc Council 
for Promoting Administrative Reform. The MCA is currently 
studying details of this body. However, Keidanren thinks "the 
fact that bureaucrats, mainly from the MCA, assume leadership in 
working out the bill is, in itself, a problem," (according to 
the Keidanren Secretariat). Thus, top Keidanren and Rengo 
officials decided to discuss this matter in depth. 
  During the meeting, Rengo Secretary General Washio said: "As 
a third-party organization, it should exclude members who speak 
for the government ministries and agencies and it should select 
members mainly from the private sector. It should have an 
independent secretariat and be granted rights to recommend 
investigations and to order submission of related documents." 
  Keidanren Vice Chairman Isao Nakauchi said: "I quite agree 
with you." Thus, the participants agreed on excluding former 
governmental officials. 
  With regard to the issue of reducing Japan's surplus, they 
agreed that "while we oppose setting up numerical targets, it is 
necessary to promote cutting the surplus in various ways, 
including expansion of domestic demand."

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] 
plans to start experimenting with a super-fast communications 
network which will link research institutions and handle massive 
amounts of data at 60 times the speed of existing networks. The 
ministry plans to connect its Communications Research Laboratory 
(CRL) (located in Koganei City, Tokyo) with the Nippon Telegraph 
and Telephone Corporation (NTT), Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co., Ltd. 
(KDD), and domestic computer makers via this network. The 
ministry also plans to invite overseas research institutions to 
participate in the project which will be promoted in response to 
a similar project underway in the United States, called the 
National Research and Education Network (NREN) project. The 
U.S. project links universities and research institutions 
throughout the nation. It has now become clear that as core 
projects which will serve as the basis for the multimedia age, 
both Japan and the United States plan to place emphasis on the 
construction of communications networks which link research 
institutions together. 
  The planned network is to consist of a massive fiber optical 
network capable of transmitting a maximum 10 giga-bits of data 
per second, coupled with the latest ATM (asynchronous 
transmission mode) converters designed to handle such data. 
This is 66 times the maximum amount of data the NTT is capable 
of transmitting via its communications networks which are 
currently in service. These have a maximum transmitting 
capacity of 150 mega-bits per second. 
  The network is to connect the MOPT's CRL with the NTT's 
Communications Network Research Laboratory (CNRL) (located in 
Musashino City, Tokyo), the KDD's KDD Laboratory (located in 
Kamifukuoka City, Saitama Prefecture), the Japan Broadcasting 
Corporation's (NHK) Broadcasting Technologies Laboratory 
(located in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo) and the International 
Telecommunications Basic Technologies Research Laboratory (ATR 
[expansion unknown], located in Seika-cho, Kyoto), a 
government-private corporation. It is expected the network will 
also link the CRL later on with research institutions managed by 
such computer makers as the NEC Corporation, Fujitsu Ltd., and 
IBM Japan. 
  Calling its project the "Global Giga-Bit Network" (G-Net), 
the MOPT plans to broadens its scope to include participation by 
foreign research institutions via a super-fast overseas 
communications network for the use of which the NTT has signed 
an agreement with the American Telephone and Telegraph 
(AT&amp;T). 
  In its project, the MOPT plans to emphasize the testing of 
technology for operating and maintaining communications networks 
and the development of new ways to use networks by utilizing 
supercomputers and databases managed by other facilities. The 
development of new uses is expected to cover a broad field 
extending from communications uses, such as video conferencing 
which features clear video images, and teletherapy, in which 
diagnosis is conducted by transmitting video images of medical 
information to remote places, to environmental research in which 
air pollution and meteorological phenomena are analyzed on a 
global scale. 
  The MOPT plans to spend 488 million yen, as approved in the 
third supplementary budget for fiscal year 1993, to improve 
computer systems and communications facilities at the CRL. The 
NTT will provide large-capacity fiber optic cables free of 
charge, while research institutions will set up necessary 
facilities on their own. Participating institutions plan to set 
up a liaison body and hopefully complete the network by March 
1995.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Malaysia Defense Minister </F>
Mohamed Najib by ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter Osamu Daiwa in Kuala 
Lumpur; date not given] 
  [Text] At a recent interview with an ASAHI SHIMBUN 
reporter, Defense Minister Mohamed Najib, man of influence in 
Malaysian politics, revealed that he is going to push through an 
armaments modernization plan on the ground that "it is now an 
unpredictable and uncertain period of time, despite the fact 
that the Cold War rivalries among the big powers are gone." He 
added that "he would avoid relying on either of the big powers 
for weapons supply," and made it clear that Malaysia will 
continue to purchase weapons not only from the United States but 
also from a number of countries, including Russian-made MiG 
fighters. He also emphasized the necessity of expanding 
multilateral dialogue to prevent conflicts. He made it clear 
that he would request from Japan the knowhow and money for 
maintaining the security of the Malacca Straits. 
  As for foreign relations, including those with the United 
States and Europe, the defense minister stressed that "ours is 
based on mutual respect." He made reference to press reports on 
suspected scandals involving Malaysian Government leaders in 
such projects as the British export of weapons and construction 
of power plants developing into the economic sanctions against 
the United Kingdom. He said, "I do not intend to apply pressure 
on mass media but I have to give signals that unfounded slanders 
against foreign leaders cannot be tolerated." 
  With reference to guaranteeing security, he said: 
"Modernizing outdated defense capabilities is a priority for 
the security of Malaysia, situated in a geopolitial location 
surrounded by wide seas. It is not intended to respond to 
specific threats but is a due conclusion of logic. 
Modernization of armaments is different from expansion of 
armaments." 
  At the same time, he made a point of emphasizing 
independence 
in choosing armaments and techniques by saying "you cannot rely 
on outsiders for security." As for the kind of the 
next-generation fighter planes for which hot contests have been 
waged by U.S. F-18's and Russian MiG-29's, he made it public 
that MiGs are included as a future choice. Leading Defense 
Ministry officials present at the interview said: "It is based 
on the policy of avoiding reliance on one country in weapons 
purchases." 
  In the meantime, the defense minister said: "Security must 
be dealt with in a broad sense, including economy, psychology, 
sentiments, and welfare and environmental problems as well as 
from a military point of view. It is rather dangerous to think 
of filling the power vacuum caused by post-Cold War changes of 
the big powers. Importance must be attached to the maintenance 
of good relations, with emphasis on economy, with all countries." 
  Based on that viewpoint, he pointed out "the importance of 
preventive diplomacy based on military [preparedness]." He 
placed a high value on ASEAN's first security forum to be 
participated in by Japan and the United States and so on in late 
July at Bangkok by saying that "it shows that trust is being 
built up." As for the Asia Pacific Economic Council [APEC], he 
said, "We will join in so far as it does not incorporate ASEAN 
or institutionalize it." 
  He said that "he believes that Prime Minister D.S. Mahathir 
bin Mohamed will participate" in the APEC summit to be convened 
in Jakarta at the end of the year. 
  With reference to China, he "hopes for it to continue 
policies to encourage foreign investments for its economic 
modernization and does not anticipate security problems, at 
least for a short while." He added: "But I understand that 
China has lingering domestic problems. I am closely following 
what movements the Chinese leadership will make after Deng 
Xiaoping and on the modernization of armaments, including the 
introduction of long-range bombers and aircraft carriers." 
  As for Vietnam, he said: "Now is the time for her to share 
the development and prosperity of Southeast Asia," welcomed "her 
restored relation with the United States," and made public that 
he intends to lead other nations in assisting her participation 
in ASEAN. 
  With regards to Japan, he looks forward to more 
contributions 
to the area in economic, technical, and medical fields and asked 
Japan to "share efforts in maintaining security" in the Malacca 
Straits. As for the East Asia Economic Council being promoted by 
Malaysia, he asked for Japanese agreement by saying: "I am 
waiting, although I have not obtained any new indication." At 
the same time, he indicated that he would press for more opening 
up of markets by saying: "The Japanese markets are very 
important to our country in the course of pursuing 
industrialization." 
  Defense Minister Najib -- number three man in UMNO [the 
United Malays National Organization], a national organization of 
Malays as well as the ruling political party. Son of the late 
Razhak, the second prime minister after independence. After 
graduating from a British university he served in important 
government posts. Though young at age 40, he is regarded as the 
man of influence next to Prime Minister Mahathir and D.S. Anwar 
bin Ibrahim, deputy prime minister and finance minister.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 10 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Today here 
the three days conference on the theme "The Issues of Reforming 
the Local Governing ", which was organized by the nongovernment 
Center of Social Science, Civic Education and Human Rights with 
assistance of the US Conference is to promote formation of 
democratic system of local governing and management, especially 
from theoretical- methodical and conceptual aspects. 
  In the first day of the conference presented were four basic 
reports of the agenda, including a report by the Mongolian 
parliament member, one of the elaborators the country's new 
Constitution B. Chimid "The Basic Principles of the Local 
Governing System and its Democratic Bases in the Constitution, 
Ways of Their Realization", a report by expert in politics and 
sociology S. Erdenetuul "General Regularity of Formation of 
Principles of Local Self-Governing by International Experience 
and Reflection of Peculiarities of the Country". 
  During the hearing and discussion of the reports a number of 
conceptual differences were revealed on the issues of local 
governing, contradictions in interpretation of legal concepts 
between law-makers and experts, in particular, in definition of 
a status of the Hural of representatives of citizens at Somon 
and Aymag level, its inter-relations with a head of 
administrative governing, distribution of powers and functions 
between them. 
  Presence of such theoretical contradictions, confusion at a 
conceptual level were confirmed in speeches of practical workers 
secretaries of Aymag, City Hurals of representatives of citizens. 
  As they said, representatives of local elected authorities 
are practically fully dependent on heads of administrations, do 
not have a real power to solve any local issue. 
  The State Great Hural members, specialists and lawyers of 
different institutes and state establishments, secretaries of 
all City and Aymag Hurals of representatives of citizens are 
participating in work of the conference.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 10 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that the State Great Hural 
Standing Committee on Food and Agriculture at its sitting has 
discussed the draft law on protection of camel live-stock and 
the draft conception of the state policy on protection of the 
total live-stock of cattle in the country. Despite the absence 
of these issues on the agenda of the forthcoming spring session 
of the parliament, the Standing Committee recognized as 
expedient submitting of them to the session for consideration. 
As the newspaper notes, the necessity of working out of a 
conception of the state policy on protection of the total live- 
stock of the country proceeds from reduction of its number as 
compared with 1990, although in these years export of meat has 
reduced by several times. 
  As the newspaper informs, the Council on Regulation and 
Organization of Work on Maintenance of Public Order, which is 
functioning under the president, at its regular sitting has 
discussed the tasks for 1994. The council noted that the state, 
administrative and public organizations have to exert efforts on 
strengthening of public order, struggle with hard drinking, 
theft, economic crimes and malfeasanse, for improvement of 
discipline and responsibility. 
  In an interview with the newspaper correspondent the State 
Great Hural member D. Demberel, who has been recently to Germany 
at the invitation of the Finance Committee of Bundestag, noting 
that in this country a great importance is attached to 
independence of the Bundesbank, he says that Germany understands 
Mongolia's peculiarities and her economic difficulties. In D. 
Demberet's view, Germany can serve as one of the basic supports 
in strengthening of cooperation of Mongolia with Europarliament 
and the European Union. 
  The newspaper informs that the Ministry of Demographic 
Policy 
and Labour has approved the order of involvement of citizens in 
labour activity in the course of part-time work, a week or 
according to agreements with an immediate payment. The order is 
directed to the growth of labour employment and incomes of the 
population, reduction of unemployment. 
  The newspaper publishes an article by journalist B. Baabar. 
He points out to inevitability of economic independence of the 
country on the two neighbouring powers. In the journalist's 
view, Mongolia's independence depends on favourable external 
conditions and consciousness of citizens. 
  The newspaper of the Mongolian National Democratic Party 
[MNDP] "ERH CHOLOO" informs that the MNDP leader D. Ganbold has 
left for the FRG on a visit on the line of the K. Edenauer Fund. 
D. Ganbold is going to attend a series of lectures at the 
European Academy in Berlin, give a lecture on economic situation 
of Mongolia. 
  As the newspaper informs, the general secretary of the 
Mongolian National Democratic Party E. Bat-uul has received the 
first secretary of the Embassy of the USA to Mongolia S. 
Martini, exchanged views with her on socio-economic situation of 
the country. 
  Journalist B. Terguun writes in the newspaper that the 
country's vital interests are connected with the use of oil 
resources. The author of the article notes that an unexpected 
interest of Russia and China in Mongolia's oil resources first 
of all is indicative not of economic interest, but of political 
accounts. As B. Terguun considers, the President P. Ochirbat 
should take into his own hands Mongolia's policy in the sphere 
of oil. 
  Quoting the publication in the Third Volume of Selected 
Works 
by Deng Xiaoping his talks with the Soviet Leader of that time 
M. S. Gorbachev, the newspaper notes that the two neighbouring 
countries are still pursuing the traditional great-power policy 
in relation to Mongolia. 
  The newspaper publishes an article by Professor S. Badarch, 
who notes that the democratic reforms in the country have opened 
new perspectives for study of history and traditions of 
Mongolia, including real assessment of the role of the last 
Bogdo-haan in his policy put the tasks of consolidation of 
consent of all sections of the population, revival of traditions 
of the Mongolian state system, development of economy and 
culture.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Fidel Ramos by Manila </F>
correspondent Rigoberto Tiglao; place, date not given] 
  [Text] Do you think that your image as a decisive 
president has been damaged by the rollback of petroleum prices 
and the lifting of the levy you imposed in September? 
  It may have been, but I'm not worrying about prestige now. 
As long as we can keep things going, I am willing to take the 
flak. There are certain costs to be paid and I'm willing to take 
those now. 
  What was the levy really for? 
  It was to fund the electric power projects we needed so we 
wouldn't have brown-outs. Funds were necessary not only for the 
power plants but also for the distribution lines. The 
three-week suspension was really a holding operation, not a step 
backwards, which we needed so we could identify alternative 
measures. 
  The observation has been made that one of the country's 
biggest problems is political gridlock between the executive 
branch and Congress. Do you think that the Congress, especially 
the Senate, has been an obstructionist body? 
  I'm saying that in the past 18 months, the Congress has been 
very productive. There are many important laws enacted and they 
are of high quality, and we collaborated with them on these. We 
have discussions with legislators once a week, and we have more 
regular dialogues now with the leadership of the House and the 
Senate, so we can chart directions more precisely. The senators 
tell me that one of their problems is that there are just 23 of 
them, and they are supposed to deal with the products of 200 
congressmen, so they are swamped with work. 
  The oil levy controversy has highlighted the budget 
deficit as the biggest block to economic growth. Are you 
confident of solving this problem? 
  You have to look at the bigger picture. The total deficit 
has been going down substantially, and we'll bring it down to 
below 3 percent (of GNP) this year. All the economy's 
parameters -- interest rates, inflation, the exchange rate -- 
are improving. The commercial portion of the foreign debt 
burden has been brought down to a minimum, and better terms 
negotiated. The domestic debt service is still a major problem, 
but we are reducing that also. What is important is the 
direction. 
  Are there gains in collecting the taxes due to the 
government? 
  We are implementing a three-pronged approach: improving tax 
collection, creating a broader base of taxpayers, and 
undertaking reforms in the tax and tariff system itself, and in 
the collecting agencies. For example, we are restructuring the 
Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Where there used to be 80 
revenue districts, there are now 115. 
  We have also removed the discretionary power of 
lower-ranking 
officers in deciding tax compromises, and this can be done now 
only by the bureau's top five officials. A large taxpayers unit 
in the BIR is now operating, which will allow them to focus 
their efforts on the big taxpayers. 
  Your efforts seem to be frustrated by the courts, as in 
the case of your campaign against magnate Lucio Tan. The 
courts' involvement has also blocked major development 
projects. 
  That is something out of my control, but at least efforts 
are 
being made. But we are also taking steps to solve those. We 
are seconding the justice department's state prosecutors, who 
are better paid, to the BIR or to any other department who need 
such lawyers. Last week, I appointed 177 new state prosecutors. 
The Department of Justice has filed cases against tax evaders 
for a claim of P [Philippine pesos] 23 billion (US$836 million). 
But we have due process in this country. If these tax evaders 
lose in the lower court, they appeal all the way up to the 
Supreme Court, and they have smart lawyers behind them. But we 
have to start the process. 
  Early on in your administration, you said that one of 
your thrusts would be to dismantle cartels and monopolies. So 
far, however, it has only been the monopoly in the 
telecommunications industry which you've addressed. 
  We have made an investigation of the cement industry, and 
we're not quite through with that yet. But (cement producers) 
have made the commitment that there will be no artificial 
shortage and no price manipulation, and we're making sure of 
this province by province. 
  The banking system is one area we want to liberalise. That's 
why we're pushing for a new banking law. The biggest bank here 
is smaller than Thailand's 10th biggest bank. Why? Because the 
banking industry has largely been in the hands of a few 
families. We're about to open up that industry, so that our 
banks will be more competitive vis-a-vis the entire Asean 
region, so that access to credit will be maximised, and its cost 
minimised. 
  The observation has been made that you are involving 
yourself too much in the details of your administration, rather 
than in giving overall direction. 
  You have to start with the basics. I've spent time visiting 
neighbours in the region, I've spent time talking with senators 
and congressmen about bills and policies, and talking with the 
private sector. However, we cannot neglect providing solutions 
for problems down below, where because of neglect in the past, 
there is a need for interagency collaboration. 
  There are observations that given the country's 
political structure, the Philippines may not be 
"governable." 
  I think it definitely is governable. That's why we went into 
this, as a challenge. All other efforts have failed. It's just 
that we did not do many things right. The structure depends on 
the people who run it. You can have the most beautiful 
structure, but if the people who are running it are not devoted, 
and are not dedicated to the goal, it will never work. 
  What would you say is your biggest lesson in 
governance? 
  You have to be awfully patient. You have to be steady. You 
must not be diverted from your original objectives.

  [Text] Seoul, ROMPRES 10/3/1994 -- The Romanian head of 
state assessed the talks conducted with President Kim Yong-sam 
as "very interesting and substantive," allowing for the singling 
out of the major directions and ways of consolidation of the 
Romanian-Korean cooperation in every domain. 
  "I am sure the joint statement we have endorsed will 
inaugurate a new chapter in the history of the relations between 
Romania and the Republic of Korea and will help raise the 
general level of our bilateral cooperation," President Ion 
Iliescu said, noting the similarity of standpoints expressed 
during the Romanian-South-Korean dialogue. 
  "Both countries are resolved to promote understanding, 
cooperation and peace in their regions and the world over," he 
said, noting that the end of the Cold War has failed to bring 
about the stability the world's nations expected and that 
complex and sometimes contradictory processes of restructuring 
interstate relations are taking place in the international 
arena, as well as a search for new structures of cooperation on 
a bilateral, regional and international plane. 
  President Iliescu recalled the efforts deployed by Romania 
for integration in the Euro-Atlantic economic, political and 
military structures, stressing that it has managed to remain a 
factor of stability in a zone powerfully marked by 
confrontations both in the West, in former Yugoslavia, and in 
the East, in the former Soviet Republics. Likewise, the 
Romanian head of state said, "we are heeding ever more the 
relations with the countries in Asia and the Pacific, that 
represent a region with very dynamic growth rates and greatest 
development prospects in the decades to come." 
  President Ion Iliescu noted that the Romanian-South-Korean 
summit talks emphasized certain similarities as regarded the 
development of the Romanian and Korean peoples, and especially 
the two peoples' aspirations to live in a climate of peace and 
mutual confidence.

<F P=106> [Article by J.N. Mak and B.A. Hamzah: "Navy Blues" -- from </F>
"The 5th Column"] 
  [Text] Since World War II, Thailand's defence has been 
focused landward, on the northwestern trans-Mekong region. 
Today that focus appears to have changed. As the Thai military 
expands and modernises its forces, it seems to have taken a 
heavy maritime bias. Such a shift is not immediately explicable, 
given that Thailand has no real external threats to its maritime 
security. So long as good relations exist with China, Bangkok 
need not fear Beijing, and even India's forces serve more as a 
counterweight to Indonesia than a threat to Thailand. The more 
likely explanation for the Thai navy's ambitious modernisation 
drive is Thailand's desire to protect its economic 
infrastructure, especially since the nation's industrial and 
economic zones are located along or near the coast. 
  Whatever the reason, it is quite clear that the Thais are 
attempting to build a "two-ocean" navy to maintain simultaneous 
control over its eastern and western seaboards, respectively the 
Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. Long-term plans include 
the acquisition of two helicopter carriers, the addition of 
three new naval bases, the construction of new frigates and, 
ultimately, a submarine programme. Together these plans suggest 
that Thailand may be thinking about more than simple protection 
of its economic interests. The country's former navy chief, 
Adm. Wichet Karunyawanit, has noted that although Thailand now 
enjoys "friendly relations with all its neighbours, we cannot 
afford to be complacent. We need to maintain our military 
preparedness." 
  Some of Thailand's hardware choices appear to put steel into 
the admiral's words. For example, although the helicopter 
carrier contracted from Spain ostensibly would be used for 
disaster relief, it will be built with a 12-degree ski ramp. 
For helicopter operations such a ramp would be a distinct 
handicap. But it makes perfect sense for operating 
Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing aircraft such as the Harrier 
jet fighter. Indeed, sources say the navy is in fact 
considering the purchase of surplus Harriers from the Spanish 
navy. 
  Likewise, a major port, north of Sattahip, includes a 
dockyard designed to do more than just support the helicopter 
carrier. Its mid-length gate design will also allow the 
simultaneous docking of two frigates. Altogether Thailand's 
naval expansion is the most dramatic within Asean. 
  Naturally these moves have made some in Asean nervous. True 
enough, those who believe that Asean's future security needs 
will be met collectively may find Thailand's purchase of an 
aircraft carrier and more frigates reassuring. But Asean today 
remains far from any such arrangement and indeed cannot yet 
agree even on the establishment of a defence pact. And though 
the Thai navy's current chief, Adm. Prachet Siridet, has 
completed a regionwide visit to reassure his counterparts that 
Thailand's purchases are for purely defensive purposes, the 
question remains: defence against whom -- and what? 
  An article last year in THE NATION, a leading Thai daily, 
may 
provide a clue. According to the article, by the year 2010 the 
U.S.-Thai security relationship would no longer be significant. 
Indeed, the U.S. by then would be Thailand's "Friendly Enemy 
Number One." The article further predicted that Thailand would 
re-ally itself with Japan, as it did during the Japanese 
invasion of Southeast Asia more than a half-century ago. Most 
ominously, the article claimed that the Thai navy would become 
"the most influential policy decision-maker in 2010 -- since 
Thailand now has the world's third-largest fishing fleet" after 
Japan and Taiwan. 
  This latter is not a comforting scenario for Thailand's 
neighbours. These neighbours harbour strong suspicions about 
Bangkok's aspirations for blue-water status, not least because 
Thailand over the past 300 years has had expansionist tendencies 
whenever it was militarily strong. Indeed, THE NATION even 
offered a scenario in the year 2008 in which a war is almost 
provoked when a Thai fishing trawler fitted with modern defence 
systems sinks a Malaysian patrol boat in the Malaysian fishery 
zone. 
  Far-fetched? Not if you consider past incidents when Thai 
fishing trawlers deliberately rammed Malaysian patrol boats in 
an effort to escape arrest for poaching. In one incident last 
year, Thai fishermen abducted a Malaysian sailor to Hat Yai and 
released him only after official protests were made. One 
Malaysian sailor is still missing and believed to have been 
thrown overboard by the fisherman. 
  The point is that Thailand has made a move to join the big 
league with its naval purchases, especially the carriers, and 
its neighbours need reassuring. Aircraft carriers, after all, 
can be regarded as offensive platforms for power projection, 
which is why all Southeast Asia fears China's planned 
acquisition of a carrier and why India's carriers provoked 
suspicion despite a substantive public relations effort to 
soothe fears. 
  The one thing that is certain is that the Thai navy will 
make 
big waves when it takes delivery of its first carrier three 
years from now and embarks on its planned submarine programme. 
Will these be used to protect its fishing fleet? Are we 
witnessing the rise of a new maritime power flexing its muscles 
in Southeast Asian seas? Will the Thais trigger a new arms race? 
Or are they merely responding to Malaysia's purchase of two 
British frigates -- or China's expansion into the South China 
Sea? These are questions many in Asean are asking. And right 
now we have more questions than answers.

  [Excerpt] Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans has raised 
the question in Hanoi of the return of 375 refugees from the 
Netherlands who have been refused political asylum, but has yet 
to conclude an agreement with the Vietnamese Government. 
  The refugees came from the former Czechoslovakia where they 
were sent as guest workers, but were not granted residence 
permits in the Netherlands as The Hague does not believe they 
are in any danger if they return to their home country. The 
Netherlands Parliament has asked the government for watertight 
legal guarantees that the Vietnamese will not encounter problems 
on their return, but the Foreign Ministry reports that 
preparations for the signing of a treaty are taking longer in 
order to obtain these guarantees. The IOM [International 
Organization of Migration] is also seeking to achieve better 
arrangements with the Vietnamese Government because the return 
of the Vietnamese who have been in the Netherlands since 1991 
could serve as a precedent. A further 10,000 refugees, mainly 
from Asia, must also return to their home country. 
  If any mistakes are made in returning the refugees on this 
occasion or if any uncertainties remain this could work against 
the return of all those who are to follow. This is why the IOM 
will only participate in the return and supervise the 
resettlement once all the arrangements have been completed and 
laid down in an agreement signed between the Netherlands and 
Vietnam. 
  Most importantly, the Netherlands is seeking clarification 
regarding the position of Vietnamese who do not want to return 
to Vietnam. The Justice Ministry has made 1 million guilders 
available for resettlement. During the meeting with his 
Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam, Kooijmans reminded 
Vietnam of its international obligations to accept returning 
nationals as a member of the United Nations. He urged the 
Vietnamese Government to come to a speedy agreement with the 
Netherlands. 
  Kooijmans also raised the issue of human rights and freedom 
of worship. The Netherlands Government considers that economic 
progress in Vietnam must be coupled with greater political 
freedoms and accelerated efforts to improve the position of a 
large part of the population which remains socially 
disadvantaged. A spokesman for Minister Kooijmans in Hanoi 
described yesterday afternoon's talks as difficult. In their 
talks with the Netherlands Government the Vietnamese denied that 
there were any problems of freedom of worship. They stressed 
that as members of a sovereign government they "indeed had the 
right to ensure that order was not disturbed," the spokesman 
reported. 
  Kooijmans has signed, however, an agreement on the 
protection 
of mutual investments. The Netherlands is the tenth largest 
investor in Vietnam, and the third European investor after 
France and the United Kingdom with total investments of 450 
million guilders (Shell, Heineken, Organon, and investments by a 
number of commercial firms). Since last December the 
Netherlands once again had its own embassy in Hanoi, occupying 
two rooms in the Dan Chu Hotel. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 11 -- About 6,000 guest workers 
returning from Germany have well resettled in Vietnam with 
assistance from various programmes funded by an agreement on 
loan and vocational training signed by the two governments. 
  Under these programmes, which worth DM [German marks] 10 
million and 70 percent was contributed by the German side, 25 
people have been trained to become trainers on economic 
management for 319 small entrepreneurs, and 28 classes on 
vocational training opened for 675 others. 
  On March 9, a delegation of the German Ministry for Economic 
Cooperation, which is on a current visit to Vietnam, met with 
many beneficiaries from the programmes to inquire into their 
circumstances in order to make the programmes more effective. 
The meeting was joined by the German ambassador to Vietnam. 
  The delegation also made known that the German Government 
would contribute DM six million more to these programmes.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 11 -- The Export Credits Guarantee 
Department of the United Kingdom (ECGD) has resumed cover for 
Vietnam after a period of 12 years following Vietnam's agreement 
with the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club at the 
end of last year, says a press release made available here by 
the British Embassy. 
  Speaking on the event, Mr. Michael Heseltine, president of 
ECGD Board of Trade [title as received], said: "I am delighted 
that ECGD is one of the first export credit agencies to restore 
medium and long term cover for Vietnam. ECGD has enormous 
potential and Vietnam is poised for major trade expansion and 
economic growth in which ECGD can play an important role". 
  The British ambassador to Vietnam, Mr. Peter Williams, said: 
"I am happy that this very necessary facility has been 
reintroduced. By insuring British exports, I see it as an 
excellent instrument to further increase the trade links between 
Vietnam and the United Kingdom and thereby to further cement our 
ever-increasing relationship in all fields".

  [Text] Vietnam is prepared to reopen wide-ranging talks on 
the diversion of water from the Mekong River and its major 
tributaries if they are held in a constructive manner, one of 
Vietnam's chief negotiators on the Mekong Committee said on 
Monday. Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet is expected to 
discuss his country's stand during his meeting with Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai when the Thai leader visits Hanoi from 
March 16 to 19, said Hoang Trong Quang, permanent secretary of 
the Vietnam National Mekong Committee in an interview with THE 
NATION. 
  Hoang Trong Quang, who stressed he was speaking in a private 
capacity, said if Thailand does not agree to Hanoi's 
requirements there will be no agreement at all. "In that case, 
Vietnam is prepared to leave the committee," he said. "We need 
the committee but it must fulfill its function. If it has no 
right to make any decision (it is a) committee for what," he 
said. Quang said he wanted the Mekong Committee, which comprises 
Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, to have a ruling say in 
any project that may have negative repercussions on other 
riverine states. 
  The current round of talks on a framework for the committee, 
which have dragged on for two years, appeared close to a 
conclusion in December after a year marked by squabbling between 
Thailand and Vietnam. But negotiations broke down again in 
January because of differences between the two countries. 
Vietnam reportedly refused to endorse previously agreed points 
in the 42-Article framework accord on the sustainable use of 
water resources at a meeting of the technical drafting working 
group in Vientiane. 
  Quang said the earlier negotiations had yet to settle the 
contentious question of diversion of water from, the mainstream 
and tributaries during the dry season, and two points in the 
four-point Article Five dealing with the reasonable and 
equitable utilization of water. 
  The National Mekong Committee's chief said Vietnam has 
accepted these clauses but wanted the issue of dry season 
diversions to be agreed upon by all the riparian states. The 
Vietnamese chief delegate said the Thai delegation did not agree 
to this at the Vientiane round of talks. "Vietnam has no 
intention to place any preconditions but we do not want any use 
of the waters causing harm to the other riparian states," he 
said. 
  The secretary said Vietnam had not raised objections to 
water 
projects in Thailand, in particular the Kok-Ing-Nan project 
which will draw water from the Kok River, a tributary of the 
Mekong, and channel it via an underground canal to the Chao 
Phraya River. Quang said Vietnam only brought up the project 
during the Vientiane meeting for comment. "So far we have no 
official information about that project," he said. 
  He said his country has legitimate concerns over the impact 
of such projects on the lower reaches of the 
four-million-hectare Mekong Delta, which is in danger of drying 
up unless controls are implemented over the quantity of water in 
the mainstream river. 
  In contrast to the earlier rounds of negotiation, Quang said 
Vietnam has adopted a more flexible stand in regard to the 
diversion clause. "It means that the upstream cannot change the 
flow regime along the river," he said. 
  In a separate interview at the Bangkok-based Mekong 
Secretariat, officials said the current mandate of the drafting 
working group has expired and Vietnam must call for a renewed 
mandate from the United Nations Development Programme which is 
the main financier of the Mekong Committee's projects. 
  Under an agreement reached by the committee in Hanoi last 
February, the drafting working group was given until last 
October to conclude the drafting process. 
  "Thailand has given considerable concessions with regards to 
national sovereignty. They agreed to notify the committee 
before using water from the tributaries during the wet season 
and to prior consultations during the dry season, according to 
one official who asked not to be named.

  [Text] HANOI, March 10 (AFP) -- Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC] 
authorities are urging reforms of trade regulations to boost 
exports, weed out unscrupulous firms and gain a bigger market 
share in the countries of the former Soviet Union, a report said 
Thursday. 
  The city's directorate of commerce has presented proposals 
to 
the government in Hanoi to issue separate licences for imports 
and exports rather than the current combined licences so as to 
encourage exports and cut back on the amount of imported goods, 
the LAO DONG newspaper reported. 
  Vietnam's cumbersome trade licensing procedures have come 
under attack from foreign businesses here, who would like to see 
the thicket of bureaucracy thinned out, but officials have 
maintained what a Western consultant here called "an informal 
quota system." Authorities in the southern city also called for 
low-interest loans for such businesses as rice production to 
bolster vital export sectors, the labour newspaper said. The 
measures would help the city meet its target of boosting exports 
by 29 percent this year to 760 million US dollars while keeping 
the rise in imports down to five percent, the newspaper said. 
  HCMC is trying to eradicate a 271-million-dollar trade 
deficit that built up last year, when it failed to meet a target 
of a 10-percent rise in exports, it said. City officials are 
urging an increase in the minimum capital of a trading company 
from 200,000 dollars to one million dollars to eliminate 
"adventurous" or vulnerable companies, the report said. 
  Other proposals currently being considered by the Ministry 
of 
Commerce include a further clampdown on smuggling from Cambodia 
and China and efforts to boost counter-trade with the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Tax breaks should be 
given to companies trading the nations of the former Soviet 
Union "in order to win a large market with which trade has been 
shrinking." Before its breakup in 1991, the Soviet Union was 
Vietnam's largest trading partner and aid donor but in 1993 
Russia fell to 11th place on the list of investors here while 
trade with the CIS has slumped because of a shortage of hard 
currency in the countries.

  [Summary] Dear Friends: Today marked yet another great day 
for the communications and transport sector as the Thang 
Long-Noi Bai Expressway officially opened to traffic. It is 
Vietnam's first six-lane, 14.56-km expressway. The expressway's 
construction cost was 16 billion dong per kilometer. "Attending 
the inauguration ceremony were Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, 
Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong, Hanoi party committee 
Secretary Pham The Duyet, Communications and Transport Minister 
Bui Danh Luu, and many other leading cadres of ministries and 
sectors at the central level and in Hanoi." 
  The expressway was built according to international 
standards 
and is of the highest-ever quality in Vietnam. 
  At the ceremony, Comrade Le Ngoc Hoan, deputy communications 
and transport minister, delivered a speech in which he said: 
  [Begin Le Ngoc Hoan recording] "The construction of the 
Thang 
Long-Noi Bai Expressway was completed thanks to the great 
efforts of all the concerned agencies. The success of this 
project was indeed possible due to the state's close guidance, 
effective coordination between construction units, and 
cooperation between the people of Hanoi and Vinh Phu Province. 
The expressway will bring about great economic benefits because 
it cuts almost 10 km from the trip to the center of Hanoi. It 
will also help to beautify the gateway to the capital city to 
welcome foreign visitors; facilitate the development of the 
industrial-tourism-business complex in northern Hanoi, being 
built to mark the 40th anniversary of Hanoi's liberation; and 
facilitate economic development in the northern region. 
  Once again, I would like to express our gratitude to the 
party and state leaders, the agencies concerned, the local 
people, and the workers for their creativity and hard work in 
successfully building this new project for the socialist 
Vietnamese fatherland. It will contribute to fulfilling our 
esteemed and beloved Uncle Ho's aspiration of making Vietnam a 
more beautiful and prosperous nation." [end recording]

  [Text] The midterm party conference of the central public 
security service party organization opened in Hanoi this 
morning. Comrade Le Duc Anh, member of the Political Bureau and 
president of the state, attended the conference and expressed 
his views to the participants. On behalf of the central public 
security service party committee, Comrade Bui Thien Ngo 
delivered a report pointing out past achievements. He 
emphatically said: To satisfactorily fulfill its new tasks, the 
public security force must make sustained efforts to serve the 
goals of national defense and construction as well as of 
socioeconomic development. It is essential to firmly ensure 
political stability and internal security, thereby foiling the 
enemy's peaceful evolution scheme. 
  In the days ahead, the central public security service party 
organization must continue to revamp its structures and improve 
the quality of its unit-building work. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Comrade Le Duc Anh commended the 
public security force for its achievements in carrying out the 
party-initiated renovation undertaking. He emphatically said: 
To outstandingly fulfill its new tasks, the public security 
force must work out measures to guarantee internal unity and 
promote solidarity with other sectors, particularly the Army. 
Efforts must be made to improve everyone's knowledge and 
modernize equipment. Adequate measures must be taken to turn 
the public security force into a modern and regular Army-type 
organization. Steps must be taken to look after the well-being 
of cadres and combatants. Prompt measures must be taken to 
overcome all indications of negativism. It is necessary to make 
every effort to guarantee the purity of the public security 
force.

  [Text] The Nghe An Province party organization, 13th term 
of office, held its midterm party conference in Vinh city on the 
morning of 10 March. Senior Lieutenant General Le Kha Phieu, 
member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Communist 
Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee attended. Evaluating 
the results of the two-year implementation of objectives and 
tasks set forth by the 13th province party organization 
congress, Comrade Nguyen Ba, member of the CPV Central Committee 
and secretary of the province party committee, said: 
  Over the past two years, the socioeconomic situation in Nghe 
An has developed fairly comprehensively. The province's overall 
growth rate was relatively higher than in preceding years with 
an average agricultural growth rate of 6.15 percent. The 
province has basically been able to tackle its food grain issue. 
Its gross industrial output value in 1993 increased by 9.4 
percent over 1992. Trade, support services, and foreign 
economic activities have undergone several changes for the 
better. The province's cultural, educational, public health, 
and sports activities as well as efforts to solve unemployment 
and to implement various social policies have showed great 
improvement. Livelihoods have become less difficult and are 
becoming stable. The face of various cities, towns, and rural 
areas has undergone rapid changes for the better. 
  However, as a poor province, Nghe An's economic growth rate 
is still regarded as slow and much lower than the national 
average. In the years ahead, Nghe An must strive to improve its 
economic structure in the direction of gradually industrializing 
and modernizing various local economic sectors to achieve a 
rapid increase in the volume of marketable products. It must 
vigorously develop its trade and support service activities to 
considerably increase their share of the gross social product. 
It must develop education and public health, carry out the 
motto of eradicating hunger and reducing poverty, encourage the 
people to enrich themselves legally, and stabilize and improve 
the people's lives. 
  The conference directed that the following targets be 
achieved by the province during the period ahead: 
  -- agricultural output value must achieve an average annual 
increase of 6.2 percent in a bid to yield 820,000 to 850,000 
tons of food grain. 
  -- gross industrial output value must achieve an average 
annual increase of 14 percent. 
  -- gross social product value must achieve an average 
annual increase of 7 percent. 
  -- national revenue must achieve an average annual 
increase of 8 percent. 
  Addressing the conference, Comrade Le Kha Phieu urged Nghe 
An 
to ascertain the strengths and advantages of each economic area 
in order to come up with effective investment measures to help 
achieve national socioeconomic development and to avoid being 
left behind compared with other localities nationwide.

  [Text] On 1 March, the party Central Committee Secretariat 
[PCCS] issued a directive on fighting social evil. 
  The directive says: The effective preventing and fighting of 
social evils -- first of all prostitution and drug addiction -- 
is currently an urgent task that our party and government must 
resolutely carry out with clear success in 1994. The decisive 
factors in successfully preventing and fighting social evils are 
the acceleration of socioeconomic development, the launching of 
public movements, the increasing management of state organs, and 
the expansion of the active role of mass organizations under the 
leadership of party committees and party organs throughout the 
country. 
  The PCCS requests: 
  1. All party echelons and organs from the central down to 
the grassroots level must consider the work of preventing and 
fighting social evils -- first of all prostitution, drug 
addiction, and AIDS -- a very important task for 1994. 
  2. Party echelons and organs must work with local 
governments and state organs to outline and execute plans and 
programs to prevent and fight social evils in their localities. 
  3. First of all, a widespread public campaign must be 
launched to accelerate propaganda and education on a large scale 
to create strong public support for condemning and eliminating 
social evils. 
  4. Grassroots party committees must incorporate the duty 
of preventing and fighting social evils, waste, corruption, and 
smuggling into their regular work. Party organs must conduct 
regular checks on the work and lifestyles of party members in 
the family and society. Party members with unhealthy lifestyles 
must be quickly educated and prevented from any wrongdoing. If 
they commit social offenses, they must be dealt with strictly 
according to party discipline and state law. Party members who 
are addicted to drugs or involved with prostitution or 
debauchery must be expelled from the party. 
  The PCCS asks provincial, city, and central organ party 
committees to execute this directive urgently.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
renewed their resolve at a top-level security meeting Friday [11 
March] to maintain close defense relations in the post-Cold War 
era. 
  They reaffirmed the growing importance of the Japan-U.S. 
alliance in the meeting that temporarily set aside their 
continuing disputes on trade. 
  In the first bilateral "two-plus-two" meeting of foreign and 
defense ministers, held at Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
official residence, they affirmed that the alliance "has grown 
stronger and has increased in importance in the post-Cold War 
period," a joint statement by the bilateral security 
consultative committee said. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Defense Agency chief Kazuo 
Aichi represented Japan and the U.S. side was headed by 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, along with Undersecretary 
of Defense Frank Wisner on behalf of new Defense Secretary 
William Perry. 
  Hata said there was "frank" discussion of security issues in 
the post-Cold War era in a good atmosphere and the two sides 
agreed to hold such meetings regularly in the future. 
  Japanese and U.S. participants shared the view that the 
meeting was "meaningful," according to Foreign Ministry 
officials. 
  Tokyo and Washington originally agreed on the ministerial 
"two-plus-two" security meeting in December 1990, but had been 
unable to hold it before now due to the difficulty of getting 
all four ministers together. 
  Christopher told the meeting that relations with Japan are 
especially important in Washington's Asia policy, saying 
bilateral security ties are important for the peace and 
stability of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The two countries should not forget the importance of the 
bilateral security arrangements, officials quoted him as saying. 
  The U.S. reiterated its commitment to maintaining a strong 
military presence in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region and 
thanked Japan for its host nation support and providing 
facilities. 
  The two sides agreed to start consultations on continuation 
of an agreement on host-nation support, due to expire in two 
years. 
  Wisner said the U.S. is studying issues involving strategic 
nuclear weapons and may make an interim report as early as this 
summer. Washington will also make clear its position on the 
U.S. presence in Asia within a few months, he said. 
  Regarding U.S. forces stationed in Japan, both sides pledged 
to continue efforts to consolidate and realign facilities and 
areas, particularly in Okinawa, consistent with the purposes of 
the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and U.S. operation requirements. 
  They also agreed on the importance of boosting exchanges of 
defense technology. 
  The security talks coincided with the arrival of the 
91,487-ton U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier Carl Vinson at the U.S. 
Naval Base at Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture, just south of 
Tokyo. 
  On international affairs, they reaffirmed that a diplomatic 
solution is the best way of resolving the issue of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development program, the officials 
said. 
  Christopher said that if there is progress in diplomatic 
efforts such as dialogues between Pyongyang and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and with South Korea, 
there could be a resumption of talks between the U.S. and North 
Korea on March 21. 
  He called for close consultations among the U.S., Japan, 
South Korea and China, in case such diplomatic efforts fail and 
the problem is brought to the United Nations Security Council, 
they said. 
  Hata replied that in such a case Japan would take 
responsible 
actions while keeping close contacts with Washington and Seoul. 
  Aichi echoed Hosokawa's remarks in the Diet that Japan will 
take responsible actions within the constitution. 
  The two sides also endorsed efforts to enhance regional 
political and security dialogues and welcomed the convening of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional 
forum.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday boasted of his strengthened personal 
relations with U.S. President Bill Clinton despite the collapse 
of bilateral trade negotiations a month ago. 
  "I am not on bad terms with Mr. Clinton," a Foreign Ministry 
official quoted Hosokawa as saying in an interview with THE NEW 
YORK TIMES, which will be published in the spring issue of THE 
NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE. 
  "On the contrary, we are getting closer and closer," the 
prime minister reportedly said. "I really feel that way when I 
talk with Mr. Clinton." 
  The United States has been turning up the heat on Japan 
after 
Hosokawa and Clinton failed to strike a deal in a February 
summit in Washington on the penetration of more foreign goods 
into Japanese markets. 
  Hosokawa told the U.S. newspaper that the restructuring of 
the economy will be the top priority for the nation, the 
official said in a briefing to reporters. 
  Hosokawa, asked to comment on whether Japan is really 
changing, reportedly said the nation's political and cultural 
structures have yet to be mature enough but that signs of change 
are surely emerging.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher again chided Japan on trade issues Friday [11 
March], calling for prompt action to open its markets and cut 
its trade surplus. 
  "Our objectives are simple -- to open markets and to promote 
global economic growth," he told Japanese business leaders. "To 
advance these objectives, Japan needs to take credible actions, 
and to take them now." 
  As in comments the day before, Christopher laced a speech to 
the Japan Association of Corporate Executives with criticism of 
Japan for failing to keep its trade commitments, as well as 
optimism that both sides will meet "our responsibility to 
change." 
  In prepared remarks, he described Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton's decision "not to paper 
over our differences" when bilateral trade "framework" talks 
collapsed February 11 as a "welcome sign of new candor." 
  But, Christopher said, "agreeing to disagree is not good 
enough. Acknowledging economic differences must be a starting 
point for finally resolving them." 
  He said last month's 15 trillion yen economic stimulus 
measures "are insufficient to produce sustained, demand-led 
growth," which Washington demands to help curb Japan's huge 
trade surplus. 
  "Japan has been unwilling to reach agreements on specific 
steps to open markets in the priority sectors of insurance, 
government procurement and autos and auto parts," Christopher 
said. 
  Despite agreeing last July to use "objective criteria" to 
gauge the opening of its markets, "Japan has declined to provide 
realistic ways to measure progress to ensure that any such 
agreements are working," Christopher charged.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Tax reform should not be 
made as an immediate and permanent measure simply to address the 
Japan-U.S. trade dispute, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
indicated Friday [11 March]. 
  The government and the ruling coalition parties are to 
decide 
on a "full-fledged" tax reform by the year-end while mindful of 
the effects of already-decided income tax cuts worth some 6 
trillion yen for fiscal 1994, starting April 1, Fujii told a 
regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  "That's how it should be done," Fujii said, rejecting calls 
for an immediate decision on a permanent income tax cut as a 
measure to boost domestic demand to help reduce Japan's trade 
imbalance. 
  In a press meeting in Tokyo on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher said keeping tax cuts to a single year 
is not enough to stimulate the economy. 
  Fujii has been stressing that Japan will decide by the 
year-end on permanent tax reform with a "balanced system in 
income, assets, and consumption" to cope with the aging society. 
  Asked about views being expressed within the ruling 
coalition 
about the need to show some direction in the tax plan together 
with a "voluntary" market-access package to be decided by the 
end of the month, Fujii said, "that's the coalition parties' 
problem." 
  On the market-access package, Fujii said, "I haven't heard 
of 
any clear talks" of compiling it in two stages -- this month and 
before the summit of the Group of Seven major nations in Italy 
in July. 
  "But realistically speaking," he said, "I think it will come 
that way, although I will have to say no to any reference as a 
two-stage plan." 
  The package will be decided by the end of the month, but 
details, including those in priority fields, will be discussed 
later, Fujii said. 
  Christopher, at a news conference after meeting Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
said Thursday that the United States would assess the 
possibility of reviving the trade framework talks after 
reviewing the package. 
  Meanwhile, Fujii said he has no plan yet to ask for a 
bilateral meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
when finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum meet in Hawaii on March 18 to 19.

  [Text] Washington, March 10 KYODO -- A top aide to 
President Bill Clinton and Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. 
Takakazu Kuriyama agreed Thursday [10 March] that the breakdown 
of trade talks between the two countries won't start a trade war 
but offered few clues on how to restore economic peace. 
  The two men, confronting each other at an open debate on 
trade policy, warned that troubled bilateral ties could even get 
worse before it gets better. 
  "A failure to resolve these issues will result in a 
U.S.-Japan economic relationship that continues to erode," said 
Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic policy. 
  The Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based think 
tank, brought Cutter and Kuriyama together for the first public 
encounter of senior Japanese and U.S. officials since the 
collapse of bilateral trade talks a month ago. 
  The breakdown of the so-called "framework" trade 
negotiations, which marred the February 11 summit between 
President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, has 
prompted Washington to threaten unilateral trade action against 
Tokyo. 
  Kuriyama said Japan hopes to return to the negotiating table 
as early as possible but admitted that he has "no idea" on how 
to resolve the impasse. 
  Cutter offered no fresh initiative either, saying "It is now 
up to the Government of Japan to begin to indicate a direction." 
  The two men, however, stressed there are no grounds to 
expect 
a trade war between the two allies. 
  "There's not a trade war and neither side will intend to 
have 
a trade war," Cutter said. 
  Kuriyama readily agreed. "We have too much at stake 
together. 
We will both be losers," the envoy said. 
  But the two officials also agreed there is very little trust 
between two allies when it comes to Japan's commitment to open 
up its markets and close its huge trade surplus. 
  The Clinton administration, arguing that few of the past 30 
or so trade accords have yielded expected results, has demanded 
that Tokyo set "numerical indicators" by which the U.S. will 
determine the success or failure of a Japanese commitment. 
  Tokyo has rejected the U.S. demand which, as Kuriyama 
reiterated Thursday, is likely to turn into a "legally binding 
commitment and therefore subject to sanctions." 
  Cutter, recalling the predawn session of negotiation that 
sealed the fate of the trade framework talks in February, quoted 
Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, the chief 
Japanese negotiator, as saying, "You don't trust us without 
numbers. We don't trust you with numbers." 
  The sense of distrust on trade matters between two allies 
drew demands for tougher U.S. trade actions from U.S. 
legislators who took part in the two-day trade forum. 
  House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, who spoke at one 
session of the trade conference Thursday, said, "A gentle, 
gradual negotiating process may work with most other countries. 
But time has taught us that it doesn't work with Japan." 
  Speaking at a later session Thursday, Sen. Max Baucus, 
chairman of the Senate finance subcommittee that handles trade 
matters, said tougher action -- even sanctions -- is justified 
because, in his view, Japan resists change without outside 
pressure. 
  "We will require a policy which understands the unique 
nature 
of the Japanese economy. We will need the credibility that only 
the prospect of sanctions can offer," the Montana Democrat said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States could settle their dispute over cellular telephones as 
early as Friday [11 March] with a business deal that would avert 
U.S. sanctions against Japanese goods, a Japanese Government 
minister said. 
  Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki told 
a 
news conference that the two firms involved, Nippon Idou Tsushin 
Corp. (IDO) and Motorola Inc., are putting the final touches to 
their deal. 
  "It's possible a formal agreement will be reached today," he 
said. 
  The administration of President Bill Clinton has threatened 
to impose trade sanctions against Japan if Tokyo does not open 
its market to U.S. companies. 
  Kanzaki said it would not take long for the Japanese and 
U.S. 
governments to strike a deal to end their dispute over cellular 
phones if the private companies reached agreement. 
  In the dispute, Washington complains Japan has not abided by 
a 1989 agreement in which it promised to provide "comparable" 
market access to its cellular phone market. 
  Motorola insists it should be given more cellular phone 
relay 
stations and channels in Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan's Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry has rejected a petition filed by 
Japanese international telephone operators against discount-rate 
services offered in Japan by U.S.-affiliated firms, an industry 
official said Friday [11 March]. "The ministry saw no problems 
under the current telecom rules after investigations based on 
the complaint, virtually dismissing it," the official told KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE. 
  The information was offered by "reliable government 
sources," 
said Toshio Kawakami, president of USF Pacific Inc., a 
Tokyo-based agent for us Fibercom Network Inc. in New York. 
  Three Japanese common carriers led by KDD, a former 
international phone monopoly, lodged the petition in January, 
requesting the ministry conduct a probe into the "call-back" 
discount services which they claimed use their lines unfairly, 
free of charge. 
  A KDD spokesman said his company has not heard of the 
decision from the ministry, and noted that the complaint filed 
in January did not involve any requests for concrete measures. 
  "Its nature was to explain the problems and not something 
that the ministry would reject." 
  The other Japanese concerns involved in the petition were 
International Digital Communications Inc. and International 
Telecom Japan Inc. 
  Under the call-back system, users call a switching center in 
the United States and hang up after two rings. After a few 
seconds, the center calls back and the users dial the actual 
number they want to call, the country of "origin" of the call 
now being the United States, where rates are lower. 
  Stressing that the services are not illegal, either 
domestically or internationally, Kawakami said, "imposing 
restrictions was from the outset impossible because the 
Telecommunications Law would have to be revised to do so." 
  He added that the ministry would not want to create new 
regulations now that Japan is pushing ahead with deregulation to 
allow better access by foreign firms, in an attempt to address 
trade disputes with the U.S. 
  After the complaint was filed, USF Pacific and some other 
Japanese agents of U.S. discount operators issued a statement 
in January, saying they were ready to talk if the Japanese 
operators offered a "reasonable" line-usage charge. 
  They also warned that they were prepared to file a counter 
petition with the U.S. Government if their services were 
blocked. 
  The KDD spokesman said the discount service is becoming an 
international problem, and "we just wanted the ministry to 
recognize this." 
  He noted, "We also want to solve the problem through talks, 
and if they fail, actual actions will be taken such as filing a 
petition with the ministry to allow changing our rules 
stipulated in contracts with users." 
  There still are no plans to start talks with the discount 
service operators, the spokesman said, adding that KDD is now 
consulting with U.S. common carriers including American 
Telephone and Telegraph Co.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- The government expects 
Japanese automakers to map out their own plans to boost 
purchases of U.S. auto parts by the end of March, International 
Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said Friday [11 
March]. 
  "If nothing is done, U.S. sanctions will come one day 
suddenly. I believe private companies understand this well," 
Kumagai told a press conference. 
  The U.S. Government has warned that it may impose sanctions 
against Japan if Tokyo does not open its markets, including 
those for autos and auto parts. Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa is trying to hammer out a package of voluntary measures 
to boost imports by the end of March with the aim of thwarting 
possible U.S. sanctions.

<F P=106> [Report by Catherine Chatignoux and Nicolas Barre in Tokyo: </F>
"Gerard Longuet Envisages Mediating Role for Europe; United 
States Will Judge Japan by Its Economic Openness Proposals"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] On an official visit in Tokyo, 
where he met yesterday with Morihiro Hosokawa, French Industry 
and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet has protested against 
the United States' reinstatement of the Super 301 provision. 
The message from the French minister to his interlocutor was 
very clear: France says "No" to any unilateral trade measure of 
this type. The minister also expressed his concern to obtain 
fairer treatment in European-Japanese trade relations. After 
the reinstatement of the Super 301, Toyota declared that it was 
ready to import U.S. spare parts worth $6 billion, a prospect 
which worries the French minister. Yesterday, he expressed this 
worry to French car component manufacturers operating in Japan, 
and today he is going to raise this issue with Toyota President 
Tatsuro Toyoda. "I fully agree that Japanese manufacturers buy 
products in the United States, but this should not be done to 
the detriment of others," he stressed. 
  In this respect, Gerard Longuet announced the organization, 
this year in Paris, of a seminar involving Japanese purchasers 
and French car component manufacturers. He also let it be known 
that, in the current dispute between the United States and 
Japan, Europe could play a "mediating role." Yesterday in 
Brussels, Leon Brittan proposed the creation of a trilateral 
body involving Europe, the United States, and Japan which would 
establish macroeconomic targets for the Japanese with a view to 
pressing them to reform their economy, rather than imposing 
targets expressed in exact figures for each sector, as the 
Americans do. For the first time, Mickey Kantor found the idea 
interesting.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- French Trade and Industry 
Minister Gerard Longuet on Friday [11 March] criticized 
Washington's retaliatory trade policy against Japan and 
encouraged Tokyo not to yield to such U.S. actions, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  While Longuet told Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata that he 
hopes Japan will not yield to Washington's stance of force, Hata 
said Tokyo will neither yield nor respond to talks supposing 
retaliation, the officials said. 
  Longuet said in a 40-minute meeting that France will be 
unhappy if major powers like the United States use force against 
Japan and achieve major results in Japanese markets, they said. 
  Hata told Longuet he has repeatedly urged U.S. officials not 
to take "unilateral" moves. 
  The U.S. Government reinstated the Super 301 trade provision 
which gives it broad powers to impose sanctions against 
countries it judges to have unfair trade practices. 
  Longuet was quoted as saying France is steadily trying to 
promote exports to Japan and has made progress in certain areas 
such as pork and helicopter exports. 
  Hata praised French efforts to promote exports to Japan, 
such 
as its business-boosting campaign called "Le Japon C'est 
Possible," and said he is sure steady efforts will promote 
bilateral economic ties, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Visiting French Trade and 
Industry Minister Gerard Longuet on Friday [11 March] called for 
more purchases of European-made automobile parts by Japan. 
  Speaking at a press conference, Longuet said if Japan opens 
up further to U.S. exports, he hopes the same treatment will be 
awarded to Europe. 
  The French minister's remarks were in reference to the 
drawing of plans by Japanese automakers to import more U.S. car 
parts in line with ongoing U.S. trade negotiations. 
  Longuet said that during the meeting with Japanese leaders, 
France and Japan agreed to set up a private-level committee to 
promote European automotive exports to Japan. 
  He said automakers' use of European car parts in Japan is at 
a ratio of only 1.4 percent. 
  He arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday to have talks with Japanese 
Government and business leaders and attend an international 
conference on assistance to Cambodia.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday brushed aside speculation that Japan will arm 
itself with nuclear weapons, a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  "We wish to contribute to peace and security in the 
(Northeast Asian) region while maintaining the set-up under the 
Japan-U.S. security arrangements," the official quoted Hosokawa 
as saying in an interview with the Korean Broadcasting System 
(KBS). 
  "It is impossible for us to go nuclear in light of the 
nuclear allergy of our people," he reportedly said, explaining 
Tokyo's strictly defensive national security policy under its 
war-renouncing Constitution. 
  The interview, held at Hosokawa's official residence, will 
be 
broadcast on the evening of March 22 in a prime-time special KBS 
program on the premier ahead of South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam's visit to Japan from March 24 through 26. 
  Hosokawa, who visited South Korea for a summit with Kim last 
November, voiced hope the two leaders will reaffirm the need for 
future-oriented Tokyo-Seoul ties, the official said. 
  Expressing deep concern about North Korea's suspected 
nuclear 
weapons development program, the premier called for cooperation 
among Japan, South Korea and the United States in resolving the 
issue, the official said. 
  On bilateral economic relations, Hosokawa noted that the 
transfer of high technology from Japan to South Korea and the 
bilateral trade imbalance in favor of Japan will be brought up 
in discussion of a soon-to-be-created intergovernmental forum 
for new economic partnership, the official said. 
  Hosokawa was also quoted as saying both Japan and the U.S. 
should "take cool and sensible steps" to resolve their brewing 
trade spat, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Japan officially notified 
the United Nations on Wednesday [9 March] that it will dispatch 
a group of 15 election observers to El Salvador on March 15 as 
part of a U.N. peacekeeping mission, government officials said. 
The reply follows the request from U.N. Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali in late February for Japan to send personnel 
to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary 
elections, the officials said. 
  The 15-member Japanese team, comprising three from the 
Foreign Ministry, one from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and 
11 from the private sector, will join a 900-member U.N. unit 
overseeing the polls in the Central American country. 
  A peace agreement, enabling the U.N. to deploy its peace 
mission in El Salvador, was signed in January 1992 after a 
decade-long "proxy war" between the U.S.-backed right-wing 
government and leftist guerrillas, supported by the former 
Soviet Union. 
  El Salvador will be the third country to which Japan has 
sent 
election observers in accordance with the U.N. Peacekeeping 
Cooperation Law, after Angola and Cambodia.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan, SDPJ] members of the cabinet Friday [10 March] 
criticized the government's farm policy, blaming it for the 
current panic in the rice market, officials said. 
  SDP members voiced concerns about the confusion and 
expressed 
their skepticism over the rice policy during informal talks 
following the day's cabinet meeting, they said. 
  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Eiijiro Hata, 
who tried to reassure his colleagues about the rice supply, bore 
the brunt of the criticism. 
  Hata, stressing that the government has secured supplies to 
the end of August, said the problem is the consumers' rush to 
hoard domestic rice. 
  "We will try to halt such rush purchase through the blend 
sales," ordered by the government, he said. 
  The Food Agency recently ordered rice retailers to sell 
domestic rice blended with imports to stop the rush to the 
homegrown crop, triggered by the short supply due to a poor 
harvest last year. 
  Prices of domestically-produced rice have soared since 
consumers who have found imported rice not as palatable as they 
want are trying to stock up domestic rice, while some 
wholesalers are reportedly restricting their sales to boost 
prices. 
  Kosuke Uehara, director general of the National Land Agency, 
said during the informal cabinet talks that the confusion might 
be a product of sloppy management and mishandling on the part of 
the government. 
  Uehara reportedly said "serious consideration" should be 
given to securing a self-sufficient supply of food. 
  Kanju Sato, minister of home affairs, said, "the people have 
lots of anxiety about the blend sales of rice" mandated by the 
government. He asked whether such a step violates the 
Antimonopoly Law. 
  Sato also pointed to the absurdity of the government's 
long-standing policy of reducing rice cultivation in the face of 
a declining rice harvest, according to the officials. 
  The SDP opposed opening the rice market up until the last 
minute before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided last year 
to lift the long-standing ban on rice imports in the course of 
the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, at a news 
conference following the cabinet meeting, admitted that the 
government, which is responsible for rice supply, cannot be 
fully immune to the blame for the rice market turmoil. 
  Takemura pledged to consider a cabinet member meeting over 
the problems as early as next week. 
  At the Diet, Hirofumi Ueno, Food Agency director general, 
said there is no effective way to stop rising rice prices on the 
black market. 
  He told a House of Representatives committee that the most 
important task is to promote smooth distribution of rice through 
government-controlled channels. 
  He said an estimated 38 million tons out of the 1993 crop 
are 
either consumed by growers or sold in the black market.

former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura Friday [11 March] 
on suspicion of taking a 10 million yen bribe from leading 
contractor Kajima Corp. 
  He is the first Diet member to be arrested in a widening

Liberal Democratic Party came after the House of Representatives 
agreed earlier in the day to lift his parliamentary immunity. 
  Legislators cannot be arrested while the Diet is in session 
unless parliament gives its approval. 
  Nakamura surrendered himself to the Tokyo District

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Legislators and party 
representatives Friday [11 March] called the arrest of former 
Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura during the Diet session 
"regrettable," but urged fellow lawmakers to restore political 
morale to regain public trust. 
  House of Representatives member Nakamura was arrested on 
suspicion of bribery after the lower house for the first time in 
26 years approved a relevant petition filed by the Tokyo 
District Court. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who also heads the Japan 
New Party, said the arrest of a legislator while the Diet was in 
session is "really regrettable," but did not elaborate. 
  Japanese legislators cannot be arrested during a Diet 
session 
without a go-ahead from parliament. 
  Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono said "as a 
legislator" he regretted "that things have come so far." Out of 
respect for the Diet's ethical standards, legislators have to 
make sure to clear themselves from any suspicion, he said. 
  Kono's party, which is at the center of the current 
corruption scandal highlighting ties between the construction 
industry and politicians, must make further efforts to "break 
with corruption," Kono said. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest force within 
the ruling coalition, said the Diet's lifting of Nakamura's 
immunity demonstrates parliament's determination to combat 
political corruption. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference his 
party "honors" the Diet decision and urged the prosecution to 
clarify suspicions against Nakamura as soon as possible. 
  Nakamura quit the main opposition LDP on Wednesday. He is 
suspected of having accepted a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima 
Corp., a leading construction firm. 
  Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party), another key coalition member, told reporters the 
Diet's cooperation with prosecutors is important in restoring 
public trust in politics. 
  "We politicians must try to shape up so we can win back 
public trust in politics," he said. 
  House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi, while noting 
the 
need to honor parliamentarians' rights, said that legislators on 
the other hand have the duty to safeguard the credibility of the 
Diet. 
  Health and Welfare Minister Keizo Ouchi, leader of the minor 
coalition Democratic Socialist Party, said it is "really 
regrettable" that the construction bribery scandal has spread as 
far as to an incumbent legislator. 
  He said that for the sake of public trust, the Diet had to 
lift Nakamura's immunity. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, of the SDP, said 
Nakamura's arrest is "extremely bitter" for his ministry as it 
has further undermined voter's trust. 
  Kazuo Shii, chief of the Secretariat of the minor opposition 
Japanese Communist Party (JCP), said Nakamura's arrest is "a 
matter of course" and his case only the tip of the iceberg. 
  He said his party will demand that Shinseito co-leader 
Ichiro 
Ozawa be questioned in connection with a series of bribery 
scandals involving major contractors. 
  With bribes having been disbursed to win public works 
contracts, Hosokawa and his government bear responsibility for 
full clarification of the scandal, Shii said.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis"] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Every time chief coalition 
strategist Ichiro Ozawa fails to get his way through backroom 
politicking, he goes into hiding. 
  It has been his style since he left the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), which often made crucial decisions in high-class 
Japanese restaurants during its 38-year-old grip on power that 
ended last August. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government 
shuns 
such posh "ryotei" restaurants and many of them, already hit 
hard by the burst of Japan's bubble economy, are going under one 
after another. 
  Policy-makers of the seven-party coalition such as the 
51-year-old Ozawa make decisions with help from a handful of 
bureaucrats bargaining on crucial issues behind closed doors, 
sources said. 
  Ozawa, co-leader of the Shinseito Party and a faithful 
servant of one-time LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru, is a strategist 
who has sometimes disappeared from reporters and the public to 
persuade Hosokawa to decide on such key issues as a cabinet 
change and tax hikes. 
  During their reign, LDP faction leaders and senior 
policy-makers held their "backroom" talks in restaurants and 
made bargains on Diet business with leaders of then opposition 
parties. 
  Ozawa is known as a "kuromaku," or mastermind who pulled the 
strings from behind the scenes to topple the government of Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa last year, ending the LDP's 38-year 
reign of power. 
  He and dozens of his fellow parliamentarians, once members 
of 
the LDP's strongest faction led by former Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita, bolted from the LDP and formed a new party last June. 
  Ozawa has stepped out of the public eye since Hosokawa 
failed 
to reshuffle the cabinet on March 2, a move that was chiefly 
aimed at removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
Ozawa was seen as the key person backing the reshuffle, the 
sources said. 
  Ozawa, once dubbed the "prince of the LDP" before leaving 
the 
party, also temporarily disappeared from reporters in December 
after catching the ire of the press with his statement that he 
was holding news conferences as a "service." 
  During that time, Ozawa reportedly demanded that Hosokawa 
remove Takemura from his cabinet, sources said. Takemura and 
Ozawa hold differing ideas, including about the realignment of 
Japanese politics. 
  In addition, Ozawa also helped fashion a 7 percent national 
welfare tax scheme in early February, which was promptly 
withdrawn because of strong opposition from both inside and 
outside the fragile coalition. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa publicly apologized for the welfare 
tax and Takemura episodes, but Ozawa managed to avoid bearing 
the brunt of the failures. 
  Ozawa, who in early January ended his two-month-old 
self-imposed ban on news conferences, is once again out of sight. 
  The Japanese public seems to be frustrated because 
Hosokawa's 
promised "change" has not materialized despite the change of 
venues of politicking from "ryotei" restaurants to hotels and 
other secluded places. 
  Will Mr. Ozawa, who has promised to make Japan a credible 
world power, please stand up?

  [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and U.S. 
officials sat down Friday for talks on the North Korean nuclear 
situation, which both sides agreed was at a crossroads. Seoul's 
Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun and U.S. Assistant Secretary of 
State for Political and Military Affairs Robert Gallucci met to 
evaluate recent developments concerning International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in North Korea and inter-Korean 
dialogue. 
  Officials here said the two sides will reaffirm their two 
preconditions for Washington to hold the next round of 
high-level talks with Pyongyang -- the IAEA inspections must 
conclude successfully and the two Koreas must exchange special 
envoys. 
  "One year ago tomorrow, North Korea announced its withdrawal 
from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Today, we are still 
wrestling with the problem," Kim said in opening the meeting. 
"We have to resolve the problem through dialogue. We maintain 
that principle," he said. 
  The IAEA team is currently in North Korea for inspections 
after a one-year break but the monitoring activities are not 
going as smoothly as expected, according to officials here and 
in Washington. Meanwhile, the inter-Korean contacts on 
exchanging envoys are dragging on with the next meeting set for 
Saturday. Officials say the March 21 meeting between North Korea 
and the United States may well have to be delayed until the two 
preconditions are met. 
  "We have been at a crossroads, and we are again in that 
position," said Gallucci. "This will be a good time to discuss 
the next steps to take together."

  [Text] The ROK and the United States on 11 March 
reconfirmed their position that full and satisfactory nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
must be conducted and that the inter-Korean exchange of special 
envoys must actually be held in order to hold the third round of 
North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. 
  It was also learned that in the high-level meeting on the 
North Korean nuclear issue held at the Foreign Ministry today, 
the ROK and U.S. Governments agreed that if North Korea agrees 
to conduct an envoy exchange by 21 March, the third round of 
North Korean-U.S. talks will be postponed for the same amount of 
days it takes for North Korea to actually conduct an exchange of 
special envoys. 
  Present at the meeting were working-level officials from 
relevant ROK ministries and agencies, such as the Chongwadae 
[presidential office], National Unification Board, Foreign 
Ministry, Defense Ministry, and the Agency for National Security 
Planning, headed by Kim Sam-hun, the ROK Foreign Ministry's 
nuclear ambassador, and the U.S. side was composed of 
working-level officials from the White House, the State 
Department, and the Defense Department, headed by Robert 
Gallucci, assistant secretary of state. 
  It has also been learned that the two countries agreed that 
if North Korea does not properly guarantee IAEA inspections and 
does not agree to the envoy exchange, the announcement on the 
third round of talks and the suspension of the Team Spirit-94 
joint military exercise will be withdrawn, and the two countries 
will push ahead with the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise. 
  The ROK and the United States agreed that if the third round 
of North Korean-U.S. talks are held, North Korea's full return 
to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, special inspection of 
the undeclared nuclear sites, assistance in the replacement with 
light-water moderated reactors, and improvement of North 
Korean-U.S. relations will be dealt with comprehensively 
[pogwalchoguro]. 
  The two countries evaluated the current status of the IAEA 
inspections and the last two rounds of the inter-Korean working 
contacts, and agreed that, on the whole, the IAEA's nuclear 
inspection has proceeded smoothly so far and that a last-minute 
settlement of the issue on exchanging special envoys remained 
possible.

  [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- Seoul and Washington are 
sticking to their prerequisites for the next round of North 
Korea-U.S. high-level negotiations, agreeing that the talks' 
scheduled date would be put off indefinitely if Pyongyang failed 
to meet the conditions. 
  The two countries reaffirmed that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) must conclude successful inspections in 
North Korea and the two Koreas must exchange special envoys 
before the Pyongyang-Washington meeting can take place, Kim 
Sam-hun, Seoul's nuclear ambassador, said after consultations 
with U.S. officials. 
  As to what constitutes successful inspections, Kim said the 
IAEA is responsible for making that determination. "South Korea 
and the United States will respect the IAEA's decision on the 
inspection results," said Kim. 
  Seoul and Washington shared concern over Pyongyang's 
negative 
attitude at inter-Korean contacts, evidenced by its "impure" 
demands, the ambassador told reporters. While repeating their 
commitment to solving the dispute through dialogue, they noted 
that the world's patience was running out. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, also 
chief 
American representative at the two previous high-level talks 
with North Korea, has come to Seoul to draw up strategies in 
dealing with the North Korean nuclear crisis. 
  A team of IAEA inspectors is in North Korea, probably until 
March 15, checking primarily whether the communist state has 
diverted nuclear material to non-peaceful uses. 
  Earlier, Washington made conditional promises to North Korea 
to cancel this year's "Team Spirit" military drill, held 
annually with Seoul, and to meet for further high-level talks on 
March 21. 
  But North Korea must permit full IAEA inspections and 
exchange presidential envoys with South Korea before the 
promises are carried out. The bilateral consultations here came 
amid another budding crisis as Pyongyang holds out on 
inter-Korean dialogue. Kim said after talking with Gallucci 
that he cannot emphasize enough that the envoy exchange is a 
precondition that must be met. 
  The three-hour session dealt with what the next North 
Korea-U.S. talks would cover. "The meeting would in reality be 
the last opportunity to solve the nuclear problem," said Kim. 
"As stated at last November's summit, they would negotiate 
related agendas on a thorough and broad basis." 
  Resolution of the nuclear problem means North Korea's 
complete return to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT], 
acceptance of special inspections of its undeclared facilities 
and implementation of the inter-Korean agreement on 
denuclearization, said Kim. 
  Exactly one year ago this Saturday, North Korea announced it 
was bolting from the NPT, riveting the attention of the 
international community. 
  Speculation here is that North Korea will hold out to the 
last minute on the envoy demand, possibly offering to conduct 
the exchange sometime after March 21. 
  "As I said, the envoys have to have come and gone. It's not 
enough to just agree on the dates of the exchange," said Kim. 
Asked whether that means the March 21 meeting might be delayed 
or cancelled, Kim answered "yes." 
  North Korean and U.S. officials meet for their sixth contact 
Saturday to arrange the envoy visits.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Cha-su: "Another Foul-up in North's </F>
Nuclear Issue, ROK, U.S. Struggle for Solution--Three Scenarios 
Under Discussion"] 
  [Text] There are signs of the North Korean nuclear 
issue--which seemed to be smoothly heading for a 
solution--getting fouled up again. As it has been reported, 
North Korea claims that it has never agreed with the United 
States on the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys as a 
precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level 
talks, thereby showing a negative attitude in the inter-Korean 
working contact. Moreover, the nuclear inspection on North 
Korea by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] appears 
to be running into a problem. 
  The ROK and the United States, therefore, are struggling for 
appropriate measures to cope with this situation. U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, who came to the ROK on 10 
March, his entourage, and relevant government officials are 
supposed to hold a series of meetings on 11 and 12 March to 
intensively discuss countermeasures. 
  Assistant Secretary Gallucci, who heads the U.S. delegation 
to the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, came to Seoul to 
coordinate the ROK and U.S. positions on the third round of 
North Korean-U.S. talks. However, since doubts raised whether 
the third round of talks will be held as scheduled, the ROK-U.S. 
talks are expected to discuss various possible scenarios. 
  The scenarios the ROK and the United States can consider 
are: 
first, if North Korea sincerely permits the IAEA inspections and 
helps realize the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys, 
second, if North Korea sincerely permits the IAEA inspections 
but does not help realize the inter-Korean exchange of special 
envoys before 21 March, and, third, if North Korea obstructs the 
IAEA inspections and refuses to realize the inter-Korean 
exchange of special envoys. 
  In case of the first scenario, the most favorable one, the 
ROK and the U.S. position is to hold the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks on 21 March and discuss extensively the North 
Korean nuclear issue and the improvement of North Korean-U.S. 
relations. The ROK and the United States have set up a policy 
that they will demand that North Korea fully return to the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and permit special inspections. 
The ROK and the U.S. strategy is not to arrive at a package 
solution for the nuclear issue and the North Korean-U.S. 
relations, as North Korea demands, but to accede to the North 
Korean demands on a step-by-step basis depending upon the degree 
of its ensuring nuclear transparency. In other words, the 
lifting of restrictions on trips to North Korea, allowing trade 
with North Korea except strategic goods, guaranteeing in writing 
not waging preemptive strike on North Korea with nuclear arms, 
and opening of a liaison offices, can be made on a step-by-step 
basis. Assistant Secretary Gallucci, in meeting with relevant 
ROK Government officials, is expected to explain the U.S. plan 
as to what sort of "carrot" it could present for the North 
Korean demands, and adjust and coordinate the U.S. position with 
the ROK. 
  In case North Korea sincerely permits the inspections but 
refuses to exchange special envoys before 21 March, the ROK and 
the U.S. position is to postpone the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks until the envoy exchange is made. However, 
noncompliance with the promise for the envoy exchange itself is 
not enough to take the issue on sanctions on North Korea to the 
UN Security Council, so the ROK and the United States will 
continue to persuade North Korea to help realize the envoy 
exchange. 
  The worst scenario is the case in which North Korea refuses 
to sincerely permit the IAEA inspections and to exchange special 
envoys. It has been reported that North Korea raised some 
objections to the IAEA inspection team's activities and 
postponed the taking of test samples from the radioactive 
chemical laboratory and the five-megawatt nuclear reactor, thus 
taking an uncooperative attitude. The basic ROK-U.S. position 
is that if North Korea refuses to permit the inspections of its 
key nuclear facilities in the present IAEA inspection, which is 
scheduled to end on 14 March, North Korea will have to be 
subjected to sanctions by the UN Security Council. 
  The ROK and the United States have set up a policy that they 
will endeavor to bring a complete resolution of the North Korean 
nuclear issue through the third round of the North Korean-U.S. 
talks. They will discuss various countermeasures, but their 
agony continues because they will have to overcome many 
obstacles in view of the North Korean attitude.

  [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government gave the go-ahead Friday for a researcher from the 
Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP) to 
visit North Korea this month. The researcher, Kim Ik-su, will 
attend a United Nations Development Program (UNDP) spot 
investigation of the three countries along the Tumen River. 
This will be the first time that the government has allowed a 
South Korean national to visit North Korea this year. 
  Kim is a member of the Regional Development Strategy (RDS) 
working group under UNDP, which comprises experts from five 
countries including South Korea and Japan. Kim will enter North 
Korea on March 19 via Beijing and investigate the Rajin-Sonbong 
region in the North until March 22. 
  UNDP held an unofficial working meeting in New York on Jan. 
31 and decided to form working groups in six areas, including 
RDS, in order to draw up guidelines for development and 
investment on the Tuman River.

  [Text] A North Korean soldier has asked South Korea for 
asylum after secretly boarding a South Korean cargo ship in 
China. At around 0530 [2030 GMT] this morning, Paek Yong-kil, 
first class sergeant of the 718 Army unit of the North Korean 
People's Army, secretly boarded a ship -- the Chihae Pioneer 
belonging to Heung-A Shipping Company -- asked for asylum upon 
entering Ulsan port. After fleeing from his country to China 
through the Yalu River on 23 November 1993, he secretly boarded 
the Chihae Pioneer ship, in Dalian, China, on 8 March and asked 
for asylum. He said in an interrogation that he had decided to 
defect to South Korea because he was getting tired of the 
socialist system.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Yi Chang-sop from the "Special </F>
Report" section: "US Urged To Scrap Retaliatory Bill"] 
  [Text] Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong yesterday expressed 
a serious concern over negative effects the U.S. "retaliatory" 
financial bill will have on the domestic and foreign financial 
markets. A passage of the bill will result in contracting, 
rather than expanding, the domestic and global financial 
markets, Hong said in an interview with THE KOREA TIMES. 
  He said Seoul will dissuade Washington from introducing the 
bill on the Fair Trade and Financial Services, often called the 
Riegle bill, as it will be used as a tool to put pressure on 
Korea and other countries to open their financial market wider. 
He said, "I can not exclude the possibility of the passage of 
the bill, which will reciprocate against countries which do not 
guarantee full national treatment to American financial services 
firms." 
  Washington has threatened to use the bill to restrict the 
American operations of international financial institutions 
until and unless foreign countries committed to opening their 
markets to U.S. financial institutions. A passage of the bill 
will arm the Treasury Department with more leverage to put 
pressure on Korea for opening its financial markets, he said. 
  Hong excluded the possibility that Washington might use the 
forthcoming APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) finance 
ministers meeting as an opportunity to pry open financial 
markets of the other countries. "The meeting, scheduled to be 
held in March 18-19 in Hawaii, is a forum for discussing 
multilateral issues, not bilateral ones," he said. "The APEC 
meeting is to share our experiences with other members, not to 
discuss bilateral issues," he said, adding that APEC finance 
ministers will discuss multilateral issues to addresses some of 
the challenges facing the region, including ensuring 
non-inflationary regional growth, financing investment, 
infrastructural development and promoting capital market 
development. He did not specify when Seoul will raise the 
foreign stock ownership ceiling, currently set at 10 percent for 
each individual issue. Under the nation's Five-Year Financial 
Reform Plan, Seoul committed itself to raising the ceiling 
sometime between this year and next year, he said. 
  The government will decide, after June, the timing and the 
extent of the ceiling expansion. He, however, said that 
foreigners can expand "indirect investment" in Korean stocks. 
"The government will soon permit such country funds as Korea 
Europe Fund in London and Korea Asia Fund in Hong Kong to 
increase capital. Additionally, three Seoul-based investment 
trust companies will be allowed to set up more funds to help 
foreigners expand indirect investments in Seoul shares." 
  His remark appears to be a clear indication that the 
government will, at least for the time being, encourage 
foreigners to make "indirect" investment rather than direct 
investment. Hong said despite positive effects foreign portfolio 
capital has on the Korean economy, it is true that such capital 
influx has strained the nation's monetary &amp; foreign exchange 
policies as well as inflation. 
  The minister said the government intervened in the stock 
market three times this year as it showed signs of overheating, 
adding, however, that this does not mean Korea is backpedalling 
in its financial internationalization program. He said "Most of 
our stabilization measures include `deregulating' old rules that 
were adopted in the late 1980s to boost the stock market, adding 
that the recent measures do not necessarily mean introduction of 
`new rules.'" He said that Seoul will pursue a capital market 
development program consistently as was stipulated in the 
Five-Year Financial Reform Plan. He added that the government 
will make multi-pronged efforts to balance demand and supply in 
the stock market. He was replying to growing foreign criticism 
that Korea's arbitrary intervention in the stock market has 
overshadowed its reform process and scared away foreign 
investors. 
  The minister said sometime this year, Korea will implement 
part of the third-stage of the interest rate liberalization 
program, which may include extension of maturity of certificates 
of deposit (CDs) and the lowering of its minimum face value of 
50 million won. The minister said Korea will come out with a 
comprehensive plan to activate foreign direct investments by the 
end of May. "If our program is implemented, there will be 
qualitative and quantitative expansion in foreign direct 
investments in Korea," he said. 
  Hong said the timing of Korea's joining the OECD 
[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] will not 
be linked to the nation's pace of financial reform when he was 
asked to comment whether Korea must delay its OECD membership as 
the OECD views the speed of the nation's financial reform is 
"slow." 
  He said by the time Korea joins the OECD around 1996, "Our 
liberalization ratio will be raised significantly." Korea will 
continue to liberalize the financial market even after joining 
the OECD as market-opening and liberalization is a dynamic 
process, he said. 
  Preconditions for OECD membership is not to what extent a 
country is liberalized, but whether the country is willing to 
implement its pre-announced liberalization schedule after 
gaining membership, he said. There has emerged a view that Korea 
may be forced to delay the OECD membership as it may be tough 
for Seoul to meet all of the OECD requirements, especially those 
on foreign exchange and capital flows. 
  He said depending on each country's economic situation, it 
can delay meeting part of the OECD requirements when it applies 
for a membership. In negotiations with the OECD, "we will fully 
explain to it why Korea must delay liberalizing specific 
restrictions," he said. He said the Korea Stock Exchange [KSE] 
will be authorized to handle stock index futures trading from 
1996 in accordance with the pre-announced program but he did not 
say whether Korea will create another futures exchange which 
will compete with the KSE for stock index futures contracts.

  [Text] Korea has dampened "unrealistic" U.S. expectations 
for the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) finance 
ministers meeting, scheduled for March 18-19 in Hawaii, as a 
forum to put pressure on other countries into opening their 
financial markets. 
  In preliminary deputies talks last week, the U.S. Treasury 
Department aired a set of proposals that could be developed into 
institutional mechanisms for expanding market access for U.S. 
financial firms. For example, Washington suggested the creation 
of a committee to "study the rule of foreign financial 
institutions in APEC countries as well as liberalization of 
their capital markets." 
  Korea, Japan, and even Brunei rejected the idea as it does 
not deal with multilateral issues for common prosperity of the 
region, according to Assistant Finance Minister Yim Chang-yol. 
Instead, the deputies agreed to adopt the Four-Cs (consensus, 
cooperation, cordiality and consultation) as a guiding principle 
of the APEC finance ministers meeting, Yim said. Furthermore, 
the meeting will be "non-binding" and no country will play the 
role of "coordinator" in the forum, Yim said. 
  Despite such a suspicious attitude among APEC countries, 
analysts here expect the United States to "make the point in the 
Hawaii meeting that financial market integration and 
liberalization is in APEC's best interests." Washington is said 
to have adopted "three principles" in further opening the Asian 
financial markets, they said. First of all, the United States, 
out of its ambition to open up foreign financial markets, 
threatens not to grant most-favored-nation (MFN) status to 
foreign firms in which countries deny full market access and 
national treatment to U.S. firms. It is looking for bilateral 
agreements which offer reasonable market access and national 
treatment. In the case of Korea, the United States might use 
the standard of "equality of competitive opportunity," instead 
of national treatment, analysts said. 
  Washington is said to be prepared to guarantee full market 
access and national treatment to countries which give U.S. firms 
satisfactory access and national treatment, they noted. The 
United States is said to be seeking to negotiate constructively 
with foreign countries, including Korea. There will be a 
standstill or "grandfathering" of existing operations of firms 
already in the U.S. market during negotiations. Furthermore, 
U.S. Treasury officials are said to be airing the position that 
the United States will not unreasonably refuse access to nations 
which are not already in the U.S. market, analysts said. 
  The U.S. objective remains multilateral. However, Washington 
argues that it can not accept the situation in which other 
nations retain the right to discriminate against U.S. firms 
while they are permitted to expand in the U.S. market, analysts 
said. Washington officials are said to be asserting that they 
will be reasonable and pragmatic. For example, the United 
States understands the Korean position which considers that its 
financial system is an integral part of its economic policy and 
its financial system should remain in domestic hands, they said. 
U.S. officials understand this, analysts here said. 
  However, Treasury officials allegedly cite ASEAN countries, 
Japan, Korea and Brazil as their main "problem" countries 
regarding full access to the U.S. services agreement. It may 
intensify its financial policy talks (FPT) with these countries 
over the next two years with the expectation of reaching an 
agreement which would enable the Treasury Department not to 
apply the MFN exemption, analysts said. 
  In carrying out such action, the U.S. Treasury Department 
has 
the legislative authority to reciprocate against foreign 
financial firms which apply to expand their operations or seek 
new operations in the United States. For example, it has 
existing Section 301 authority of the Trade Act to take such 
action. But the Treasury Department has been reluctant to use 
this authority in the past except in cases of third country 
restrictions on market access of U.S. insurance companies. 
  The Treasury Department also expects Congress to enact the 
"Fair Trade in Financial Services" act this year. For the first 
time, the U.S. administration has taken a united position in 
supporting this legislation. However, there are still problems 
in winning passage, particularly in the House of 
Representatives, analysts said.

  [Text] Pusan, Mar. 11 (YONHAP) -- Travel agents here were 
reacting furiously on Friday against the decision of the U.S. 
Consulate General in this port city to stop issuing U.S. visas 
through travel agents. 
  The American Consulate told the representatives of 21 travel 
agents in this area on Friday afternoon that the consulate would 
cease to issue visas through agents effective April 1. 
  "This is a retaliatory step against us as there has been a 
move among us to denounce the consulate's earlier decision to 
restrict the number of travel agents authorized to handle visa 
requests," a travel agency official said. 
  The consulate said that beginning April 1 travel agents or 
individuals should apply for visas directly at the U.S. Embassy 
in Seoul. 
  The U.S. Consulate said, however, it would continue to 
handle 
visa reissuance for those in Pusan and South and North Kyongsang 
Provinces, whose application, it said, should be filed 
individually not through travel agents. 
  The new decision is expected to cause much inconveniences to 
would-be U.S. travelers as well as to adversely affect the 
business of travel agents in the region. 
  "We will condemn this measure of the U.S. Consulate General 
through large-scale rallies to be held jointly with citizens 
organizations," the travel agency official said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
met with the chairman of the main opposition Democratic Party 
[DP], Yi Ki-taek, Friday and agreed on the need to clean up the 
political climate. 
  At a two-hour meeting Friday morning, Kim and Yi, however, 
disagreed on abolition of the controversial National Security 
Law, Yi's proposed visit to North Korea and ratification of the 
Uruguay Round accord. 
  The two party leaders also showed a considerable difference 
of opinion on the political neutrality of the police. 
  The meeting, held at the invitation of the president, was 
their second since Kim Yong-sam inaugurated the first civilian 
administration in more than three decades in February last year. 
  In view of their differing opinions, the abolition of the 
National Security Law and National Assembly ratification of the 
Uruguay Round agreement are expected to become hot political 
items in the months ahead. 
  Responding to Yi's demand that the National Security Law be 
revised, President Kim said firmly: "It cannot be done." 
  "North Korea, which had denounced the South in propaganda 
broadcasts for 10 hours a day, is doing it now for 13 hours a 
day and it (Pyongyang) has never given up its ambition of 
communizing the South. 
  "Under the circumstances, we cannot revise the National 
Security Law any more," the president said, according to 
presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. 
  With regard to Yi's request for support of his plans to 
visit 
North Korea, President Kim warned the DP chairman might be 
"caught up" in North Korea's strategy to communize the South. 
  Yi's plans to visit North Korea at a time when Pyongyang is 
trying to gain nuclear weapons capability are undesirable both 
for Yi and the country. 
  Commenting on the Uruguay Round, Kim said renegotiation of 
the global trade agreement is not possible, while asking Yi to 
marshal opposition support for ratification of the accord at the 
National Assembly. 
  As for issues of political neutrality of the country's 
police 
forces, the president said the National Police Administration 
has already been launched for that purpose. "There was no need, 
however, to set up a new government agency for police neutrality 
in a small country like ours," Kim said. 
  Touching on implementation of the revised political bills 
that were just passed by the National Assembly, President Kim 
said there can be no ruling and opposition parties "in the sense 
that they (new laws) signal a renaissance of parliamentary 
democracy in this country." 
  The president also pledged to mobilize all administrative 
powers to crack down on those who break election laws during 
polls for the heads of local autonomous governing bodies in 1995. 
  "It does not matter how many law-breakers we catch," Kim 
said. "We will bring all of them to justice." 
  Yi told the president that the government should demonstrate 
its determination to implement the new political laws in order 
to foster a cleaner political climate. 
  The opposition leader also proposed that National Assembly 
proceedings be televised to help realize political reform. 
  On the National Security Law, Yi said it should be replaced 
with democratic law-and-order legislation or absorbed into the 
criminal code because the law as it stands now is liable to 
abuse. 
  With regard to the North Korean nuclear question, Yi said it 
should be resolved through negotiation among the three involved 
parties -- the United States, and South and North Korea.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Myong-chol: "Yi Firms His Grip on Cabinet </F>
To Secure the Sphere of Power"] 
  [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- In the three months 
since he became the second prime minister of the Kim Yong-sam 
government, Yi Hoe-chang has tightened his grip on the cabinet 
and carved out a sphere of influence. 
  As one noteworthy example, he recently decided to 
discontinue 
subsidies to civil organizations thus far supported by the 
government such as the Saemaul (New Village) Movement without 
consulting beforehand with Chongwadae. 
  And on Thursday, he made important remarks on the 
internationally sensitive North Korean nuclear issue, a 
significant departure from his predecessors. 
  Widely known as a man of principle and conviction, Yi 
ordered 
Home Minister Choe Hyong-u on Tuesday to stop giving financial 
support to the Saemaul Movement, the Association for Just Living 
and other civil organizations, and to take steps enabling these 
movements to stand on their own feet. 
  The decision took many in the government by surprise, 
because 
he announced it without prior consultation with Chongwadae. 
  President Kim's aides at Chongwadae were unhappy, not only 
because they were not consulted in advance but also because they 
think it premature for the government to discontinue subsidies 
to civil movements. 
  "Civil movements should, in principle, be self-reliant and 
free from the government's influence and of the nature of 
volunteer services," he told reporters on Thursday. "When they 
use government funds for their programs, they can invite public 
distrust and misunderstanding, however good their cause may be, 
and this is why I decided to stop supporting them." 
  One of Yi's aides said, "It's true that he did not discuss 
the decision with any Chongwadae officials, but he must have had 
sufficient communication with President Kim on this matter." 
  Yi's way of announcing the decision was unique: He 
personally issued an order to Home Minister Choe, unlike his 
predecessors who made such announcements at cabinet meetings -- 
almost without exception. 
  By giving an order to Choe, known as "a strong man" in the 
Kim Yong-sam government due to his long relationship with the 
president, Yi made it clear that Choe is but one of the cabinet 
members under his control. 
  All cabinet ministers are "real power," he remarked only 
days 
after he took office late last year. 
  In a meeting of related ministers just before the recent 
extraordinary parliamentary session, Yi hinted at a plan to 
reform government-funded civil movements. 
  When Home Minister Choe discussed a plan to reduce subsidies 
to civil movements gradually over a period of four to five 
years, Yi asked, "Is there any need for such a gradual approach?" 
  Then came his decision to stop handing out government funds 
to them once and for all. 
  On the North Korean nuclear issue, he warned on Thursday 
that 
the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks would not 
take place and the suspended South Korea-U.S. military exercise 
"Team Spirit" this year would be held if the ongoing 
inter-Korean dialogue fails to make any headway. 
  This was an unexpected and exceptional warning by a premier, 
because almost all of Yi's predecessors made it a rule to avoid 
commenting on sensitive political and foreign policy issues. 
  Yi issued the warning at a press conference where he 
disclosed the results of a high-level strategic meeting of 
unification-related ministers he presided over that morning, 
indicating that he has a voice in any matters the government 
deals with. 
  He recently said he would meet the press at least once a 
month to make known his views on major problems facing the 
government. 
  One of his aides, who served several premiers before Yi, 
said, "He's a premier of the new generation," pointing to two 
things that make Yi different from his predecessors. 
  One is that Yi cares little about the reactions of senior 
presidential aides when he makes a policy and the other is that 
he asks for an exclusive meeting with President Kim whenever he 
considers it necessary. 
  Premier Yi, as the government's No. 2 man, ought to be that 
way in running the administrative branch. But his predecessors 
did not act similarly. For instance, one of them asked for the 
presidential secretariat's permission when he gave a small 
present to each reporter covering his office. 
  In addition to his weekly meeting with President Kim, Yi 
often has special in-depth talks with his boss, according to the 
prime minister's close associates. 
  Thanks to his frequent communication with President Kim and 
his firm grip on the cabinet, Yi can fully exercise his power as 
No. 2 man. 
  His grip on the cabinet is based on an ability to keep his 
wits about him when pressing tasks facing the government and his 
experience as a court judge passing judgement in criminal and 
civil cases. 
  His experience as a judge, which necessitates reading many 
case reports, helps him quickly understand many reports 
submitted by cabinet ministers and others. 
  He is particularly good at pinpointing faults in reports and 
is rather cold when criticizing his subordinates for making 
mistakes. 
  Recently, Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok felt 
Yi's 
wrath for an error in his anti-inflation report, according to 
Yi's aides. 
  Yi ordered his aides to make a list of the steps he had 
promised to take at the recent interpellation session of 
parliament, saying he would check the list periodically to see 
if the steps have actually been taken. 
  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang is a man of his word.

<F P=106> [From the "Special Report" supplement; article by Yi </F>
Pil-sang, professor of finance and dean of planning and public 
relations at Korea Univerity: "Defective Financial Reform 
Strands Economy"] 
  [Text] Upon its inauguration last year, the Kim Yong-sam 
administration launched a nationwide movement for a New Economy 
to be led by the people's participation and creativity. To this 
end, the economic staff of President Kim has been engrossed in 
pushing for financial reform. 
  The obsolescence of the finance sector had long been cited 
as 
a fundamental reason for manipulation of the economy by the rich 
and the powerful for their own monopolistic ends instead of it 
being nourished to provide benefits to all sectors of society. 
After thirty years of such manipulation, the income gap has 
widened to a point were it could spark social conflict, which 
could throw further economic development into a dilemma. 
  Against this backdrop, the implementation of the real name 
financial transaction system had given fresh hope to all. The 
real-name system was pushed decisively ahead in last August last 
[as published] by an emergency presidential decree as the core 
part of the administration's economic reforms. The real-name 
financial system was to eradicate all kinds of underground 
economic malpractices including speculative transactions and 
black market deals. 
  The second stage of interest rate liberalization was another 
achievement of the new administration. The second phase called 
for the liberalization of interest rates on all loans excluding 
government policy loans. The deregulation of lending rates was 
aimed at bringing financial market mechanisms back to normal in 
a bid to correct the distorted flow of funds. The prolonged 
control of interest rates had functioned as a nucleus giving 
birth to mammoth underground curb markets. 
  Despite the drastic financial reforms, they have failed to 
bring about hopeful surge in investment activities and equitable 
prosperity. The recent economic trend rather signifies the 
sufferings borne by the general public. During the first two 
months of this year consumer prices rose by 2.4 percent 
threatening already to surpass the target of 3 percent 
stipulated in the government's New Economy plan. Last year, the 
annual inflation rate was recorded at 5.8 percent, reaching far 
beyond the target level for the year. On the contrary, the rich 
extravagantly spent on imported goods with new money. Equipped 
with abundant liquidity, the rich play in the casino-like stock 
market. As a result the unprivileged still stand deprived of 
hope. 
  More gloomy the benefits of increased exports which are made 
by the appreciation of the Japanese yen are monopolized by big 
businesses. [sentence as published] The lopsided business boom 
could tear the economy into two extremes, i.e., excessive boom 
for big businesses and serious suffering for small businesses. 
  The fundamental reason for the negative trend lies in that 
the financial reforms were pushed largely in the context of 
political show off. The primary purpose of the real-name system 
was to bring the underground markets out into the open, thus to 
lawfully divert unlawful funds into industrial purposes. 
Nevertheless, the government was just busy enough to trap 
illegal funds under their control utilizing tax probes. 
  Such a political and bureaucratic approach immediately 
produced an uneasy economic environment discouraging business 
activities. The depression of business activities was amplified 
by the significant increase in the collapse of small business 
firms. More than 40 percent of their funds had been secured 
from the curb markets. Upon implementation of the real name 
system, the curb markets were virtually frozen causing small 
business firms to suffer financial difficulties. Although the 
government instantly came up with measures to offer financial 
support, the effects bore little results. 
  What was important to the government was the fact itself 
that 
the real-name system was implemented rather than the content on 
how the new system would affect the economy. Actually, the 
real-name system implemented by the government did little but 
provide legitimacy to illegal financial transactions by the use 
of borrowed names. Out of a total of 33 trillion won in 
financial assets estimated to have been traded under non-real 
names, only six trillion were changed into real names, which 
implies some 27 trillion won of assets still are hidden under 
borrowed names disguised as real. 
  The government plan for the second phase of liberalization 
of 
interest rates was not effective either in terms of invigorating 
financial market functions and correcting underground financial 
transactions. The government did not allow free deposit rates 
under the second phase. After implementation of the real-name 
system, the liberalization that had been needed desperately was 
the decontrol of deposit rates. Affected by the real-name 
system, the underground funds were frozen and the velocity of 
money has significantly fallen. Meanwhile, the government has 
continuously supplied new money in a measure to rescue business 
firms from their financial difficulties. Theses two factors 
combined to put the economy into a trap of liquidity. Under 
this situation, the need for decontrol of deposit rates was 
absolute in order to have financial institutions absorb the 
excess liquidity and channel the funds into productive 
investment. 
  Most defective of the government's financial reforms, the 
independence of the central bank was put off for good. The 
revision of the law for an independent central bank was on the 
list of major election pledges made by President Kim. The 
independence of the central bank carries crucial importance as 
it halts the vicious political business cycle. It is a general 
consensus among economists that only an independent central bank 
can pursue a stable monetary policy that may be politically 
unpopular yet in public interests. 
  The current uneasy economic trend may be termed as another 
vicious business cycle escalated by political pressure in the 
absence of the independence of the central bank. Immediately 
after taking office the administration unveiled a 100-day 
economic boosting measures in a bid to restore vitality to the 
stagnant economy. 
  The 100-day plan was not adequate at all as it did not take 
into account the structural dilemmas faced by the economy. 
After the collapse of the large bubble of speculation, the 
economy had been experiencing structural stagflation. Thus the 
prime economic task was to maintain a stabilization policy and 
then to reform the structure. Many economists pointed out that 
should an expansionary policy be adopted the stagflation would 
spread rapidly to every sector of the economy. 
  The 100-day stimulus plan was considered by economists as a 
political scheme to turn the economic trend into a mood of 
celebration. The 100-day plan called for massive expansion of 
money supply, pushing business firms to initiate new investment 
ventures. Concurrently the plan called for sharing the pain 
asking workers to abide by low wage increases and business firms 
to freeze prices of goods to control inflation. During the 
100-day plan some six trillion won in new money was poured into 
the economy. The new printing of money did not stop here. In 
the wake of implementation of the real-name system, the 
government initiated another round of injeting new money to 
soothe adverse impacts. With this, some four trillion won was 
printed. Meanwhile the liberalization of interest rates brought 
about a third phase of money expansion as a measure to reduce a 
possible hike in market interest rates. Some two trillion won 
was again released on this account. As feared in the beginning, 
the money expansion set inflation on fire which is now pushing 
the economy into a state of disorder. 
  To make matters worse, the government has successively 
yielded to foreign pressure to open domestic financial markets. 
Last year some five trillion won in foreign funds flowed into 
local securities markets as hot money to blow a speculation 
wind. Encouraged by the inflow of foreign funds the stock 
market index rose to nearly 1,000 points which is the highest 
since 1989. The massive inflow of foreign capital raises public 
concern that it paralyzes economic stabilization by making 
monetary policy impotent in controlling money supply. This 
year, another 10 trillion won in foreign funds is yet to come. 
  Overall, the defective financial reforms are producing an 
economic quagmire. Thus corrective measures are needed to 
remedy the limping real-name system, such as early 
implementation of the global income tax system. Without a 
global tax system, the real-name system functions little because 
the system has no tool to penalize illegal transactions. Once 
the global system is installed, the lenders of names will have 
to pay taxes. Thus, the irregular transactions under assumed 
names would disappear. 
  From the legal point of view, a legislative measure is 
necessary to outlaw financial transactions under assumed names. 
  The decontrol of deposit rates remains another task of the 
government. The controlled low deposit rates continuously 
discourage national savings making scare funds available for 
industrial purposes. From this, the problem of printing new 
money and the rise in underground curb markets has naturally 
stemmed. 
  The revision of the central bank law must be hurried in 
order 
to have the financial reforms function the right way. 
  To root out irregularities, the severance of the unhealthy 
tie between politics and economics is a prerequisite. It is a 
tie that has subordinated the central bank to the Ministry of 
Finance as a window to print money. 
  The Ministry of Finance has had the central bank serve 
virtually as a money pump for political spending. With no power 
to resist this, the central bank could only wring its hands as 
the economy endured disastrous inflation of 20 to 30 percent per 
year. The painful experience of money pumping was repeated 
again last year. 
  The financial reform plan made by the government includes 
the 
major overhaul of the existing financial industry structure to 
modernize the obsolescent market system under the heavy-handed 
guidance of the Ministry of Finance. A serious concern rises 
that the government's determination of business boundaries for 
each financial institution and restructuring of the financial 
industry may rather deteriorate the development of financial 
market functions because it will legally erect entry barriers 
and limit free business activities. The arbitrary government 
intervention has been the major cause for the prolonged 
obsolescence of the finance industry in Korea. The government 
plan may well be regarded as another bureaucratic attempt to 
build an iron wall against the growth of market viability. 
  The ultimate choice for the government to take is to allow 
full-fledged deregulation and let financial institutions 
determine autonomously the relevant industry structure and 
operation rules to their liking. If a free hand is given, a 
competitive market mechanism will be formed to push each 
institution to develop its own specialty for survival. And the 
efficient industry structure will emerge as an evolutionary 
process based on market needs in a long run perspective.

  [Text] The administration decided to rule out favoritism 
for large companies in the course of disposing of government 
equities of 23 state-financed corporations to the private hand 
as part of efforts to minimize potential backlash of 
privatization. 
  It will finalize detailed ways and means of their 
privatization with enough time, not sticking to the 
previously-set deadline of September. 
  The decision was made by senior officials from relevant 
ministries in a meeting convened by Vice Economic Planning 
Minister Han I-hun Wednesday which focused on reviews of 
problems which could arise in the privatization process, 
officials present at the two-hour session said yesterday. 
  It came after critics blamed the administration for 
commissioning the Federation of Korean Industries, a lobbying 
group of conglomerates, to select the winning bidder for the 
second cellular phone business license and letting some chaebols 
[business conglomerates] share interests in this project. 
  Concrete measures will be determined later but officials 
were 
initially inclined to divide business scopes of Korea Gas Corp. 
[KGC] into several parts and put them under the control of 
private investors to lead them to competition. 
  In this regard, each supply network and station of liquefied 
natural gas will have a different largest shareholder. KGC is 
subject to privatization next year. 
  A golf course in the Cheju resort of Chungmun, run by Korea 
National Tourism Corp., will be placed on a public tender after 
thorough assessment of its value by August. 
  Officials will keep deliberating on whether or not they will 
allow National Agricultural Cooperative Federation to maintain 
the controlling share of 25 percent in Namhae Chemical Corp., a 
chemical fertilizer producer, for stable supply of the key 
farming material. 
  However, they will positively consider permitting the 
participation by large companies in a bidding for the purchase 
of Hanjung shares because the giant firm will not be managed 
effectively without their involvement. 
  Hanjung, formerly Korea Heavy Industry &amp; Construction 
Co., 
will be handed over to private shareholders gradually after 1996 
when it will lose its 15-year authorization to solely supply 
large power generating facilities.

<F P=106> [From the "Special Report" supplement by staff reporter Cho </F>
Chae-hyon: "Enterprises Increasingly Raise Funds Through Direct 
Financing"] 
  [Text] Enterprises are changing the way they raise funds 
to increasing reliance on direct financing such as issuing 
stocks and bonds. 
  It has been pointed out that domestic industrial firms have 
excessively relied on borrowing from financial institutions and 
their capital structures are a far cry from being as strong as 
foreign firms'. The more they borrow from financial firms, the 
more they have to pay in interest, which results in blunting 
their competitive edge against foreign counterparts. 
  As financial liberalization rolls on, firms will be given 
more diverse opportunities to raise funds at cheaper costs than 
before. As the government is moving to give more opportunities 
for firms to raise funds by issuing bonds and stocks, it is 
predicted that they will continue to increase their dependence 
on direct financing, refraining from borrowing from banks and 
short-term financing firms. 
  At present, domestic industrial firms are relying heavily on 
borrowing from banks and nonbanks to raise funds as they are 
relatively restricted in doing so overseas and by issuing 
shares. Out of total funds raised by firms, an average of about 
40 percent has come from borrowing from banks and nonbanks since 
1990, according to statistics furnished by the Ministry of 
Finance and Economic Planning Board. For 1993, enterprises 
borrowed 16 percent of their total outside borrowings including 
direct and indirect financing from banks and 25 percent from 
nonbanks. It shows they are more dependent on nonbanks than on 
banks when they borrow. By comparison, their indirect financing 
ratio against outside borrowing was 38.4 percent in 1990, 43.7 
percent in 1991 and 38.2 percent in 1992. 
  The direct financing ratio against outside borrowing sharply 
rose last year. It was 42.4 percent in 1990, 37.3 percent in 
1991 and 37.6 percent in 1992 before it rose to 50 percent last 
year. But the direct financing ratio is still far lower than 
that of economically-advanced nations, indicating that domestic 
firms should further be encouraged to raise more funds by 
issuing stocks and bonds, and increasing loans in overseas 
financial markets. 
  In particular, the ratio of overseas borrowing against 
outside borrowing remains at a negligible degree. Many domestic 
enterprises have enhanced their credit ratings in overseas 
financial markets so they can raise funds overseas taking 
advantage of their high credit ratings. 
  But they are heavily restricted from doing so by the 
government's tough stance against borrowing overseas. The 
government has banned industrial firms from getting commercial 
loans overseas in order to counter the surge in foreign capital 
inflow. 
  Against this backdrop, the ratio of overseas borrowings to 
outside borrowings was 6.8 percent in 1992 and a meager 0.8 
percent last year. 
  By comparison, domestic companies are more heavily dependent 
on indirect financing than Japanese firms, according to a survey 
compiled by a research institute affiliated with Citizens 
National Bank. Japanese firms are increasing their dependence 
on direct financing as they raised 57 percent of their outside 
borrowings through direct financing in 1990 and 69.7 percent in 
1992. The ratio for Korean firms was 42.4 percent in 1990 and 
37.6 percent in 1992. 
  The research institute said Japanese enterprises maintained 
close relations with banks and relied heavily on bank loans 
until the 1970s but they continued to reduce their borrowings 
from banks since the 1980s. The report said that since the 
first oil-shock, companies had to be active in reducing their 
borrowings from banks because of the sharp drop in their 
earnings in the wake of the oil-shock. Japanese firms were 
freer than Korean firms in borrowing overseas, thanks to the 
financial market deregulation there and the promotion of their 
credit ratings in world financial markets. Japanese firms were 
able to raise their dependence on direct financing by increasing 
issuance of additional shares, acumulating profits and issuing 
bonds overseas, it said. 
  The report said that Japanese banks tried to increase their 
capital by attracting outside funds through issuing additional 
shares and were able to reduce their funding costs by tapping 
foreign loans through floating bonds overseas. 
  According to the report, Japanese firms mobilized all 
possible measures to cut their funding costs as much as possible 
by analyzing foreign exchange rates and interest rates overseas. 
  Despite the Korean firms' smaller dependence on direct 
financing, it is expected that they will be able to raise more 
funds through direct financing methods in the years to come. In 
a recent report, the Economic Planning Board forecast that 
domestic business concerns will rely more on direct financing 
than indirect financing and will increase borrowings overseas 
due to the on-going financial market liberalization. It 
predicted that companies listed on the Korea Stock Exchange will 
be able to issue additional shares and a growing number of 
companies will be allowed to go public as Seoul stock market 
conditions improve despite ups and downs in the stock index. 
  The government announced a series of measures to cool down 
the stock market last month that included an increase in supply 
of stocks in the market. Thus it will be a lot easier for firms 
to issue additional shares on the Korea Stock Exchange this year. 
  The prevailing perception in the financial market is that 
firms will have to reduce their borrowings from banks partly 
because the financial authorities are calling on banks to 
refrain from extending excessive loans to firms in order to 
control growth in the total money supply. 
  Accordingly, bank loan operations are changing. In the past, 
banks passively waited for borrowers to come to them but now 
they go out to find borrowers. Banks are moving to offer new 
financial services in which they give financial information to 
enterprises about the best methods to raise funds at the lowest 
possible interest rates after analyzing foreign exchange rates 
and interest rates. A banker said that what bank employees are 
doing now is making phone calls to big business groups to entice 
them to use funds, a turnaround from their past loan operations. 
Banks have to double their efforts to develop new promising 
companies as their major clients as big business groups, which 
are major clients for them, will continue to shun them as 
financial market liberalization gains momentum. 
  It is desirable for industrial firms to increase their 
dependence on direct financing because it will strengthen their 
financial and capital structures, many central bank officials 
said. In order to increase their dependence on direct 
financing, they will have to scrap past business styles in which 
they increased facilities to the extent that the supply of goods 
surpasses the demand. When they keep increasing investment in 
facilities or plants without sufficiently reflecting market 
conditions and their financial status, they will have to 
continue to increase their dependence on indirect financing, 
which will result in worsening their capital structures.

  [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- The Office of Bank 
Supervision is investigating a report on the alleged outflow of 
foreign exchange at Citibank's Seoul branch. 
  An official at the office said, "we are investigating the 
Seoul branch of Citibank after it was reported that the bank 
secretly sent out an enormous amount of money to a foreign 
country in a transaction with a religious group." 
  "NAEIL SINMUN," a weekly newsmagazine, reported in a recent 
issue that the Seoul branch of Citibank accepted a deposit of 
more than 10 billion won (about 12.36 million U.S. dollars) at 
low annual interest rates of 1-6 percent and had Citibank's Hong 
Kong branch illegally pay a person affiliated with the religious 
group 1.3 billion won. 
  According to the report, Citibank drew up an interest swap 
contract with a company in Hong Kong to provide an annual 8.84 
percent forward exchange rate in June 1991 and to receive spot 
exchange rates slightly higher than the London inter-bank 
offered rate (libor). 
  The bank claimed to have suffered a loss in the contract, 
which said it should pay higher interest than the actual rate, 
while in reality giving a sum equal to the loss through 
Citibank's Hong Kong branch to someone designated by the 
religious group, the report said. 
  NAEIL SINMUN reported that Citibank's Seoul branch paid a 
relatively high interest rate, while international interest 
rates were dropping, because it intended to send foreign 
exchange to a foreign country under the pretense of a legal 
final transaction. 
  Citibank said the Hong Kong company with which it made the 
swap contract is a British bank, but failed to explain clearly 
why the firm is not registered in the colony. 
  Citibank said, however, that the religious group's deposit 
and the swap contract are unrelated and that banks often suffer 
losses in swap transactions. 
  The bank claimed that NAEIL SINMUN wrote a distorted report, 
saying, "We are studying legal action against the weekly."

  [Text] Seoul, Mar. 11 (YONHAP) -- Nearly half of the 
foreign farm goods, plants and horticultural items imported last 
year were found unacceptable due to blight and harmful insects. 
  According to the National Plant Quarantine Service on 
Friday, 
74,520,000 tons of imported grains and special crops were found 
unacceptable. 
  The amount accounted for 44.1 percent of the total brought 
into the country last year. 
  By item, the "unacceptable" goods represented 75 percent of 
the total corn imported last year, 74.3 percent of raw coffee, 
38.7 percent of sesame, 35.1 percent of red bean, 33.3 percent 
of soy bean, and 8.9 percent of wheat. 
  The quarantine service had importers exterminate blight and 
insects before the items affected were cleared through the 
customs. Those which could not be properly disinfected were 
discarded. 
  The imported items discarded last year included 502 tons of 
acorns and 309 tons of dried fernbrakes, both from China, and 28 
tons of grapefruits from the United States.

<F P=106> ["Traitor's Outburst Inciting Confrontation" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam at "the graduation ceremony of the military academy of 
the air force" Tuesday let loose a bellicose blast calling for 
"maximized combat power" of the puppet army and "ultra-modern 
military equipment", raising a hue and cry over the fictitious 
"deployment of Armed Forces in the forward areas by the North". 
  Earlier, on the 4th of March, the traitor showed up at "the 
graduation ceremony of the military academy of the Navy" and 
incited war fever. 
  It is ill-boding that Kim Yong-sam accompanied by brasshats 
incited the consciousness of confrontation and war fever at the 
military academies at a time when working-level contacts for the 
exchange of special envoys were underway. 
  This shows that the puppets are little interested in the 
improvement of the inter-Korean relations, but persistently 
seek only division and confrontation. 
  With the traitor Kim Yong-sam remaining in power, neither 
the 
successful promotion of North-South dialogue nor peace of the 
Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification is thinkable.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- The following is the full 
text of a joint announcement by the U.S.-Japan Security 
Consultative Committee on Friday [11 March]: 
  1. The governments of the United States and Japan held their 
first security consultative committee meeting under the new 
format in Tokyo on March 11, 1994. Representing the United 
States were Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Undersecretary of Defense Frank G. Wisner. Representing Japan 
were Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs 
Tsutomu Hata and Director General of the Defense Agency Kazuo 
Aichi. 
  2. The two sides affirmed that the U.S.-Japan alliance has 
grown stronger and has increased in importance in the post-Cold 
War period. The treaty of mutual cooperation and security 
between Japan and the United States of America, the basis of the 
bilateral security relationship for almost 35 years, remains 
vital to the maintenance of peace and stability in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  The two sides noted that the security treaty also 
constitutes 
the foundation of our political partnership, which is pivotal to 
peace and stability in the world. 
  The vigorous partnership between the United States and 
Japan, 
based on strong bilateral security ties, is also an essential 
element of an emerging Pacific community. 
  3. The United States reiterated its commitment to 
maintaining a strong, forward-deployed military presence in 
Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. also expressed 
appreciation for Japan's high-level host nation support, for the 
provision of facilities and areas for use by U.S. forces in 
Japan, and for the hospitality of host communities. These are 
valuable contributions to the effective forward deployment of 
U.S. forces and thereby to our mutual security. The two sides 
confirmed the importance of Japan continuing such host nation 
support, and agreed to start consultations on this in the coming 
months, taking into consideration that the current special 
measures agreement is to expire at the end of March 1996. 
  The continued harmonious use of facilities and areas by U.S. 
forces in Japan is indispensable to deterrence and the readiness 
of U.S. forces in Japan. At the same time, the understanding 
and cooperation of host communities are essential to the smooth 
and effective operation of the security treaty. Both sides are 
determined to continue their cooperation on issues related to 
facilities and areas provided to U.S. forces. In this context, 
the two sides pledged to continue their efforts for 
consolidation and realignment of facilities and areas, 
particularly in Okinawa, consistent with the purposes of the 
security treaty and U.S. operational requirements. 
  4. The two sides stressed the importance of interoperability 
and complementary defense cooperation. They also noted that 
cooperation in acquisition and defense technology exchange has 
contributed to the effective operation of the security 
arrangements and enhancement of mutual security. In this 
connection, the two sides stressed the importance of expanding 
the two-way flow of defense technology. 
  5. The stability of the Korean peninsula is of vital 
interest to both the United States and Japan. The two countries 
have worked closely together on the North Korean nuclear issue. 
The two sides reaffirmed that a diplomatic solution is the best 
means of resolving the issue. They insist on North Korea's full 
compliance with all of its international commitments, including 
the Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  The two sides endorsed efforts to enhance regional political 
and security dialogues and welcomed the convening of the ASEAN 
regional forum. They noted the need to increase the 
transparency of defense plans and expenditures among the nations 
of the Asia-Pacific region in order to enhance their shared 
sense of security. 
  6. The two sides emphasized that the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and missiles poses a serious 
challenge to our mutual security and that it is important to 
counter such threats. The United States and Japan continue to 
discuss theater missile defense in bilateral security 
consultations.

  [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
received U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political and 
Military Affairs Robert Gallucci on Friday and exchanged views 
on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of 
North Korean nuclear sites. 
  President Kim reaffirmed that a special envoy exchange by 
South and North Korea and Pyongyang's cooperation in the IAEA 
nuclear inspections are preconditions for a third round of 
high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington. 
  Kim also stressed that Seoul and Washington should make 
joint 
efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  The third round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks 
cannot be held unless the two Koreas exchange special envoys, an 
official at Chongwadae [presidential office] quoted Gallucci as 
saying.

  [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and U.S. 
officials agreed Friday that the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspections of North Korean facilities are going 
well enough not to cause any undue concern. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and visiting U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert Gallucci met privately after officials 
from the two sides had sat down to three hours of talks on 
resolving the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  "They (Han and Gallucci) noted that the IAEA inspections are 
under way. The inspection issue was not discussed as a matter 
of concern," Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said after 
the meeting. 
  The two officials' judgement soft-pedaled unceasing reports 
that IAEA activities are being limited by North Korea, which is 
refusing full access to certain key installations. 
  Chang said they discussed two scenarios if the third round 
of 
North Korea-U.S. high-level talks either does or doesn't open on 
March 21. 
  Gallucci, chief U.S. representative at the high-level talks 
with North Korea, is in Seoul to work out a joint response to 
the nuclear situation. 
  He and the foreign minister will meet again over lunch on 
Saturday and evaluate the results of the sixth inter-Korean 
contact on exchanging special envoys, Chang said. 
  The envoy exchange is one of two preconditions to North 
Korea-U.S. high-level negotiations. The other is successful 
conclusion of the IAEA inspections.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Cambodia's First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh said Friday [11 March] that his 
country will prohibit the import and laying of land mines 
effective immediately. 
  "On behalf of the royal government, I would like to say very 
clearly that we completely ban any laying out of mines," 
Ranariddh told reporters at the Japan National Press Club. 
  Ranariddh, in Tokyo to attend a meeting of the International 
Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC), also vowed 
that the Cambodian military will never again purchase mines. 
The announcement followed pledges by donor countries and 
organizations earlier Friday of more than 20 million dollars 
over two years to help Cambodia find and deactivate millions of 
mines. 
  Ranariddh cited a message from King Norodom Sihanouk, issued 
just ahead of the meeting, in which the monarch said "history 
will condemn extremely harshly those who plant such mines in 
Cambodia." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Cambodian Foreign 
Minister Norodom Sirivut took Thailand to task Friday [11 March] 
for allowing an illegal logging trade to thrive along Khmer 
Rouge- controlled border areas. 
  Sirivut broached the subject in an interview with KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE during his visit to Tokyo for a two-day meeting of the 
International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia 
(ICORC), which ended Friday. 
  "It's not reasonable, it's not fair to say on one hand `we 
will help Cambodia' and on the other hand `we will bleed it'," 
he said, evidently referring to Thailand by the well-worn 
euphemism "neighboring country." 
  Thailand participated in the ICORC meeting as a donor 
nation. 
Its thickly forested border with Cambodia is the scene of 
lucrative trade in Cambodian timber run by the Khmer Rouge. 
  Sirivut said he made a "strong appeal" at the conference for 
Cambodia's neighbors to respect its laws concerning exploitation 
of timber, an apparent reference to a U.N.-backed logging ban 
Cambodia instituted at the beginning of 1993. 
  "Natural resources are for the survival of Cambodia," said 
the foreign minister, who also serves as deputy prime minister. 
  Sirivut's remarks followed an unconfirmed report about a 
soured December agreement between the Cambodian Government and 
the Khmer Rouge to share profits from the export to Thailand of 
some 120 million dollars worth of timber, stranded since the 
ban. The timber was reportedly moved into Khmer 
Rouge-controlled territory to be sold across the border from 
mid-February to the end of March, but Khmer Rouge attacks on 
government positions convinced the government that the 
guerrillas had broken their word. Government forces are now 
preparing to take over the logs and logging routes by force, 
according to the report quoting Thai sources. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- A top-level Cambodian 
Government delegation departed Tokyo for Phnom Penh on Saturday, 
gratified at the 773 million dollars in aid pledged by donors at 
a two-day international conference on Cambodian reconstruction. 
  "We are very happy," said Economy and Finance Minister Sam 
Rangsi in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE before departure. 
  Rangsi accompanied co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and 
Hun Sen to a meeting of the International Committee on the 
Reconstruction of Cambodia on Thursday and Friday. 
  "Before we came we were a little bit anxious because we know 
that donor countries face many requests from many other 
countries in many parts of the world," he said. "We were a 
little bit afraid that people may forget Cambodia. But finally 
we have noticed that there is still a strong concern about 
Cambodia and that the world community realizes that without 
development all the achievements in peace can be jeopardized," 
he said. 
  The 773 million dollars pledged will go toward 
reconstruction 
costs over a two-year period. 
  The meeting, chaired by Japan, was attended by delegates 
from 
32 countries, the European Union and 12 international 
organizations.

  [Text] The U.S. Government identified eight Japanese 
industrial sectors -- wood products, paper, plate glass, 
computers, supercomputers, electric telecommunications, medical 
equipment, and insurance -- as candidates subject to retaliatory 
action under the Super 301 trade provision (designed to impose 
sanctions on trading-partner nations which employ unfair trade 
practices). Companies in all of the sectors -- except for 
insurance, which comes under the control of the Finance 
Ministry's administration of issuing licenses and permits, and 
telecommunications, which enjoys an excess of exports over 
imports -- are perplexed and oppose the announcement. It seems 
that the plate glass and wood product industries, whose imports 
exceed exports, are having difficulty understanding what the 
United States' true intentions are. Many of these firms feel 
bullish, partly because of a lull in the appreciation of the yen. 
<H5>  Plate Glass </H5>
  According to 1992 customs clearance statistics, Japan 
imported plate glass worth 4.5 billion yen from the United 
States, and the United States imported 1.6 billion yen of plate 
glass from Japan. The difference is that Japan spent 2.9 billion 
yen more than did the United States. 
  Yasuhiko Kogawa, managing director of Asahi Glass Company, 
which is the largest glass producer in Japan, did not hesitate 
to express his dissatisfaction. He said: "Japan's imports 
exceed exports as far as the flat glass trade with the United 
States is concerned. Moreover, the scale of the glass trade 
between the two countries is small. Why is the United States so 
insistent about the plate glass sector?" In response to a 
request made by the United States, the Fair Trade Commission 
[FTC] investigated the realities of business practices in the 
industrial sectors. As a result, the FTC pointed out that 
business ties between glass manufacturers and their special 
agents are firm and that there was room for improvement. 
  However, three plate glass companies maintain that the 
progressive rebate and postdiscount systems known as unfair 
traditional business practices, which are the cause of keiretsu, 
were successively abolished. Therefore, they say that "we no 
longer have the systems that can be improved further" (according 
to the same managing director). 
<H5>  Paper Products </H5>
  The same thing can be said about paper products, of which 
Japan imports more than it exports. Since a settlement was 
reached for the time being following the conclusion of the 
Japanese-U.S. paper accord, Takashi Mano, managing director of 
the New Oji Paper Company, said: "The use of imported paper is 
increasing. Our customers are making their own decisions as to 
how to use the imported paper. They are using imported papers 
to print newspapers, telephone books, and other items. However, 
foreign manufacturers need to make greater efforts to improve 
the quality of their products and to meet their promised 
delivery dates. We have no cases of unfair traditional business 
practices." 
<H5>  Electric Telecommunications </H5>
  Japan exported telecommunications equipment worth 304.8 
billion yen to the United States in fiscal year 1992, but Japan 
imported telecommunications equipment worth 70.5 billion yen in 
the same year. The United States does not produce fax machines, 
which make up one-third of the telecommunications goods that 
Japan exports to the United States. As far as network 
equipment, such as switchboard machines, is concerned, Japan is 
steadily increasing its imports. In fiscal year 1987, Japan 
exported 2.7 times as many switchboard machines as it imported. 
In fiscal year 1992, however, the situation became reversed, 
and the export of network equipment became 0.8 times greater 
than imports. The imbalance was corrected. The 
Telecommunication Machine and Industry Association gives this 
refutation: "The situation improved in fiscal year 1993 as 
well. Imports will increase more because a system under which 
customers will be able to buy their own mobile telephones 
[rather than renting them] will be introduced in April." 
<H5>  Wood Products </H5>
  Japan is importing 75 percent of the lumber it needs. 
Moreover, lumber produced in the United States holds 27 percent 
of the market in Japan. Because of this, the National 
Federation of Lumber Associations [NFLA] is of the opinion that 
"we do not think Japan is a closed market." However, the import 
rate of U.S. lumber grew by only 2 percent while Japan's lumber 
imports increased by 17 percent in the two-year period of 
1992-93. 
  The United States is demanding that Japan remove all tariffs 
on imported lumber, but Japan is saying that "the issue of 
tariff rates was settled at the Uruguay Round talks late last 
year" (according to the Forestry Agency). The NFLA says: "The 
market share of U.S. lumber is lower than that of Canadian 
lumber simply because it does not meet the needs of Japanese. 
We just cannot understand the U.S. countermeasures." 
<H5>  Supercomputers </H5>
  Currently, only three Fujitsu and one NEC supercomputers are 
being used in the United States, according to Fujitsu Ltd. and 
the NEC Corporation. Compared to this, nearly 40 supercomputers 
made by Cray Research Inc. of the United States are in use in 
Japan. Computer industries are at a loss, saying, "We do not 
know why we are subject to the instances of retaliation because 
this is an area where imports exceed exports." 
  Fujitsu said: "The Defense Department, the Energy 
Department, 
and other U.S. Government agencies are buying U.S. 
supercomputers. In reality, it is the United States which is 
forcing foreign supercomputer makers out of the U.S. market. We 
just do not understand why the United States is attacking only 
Japan in the supercomputer field." 
<H5>  Medical Equipment </H5>
  According to the results of a survey conducted by the 
Toshiba 
Corporation, Japan exported to the United States medical 
equipment worth some 100 billion yen in fiscal year 1992. At 
the same time, it imported about 800 billion yens' worth of 
medical equipment from the United States. Toshiba complained 
about the U.S. action, saying, "We do not understand why the 
United States thinks that we are an unfair trade partner." As 
for Japan's small automatic blood analyzers and other medical 
equipment which are being sold in the United States, some 
Japanese companies are saying that "U.S. consumers will suffer 
if these types of equipment become subject to retaliatory 
action" (according to Hitachi). 
<H5>  Computers </H5>
  Japanese and U.S. computer makers are actively supplying 
their products to each other and are promoting technological 
cooperation. Fujitsu said: "Depending on the product, it is 
difficult to tell if it is made in Japan or in the United 
States. Retaliation is impossible." 
<H5>  Insurance Services </H5>
  Being conscious of the Finance Ministry, which acts as the 
responsible authority, life insurance and nonlife insurance 
companies are avoiding commenting on the recent "identification" 
of the business sectors. The Sumitomo Life Insurance Company 
and other insurance firms say that "we would like to remain calm 
and to continue observing the development of the situation." 
However, Toshitaka Urakami, chairman of the Life Insurance 
Association (and chairman of the Sumitomo insurance company), 
commented on the breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. trade talks by 
saying: "We avoided the worst-case scenario, in which both 
countries would agree to establish numerical targets without 
having a thorough understanding of the situation. We could not 
help but do this."

<F P=106> [By reporter Yozo Matsuda] </F>
  [Text] A concept for expanding the "basic plan on public 
investment" as a way of finding a breakthrough in the deadlocked 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks is emerging. There are now 
growing calls for adding about 100 trillion yen -- for the 
purpose of expanding domestic demand -- to the existing plan to 
invest 430 trillion yen in public works projects in the 10-year 
period to 2000. The Ministry of Finance [MOF] at present is wary 
about this idea of revising the plan at a time when a conclusion 
is yet to be reached on the question of taxation system reform, 
and insists "it would be irresponsible to make a pledge on 
expanded investments when there is no hope of securing financial 
resources." But still there is a growing possibility that this 
will become a key point in the market liberalization plans to be 
finalized by the government soon. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii in a news conference on 9 
March showed he was cool toward an early revision of the plan, 
by declaring, "discussions on the expansion of the basic plan, 
including those on financial resources, are only beginning now, 
and there is no need to change our pace." 
  But demands for discussing the basic plan are growing now 
that the possibility of the United States applying the Super 301 
provision (definition of unfair trade practices and nations 
engaged in such practices, and sanctions against them) of the 
Omnibus Trade Act is closer to reality after the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks broke down over the question of setting 
numerical targets. 
  The minister of transport and the director-general of the 
Economic Planning Agency have demanded the revision of the plan 
in informal cabinet meetings, and the Japan Federation of 
Economic Organizations [Keidanren] and the Japan Association of 
Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai] separately on 7 March 
submitted emergency proposals [to the government] on adding more 
than 100 trillion yen to the plan. 
  Despite these voices, the MOF is not about to agree to a 
revision of the plan at the present time. An official of the 
ministry Budget Bureau said: "Even the final report of the 
Hiraiwa Commission said public investment should not be expanded 
without finding means of financial resources to back it up." 
  The Hiraiwa Commission's final report said, "a revision of 
the basic plan on allocation of funds as well as expansion 
should be considered only on condition that appropriate 
financial resources are secured so that no burdens are left into 
the next generation." As such, the MOF's view is that expansion 
should be possible only on the premise that taxes will be raised 
in the future. The ministry also insists that if, for instance, 
a choice of issuing large amounts of construction bonds is made, 
it will result not only in increasing government burdens in 
paying for principal and interest therefrom, but also in raising 
the overall bank interest rates as issuance of the bonds will 
suck in funds from the private sector. As such, it will in fact 
only impede recovery of the economy, the ministry argues. 
  But within the government there are also those who want to 
find a breakthrough in the economic framework talks by 
presenting to the United States the concept for expanding public 
investment. Apparently there is "internal strife" among the 
government offices. 
  The MOF argues vehemently against the demands for expansion, 
contending, "The United States has not once asked for expansion 
of the public investment in the framework talks. Some people 
are misreading the interests of that country."

  [Text] On 12 March, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa gave a speech to the Shinseito 
Kochi Prefecture Chapter's meeting held in Kochi City. Ozawa 
has been staying away from formal scenes -- such as coalition 
leaders' meetings and the lower house plenary sessions -- from 
the time that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa gave up on a plan 
to reshuffle his cabinet. During this period, he has reportedly 
been contacting younger Diet members of the Japan New Party 
[JNP], and seeking measures for breaking the deadlock over 
Japan-U.S. economic relations. He is scheduled to come back to 
a meeting with coalition leaders early next week. 
  Ozawa has been "hiding himself" after the 2 March meeting 
with Prime Minister Hosokawa. However, he met with three JNP 
lawmakers on the evening of 7 March. According to Ozawa's close 
associates, he has "already make contacts with the JNP several 
times." 
  Political turmoil caused by discord involving Hosokawa's 
cabinet reshuffle plan triggered moves toward the regrouping of 
coalition parties. Under such circumstances, Ozawa probably 
believes that a tie-up with the JNP is the key to power in the 
merger of coalition parties. 
  In the 12 March speech, Ozawa stated "Japan-U.S. relations 
are in very critical condition." His close associate said, to 
settle pending issues between the two nations, Ozawa had met 
with Walter Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, after the 
Hosokawa-Clinton summit in February. A government official 
close to the prime minister said "Mr. Ozawa positively dealt 
with" coordinating work on liberalization of the mobile phone 
market. In connection with this, he is expected to visit the 
United States shortly after 20 March.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Don't End It as a Show Performance"] </F>
  [Text] "Japan-U.S. relations are the most important 
bilateral relations in the world," Michael Mansfield, former 
U.S. ambassador to Japan, used to say, and many people have 
thought that way and still do. 
  While this thinking has been taken for granted, it is now 
becoming increasingly unclear whether the people really believe 
that to be true in the bottom of their hearts. That doubt is 
now here because in no way can we really believe that either the 
Hosokawa government or the Clinton government is seriously 
thinking that way. 
  Some people say there is no need to worry "because the two 
nations are so deeply involved with each other economically." 
That may be true, but economic relations are indeed mercenary 
relations of interest, and there is nothing as changeable as 
such relations. The sharpening conflict in bilateral relations 
over the economic consultations is the best testimony to this. 
  Some people say there is no need to worry "since the two 
nations are closely tied by the security pact." That may be 
true as well. But the security pact is informed by intentions on 
one side that are sometimes different from the other and vice 
versa, resulting in the peoples of both countries occasionally 
becoming sensitive and emotionally disgruntled toward each 
other. For instance, the presence of U.S. forces in Japan is 
now apt to be viewed as a heavy burden by both Japan and the 
United States. 
  The problem, after all, arises from thinking that Japan-U.S. 
relations affect only the two countries themselves. That line 
of thought leads to the egotism of one side clashing with the 
that of the other. We would like to think of the U.S.-Japan 
relationship in terms of bilateral ties, but the relationship 
does not end there. 
  Let us think. Japan and the United States between them hold 
about four-tenths of the gross national product (GNP) of the 
world. We need to realize how much trouble the quarreling of the 
two countries is causing other countries in the world. In fact, 
only recently, THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE reported in a 
big- headline article that Asian countries are concerned about 
catching side blows from these quarrels. We think former 
Ambassador Mansfield had that thought in his mind when he used 
the phrase "most important bilateral relations." 
  We do not want to repeat here what the Japanese and U.S. 
Governments are saying with respect to the economic 
consultations. All people of the world agree that the Clinton 
government's way of doing things is crude and high-handed. 
  But if anyone thinks other countries in Europe and Asia 
approve of Japan, this is simply not true. The world is bitter 
about Japan's trade surplus, which amounts to $130 billion. No 
wonder the people of the United States, which has a deficit of 
some $60 billion with Japan, should have emotional anti-Japanese 
feelings. 
  Japanese prime ministers of the past kept on telling U.S. 
presidents "please wait a little more" or "we must look at the 
economy in the long-term." High deficit figures are the result 
of all of this. President Clinton has some justification for 
openly criticizing Japan in news conferences. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, who arrived in Japan on 
9 March and has spent his days as scheduled, will be leaving for 
China today on 11 March. 
  The secretary has met with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister. 
The ministerial meeting on Japan-U.S. security attended by 
foreign ministers and defense chiefs of the two nations, which 
has been pending for some time, will be held today as well. 
  According to reports, in the meetings held so far, the 
parties have not held any in-depth discussions on restoring 
bilateral ties. Maybe there has been more meaning in the fact 
that they met, rather than in anything that came out of the 
meetings. We would like to think this way in good faith. 
  But, after all, a show performance is nothing more than a 
show performance. We do not mean to ridicule Prime Minister 
Hosokawa by saying that such exhibits are his forte. But we do 
wish to say there is no doubt that the longer the delays 
continue, the more difficult it becomes to restore relations 
that have gone awry. 
  Anyway, the ball needs to be sent back to the United States' 
side of the court. It needs to be an infallible shot as well. 
The only thing left for the prime minister to do now is to be 
resolved and exercise leadership over the legions of bureaucrats.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Must Hurry and Resolve Mutual </F>
Discontents"] 
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to 
Japan and met with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, and Defense Agency Director-General Kazuo 
Aichi. For the prime minister, it was his first Japan-U.S. 
meeting following the failure of the summit meeting in February. 
  The secretary of state complained strongly about the huge 
trade surplus and current-account surplus of Japan, but the 
meeting failed to bring out any clues on resolving the 
situation. The Japanese Government is said to be set to 
announce market liberalization measures, such as additional 
deregulations, by the end of this month, but it remains unclear 
whether Prime Minister Hosokawa can come up with market 
liberalization measures or surplus reduction measures that are 
bold enough. 
  The recent Japan-U.S. meetings once again confirmed that 
Japan- U.S. relations are the "most important bilateral 
relations in the world" and that the Japan-U.S. security system 
is "indispensable for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region in the post-Cold War era." 
  In spite of this, the trend of mutual distrust and 
discontent 
between the governments and the peoples of the two nations is 
only growing. This situation is undesirable for the future of 
Japan-U.S. relations. Both Japan and the United States urgently 
need to recognize that their relationship is such that each 
nation is becoming more dependent on the other, and that active 
efforts must be taken to prevent mistrust from growing and to 
expand mutual relations. 
  Secretary Christopher compared Japan-U.S. relations to a 
three- legged stool. He said that two legs of the stool -- 
security cooperation and global-scale cooperation -- are very 
sturdy, but the remaining leg -- cooperation in economic and 
trade areas -- is very unstable. 
  The irritation of the United States stems from the fact that 
while Japan's trade and current-account surpluses are not 
decreasing at all, the nation has not been able to produce any 
concrete measures toward market liberalization. Apparently, 
U.S. President Bill Clinton has settled on a policy of getting 
tough with Japan, in order to deal with the protectionist moves 
arising in Congress with by-elections coming in the fall. 
Public opinion polls in the United States are also said to show 
that there are growing numbers of people who think "Japan is 
unfair." 
  On the other hand, Japan is irritated as well. This is a 
reaction to the unilateral revival of the Super 301 provision 
(which defines unfair trade practices and enables sanctions to 
be taken against nations engaged in such practices) of the U.S. 
Trade Act, as well as to a brutal policy which states that "only 
results matter." People in Japan complain, "Japan may be called 
an economic power, but we are not living a high-quality, 
abundant life." 
  It is necessary that the leaders of Japan and the United 
States do all they can to resolve the economic frictions to 
prevent the disturbances among the two nations from developing 
into emotional confrontations. In particular, Japan, which is 
criticized by all of the industrialized nations as a country 
with an overly large current-account surplus, should come up 
with mid- and long-term endeavor targets for reduction of the 
surplus on its own without delay. 
  In security and global-scale cooperation areas, there have 
been visible achievements. In the meeting of the Japan-U.S. 
Committee for Consultations on Security, which for the first 
time was held at the cabinet ministerial-level, there were 
agreements on cooperation with respect to the suspected nuclear 
arms program of the DPRK, and on preventing the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  In fact, as regards global-scale cooperation, Japan's 
initiatives are highly appreciated. It is not so well known 
that at the Japan- U.S. summit in February, Japan promised to 
provide about $3 billion in funds for world population and AIDS 
control programs which are being undertaken jointly by Japan and 
the United States. 
  What is needed is for Japan and the United States to think 
and act coolly. As for Japan, what is important for it to do is 
to say things which need to be said to the United States, but at 
the same time to go ahead on its own and do what it should do. 
That will certainly lead to a deepening of trust between the 
two countries.

<F P=106> [by Shigeru Komago] </F>
  [Text] Regarding reports that Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], will visit the 
United States in late March, the U.S. Government has cherished 
growing hope for Ozawa's visit. The United States believes that 
"Mr. Ozawa paved the way for breaking the deadlock on the mobile 
phone (portable and car phones) issue." Although the itinerary 
of Ozawa's visit is yet to be finalized, the government has 
expressed its expectation that if Mr. Ozawa's visit takes place, 
he "will surely bring compromise proposals" concerning objective 
criteria designed to measure the progress in Japan's efforts to 
open its markets. 
  The U.S. Government has received information on Mr. Ozawa's 
visit through reports in the mass media as well as from the U.S. 
Embassy in Japan. According to a U.S. Government official, Mr. 
Ozawa will arrive in Washington on 21 March with the ostensible 
aim of granting a request for a speech. The same official has 
also said that the United States "has been sounded out" by Mr. 
Ozawa on his intention to meet with senior U.S. Government 
officials, including President Clinton, as well as congressional 
leaders. 
  The U.S. Government has also been eager to improve relations 
with Japan since the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks in February. A official at the U.S. Trade 
Representative Office said that "Mr. Ozawa took action" under 
the situation. Regarding the report on Ozawa's visit to the 
United States, U.S. Congressmen who take a hard-line stance 
against Japan, including House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, 
and U.S. Government officials stated the following: "Mr. Ozawa 
reportedly plans to come to the United States to pave the way 
for resuming the framework talks;" and "he reportedly intends to 
accept the U.S. proposal for setting sector- by-sector objective 
criteria as endeavor indicators if the United States promises 
not to use such criteria for the purpose of imposing sanctions 
against Japan." 
  However, the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry, and the Japanese Embassy in the United 
States have reiterated: "We have not heard of such a plan. 
This is not Prime Minister Hosokawa's intention, nor is it a 
government policy. Mr. Ozawa's visit to the United States has 
not been decided." If this is true, the current reports prove 
that the U.S. Government cherishes excessive hope for Mr. 
Ozawa's visit and that the two governments have now lost most of 
their channels of communication. 
  The first task of Deputy Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Hayashi -- who has succeeded former Deputy Vice Minister 
Koichiro Matsuura and who is scheduled to hold talks with U.S. 
officials in charge of the framework talks in Washington this 
week -- is to normalize channels between Japan and the United 
States to dispel such misunderstandings. The current atmosphere 
is such that if the channels are not normalized, the mistrust 
between the two countries which followed in the wake of the the 
summit meeting in February may worsen.

  [Text] On 11 March, the government decided to discontinue 
Japan's voluntary restrictions on auto exports to the United 
States, which will expire in the end of this month. Japanese 
automakers are expected to announce their programs to expand 
their purchases of foreign-made automobile and auto parts later 
this month. Following these announcements, the abolishment of 
restrictions on auto exports will be formally declared. The 
control of auto exports, which has been being criticized as a 
symbol of managed trade between Japan and the United States 
since its implementation in 1981, is about to end. 
  The decision to abolish voluntary restrictions was reached 
mainly for the following reasons: 1) Japan's auto exports to 
the United States are unlikely to grow drastically because 
Japanese automakers already have a considerable amount of 
production in the United States; and 2) according to the 
agreement at the GATT Uruguay Round last year, the voluntary 
restriction of exports is not a clear violation of GATT rules, 
but as it is considered a questionable practice, it should be 
discontinued. Both the U.S. Government and the Big Three 
automakers have informally conveyed to the Japanese Government 
their position not to "welcome further renewals of voluntary 
export restrictions," noting that Japan's controls on auto 
exports have already lost their significance. 
  The restrictions on auto exports to the United States have 
been voluntarily determined by Japan at the end of every fiscal 
year. The policy began in fiscal year 1981, when a rapid 
increase in the Japanese share of the U.S. auto market became 
the focal point of trade disputes between the two nations. The 
annual export quota was set at 1.68 million units in the 
beginning, but was expanded to 2.3 million in 1985. After this, 
however, Japanese automakers began to expand their production in 
the United States to cope with the drastic appreciation of the 
yen. Since 1987, Japan's auto exports to the United States have 
not reached the annual export ceilings. The government lowered 
the quota to 1.65 million in fiscal 1992, but actual exports 
were even lower for that year. The export level for fiscal 1993 
is estimated to be about 1.5 million units. In addition, the 
Uruguay Round accord is urging abolishment of questionable 
export control measures for a four-year period starting in 1995. 
Under such circumstances, Japan has been clarifying its 
intention to discontinue some export control measures following 
the expiration of such measures.

  [Text] Terusuke Terada, press secretary for the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, in a news conference on 11 March commented 
on the 22.4 percent increase in defense spending envisioned in 
China's 1994 budget draft, and said, "The growth rate, no doubt, 
is large, but we have to take factors like inflation into 
account. An analysis would be necessary." The guideline on 
Japan's Official Development Assistance (ODA) programs requires 
the government to consider in deciding on aid to countries 
whether the recipients' defense outlays are conspicuously large 
or not. Terada in his remark meant to say that the scale of the 
defense budget should not immediately become the reason for a 
review of Japan's ODA programs for China.

  [Text] More than one year has passed since the DRPK (North 
Korea) announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) on 12 March 1993. While the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has inspected seven 
nuclear facilities declared by North Korea, this has been 
inadequate, and data obtained has been limited. As the opening 
of the third round of meeting between senior officials of the 
United States and the DPRK on 21 March has become uncertain, the 
Japanese Government decided to make preparations at home in 
anticipation of possible economic sanctions by the UN Security 
Council against North Korea. 
Progress in Nuclear Development [subhead] 
  Although Japan is a close neighbor of North Korea, and is 
constantly under its nuclear "threat," the government relies on 
the United States for information obtained by analyzing 
satellite data. The prevailing view is that from the amount of 
plutonium the DPRK possesses, it should be able to manufacture 
two to four nuclear bombs. As to how far the development of 
nuclear devices has gone, opinions are divided within the U.S. 
Government. The Department of State claims that the DPRK is yet 
to develop any nuclear weapon, while the Department of Defense 
and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assert that North 
Korea has already succeeded, or is just one step from doing so. 
  Adding its own information analysis, the Japanese Government 
believes that "even if a nuclear bomb had been developed, the 
DPRK has not reached the stage of conducting an experiment to 
test the effectiveness of the explosion. A few more years will 
still be needed before the bomb is improved and becomes suitable 
for transport, and eventually becomes capable of being loaded on 
fighters or missiles," (according to a Defense Agency [DA] 
source.) 
  With regard to North Korea's nuclear development, it is said 
that "the development of nuclear arms is indispensable for 
maintaining the present regime of President Kim Il-song and 
Secretary Kim Chong- il," (according to the DA source.) 
Therefore, the prevailing view in the government is that it 
would be impossible to stop its nuclear development. 
Japan's Security [subhead] 
  In May 1993, North Korea conducted the test-firing of three 
"Nodong-1" ballistic missiles into the sea off Noto Peninsula. 
The government immediately got hold of this information. It 
made a detailed exchange of data with the United States two days 
after the launch. 
  From the information gathered from soldiers defecting from 
North Korea, it has also become clear that North Korean missiles 
were manufactured based on Japanese-made high-tech products, and 
they are now targeting Japan. 
  While Japan is not in any immediate danger, it is also a 
fact 
that on the mid- and long-term, Japan is ill-prepared to deal 
with North Korean nuclear missiles in the future with, for 
instance, "Patriot" surface-to-air missiles, or airborne warning 
and control systems (AWACS). 
Dealing With Economic Sanctions [subhead] 
  North Korea is expected to maneuver in various ways for the 
postponement of nuclear inspections by the IAEA while keeping 
its option of negotiating with the United States open. Thus, 
many think that "UN economic sanctions will be discussed sooner 
or later," (according to a Foreign Ministry source.) 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's position on this issue 
is: 
"We will do what we can within the limits of the Constitution." 
However, critics point out that suspending regular shipping 
services might become a human rights issue, while it would be 
difficult even to obtain accurate data on remittances by Korean 
residents in Japan to the DPRK if a third country is involved. 
They doubt if economic sanctions will have any immediate effect. 
  On the other hand, there are also a growing number of 
supporters to the view that "economic sanctions have the 
political effect of demonstrating what is a rule violation in 
the international community," (according to the Foreign Ministry 
source.)

<F P=106> [Interview with Shozo Azuma, parliamentary vice minister of </F>
foreign affairs, by unidentified GAIKO FORUM editorial staff 
member on 1 February; place not given: "How Were Russia's 
Parliamentary Elections Conducted?"] 
  [Text]International Election Monitoring Was 
Effective 
  [GAIKO FORUM] To begin with, please give me the background 
of 
why the monitoring teams were sent to observe the elections and 
how Japan dealt with this? 
  [Azuma] The recent parliamentary elections were the first of 
their kind carried out in a democratic fashion for a newborn 
Russia, and I understand that this was an important milestone 
for Russia to become a true democracy. With this realization, 
and to support Russia's democratization, Japan decided to send 
monitoring teams there. To put it concretely, President Boris 
Yeltsin, when he visited Japan last October, personally 
requested that a monitoring team be dispatched, and Prime 
Minister Hosokawa expressed a willingness to actively cooperate 
on the matter. 
  Thus, it was decided that Japan would send a government 
monitoring team, and I was appointed an ambassador extraordinary 
to head the team. Members of the team included the Home Affairs 
Ministry, local public and private organizations, as well as the 
central government and an advisory team of Diet members. My 
team monitored Moscow, and another detachment was sent to 
Khabarovsk. In addition to sending monitoring teams, Japan 
provided supplementary assistance by making grants of 
communications equipment and the like. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] I consider the Russians to be a proud people, 
but despite this they asked for monitoring teams to be sent. 
How do you interpret this request? Did they intend to improve 
Russia's image, or did this reflect an apprehension about the 
election behavior of the Russian people? 
  [Azuma] They might have considered that order would be 
maintained by having international election monitoring teams. 
The important things, however, were to let the world as well as 
their own people know that the recent elections were conducted 
in a free and fair atmosphere and that the international 
election monitoring teams served their purpose in very effective 
way. 
<H5>  Elections in a Peaceful, Harmonious Atmosphere </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] Compared to Japan's elections, what impression 
did you get of Russia's election campaigns and the response of 
its voters? 
  [Azuma] Because it was Russia's first democratic election 
and 
because the campaigning period was short, they were entirely 
different from Japan's. Unlike in Japan, there were no campaign 
loudspeaker vehicles on the streets. Door-to-door campaigns 
were permitted, but little such campaigning was done because the 
campaigning period was so short. Few wayside speeches were 
noticed. We saw only Mr. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of the Liberal 
Democratic Party doing this. In the election campaigns, 
television played an especially vital role, in my opinion. In 
Japanese polling stations, we find a solemn atmosphere, in the 
sense that secret balloting has to be guaranteed, but it was 
peaceful and harmonious in Russia. Husbands and wives were seen 
entering the same voting booth together, or voters were seen 
filling out ballots while talking with other voters without 
bothering to enter the booths. If you witnessed only such 
scenes, you would conclude that secret voting was not attained, 
but they insisted that they were discussing only how to fill out 
the ballots. Certainly, it did not come to our attention, 
within the scope of our monitoring, that somebody induced others 
to vote for specific candidates or parties. To strictly 
safeguard secret balloting, however, it might be necessary to 
increase the number of voting booths so that filling out ballots 
in booths can be thoroughly enforced. 
  Although it was not actually observed to have happened, 
there 
were problems of preventing one voter from voting many times. 
According to the system, anybody who was not in their voting 
district on election day because they were on official trips 
could cast their ballots where they presented themselves by only 
showing their passports or identification cards. So, logically, 
it was possible for a voter to vote multiple times by going to 
other voting districts and showing their identification cards. 
To eliminate such a danger of multiple voting, I think that the 
current absentee ballot system must be amended. Somewhere in 
Africa, they put a mark which is indelible for a certain length 
of time on the voter's hand, to make the absentee voting system 
foolproof. That sort of method might become necessary. Also, 
there was room for improvement in the system of placing 
inspectors. 
<H5>  Whether People Can Follow Reforms or Not </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] The outcome of the elections shocked the world 
with the emergence of such an extreme nationalist as Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy. What is your thought on this? 
  [Azuma] Although the elections were conducted smoothly, they 
did not turn out as the reformist camp anticipated. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Was it that the people were perplexed by the 
abrupt reforms? 
  [Azuma] As for the trend in the direction of democratization 
and a market economy, the multitude of the Russian people are 
presumed to understand this. A lady who came to vote said, "I 
cannot see what they are actually going to offer to better our 
lives, although they keep bragging about reforms." This kind of 
discontent drifted toward the ultrarightists, I suppose. I 
heard many people say that they did not bother to vote because 
the reformers were absolutely destined for victory. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] China is, in a manner different from that of 
Russia, proceeding with an open economic system while 
maintaining its dictatorial system. On the contrary, Russia 
gave priority to political reform before economic reform. 
However, the market economy is not functioning well, and crime 
seems to be on the increase. What do you think about these 
things? 
  [Azuma] If measures had been taken to permit the people to 
understand the contents of the reforms while carrying out 
radical changes, confusion and discontent could have been 
mitigated. 
  It could well be an issue of the end of the 20th century 
that 
rationality and human pride are lost because greed overcomes 
them, while human nature is neglected by pursuing rationality. 
Now the wisdom is needed to harmonize them. In the case of 
China, it is proceeding with gradualism, and it is thought that 
if the test cases along the coastal areas prove to be 
successful, they may be applied to the nation as a whole. In 
Russia, there are, in a sense, many people with a West European 
way of thinking. So, it can be rationally proposed that there 
is a concept first and that it is followed by methods to achieve 
the objectives based on that concept. But the question is 
whether the people can follow it, whether to proceed after the 
people are fully informed about it, and whether to proceed with 
their full consent or rather with the full authority entrusted 
to the elites. I believe that social confusion was brought 
about by the people who want to take part in a good idea without 
their having come to grips with that idea. 
<H3>  Future Japanese-Russian Relations in a Turbulent World 
Community </H3>
  [GAIKO FORUM] What should the future assistance to Russia 
from Japan and the West be like? 
  [Azuma] Russia is going ahead with democratization and 
economic reforms, and it wants assistance from the international 
community because it cannot help itself. A new parliament came 
into being as a result of the recent elections. Within it are 
unexpected political parties embracing factors of instability 
concerning the course of reforms, in a sense. But, as a general 
direction of the course being followed, President Yeltsin and 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin are steadfastly continuing in 
the direction of reforms. At this stage, it should not be 
considered that the basis for assistance has ended. If Russia 
is thrown into confusion as the result of a lack of assistance, 
it will pose an unstable factor for the whole world, as well as 
the Russian region. A Russia which evolves into a democracy and 
which follows the way to economic reforms is directly connected 
with the stability and prosperity of the world. And that is the 
precondition for assistance. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] A sense of menace from Russia/the Soviet Union 
remains in the heart of Japanese. Now that the Soviet Union is 
gone, what do you see as the future of Japanese-Russian 
relations? 
  [Azuma] Military power was an important nucleus of the 
post-World War II Cold War structure. But, after that structure 
has collapsed, it should not be attempted to maintain that order 
by possessing military power. The key to becoming a great power 
rests on economic power, and I think that understanding between 
the leaders who guide the economy and the people is what is 
being sought after the collapse of the Cold War structure. It 
may take a considerable amount of time before that becomes 
tangible. An extremely important factor in pursuing the 
post-Cold War new international order is to deepen 
Japanese-Russian relations in a broad sense rather than the 
up-to-the-present Japanese-Russian relations in a narrow sense. 
  In the case of Japan, the collapse of the 1955 order was a 
domestic affair, without the international trend having been 
part of the recipe. Meantime, what is happening in the world is 
the decisionmaking of a nation which directly feels the 
turbulence of the international community and which is compelled 
to respond to the changes in the world. If not viewed from such 
a perspective, the movement of Russia will become 
incomprehensible. I do not deny the importance of Japan's 
dealing with what it should do concerning Japanese-Russian 
relations, but I think we have come to the point where 
Japanese-Russian relations must be considered once again in the 
post-Cold War framework in which these relations are managed 
with the turbulence of the international community being kept in 
mind. However, nobody seems to have the answer yet, I think. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Quite a bit of assistance is being provided to 
Siberia by nongovernmental organizations, and in that sense the 
recent sending of election-monitoring teams can be categorized 
as one such step for Russia. 
  [Azuma] That is right. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] After your return, what is your main point in 
discussing your experiences there? 
  [Azuma] Russia's election system is a single-member 
constituency within the proportional-representation system. Two 
hundred and twenty-five members each are elected by both systems 
to fill the 450-seat parliament. If the reformist camps do not 
cooperate between themselves and wage independent election 
campaigns, they will suffer defeats in unexpected areas. I said 
this to the prime minister, and he said that it is quite 
enlightening. (laughter) 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Japan is not only teaching but also has 
something to learn. 
  [Azuma] I have not quite comprehended why Russia chose such 
a 
system. However, Japan is going to adopt the same type because 
of the recent passage of the political reform bills. It gives 
quite a hint. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.

  [Text] The Japanese Government has decided to launch a 
project to help the SRV in developing an industrial zone in 
Hanoi, the country's capital in its northern area, in an effort 
to rectify an economic imbalance between its southern and 
northern regions. The government plans to embark on making 
preparations for the construction project, starting off with 
sending a preliminary mission to the SRV on 20 March. It also 
plans to extend yen loans to help fund the construction of the 
Hanoi industrial zone, which is scheduled to begin as early as 
in 1996. 
  Investments in the SRV by foreign private firms have 
concentrated in the southern part of the country, primarily 
around Ho Chi Minh City. This has further widened the economic 
gap between the thriving southern regions and the underdeveloped 
northern regions -- a factor which has begun to cause 
instability in the country. 
  The government mission, consisting mainly of members of the 
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), plans to work 
with the Hanoi People's Committee to finalize details on such 
points as the following: 1) the current situation in the Hanoi 
area and future outlook; 2) selecting prospective industries; 3) 
investment demands; 4) determining the location of the 
industrial zone; and 5) the schedule for construction of the 
industrial zone. The government mission plans to begin actual 
investigations in June. It hopes to draw up a basic outline of 
the project by January 1996 and present it to the SRV. 
  The SRV Government has sounded out the Japanese Government 
for its support in funding the construction of the industrial 
zone. The Japanese Government plans to respond favorably to 
this request. Construction costs are expected to total around 
$100 million. 
  In terms of total cost, the project, including construction 
of ancillary facilities, is expected to be of the greatest scale 
for a single project among projects for which Japan has decided 
to apply its yen loan program for the SRV. Japan resumed this 
program in 1992 after suspending it for about 14 years. 
  There has traditionally been an economic imbalance between 
the northern and southern regions of the SRV. The per capita 
annual national income in Ho Chi Minh City is $350, while it is 
only $250 in Hanoi. A worker in Ho Chi Minh City earns an 
average monthly salary of $38.80, while a worker in Hanoi makes 
only $22.40, or only about two-thirds of his counterpart in the 
south. Moreover, ever since the country enacted its Foreign 
Investment Act in 1988, over 70 percent of foreign investment in 
the SRV has concentrated in its southern regions, primarily 
around Ho Chi Minh City. If left unattended, the situation 
could turn out to be like as it was before the country's 
unification in 1975 when "the south prospered and the north 
remained poor." 
  In early February 1994, the United States decided to lift 
economic sanctions it had imposed against the SRV. As a result, 
there are now hardly any barriers against direct foreign 
investment. Although the SRV is expected to make rapid growth 
among the East Asian countries, along with the PRC, its leaders 
are faced with the problem of an economic imbalance between its 
northern and southern regions. The Japanese Government 
considers that "the promotion of development in the northern 
regions is urgent for a well-balanced economic growth," (as 
stated by a Foreign Ministry source). Therefore, in carrying out 
its economic aid program for the SRV, the government has decided 
to hammer out a plan to place priority on the development of the 
country's northern regions, primarily around Hanoi.

<F P=106> [Article by Yasuyuki Aoki, SHUKAN ASAHI reporter: </F>
"Unexpected Number of SDPJ Rebels Lead Rejection in Upper House; 
Next Move Left for Ichiro Ozawa Who Failed To Force Through the 
Bills"] 
  [Text] The present political situation revolves around Mr. 
Ichiro Ozawa. That is common knowledge in Nagata-cho. The 
ruling and opposition parties are divided over whether they are 
pro-Ozawa or anti-Ozawa. Factions and groups are being sorted 
out even within the coalition parties and the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP]. An incredible person whose name is 
listed among the top 10 "men disliked" and "men liked." He 
turns out to have played a lead role also in the course of 
events leading up to the rejection of the bills on political 
reform. 
  Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, supreme power-wielder in the Hosokawa 
regime and acting director of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
enjoys the game of chess His skill there is between that of a 
beginner and a second-class amateur. In Nagata-cho that puts him 
into the category of "strong man." 
  Chess is a "game of decisions. "Should I gamble here, or 
should I wait patiently for my next chance? -- one is constantly 
being pressed to decide. A weak person is frequently defensive 
when he should take the offensive and fades into a loss. 
  Mr. Ozawa is different in that respect. One who has gone up 
against him rates Mr. Ozawa's chess this way: "He's the type who 
initiates offensive moves. He's not good at closely watching his 
opponent's moves. He tries to cut the way open on his own. 
There's no `defense' in Mr. Ozawa's moves. Another 
characteristic is that, when the situation is unfavorable, he 
doesn't struggle fruitlessly. Before really getting into a bind, 
he accepts defeat. I don't know if you'd call that gallant, but 
he's a man more embarrassed by a vain struggle than by defeat." 
  Such a tendency can be glimpsed also in his politicking. 
  "He has the image of a schemer; but his tactic is the 
tactless method of frontal attack. He's the direct opposite of 
former premier Noboru Takeshita, who would just wait for the 
ripe fruit to fall. Seeking `a frontal breakthrough' by force, 
he has often failed." 
  So said an LDP leader, referring to the Tokyo gubernatorial 
election of three years ago, on 21 January [1994] after the 
political reform bills were rejected in the upper house plenary 
session. 
  The LDP secretary general at that time, Mr. Ozawa had former 
Japan Broadcasting Corporation newscaster Hisanori Isomura run 
so as to topple the incumbent governor, Shunichi Suzuki. 
Conversely, however, that had angered Mr. Suzuki and led to an 
election splitting the conservatives. With Mr. Isomura's 
crushing defeat, Mr. Ozawa said, "I accept full blame for the 
outcome. It is enough for me alone to take responsibility." And 
he just resigned from his position as secretary general. 
  The recent rejection of the political reform bills may be an 
even greater failure than the earlier defeat. Mr. Ozawa seem to 
have misread the outlook; he shows the sign of being disturbed. 
  During the week before the vote in the upper house plenary 
session, Mr. Ozawa was acting quite energetic. On the 14th, he 
showed enthusiasm when the LDP side secretly approached him with 
the compromise proposals that 1) a proportional allocation be 
made of 280 single-seat constituencies and 230 seats for 
proportional representation; 2) proportional representation 
would be done by totaling votes for nationwide units, and those 
successfully elected would be determined for each of seven blocs 
nationwide; and 3) corporate and organizational donations to 
individual politicians would be allowed only for politicians in 
local constituencies. 
  He met successively with Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary 
general, 
on the 15th; with Wataru Kubo, general secretary of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], on the 16th; and with Takeshi 
Noda, LDP director of the lower house Ad Hoc Committee on 
Political Reform, on the 17th. In the meeting with Mr. Kubo, he 
said, "We counted the votes, but it's close (whether it will 
pass), isn't it." While up to that time he had raced ahead with 
his strong course for handling the Diet, he may have become 
perplexed because the chance of a rejection had emerged. 
  It had seemed that his talks with the ruling and opposition 
parties, other than the Communist Party, might pull it together; 
but the situation changed after newspapers reported the floating 
of the compromise proposals as the front-page lead story in 
their morning editions on the 19th. By pushing secret 
negotiations over the heads of upper house members, he had 
angered all the upper house LDP members. 
  It is even said that a memo in which Mr. Noda leaked the 
contents of his talks with Mr. Ozawa was copied and circulated 
among upper house LDP officers. In it was detailed the 
arrangements for presenting a compromise plan by LDP Secretary 
General Mori, then negotiating between the opposition and ruling 
parties in the upper house, next having a summit meeting between 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono, 
and then agreeing. 
  It is no wonder the upper house side was angered; it was as 
though, before negotiations on a wage increase, an agreed figure 
had come out. 
  On the evening of the 19th, Mr. Ozawa made a phone call to 
an 
LDP Diet member to whom he had a pipeline and asked, "How is it 
going with the upper house LDP members? Now we've led the horse 
to the water trough, it'll be bad if we can't make it drink." 
After that, Mr. Kono made an intercessory phone call to Mr. 
Ozawa, but two hours later Mr. Ozawa again called his LDP Diet 
member contact and made this parting shot: "We've decided on 
adoption. Tell Kono." 
  This means Mr. Ozawa had again switched to a hard line. Had 
something happened during this two-hour interval? Had he seen 
the LDP in the upper house not pulling together, or had he 
recovered his confidence in the outcome of a vote which he once 
had viewed as uncertain? 
  But the outcome was rejection. The SDPJ rebels were more 
numerous than expected--20 (17 opposing the bills and three 
abstaining) -- while the LDP rebels numbered five--less than he 
had expected. 
<H5>  Ozawa Repeated "Not Yet" Three Times </H5>
  Beaming after the rejection, Mr. Kono said, "The style of 
managing the Diet by force brought on a reaction," implicitly 
criticizing Mr. Ozawa. At the time of the Kaifu cabinet, while 
he was a candidate for cabinet and party official posts, he was 
opposed by the "Kono- hating" Mr. Ozawa and lost out in both 
cases, so the grudge he holds toward Mr. Ozawa is especially 
deep. When Mr. Ozawa professed himself to be in "the reform 
faction" and raised the banner of Shinseito, Mr. Kono snapped 
at him sharply, saying, "What needs to be reformed first of all 
are the very dispositions of those men." 
  Criticism of the Ozawa line is swirling about Nagata-cho. 
LDP 
upper house Secretary General Tomio Yamamoto says, "It was an 
antifascist struggle," while coalition officials also offer the 
analysis that "Mr. Ozawa's forceful style invited the outcome of 
increasing the number of SDPJ rebels." 
  If it were chess, Mr. Ozawa would quickly admit defeat at 
this point. However, it is no longer so-called era of 
"Kon-Chiku-Sho" [Kanemaru, Takeshita, and Ozawa -- also, a 
common Japanese curse, "Damn it"] when Ozawa was LDP secretary 
general and had the backing of Takeshita and Shin Kanemaru, 
former LDP vice president; things have changed and Ozawa faces 
with a fierce power struggle. 
  An SDPJ official says, "Mr. Ozawa appears to have been 
defeated, but actually has not. Hereafter, if the governing 
coalition parties swallow the LDP's demands whole, within both 
the LDP and the SDPJ internal struggles will begin between 
pro-reform group and the go-slow group over whether to accept 
them. His real aim probably is to induce the breakup of both 
the LDP and SDPJ." 
  However, the LDP plan was once rejected and killed in the 
lower house. The , SDPJ will also find it hard to concede to 
regulations barring corporate and organizational donations. Even 
if the Executive Department decides on a concession, if more 
rebels emerge and lead to a party rupture, the coalition regime 
will collapse. 
  If the political reform bills are killed, would Prime 
Minister Hosokawa dissolve the lower house and call for general 
elections or have the cabinet resign en bloc since he has said 
that he "will take political responsibility? 
  With this recession, could he dissolve the Diet without 
having drawn up a budget for this fiscal year? Even Komeito, a 
coalition partner of Shinseito , strongly opposes. 
  Calling for an en-bloc resignation, however, if it were just 
to replace the prime minister with deputy prime minister, 
Tsutomu Hata, or the foreign minister, for example, would 
scarcely win the understanding of the nation. 
  It indeed appears that Mr.Ozawa is now in a fix and is truly 
waging a fruitless struggle that will embarrass himself. At the 
government-ruling parties leadership meeting, the night of the 
21st, when the draft bills had been rejected, he said, exposing 
the details of his compromise maneuvers with the LDP, "I had an 
agreement with the LDP Executive Department, but they broke 
their promises," thus trying to pin responsibility on the LDP. 
It was unusual for Mr. Ozawa, who is known for being 
tight-lipped. That might very well be an indication of his sense 
of defeat and frustration. 
  When the bills were rejected, Mr. Ozawa said as if to rouse 
himself to action, "Well then, it's one more round." To the 
reporters' question, "Is it a plan gone awry?" he answered three 
times, "Not yet, not yet, not yet." 
  About the same time, the leaders who had gathered in the 
LDP's lower house secretary general's office broke out in 
cheers when they saw the rejection on television. But, just one 
person, Chairman Ryotaro Hashimoto of the Policy Affairs 
Research Council, rebuked them all, saying, "Don't whoop it up!" 
Mr. Ozawa's rival knows well what his "next move" will be.

  [Text] Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa failed to 
attend the 4 March plenary session of the House of 
Representatives at which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
delivered his policy speech. 
  Commenting on his nonattendance, a spokesman at Ozawa's 
office said: "He does not have any special plans. But he may 
be feeling a little fatigued." 
  However, as Mr. Ozawa is not known for missing plenary Diet 
sessions, the rumor has started that his absence was a silent 
protest against the prime minister's failure to reshuffle the 
cabinet. 
  Mr. Ozawa missed a meeting of the government and ruling 
party 
leaders held on the night of 2 March, at which the prime 
minister announced his decision to postpone a cabinet reshuffle. 
Since then, Mr. Ozawa has made no appearances at the Diet where 
he has previously appeared regularly. 
  A senior Shinseito staff member said: "He is not exactly 
dissatisfied with the prime minister, but rather irritated by 
the fact the political outlook has become uncertain. Although 
he may not make an appearance for about a week, he will show up 
sooner or later."

  [Text] Coalition parties are expected to form a unified 
parliamentary group probably at the end of the current Diet 
session, senior coalition officials said on 10 March. In 
preparation for upper house elections in summer 1995, the 
coalition parties believe it is necessary to open talks on 
interparty cooperation in election campaigns within this summer. 
In connection with this, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has 
recently requested a high-ranking official of the multiparty 
parliamentary group Shin-Ryokufukai to expand the group to the 
entire coalition as soon as possible. The merger of upper house 
parliamentary groups will be carried out among the 
Shin-Ryokuhukai, the Komeito, and the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ]. Informal negotiations are now under way among 
SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo, Komeito Deputy Secretary 
General Naohiko Okubo, and Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] 
Parliamentary Group Chairman Yukihisa Yoshida. 
  To cope with the next general election, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa is seeking a unified parliamentary group in the lower 
house. The upper house's moves toward a parliamentary group 
merger involving the SDPJ is likely to accelerate inter-party 
alliance, or even party realignment, in the lower house. 
  In a speech given to the 10 March meeting of the "10-Men 
Association of the Coalition Village," a gathering of coalition 
leaders chaired by former SDPJ Chairman Makoto Tanabe, SDPJ 
Secretary General Kubo said: "The coalition must fully grapple 
with the 1995 upper house elections narrowing our candidates. 
We must unify our parliamentary groups." Attendants from other 
parties basically agreed with his opinion. 
  Touching on the possible timing of the parliamentary group 
merger at the upper house, a senior Komeito official said "we 
are seeking the merger in the end of the current Diet session." 
The new group may be called the "Dai-Ryokufukai." 
  At the upper house, the Shin-Ryokuhukai was formed last 
month 
as a joint parliamentary group of the Shinseito, the DSP, the 
Democratic Reform Party [Minshu Kaikaku Rengo], the Japan New 
Party [JNP], and the Sports Peace Party. In particular, the 
Shinseito and the JNP take positive stances toward the 
parliamentary group union because it may trigger similar moves 
at the lower house, or even a political party realignment. In 
mid-February, Prime Minister Hosokawa met with Shinseito 
Parliamentary Group Acting Chairman Ichiji Ishii at the prime 
minister's office and make a request to "unify (all coalition 
parties) as soon as possible." 
  The Komeito has been taking positive attitudes toward its 
own 
participation in the unified parliamentary group. However, the 
party wants the SDPJ to join the group simultaneously, since it 
would be unfavorable to leave the largest ruling party in an 
isolated position. Therefore, the Komeito is currently "waiting 
for action by the SDPJ" (as a senior Komeito official said).

<F P=106> [Article by editorial staff member Shunji Taoka: "Defense </F>
Agency's Defensive Battle Regarding the Revision of the National 
Defense Program Outline"] 
  [Text] "I thought it might hold good for 10 years," said 
Noboru Hoshuyama, director of the Secretariat of the Defense 
Agency [DA] who created the draft of "The Defense Program 
Outline" adopted by the National Defense Council in October 
1976. In the autumn of 1974 Hoshuyama, who at that time was a 
staff member of the Defense Planning Division within the Defense 
Agency, took leave and completed the draft in one week, living 
in the hall owned by the Defense Agency's Mutual Aid Association. 
  At that time, partly because of the inflation which occurred 
following the first oil shock, the defense budget for 1975 
increased by 21 percent compared to the previous year. On the 
other hand, the world was experiencing detente following the 
Vietnam war, and it became necessary for the government to frame 
the defense program outline in order to show the people to what 
extent the defense capabilities were to be reinforced. 
  With the lapse of the 18 years since they were framed, the 
"outline"--which provides for basic defense capabilities, with 
the East-West confrontation as background, and the "attached 
sheets to the outline" which provide the military forces and 
equipment to achieve the outline--has become outdated. Besides, 
with the end of the East-West confrontation, it has become 
necessary to review Japan's security policy as a whole. 
  The "panel on defense problems" established on 28 February 
as 
an advisory council to Prime Minister Hosokawa is trying to 
frame a new basic plan. 
<H5>  Things Did Not Go as the Defense Agency Expected </H5>
  A number of councils established in the past were expected 
to 
play the role of "invisible cloak" to cover up the fact that 
intellectuals are also giving their consent to the plans 
proposed by the ministries and agencies. However, the newly 
established panel was of a different nature. Originally the 
Defense Agency planned to establish an advisory organ to the 
director-general, but its intention was not realized as the 
advisory panel was suddenly established by the prime minister. 
  Flurried, on 1 March the Defense Agency established a "panel 
to discuss ways of defending the nation" consisting of the 
director-general, the vice ministers, the bureau directors, the 
chiefs of staff of the three Self-Defense Forces, and other 
staff members. 
  A leading staff member of the Defense Agency says: "We 
intend to take the initiative in dealing with the situation. We 
intend to compile a complete plan before they reach with their 
conclusion, and to prevent the panel from running alone." The 
Defense Agency seems to be aiming at an "active defense," not a 
"passive defense." 
  The key member of the panel is Seiki Nishihiro, former vice 
minister for the Defense Agency. Retired Admiral Makoto Sakuma, 
former chairman of the Joint Staff Council, also joins the 
panel. Thus there is little possibility that the panel will come 
up with a plan totally different from the previous one. 
However, Nishihiro is the person who once proposed that the 
Ground Self-Defense Force should be drastically reduced, that 
equipment should be imported to cooperate with the United 
States, and so on. Therefore, Defense Agency officials who are 
his juniors are taking a cautious attitude toward him because 
"Nishihiro tends to make philosophic expressions and come up 
with fantastic ideas". 
  "The panel is not capable of making a concrete proposal as 
to 
the scale of the Self-Defense Forces in the future," states a 
high-ranking official of the Defense Agency. He added his own 
advice that "it would be easier to effect reductions if the 
outline was abolished; as used to be the practice before the 
outline was framed, a five-year plan will be framed to meet the 
situation." 
  However, the "threat from the North" has sharply decreased. 
With serious economic and financial confusion taking place, the 
amount Russia spends in real terms on national defense declined 
to below one-eighth the level of two years ago. While defense 
expenses in nominal terms increased by 3100 percent, inflation 
rose 26000 percent during the same period, and the country faces 
difficulty in procuring equipment maintenance expenses and 
salaries. In fact, the percentage of evaders of military 
service has reached as high as 80 percent. 
<H3>  Defense Agency Claims the Military Power of the PRC Has 
Increased </H3>
  Nishihiro, Sakuma, other officails, and the Defense Agency 
itself attempt to explain the necessity of the Self-Defense 
Forces on the grounds that the military power of the PRC has 
increased following the collapse of the USSR. 
  However, from a long-range view, the actual increase in the 
PRC's military expenditures is almost on the same level as the 
rate of inflation. 
  A drastic reduction is underway in China's army. The navy 
has also sharply decreased the number of its submarines; it now 
maintains 30-odd submarines, whereas five years ago it 
maintained more than 90. The air force, which maintains 5,000 
outdated airplanes which are on the verge of retirement, has 
purchased only 26 Russian-made Su-27 planes during the past two 
years. Far from increasing its armaments, the country is having 
difficulty in modernizing its forces. It will not be 
justifiable to designate the PRC as the threat which replaces 
the USSR. 
  With the East-West confrontation coming to an end, changes 
are also taking place involving the defense relationship between 
Japan and the United States. High-ranking government officials 
and the mass media in the United States are expressing anxiety 
over Japan's nuclear armaments, and are directing their 
attention to the increase in Japan's defense expenses while 
other advanced countries are reducing their own defense 
expenses, even though the amount of the increase may be small. 
  The panel plans to develop its tentative conclusions by this 
summer. However, it is likely an actual battle involving 
reductions will take place sometime thereafter.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 10 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- In March 9 
the representatives of the opposition in the State Great Hural 
(SGH) of Mongolia had a meeting with the president of the 
country P. Ochirbat to discuss the present situation in the 
country and possible crisis in the parliament, but they did not 
come to any decision and mutual consent. 
  But the opposition the Mongolian National Democratic Party 
(MNDP) and the Mongolian Social Democratic Party (MSDP) are not 
going to abandon their decision to recall their representatives 
from the parliament of the country, informs the MONTSAME 
correspondent, referring to the official sources. 
  The opposition has been waiting for the end of the official 
visit of President P. Ochirbat to the four countries of Asia to 
discuss with him the present situation in the country and the 
issues of recalling its representatives from the State Great 
Hural. P. Ochirbat has been elected to the post of president 
from the bloc of the MNDP and the MSDP. If, in the end, the 
opposition recalls its representatives, 70 out of 76 members of 
the parliament will represent only one party of the ruling 
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP). 
  This responsible decision has been made recently by the 
opposition, with taking into consideration the present situation 
in the country, considering that the opposition can not work in 
the parliament later on preserving the party representative.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 11 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper" ARDIYN ERH" publishes an interview of its 
correspondent with the chairman of the State Great Hural (SGH) 
Standing Committee D. Lundeejantsan, who returned to homeland 
after visiting Japan at the invitation of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Japan. D. Lundeejantsan points out to 
successful development of Mongolian Japanese relations in 
different spheres, including on the line of the parliaments. He 
particularly notes that during meetings with officials of Japan 
they have been pointing out with satisfaction to declaration by 
Mongolia of her territory a nuclear free zone. As D. 
Lundeejantsan announces, by the end of the forthcoming spring 
session of the State Great Hural it is supposed that the head of 
the Mongolian parliament will visit Japan. 
  The newspaper publishes an interview of the general director 
of the firm of knitted wear "Gobi" P. Damdinjav. He notes that 
cashmere articles produced by the firm are still in popular 
demand in foreign countries, including Canada, the USA, Japan, 
England, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, France. Concerning the 
issues of supply with raw materials, P. Damdinjav notes that 
shifting enterprises to a free system is profitable for 
enterprises, which produce goods for export, and complicates 
activity of enterprises, based on import. 
  As the newspaper informs, according to the outcome of the 
census, which was carried out at the end of the last year, in 
agriculture there are 153, 6 thousand families of cattle 
breeders or 347, 9 thousand cattle breeders, which exceeds the 
level of the previous year. The number of individual cattle 
breeder's farms has exceeded 80 thousand or increased by 1, 8 
times as against 1992. Individual cattle breeders constitute 
more than 52 percent of cattle breeding units, in average 72 
heads of cattle falls on each unit. 
  In an interview with the correspondent of the government 
newspaper"DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEUEE" the Minister of Power, Geology 
and Mining Industy G. Jigjid explains restriction of electric 
energy supply of the capital and central regions of the country 
with misfirings in supply with coal, which in its turn is 
connected with the exceeding of a norm of exploitation of 
automachines of high hoisting capacity, which are working at the 
Baganuur Coal Mine. Besides that, as the minister notes, 
irresponsibility of workers. Despite granting currency means to 
the branch, says the minister, they defray only a half of 
expenses on purchase of spare parts and materials. 
  As the newspaper informs, in the capital there are 5 women 
of 
the age above 100 years. The eldest out of them is 113 years 
old Sodoogiin Jidhuu. G. Togtohbayar has given birth to 16 
children. The citizen of the capital B. Dolgor has brought up 5 
children orphaned or left by parents. 
  According to the data of the newspaper, in general 
educational schools of the country 370 thousand children are 
studying, which is less as compared with the last year's level 
approximately by 10 thousand children. As the newspaper notes, 
at present about 120 thousand children of the school age do not 
attend the general educational schools.

<F P=106> ["Sixth Working Contact for Exchange of Presidential Envoys" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Panmunjom, March 12 (KCNA) -- The sixth working 
contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the 
North and the South was held in the South side's portion of 
Panmunjom today. 
  The head of the North side's delegation said at the contact 
that the exchange of presidential envoys between the two sides 
had been proposed by the North side and it had made all sincere 
efforts for its realisation. 
  Noting that the South side which had opposed this exchange 
last year has accepted our proposal and is willing to exchange 
special envoys, he said he was going to make clear the following 
points now. 
  He said: 
  Firstly, it is required of the South side to admit that it 
had categorically opposed the exchange of special envoys when we 
proposed it. 
  It is a matter which must be clarified for a successful 
realisation of the exchange of special envoys in the future. 
  Secondly, the South side had consistently refused top- level 
talks which we had proposed in the past. 
  As far back as more than 20 years ago when the first 
North-South dialogue began, our side proposed to the then 
authority of the South side to have top-level talks between the 
two sides and, in the later period, proposed to the South side a 
summit meeting between the two sides officially and unofficially 
several times. 
  Especially, in early April, 1992, a special envoy of our 
side 
visited Seoul and invited the South Korean top authority to 
Pyongyang. 
  At that time, heads of state and government and prominent 
figures of many countries came to Pyongyang and congratulated 
our respected leader President Kim Il-song on his 80th birthday 
and had significant meetings with him. 
  The South side of the same nation, however, turned down our 
special envoy's invitation to visit Pyongyang and so a summit 
between the North and the South could not be held. 
  But we had never mentioned it. 
  Today we are clarifying these facts in the hope of strictly 
preventing the recurrence of the unhappy things of the past 
concerning the question of the exchange of special envoys 
between the North and the South. 
  Stating that the North side had deeply studied and examined 
the proposals and remarks made by the South side at the last 
working contact and the one-to-one contact between the heads of 
both sides, the head of the North side said: 
  In this we have reached the conclusion that your side 
suggested that the issues of discontinuing all large-scale 
nuclear war manoeuvres and stopping seeking an "international 
cooperation system," which were raised by the North side, might 
be discussed and resolved when the sides exchanged special 
envoys. 
  Your side also said that it had decided not to stage the 
"Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and greater efforts 
should be made from the national viewpoint with regard to the 
issue of the "international cooperation system." 
  And your side said the situation has changed now because 
your 
side had already decided to shelve the plan to introduce Patriot 
missiles and as for the remarks of your side's top authority 
that he "cannot shake hands with a party possessed of nuclear 
weapons", he made them in June last year and later said judging 
from information available, the North had no nuclear weapons. 
  The head of the North side delegation said although this 
position of the South side was still not satisfactory enough, 
the North side took note of it, regarding it as an expression of 
understanding of the reasonableness of the four-point demand 
raised by the North side. 
  Then he proposed to the South side, as a dramatic step for 
the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the 
South, to announce at home and abroad in the form of joint 
communique that the North and the South confirmed again each 
other's intention to exchange special envoys and reached a 
complete agreement on the exchange of special envoys at the 
earliest possible date, and to discuss the drafts of agreement 
on working procedures put forward by both sides and finalize it 
at the contact today. 
  After the speech of the North side the two sides entered 
into 
the discussion of detailed matters. 
  The North side repeatedly urged the other side to take a 
joint step of announcing to the nation in a joint communique 
that they confirmed again each other's intention to exchange 
special envoys and agreed to realize it at the earliest possible 
date. 
  The South side, however, refused to accept it under 
unreasonable excuses and pretexts. 
  The North side stressed again that because both sides 
confirmed their will for the exchange of presidential envoys and 
agreed to realise it at the earliest date possible, there is no 
reason to refrain from reporting about it. 
  It suggested releasing news reports separately according to 
each side's convenience if a joint communique was not to be 
published. The South side opposed it, too. 
  The North side said it would publish a news report of its 
own 
in disregard of the South side's opinion. 
  The sides entered into a discussion of the working 
procedures 
for the exchange of presidential envoys. 
  Out of the 28 points of 13 articles contained in the drafts 
put forward by the sides, they reached an agreement in principle 
on all but four articles. 
  The South side insisted on its unreasonable position and 
took 
a negative attitude toward principled and important matters 
related to the tasks of the special envoys such as adherence of 
the North and the South to the principle of national 
independence, confirmation of the way of national reunification 
and promotion of great unity of the whole nation. 
  Then followed a tete-a-tete contact of the chief delegates 
of both sides. 
  It was agreed that the seventh working contact would be held 
at the Thongil House in the North side's portion of Panmunjom on 
March 16.

<F P=106> ["Agreed Conclusions Must Be Implemented Strictly" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- If the United States 
is truly willing to find a negotiated solution to the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula, it must honestly and strictly 
implement the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. 
contact in New York, urges NODONG SINMUN today. 
  Recalling that at a time when the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks is due on March 21, some seditious forces of the United 
States, Japan and South Korea are trying to obstruct the 
implementation of the agreed conclusions, insisting on 
preconditions and hard lines against the DPRK, the news analyst 
says: 
  This is an anti-dialogue move of those who hate a negotiated 
solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  By calling for preconditions, those seditious forces seek to 
hinder the implementation of the agreed conclusions reached at 
the New York DPRK-U.S. contact and lower the checkbar on the way 
of the solution of the nuclear issue through dialogue and 
negotiation which has been paved with much difficulty. 
  Things, however, will not go as they wish. 
  The point is how the DPRK and the U.S. promote the process 
of 
the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula which has been put on the right track, with a sound 
thinking faculty, not caring a bit about the moves of any 
seditious force. 
  The situation may develop to a grave phase, if any side 
delay 
or foil the implementation of the agreed conclusions, seeking 
its selfish purpose or lending an ear to the seditious voices. 
  The seditious forces must renounce the reckless attempts to 
block the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  What is needed at the present moment with the third-round 
DPRK- U.S. talks ahead is to do act in favor of the settlement 
of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  If a dialogue partner set unreasonable preconditions and, 
furthermore, take up the refrain of the call of the seditious 
forces for tough measures, that will result in spoiling the 
atmosphere of dialogue and negotiation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
staged a war exercise for a surprise bombing on designated 
targets in the North Thursday [10 March] with some ten 
Japan-based pursuit-assault planes in the skies above Sangdong 
and Kunwi, South Korea, military sources said. 
  Meanwhile, an Okinawa-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance 
plane committed an overall photographing and electronic 
reconnaissance in the South Korean airspace on the northern half 
of Korea. 
  That day, the South Korean puppets mobilized some 800 armed 
bandits in a war exercise on the forefront in Chupa-ri, Chorwon 
County, South Korean Kangwon Province. A 105-mm artillery group 
of the puppet army fired about 90 shells at spots adjacent to 
the demilitarized zone along the military demarcation line.

  [Text] The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets have 
dared to conduct long-range bombing exercises to occupy enemy 
positions. According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists' 
Marine Air Corps from overseas bases on 10 March made sorties 
over the South Korean skies and conducted provocative long-range 
surprise-attack bombing exercises aimed at a northward invasion. 
  On 10 March, some 12 pursuit planes took off from a base in 
Japan, refueling in mid air, and ran wild in the surprise 
bombing exercise of given objects in attack position in the 
skies over areas near Sangdong and Kunwi, South Korea as well as 
the exercise of returning to the base. 
  The war exercise, which was conducted with the support of 
aerial refueling planes, was a dangerous game to enhance the 
actual-combat capability of the long-range air corps in the 
surprise bombing of objects inland of the northern half of the 
Republic. 
  While the war exercise was going on, an RC-135 strategic 
reconnaissance plane, that flew from a base in Okinawa over the 
South Korean skies, made a long-distance flight over areas near 
the Military Demarcation Line [DML], took comprehensive pictures 
of the whole area of the northern half of the Republic, and 
conducted electronic reconnaissance. 
  In the meantime, the South Korean puppets ran amok with 
provocative war exercises, which were very agitating to us, near 
the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ] of the MDL. On 10 March, over 800 
puppet Army's armed villains loaded in some 50 armored cars 
advanced up to the fore areas near Chupa-ri of the South Korean 
Chorwon County, and worked themselves into a war frenzy openly 
occupying a battle position in broad daylight. Prior to this, 
on 9 March, the puppet Army's 105mm artillery groups appeared 
near Chongja-ri, Paju County and Chungsan, Yonchon County, 
Kyonggi Province, were filled with northward invasion frenzy and 
dropped over 90 bombs in areas near the DMZ of the MDL.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The international 
association against torture strongly demanded the repatriation 
of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to the Northern half of Korea, two 
old men who had been forced to a prison life for over thirty 
years in South Korea after they were taken prisoners in 1951 and 
1953 during the Korean war, and are now kept in South Korea. 
  In a letter to the South Korean authority demanding their 
repatriation, the association recalled that they had been 
subjected to brutal and inhuman tortures and maltreatment in 
prison and noted that their health has run down further 
under the present living condition and discrimination. 
  The letter said that though Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan sent a 
petition requesting their repatriation to the North for their 
reunion with their families to the South Korean Red Cross and 
the International Committee of the Red Cross, the South Korean 
Red Cross has not accepted it. 
  The letter urged the South Korean authorities to immediately 
take a measure for their reunion with their families in the 
North.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppet Security Planning Board (SPB) [Agency for National 
Security and Planning--NSP] recently invented and made public 
the case of "Yi Pok-hon's visit to the North" in a bid to do 
harm to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, according to 
a report from Seoul. 
  It alleged that Yi Pok-hon, 32, who had been sought by the 
police in South Korea in 1990 on the suspicion of swindles, went 
abroad and joined an international criminal organization 
engaging in drug trafficking and terrorism by contract and then 
received terrorist training by traveling to the northern half of 
Korea on several occasions and conducted secret activities to 
get rid of anti-North activists overseas at the dictate of the 
North, before being arrested. 
  This is an utterly groundless, preposterous drama invented 
premeditatedly by the "SPB" pursuing a sinister political 
purpose and a disgusting offspring of the anti-DPRK plot aimed 
at slandering the North. 
  It is sheer nonsense that Yi Pok-hon, a ghost invented by 
the 
"SPB", came to the North. And still more preposterous is the 
claim that the North gives terrorist training. 
  We take a serious view of the ridiculous charge of the "SPB" 
that we invited scores of members of the afore-said criminal 
organization to the North with the assistance of Yi Pok-hon and 
gave them special military training and, at the same time, have 
sold arms through them. 
  It goes without saying that this is another brainchild for 
attaching "seriousness" to the case of "Yi Pok-hon's visit to 
the North." We, however, feel it necessary to decisively refute 
the vicious political plot of the puppets to impair the 
dignified international image of the DPRK by linking it with an 
international criminal organization. 
  The case is only a sequel to a long string of the anti-DPRK 
plots which the "SPB" had hatched each time the situation turned 
unfavorable to them. It is nothing but a drama to cover up 
their poor position in which they have become a target of 
worldwide denunciation over the issues of the "National Security 
Law" and human rights abuses in South Korea, and avert elsewhere 
the attention of the world people. 
  The case only shows how nervous the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique has got over the fact that the DPRK's authority and 
prestige is growing not only in South Korea but in the 
international arena, while they have got into hot water. 
  Therefore, we cannot but see behind the criminal scheme of 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to deliberately balk the ongoing 
working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the 
North and the South and obstruct the third round of the 
DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and thus isolate and stifle the 
North with the "international cooperation system." If the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique wants to frighten the North with a base 
drama which cannot work with anyone, it would be a serious 
mistake.

<F P=106> ["Indictment Against `Civilian' Fascist Hangman" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The report of the 
Amnesty International scathingly denouncing the harsh human 
rights violations by "civilian fascists" is a telling blow at 
Kim Yong-sam the fascist hangman, who is advertising "expansion 
of human rights," stresses NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The Amnesty International in a report March 9 on the lapse 
of 
one year since the traitor Kim Yong-sam's inauguration said that 
although he promised "democratization" under the "civilian" 
veil, "new tortures and harsh practices" have appeared in South 
Korea. The Kim Yong-sam government has hardly done anything to 
put an end to human rights violations, added the report. 
  When hanging up the signboard of "civilian government," the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam waxed eloquent about "liquidation of the 
leftovers of the past" and "expansion of human rights." The 
last year, however, has witnessed nothing but murderous 
strong-arm politics and terror politics in South Korea. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group relies on the one-party dictatorship 
of the military fascist "Democratic Liberal Party." And such 
fascist repressive machines as "Security Planning Board" and 
"Secret Affairs Command," which should have been thrown into the 
dustbin of history, along with the dictatorship of the "Fifth 
and Sixth Republics," still stay alive and active in human 
rights violations, invoking the "National Security Law" that 
should have been scrapped. This is the stark reality of South 
Korea. 
  To expect democratic politics and guarantee of human rights 
from the traitor Kim Yong-sam is as foolish as hoping to see a 
wolf give birth to a lamb. 
  Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets at a recent meeting 
of 
the UN commission on human rights made a tirade about "expansion 
of human rights" and "progress in democratization" in South 
Korea and even took issue with someone's "human rights problem." 
This was the height of shamelessness and a mockery of the 
meeting and its participants. 
  Only after the ouster of the "government" of the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, can true democratic politics and human rights be 
expected in South Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
people of all strata who truly want independence, democracy, 
peace and reunification must unite with each other, irrespective 
of ideology, political view, religious belief and property 
status, transcending their party interests and strategies, and 
their genealogy and affiliation, to fight the colonial fascist 
forces, the common target of struggle, stresses NODONG SINMUN in 
a by-lined article today. 
  The cause of independence and democracy in South Korea and 
national reunification is a showdown between the national forces 
for independence and the aggressive forces and between the 
patriotic forces for reunification and democracy and the fascist 
forces for division and it requires the unity of all the 
champions of independence, democracy and reunification, the 
paper says, and goes on: 
  There is no reason that the forces for independence, 
democracy and reunification cannot achieve [word indistinct] 
Korea. Workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, urban 
dwellers, national capitalists and many other people are 
suffering under the colonial fascist rule in South Korea. The 
people, except the narrow privileged circles, cannot defend 
their vital interests unless the colonial fascist rule is 
liquidated. This is an objective condition under which South 
Korean people of various social strata can closely unite with 
each other under the slogan of independence, democracy and 
reunification. 
  All the South Korean forces for independence, democracy and 
reunification oppose the colonial fascist rule and hope for the 
establishment of an independent, democratic government. 
  It is a lawful demand in accomplishing the cause of 
independence, democracy and reunification that the South Korean 
people launch an all-people common struggle, irrespective of 
their isms and principles and their party, political and 
religious groupings. 
  It is important in developing the mass struggle for 
independence, democracy and reunification to strengthen the 
political struggle of the workers and peasants, while closely 
combining it with the students' movement for political freedom 
and democracy and waging a common struggle with all other 
classes and circles interested in it. 
  The South Korean patriotic forces for independence, 
democracy 
and reunification must, for the present, vigorously wage a 
massive common struggle to put an end to the domination, 
interference and pressure by outside forces and smash the 
treacheries, suppression, nonfrontationist [word as received] 
and divisive moves of the "civilian" fascist forces and head for 
the formation of a united front. 
  This is the way of rejecting the domination and interference 
by outside forces, destroying the fascist dictatorial forces and 
winning independence, democracy and reunification. 
  The South Korean people's righteous struggle for the three 
goals will surely emerge victorious.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- South Korean people 
have presented gifts to dear Comrade Kim Chong-il carrying their 
will to follow him and hold him in high esteem as the leader of 
the nation and the lodestar of reunification. 
  A South Korean woman prepared a gem embroidery "The old home 
at Mt. Paektu secret camp" with utmost care. The embroidery 
shows the native home of Comrade Kim Chong-il and Chong-il peak 
and two bunches of flowers with 94,216 strung beads of 17 colors. 
  The gift reflects the pure heart of the South Korean people 
to follow Comrade Kim Chong-il and hold him in high esteem and 
the wishes of the fellow countrymen determined to cherish the 
historical day of his birth for ever and celebrate the 
anniversary. 
  Among the gifts are a gem embroidery with Mt. Paektu, the 
emblem of the Workers' Party of Korea and the red sun 
represented with 216,000 beads and beside them letters calling 
for upholding the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
and a bronze plum tree symbolizing the ardent aspiration and 
will of the fellow countrymen to follow him and the immortality 
of the chuche idea. 
  They also include a gift depicting a peach tree laden with 
fruits which was made from natural gem stones of various colors, 
symbolizing the socialist system of the Northern half of the 
country which has turned into "a peach orchard behind misty 
hills" under the leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, and a 
wooden carving of Mt. Paektu with a poem dedicated to him, 
reflecting the sincere wishes of the South Korean people for 
good health and long life to him, and other carvings.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea [GFTUK] 
issued an appeal to the South Korean workers today concerning 
the existence of the workers which is now in a grave crisis due 
to the South Korean authorities' anti-popular labour policy and 
wage-curbing move. 
  The appeal charges that the Kim Yong-sam regime has been 
brandishing the sword of fascist dictatorship against the 
workers, branding their just struggle for the right to live and 
democracy as "collective egoism". 
  It says: 
  Imposing "sharing of hardships" upon the working masses, the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam, puppet, cut the yearly wage hike rate at 
below 3 percent and is making no scruples of fascist crackdown 
on the labor movement by invoking even the ill-named "emergency 
arbitration power" of the period of "Yusin" dictatorship to curb 
the struggle for a higher pay. 
  He has lifted to more than 3,000 million dollars, the 
largest 
ever, the burden share for the maintenance of the U.S. 
occupation forces in South Korea and increased the military 
spendings for the first year of his office to more than 
10,000,000 million won, or up 9.6 percent from the previous 
year, while suppressing the workers' just demand for a higher 
pay at the point of the bayonet. 
  The appropriations of the puppet government's "budget" for 
the socalled "welfare of the working people" account for a 
meager one 300th of the military expenditures. 
  The miserable living conditions of the labouring masses 
including workers cannot be improved, nor can the outrageous 
deeds of the employers be removed as long as such dastardly 
traitor, dirty turncoat and disgusting political prostitute Kim 
Yong-sam the traitor is left in power in South Korea. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a trickster as cunning and 
shameful 
as an old fox is now is preaching "compromise" on one hand and 
trying on the other to weaken your strength through ruthless 
suppression and "ameriolation". 
  There should be no compromise with the clique of traitors. 
No compromise, no hesitation, no submission is the way for you 
to win in the struggle for a higher pay and the right to live. 
  The enemy pouncing upon you with a dagger between his 
clenched teeth must be fought back with a dagger. 
  South Korean workers! 
  The season of struggle has come. 
  Rise daringly in the springtime struggle for a wage hike 
excel. 
  Your demand will not be met through petitioning or 
negotiations. 
  Kindle a fiercer flame of struggle to wreak the pentup 
rancour of the forerunners who fell in struggle and to save the 
people from distress! Rise up like mountains and demonstrate 
the strong mettle of the working class! 
  You workers in South Korea must develop your struggle for 
wage hike into an anti-U.S. struggle for independence and an 
anti-fascist struggle for democracy if you are to lead a life 
worthy of human being in a genuinely independent and peaceful 
world. 
  Fight it out to bring down a stern sledge hammer on the head 
of the Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors and establish a true 
independent democratic regime in South Korea!

<F P=106> ["Where Does Japan Lead Situation" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata recently prattled that "if North Korea 
refuses again to accept inspection or takes an irresolute 
attitude or uses the nuclear card strangely, Japan would sternly 
counter with it within the scope of the constitution", 
clamouring that the "DPRK is going to make nuclear weapons and 
it is suspected of having one or two nuclear bombs." 
  The remarks of the Japanese foreign minister are virtually 
tantamount to an official declaration that Japan will openly 
step up nuclear armament, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says, 
and goes on: 
  We cannot but take a particularly serious view of this. 
Though the Korean peninsula is denuclearized, it will be 
useless and will not guarantee peace and security in this 
region, Japan's nuclear armament posing an actual danger. 
Hence, we have felt that the North-South joint declaration on 
denuclearization might be of no use, unless Japan's attempt at 
nuclear armament is checked. And this feeling grows stronger as 
the Japanese authorities take issue with our "nuclear issue" 
more blatantly in a bid to justify its nuclear armament. This 
makes us doubt whether the North-South joint declaration on 
denuclearisation is needed. 
  Judging from all this, we may find ourselves compelled to 
reconsider our stand toward denuclearization on the Korean 
peninsula. In case of this, the situation will develop to an 
unpredictable phase and it will not be good to the United States 
and South Korea, either. The Japanese authorities should 
entirely be to blame for this. 
  The Japanese authorities must act with discretion, deeply 
pondering over the grave consequences of their utterances.

<F P=106> ["Japan Must Codify `Three Non-Nuclear Principles' and </F>
Faithfully Observe Them, NODONG SINMUN" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- If it is true that 
Japan does not pursue nuclear armament, it must codify the 
"three non-nuclear principles" and faithfully observe them, give 
up the projected stockpile of excessive plutonium and clearly 
declare its will for denuclearization, urges NODONG SINMUN today. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in his address at the 
Diet some time ago described foreign press reports about Japan's 
pursuit of nuclear armament as "groundless," saying that Japan 
has "three non-nuclear principles" banning the manufacture, 
possession and introduction of nuclear weapons. And Morihiro 
Hosokawa stated that Japan would keep to the "three non-nuclear 
principles." 
  The news analyst of the paper dismisses their assertions as 
verbal pyrotechnics to get out of the tight corner in which 
Japan faces worldwide criticism as a nuclear culprit. 
  The commentary says: 
  As for the "three non-nuclear principles" which the Japanese 
Government uses as an evidence for its "nuclear uprightness," 
they are nominal as they are not codified and specify no penalty 
on their violations. 
  Never have the "three non-nuclear principles" been observed 
since they were laid down by the Japanese Government in the 
1960s. 
  U.S. warships and planes loaded with nuclear weapons 
frequent Japanese sea ports and airports, as if they were their 
own. Japan, however, has never inspected them, nor has the 
conversion of the Japanese territory into a nuclear base of the 
United States been raised as a problem. 
  The "three non-nuclear principles" are used today as a 
smokescreen to conceal Japan's nuclear armament. 
  The Japanese Government is putting up the signboard of 
"three 
non-nuclear principles" in an effort to relieve the Japanese 
people of their concern over nuclear armament at home and make 
Japan appear a "non-nuclear peace state" externally. 
  Behind the curtain of these "principles" Japan as 
stockpiling 
a colossal amount of plutonium to rank itself among the nuclear 
powers. It has finished preparations for the manufacture of 
nuclear weapons and developed by itself and launched a space 
rocket capable of carrying nuclear warheads. 
  Japan plans to dispatch its Armed Forces to wide areas of 
the 
world and is accelerating its nuclear armament and its 
conversion into a military power to realise its dominationist 
ambition with strength. 
  If the Japanese authorities resort to double-dealing 
tactics, 
letting out a string of poor excuses, they will face a bitterer 
criticism from the world people.

<F P=106> ["Foolish Attempt" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- It is a folly of the 
Japanese reactionaries to try to frustrate the third-round 
DPRK-USA talks when the day of its opening is drawing near, says 
MINJU CHOSON in a commentary today. 
  The analyst notes: 
  When the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact 
in New York was published the high-placed authorities of Japan 
made quite a noise as if the United States had made a big 
mistake, trying to attain their sinister purpose by poking their 
noses into the "nuclear problem" of the DPRK. 
  Blaring that the "pressure for the inspection" of the 
military sites of the North of Korea "would increase", Japanese 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata a few days ago urged us to take "a 
measure to dispel the suspicion of nuclear weapon development". 
  A ranking official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry said 
with malice that "a mistake in the North Korean problem will 
entail an irretrievable consequence." 
  The Japanese reactionaries are also spreading through 
subsidized media the warning that if Japan cannot take a joint 
step with the United States in the "nuclear problem", the 
Japan-U.S. relations which show a lift with the collapse of 
economic negotiation will greet a more serious phase. 
  Judging from the words and deeds of the Japanese 
reactionaries, they are craftily and viciously trying to deeply 
interfere in the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK by putting pressure 
on the United States, capitalizing on the "Japan-U.S. alliance" 
and the complex Japan-U.S. trade relations and break up the 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Japan has no ground or justification to meddle in the 
"nuclear issue" of the North of Korea. The Japanese authorities 
are kicking up an untimely row over it. This reveals their dark 
intention to justify their own nuclear armament. 
  The Japanese authorities should not interfere in other's 
affairs, forgetful of their position, but give up their own 
reactionary scheme of nuclear armament.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- Statements and an 
article denouncing Japan's nuclear armament were published in 
different countries recently. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a recent statement 
said Japan has stockpiled a large amount of plutonium and 
completed technological preparations to make nuclear weapons any 
time. 
  The statement warned that if Japan continued on the road of 
nuclear armament, it would invite curses and condemnations from 
the world people. 
  The Yugoslav paper BORBA said although Japan laid down the 
"Three non-nuclear principles" banning the production, 
possession and introduction of nuclear weapons, it has been 
covertly ignoring the principles recently. 
  Alejandro Solorzano, chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the National Assembly of Nicaragua, in a statement 
on March 3 said it is a big obstacle to the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula that Japan is hastening its nuclear 
armament despite strong protests and denunciation by the world's 
progressive people. 
  He stressed that the total elimination of nuclear weapons 
and 
a halt to their development should be realized worldwide and 
that Japan should discard its dream of becoming a nuclear power.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- 
A meeting took place at the Korean Hall in Tokyo on March 9 to 
commemorate the 20th founding anniversary of the film studio of 
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon). 
  A decree of the DPRK Central People's Committee on awarding 
order of national flag first class to the Chongnyon film studio 
was read out and then congratulatory messages from organizations 
in the homeland conveyed. 
  In his congratulatory speech Ho Chong-man, chief 
vice-chairman of the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee, said 
the 20-year history of the Chongnyon film studio is unthinkable 
apart from the loving care and solicitude of the great leader 
Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the dear leader Marshal Kim 
Chong-il. He recalled their wise guidance to the manufacture 
and dissemination of film and video recordings of Chongnyon. 
  The Chongnyon film studio could develop into a reliable film 
and video recordings producer and disseminator of Chongnyon and 
register proud successes under the loving care of the great 
leader and the dear leader, he stressed. 
  He said the workers of the studio should honorably discharge 
their duty and role as a worthwhile propagandist and educator of 
the chuche era, as a recorder of history. 
  A letter to Marshal Kim Chong-il was adopted at the meeting.

  [Text] Son Song-pil, our country's ambassador to Russia, 
held a news conference with reporters in Moscow on 9 March in 
connection with the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. In 
the conference, the ambassador briefed the content of a 
statement by Kang Sok-chu, first vice foreign minister, to 
reporters and said: Our country and the United States agreed to 
take a joint action for a solution to the nuclear issue in New 
York on 25 February. According to the agreement the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection has started, 
beginning on 1 March, a working-level contact for the exchange 
of special envoys between the North and the South has resumed, 
and a statement was announced regarding the suspension of the 
Team Spirit joint military exercise. 
  It is good thing that the agreement was reached on the joint 
action and that the work for their realization has begun. 
However, the measures taken for the joint action are still on a 
primary level [kichojok] and are nothing but a beginning. The 
problem we have now is how to implement the agreement. 
  If the measures for the joint action are properly 
implemented 
the DPRK-U.S. talks will be able to proceed smoothly and the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula will be able to be 
resolved completely [kunwonjokuro]. The problem is that 
barriers [nangwan] should not be created by putting forth 
conditions. If barriers are created the situation will become 
grave again. 
  We want the United States not to create obstacles to the 
implementation of the agreement any longer. The people in the 
world, as well, hope that the agreement reached between the DPRK 
and the United States is implemented as it is and that, 
accordingly, the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is 
resolved peacefully. 
  However, acts are emerging now which arouse suspicions in 
implementing the DPRK-U.S. agreement on the measures for the 
joint action. In particular, Japan, not satisfied with the 
agreement between the DPRK and the United States, is kicking off 
a commotion, babbling that a special inspection should be 
conducted and the like. Japan is trying to hinder a solution to 
the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and, thus, is aiming 
at justifying its nuclear armament. Japan has stockpiled large 
quantities of plutonium and completed the means of delivery of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Now that Japan's nuclear armament has reached a very 
dangerous stage we cannot but enhance our alertness to this. It 
is because if Japan is armed with nuclear weapons the 
denuclearization of Northeast Asia cannot be realized nor will 
the declaration of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula be 
meaningful. Therefore, to achieve the overall denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula and the Northeast Asian region, Japan's 
nuclear armament must be thoroughly blocked. 
  Whether or not the agreement on the measures for the joint 
action is faithfully implemented depends entirely on the U.S. 
side. We will keenly watch the U.S. side's actions. If the 
U.S. side fails to implement the agreement with unwarranted 
pretexts we will take corresponding countermeasures against it. 
  The ambassador also revealed the South Korean authorities' 
crime of destroying the ecological environment and doing harm to 
people's health by dumping nuclear waste on sea. He then 
answered questions raised by reporters.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The Central South 
District Association of the headqarters of Koreans in China of 
the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification 
(Pomminnyon) in a statement February 28 denounced the 
treacherous scheme of the South Korean authorities to take 
Koreans residing in Sakhalin region, Russia, to South Korea by 
deceiving and alluring them in conspiracy with the Japanese 
Government. 
  The statement points out that this is not a mere 
humanitarian 
matter but a serious political problem of the Korean nation and 
compatriots and, at the same time, an international human right 
issue. It says the South Korean treacherous clique are 
committing a crime by violating the dignity and interests of the 
nation and human rights, hand in glove with the Japanese 
Government, though it has yet to make apology and compensation. 
  The statement points out that the South Korean authorities, 
under the mask of "humanitarianism," are trying to lay their 
foothold against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 
the Far East of Russia, sow the seed of dissension within the 
nation and foster confrontation, and thus perpetuate the 
division of the country. 
  The statement demands that the South Korean authorities 
promptly renounce the treacherous scheme and the Japanese 
authorities think first of their compensation to the Koreans 
overseas and no more do act obstructive to the reunification of 
Korea.

the Cuban Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification was 
held in Havana Cuba, on March 1. 
  The annual meeting reviewed the work of the committee last 
year and discussed tasks of this year. 
  Chairman Jesus Montane Oropesa in his speech said that last 
year the U.S. imperialists and the international reactionaries

achieved great victories by firmly uniting to smash the enemy's 
moves at every step. 
  The great leader comrade President Kim Il-song received the 
outgoing Cuban Ambassador to the DPRK Juan Jose Leon Vega, and 
gave him precious teachings and showed deep solicitude, he said, 
and pointed out: This is an expression of deep trust and love 
for the party, the government and the people of Cuba. 
  The friendly and cooperative relations between the two 
countries are developing on the basis of the special intimacy 
between the great leader comrade President Kim Il-song and 
Supreme Commander Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz, he noted, and 
stressed: The Cuban people would extend invariable support and 
solidarity to the Korean people in their efforts for the 
reunification of the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- A resolution on the 
situation of the Korean peninsula was adopted at the recent 5th 
plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of the Peoples of Spain. 
  The resolution said serious apprehensions have been roused 
worldwide as the United States, Japan, South Korea and some 
other quarters created a grave situation on the Korean peninsula 
on the pretext of the "North' nuclear problem". 
  It expressed support to the DPRK' position on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and dialogue, saying 
they affirm their solidarity for the DPRK's policy of peaceful 
reunification. 
  The National Executive Committee of the Mariateguista United 
Party of Peru adopted a resolution on the Korean question on 
March 1. The resolution said the "10-point programme of the 
great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the 
country" is a significant, highly important guideline for the 
reunification of the country. 
  Noting that it is the aspiration of the international 
community and the world people to eliminate all the nuclear 
weapons and realize the denuclearization of the whole world

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- Mass meetings were

the tasks put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song 
in his letter to the national agricultural conference "for the

  Reports were made by the chief secretaries of the provincial 
and municipal committees of the Workers' Party of Korea who are 
concurrently chairmen of the people's committees, to be followed

  The reporters and speakers stressed that the historic letter 
of President Kim Il-song to the national agricultural conference 
is a programmatic guideline clearly indicating the road of 
consolidating Korean-style socialism, powerfully demonstrating 
its force and finally solving the socialist rural question. 
  They said all the agricultural working people should be 
prepared more firmly in ideology and morality and in technique 
and culture as required by socialism through the development of 
the ideological and cultural revolutions in depth. 
  They stressed the need to steadily raise the level of the

  [Text] Pyongyang, march 12 (KCNA) -- Infinite loyalty to 
the illustrious leader definitely guarantees the continuity and 
accomplishment of the socialist cause, says MINJU CHOSON in a 
by-lined article today. The issue of succession to the 
leadership was successfully resolved a long time ago in our 
country when our people acclaimed dear Comrade Kim Chong-il as 
their illustrious leader, the article says, and goes on: 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, basing himself on his 
deep study of the fundamental principles and quintessence of the 
chuche idea founded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, 
formulated the guiding idea of the Workers' Party of Korea as an 
integral system of the idea, theory and method of chuche. He 
has enriched and comprehensively developed in depth the chuche 
idea with new fundamentals and contents as required by the 
present time and the developing revolution. And he has 
developed it to be the revolutionary idea of the popular masses 
both in name and in reality. 
  Thanks to the energetic ideological and theoretical 
activities of the dear leader, the treasurehouse of the chuche 
idea has been further developed and enriched and this idea has 
become the only correct guiding idea of the era of independence. 
And the people have made all their efforts to accomplish the 
cause of socialism with the faith and belief that when they are 
guided by the chuche idea, they will be able to complete the 
cause of independence. 
  The dear leader has raised it as the main point to 
strengthen 
the party and enhance its leadership role in the whole course of 
leading the cause of socialism, put forward a policy of party 
building for modelling the whole party on the chuche idea and 
directed the efforts for its thorough implementation. 
  He has set forth outstanding strategies and tactics and 
proper slogans in each period of our developing revolution and 
vigorously encouraged our people to carry out the party's line 
and policies and bring about world-startling miracles and 
innovations one after another in socialist economic and cultural 
construction. 
  Under his energetic guidance, our country has become a 
powerful socialist country with political independence and a 
mighty independent national economy and self-defence military 
power. 
  The dear leader has shaped magnanimous politics embracing 
all 
our people to achieve singlehearted unity of the society in 
which the entire people are united closely around the leader in 
the same thought and purpose and on the basis of morality and 
faithfulness. 
  His boundless love for and trust in our people have made 
them 
remain loyal and devoted to the party and the leader and fully 
display the beautiful communist traits throughout the country. 
  All our people are now striving hard for the accomplishment 
of the socialist cause, closely united around the dear leader, 
with the unshakable revolutionary faith that they will surely 
emerge victorious as they are guided by him.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 14 Mar (AKP) -- "I appeal to the Royal 
Government and the Khmer Royal Armed Forces, as well as the 
party of Democratic Kampuchea and its armed forces, to stop 
mining our nation's land -- immediately, totally, and 
definitively," His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk insisted in a 
10 March letter from Beijing. The letter, citing in particular 
the serious danger currently caused by land mines, stressed: 
  "It is a fact that our Cambodia has become the world 
champion 
as far as the number of invalids is concerned... Today there 
are more than 40,000 victims of mines and other explosives. To 
this number, without counting the dead, we should add another 
600 per month whose arms or legs are mutilated by explosions... 
Mine specialists -- both foreign and local -- estimate that 
nearly 10 million land mines have been laid in our poor 
motherland, while Cambodia's population is just 9 million... In 
their opinion, it would require 600 years -- or six centuries -- 
of work to clear all of these mines on our current small 
budget... Therefore, I appeal to the Royal Government and the 
Khmer Royal Armed Forces, as well as the party of Democratic 
Kampuchea and its armed forces, to stop mining our land -- 
immediately, totally, and definitively; to begin joint mine 
clearing operations; and to destroy completely all mines 
remaining in their stocks... I would like to thank the soldiers 
and/or the warriors of all parties in advance for their 
patriotism and their nobility in totally destroying the land 
mines so that our Cambodia and our Cambodian population can 
live."

  [Text] The Tokyo conference organized by the alliance in 
an attempt to get money to assist communist Vietnam to continue 
its aggression and occupation of Cambodia through the two-headed 
government, their common puppet, was a failure. 
  This conference failed because: 
  1. No country promised to provide aid to the two-headed 
government; 
  2. Only the United States, Japan, and Australia pledged to 
provide some aid. [sentence as heard] The two-headed government 
is not very hopeful that a significant amount of money is 
forthcoming even from these pledges. 
  At the previous Tokyo conference, these countries also made 
promises. In concrete terms, the money came in trickles. Many 
countries and international organization at the meeting proposed 
that peace and security be established first for their aid to be 
efficient. These countries made this proposal not believing 
that the two-headed government can carry out what they have 
proposed. 
  1. Who can the two-headed government convince about economic 
rehabilitation and Cambodia's reconstruction if its mouth talks 
about national reconstruction while its hands are constantly 
fueling the war of communist Vietnam? 
  2. How can national reconstruction take place when the 
government is so corrupt? What country, apart from bad elements 
in the alliance, is going to throw money into a bottomless pit? 
  These are the major reasons that cause the failure of the 
Tokyo conference.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of interview with President Suharto by Ruhut </F>
Sitompul, member of Indonesian National Youth Committee, in 
Jakarta on 12 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sitompul] Mr. President, I would like to thank you 
for giving me a chance to speak. I want to talk about the 
constitutional issue. As national youths, we all believe that 
you are a leader elected through constitutional means. Now we 
want to discuss the issue of the national leadership succession. 
Being your sons because we are from KNPI [National Youth 
Committee], I want to discuss your earlier remarks on the 
leadership succession, but first let me tell you that we are 
impressed by the detailed explanation you gave us on our 
national development stages. Our regeneration process is 
natural, not by passing the baton as in a foot race. The 
leadership mechanism proceeds smoothly every five years. 
Therefore, if the People's Consultative Assembly, our highly 
esteemed state institution, still wants you to serve as 
president after 1998 for the second long-term development plan, 
we beg you to be ready to serve for another term [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Suharto] In 1998, how old will I be? Seventy-seven years 
old, right? I have thought about it, [words indistinct]. 
However, we cannot stop the law of nature, which I must take 
into account [words indistinct]. 
  [Sitompul] But we pray to the almighty God for your ... 
  [Suharto, interrupting] [Laughs] Thank you. As I once said 
in the past, I knew nothing about economics, but now, the 
younger generation is smarter and faster in learning things. 
What did I do when I knew nothing about economics? I enlisted 
the assistance of economists like Mr. Wijoyo and his friends. I 
allowed them to carry out debates on economic matters, and I 
just listened to them. [laughter] After a few months, I began 
to take part in the discussions. Finally, because I had to make 
decisions, I began to learn things in a gradual way. We should 
not be discouraged, because God will certainly show us his way. 
Besides, our struggle still has a long way to go. 
  [Sitompul] We do not want to talk about the heir apparent 
issue, but in view of the leadership model that you have given 
all of us, the beloved Indonesian people, we hope that at least 
there will be somebody that will inherit your leadership 
qualities, because after 25 years or even 30 years, we do not 
want to see a new leader with new policies. We must firmly and 
resolutely adopt the Pancasila [five principles] ideology and 
the 1945 Constitution. 
  [Suharto] I think the system makes sense because what a 
president does is bound to be within the GBHN [Broad Outline of 
State Policy]. Therefore, if his actions are against the GBHN, 
or he wants to do as he wishes, he must be corrected, and the 
House of Representatives is entitled to summon him, but it is 
the MPR [People's Consultative Assembly] that is authorized to 
impeach him. So there is the safety valve system. We must 
admit that nobody is perfect, and everybody must do his share to 
help the country so that things will turn out smoothly. 
Therefore, we should not be alarmed, and my duty is to create a 
situation where everybody can work and show his achievements. 
People can produce achievements in different areas, and the MPR 
may begin to judge their performance and discuss them through 
their parliamentary factions. As you know, I will certainly not 
abandon our struggle in the second long-term development plan. 
  There are three main principles in the ABRI [Indonesian 
Armed 
Forces] leadership, and one of them is [words indistinct]. Even 
if during my absence, we must still adopt the principle of Tut 
Wuri Andayani [providing education to children by supporting 
them from behind], and we will never abandon our responsibility 
to our nation's struggle. Let us pray to God for his blessings. 
Thank you, and peace be upon you.

Only after I deliver my accountability (before the people's 
congress) will I step down," He was quoted by the Indonesian 
Ulemas Council (MUI) Chairman Hasan Basri as saying. 
  Hasan Basri together with Azhar Bashir, chairman of the 
Islamic Organisation Muhammadiyah and Ilyas Rukiat of the 
Islamic Propagation Council (DDI), met with the president to 
discuss problem on how to determine the first day of the Arabic 
Shawal month, 1414 Hegira. Basri said that the president 
reiterated the remarks in response to the concern of Moslems in 
the country that he will step down before his tenure of 
presidential office is completed in 1998. 
  Moslems in Indonesia raised concern over the matter 
following 
the remarks of a US author, Donald Wilson, who said in Jakarta 
recently that Suharto knew well when he steps down. Wilson's 
remarks provoked speculations that President Suharto will step 
down before his term of office is completed, the MUI chairman 
said. "Please do not try to engineer unclear things," the 
president was quoted by Hasan Basri as saying. 
  The president said that the People's Consultative Assembly 
(MPR) will find the correct new president in the future. "It is 
illogical if the MPR cannot elect a new president among the 180 
million," the president told the Ulemas. 
  On the occasion the president expressed hope that Ulemas 
would reach a common consensus on the first day of Shawal, 1414 
Hegira. He asked the Ulemas to make their best in order that 
Moslems in the country can celebrate and say their 'id al-fitr 
prayers on the same day. In the past years, there had been 
differing views among the Ulemas on the first day of Shawal that 
Moslems celebrated it not on the same day.

  [Text] Jakarta, March 12 (ANTARA) -- President Suharto said 
here Saturday that he had never had the ambition to become a 
president for life because he was aware of his age and ability. 
"I am not ambitious to serve as president for life," the 
president said in a dialog with members of National Youth 
Committee (KNPI). He said that the People's Consultative 
Assembly (MPR) must be able to find a new president. 
  During the dialogue, a KNPI member requested that the head 
of 
state be ready to serve another five year term after his current 
presidential tenure expires in 1998. In response to the 
proposal, the president said: "Please count how old I am at that 
time (he was born in 1921 ed.) this must be taken into account." 
He said that the law of the nature must be considered, referring 
to the decreasing ability of a person due to old age. "God will 
provide guidance. Moreover, children today are clever," the 
head of state said. 
  When another KNPI member suggested that the president 
prepare 
a "crown" in order to keep the state policies unchanged even if 
there is a change in the state leadership, Suharto said that it 
would not happen as long as the MPR decrees are implemented well. 
  On the occasion the president reiterated that he would not 
step down before the completion of his constitutional tenure in 
1998.

  [Text] Indonesia has called on the United States not to 
reenact the Super 301 trade law. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas 
told reporters in Jakarta today that a trade law like Super 310 
should not be imposed because it amounts to an unilateral act. 
The U.S. policy of reenacting the trade law has also been 
criticized by France. French Industry and Foreign Trade 
Minister Gerard Longuet said the U.S. decision was unjustifiable 
as it was directed against a certain nation like Japan. 
  According to Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, it is improper for 
the United States to use political, military, and financial 
influence to serve its business interests. Minister Ali Alatas 
swore in the consuls general of the Republic of Indonesia for 
New York and Berlin in Jakarta this afternoon. Accordingly, the 
minister asked the Consulate General of the Republic of 
Indonesia in New York to consistently monitor any problems in 
relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the United 
States, including the issue of workers, to maintain good 
bilateral relations.

  [Text] Jakarta, March 13 (ANTARA) -- The protectionist 
trade practices of some developed countries should be countered 
by Indonesia through market diversification, opportunities for 
which are abundant, a senior trade official said. Rudy Lengkong, 
head of the National Agency for Export Development (BPEN), was 
commenting on reports that the United States was threatening to 
revive its "Super 301" Trade Act and apply it to countries 
Washington believes are guilty of unfair trade practices toward 
the U.S. 
  Lengkong said many countries other than the protectiomist 
developed ones, were still "wide open" for Indonesian goods. 
"We should widen our marketing reach among the developing 
countries, in other words: diversify our markets," he said. The 
Latin American countries, former communist countries in Eastern 
Europe and Middle Eastern countries were potential markets for 
Indonesian products, he added. 
  Meanwhile , business circles in Jakarta said Indonesia 
should 
diversify its overseas markets not only in response to the 
protectionism of certain developed countries but also because 
its traditional foreign markets were suffering from a protracted 
recession. 
  Previously Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had said the United 
States should no longer use its Super 301 Trade Act against its 
trade partner because such action would not be in line with the 
GATT's (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Uruguay Round 
accords. "Super 301 should no longer be used since the Uruguay 
Round of GATT has duly provided for certain clauses governing 
settlement of disputes among countries," Alatas said. 
  Lengkong said Indonesia should be working hard to accomplish 
the diversification of its markets and reduce its dependence on 
its traditional markets. 
  According to private business observers, Indonesia is 
lagging 
far behind its partners in ASEAN (Associatcon of South East 
Asian Nations) where export market diversification is concerned.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Total foreign investment 
commitments, which more than tripled to US$1.57 billion from

  [Text] Jakarta, Mar 12 (ANTARA) -- The low growth rate of 
the country's textile and textile product exports in 1993 was 
mainly caused by an oversupply of such commodities on the 
foreign market as a result of the world recession, Industry 
Minister Tunky Ariwibowo has said. 
  Ariwibowo told the press after a meeting with President 
Suharto here on Saturday that the country's textile and textile 
product exports for all of last year were valued at 5.8995 
billion US dollars, an increase of 0.01 percent from the 
previous year's figure. 
  Compared with other export commodities such as wood and 
rubber, of which exports increased by 37 percent and 148 percent 
respectively, the growth rate of textile and textile product 
exports was very low, the minister said. 
  The oversupply of products had caused consumers to buy 
products which had been already stored at warehouses as 
merchandise, leading to slow trade in new products, he said. He 
also attributed the slow growth rate of Indonesia's textile and 
textile product exports to the entry of China's textile to the 
United States, the appreciation of Japanese yen against the US 
dollars besides the emergency of new textile exporting countries. 
  To boost the growth rate of textile and textile product 
exports, which currently become one of the prime foreign 
exchange earners, the government and textile producers should 
take various steps, including making immediate adjustments to 
new developments occurring in the world market. 
  Tunky also reported to the head of state on the development 
of domestic electronic industries. According to the minister, 
the export of electronic goods in 1993 reached a record high of 
1.1 billion US dollars but the import of electronic components 
increased to 800 million US dollars in the same year. The 
electronic components included cathode ray tubes, special 
components of radios and tape recorders as well as capacitors, 
he said. 
  He said the government should encourage foreign electronic 
component manufacturers to relocate their plants in Indonesia as 
part of efforts to keep down the import of electronic 
components. The relocation of the electronic component 
industries in Indonesia would be successful if their products 
were bought by export-oriented companies, he said.

<F P=106> [By Yindi Loetcharoenchok] </F>
  [Text] Lao leaders yesterday warmly welcomed investment 
from Thailand, saying the landlocked nation is blessed with 
abundant natural resources and economic potential which are 
awaiting development that would be of mutual benefit. 
  At a conference in Vientiane yesterday, senior members of 
the 
Lao government spelt out a range of incentives to attract 
foreign investment. They include foreign investment laws; 
customs and taxation; flexible rules and regulations; and a 
number of bilateral Lao-Thai economic and investment agreements, 
such as agreements on trade and on investment promotion and 
protection, as a basic guarantor to Thai investors. 
  While they expressed a strong desire to develop the 
country's 
natural resources to improve its ailing economy, they repeatedly 
stressed that Laos' arts and culture, ecology and environment 
will remain intact and well preserved. 
  The calls were made yesterday during a conference in 
Vientiane on "The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge: Economic and 
Investment Prospects in the Lao PDR" which was organized by THE 
NATION ahead of the official opening of the Mittraphap bridge 
early next month. Lao PM's Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon 
inaugurated the conference while Thai Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai Wirawan gave a keynote speech on prospects for Lao-Thai 
economic cooperation. 
  Phao said his country of 4.4 million people is full of 
natural resources, and has stable political and social systems, 
which are conducive for foreign investment. He called on Thai 
business people to probe Laos' economic potential, especially in 
the fields of agriculture and forestry, industry and services 
for local and external needs. Laos' new market-oriented economic 
policy, he said, has received full support from the private and 
government sectors of friendly nations, especially Thailand 
which "has warmly extended its assistance and cooperation" to 
Laos. 
  Amnuai warned Thai businessmen and investors not to exploit 
the resources in Laos or other neighboring countries for 
short-term gains. He said traders and investors should always 
bear in mind the "philosophy of cooperation," which purports 
"mutual benefits" and "fairness in profit sharing" with host 
countries. He said the cooperation should provide "sufficient 
economic returns" to host countries including the transfer of 
technology and management know-how so that they will eventually 
stand on their own feet. 
  Lao-Thai cooperation will contribute and lead to broader 
sub-regional and regional economic cooperation, which is 
developing under the structure of the four northern Mekong-rim 
countries in the Quadrangle Economic Cooperation and the 
Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Amnuai said. 
  He said he believed the opening of the Lao-Thai Friendship 
Bridge across the Mekong River by His Majesty the King on April 
8 will set a new era of bilateral relations and cooperation. 
  About 250 people attended the conference yesterday at the 
Lan 
Xang Hotel, including 140 Thai businessmen and investors, about 
30 representatives of the Lao private sector and officials from 
various key Laos economic ministries. 
  Among the Lao delegates were six deputy ministers from key 
economic ministries and offices who gave a broader perspective 
of Laos' economic and investment potential and outlined national 
foreign investment laws, incentives, rules and regulations. 
  Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice president of the National 
Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC), discussed Laos' 
economic development plan towards the year 2000, while another 
CPC vice president Leuan Sombounkhan talked about national 
foreign investment policies. 
  Somphong said the new eight-year economic development plan 
was implemented in February 1993 with the objective of boosting 
the country's financial capital by developing its own natural 
resources in the fields of minerals, hydropower, tourism, 
agriculture and forestry, husbandry and human resources. 
  Rural development has been the government's priority in 
order 
to bridge the economic disparity and to distribute wealth to 
provide better living conditions and standards around the 
country, he said. Vientiane has set an economic growth target of 
7-8 per cent annually. 
  Leuan said Laos is open to investors from around the world, 
but that Thailand has an advantage due to its territorial 
proximity and racial and cultural similarities. 
  He acknowledged several shortcomings that have hindered 
economic growth, such as a shortage of capital markets, 
manpower, lack of economic expertise and technology, and poor 
management systems. 
  He described in detail an 11-point incentive program, which 
Vientiane has introduced to attract prospective investors. They 
include opening investment in all economic fields including 
human resources in the fields of academia, education and 
culture; protecting against nationalization; three different 
forms of investment, from contract agreements to joint ventures, 
or 100 percent foreign investment; full repatriation of personal 
and corporate assets; freedom from government intervention in 
investments; recruitment of foreign labor and human resources; 
repatriation of profits; and a certain period of relaxation of 
income and profit taxes and the establishment of a "one-stop 
service" to facilitate investments. 
  Four other Lao ministers gave a good perspective of 
investment in Laos. They stressed that Vientiane has pursued an 
economic policy of sustainable development for mutual benefits 
with the aim of protecting its culture, social structure, 
environment and ecology.

  [Text] VIENTIANE -- The Laotian National Assembly is 
considering changes in its laws to encourage foreign investment 
to the country. The assembly on Wednesday began a six-day 
meeting during which members will debate legal amendments 
approved recently by Cabinet, including a proposal to allow the 
setting up of an industrial estate. A senior Laotian official 
said yesterday the proposed amendments would provide more 
incentives for foreign investors in Laos, mostly Thais. 
  Proposed changes included allowing businessmen longer tenure 
on rented land. "Businessmen are authorized to transfer the 
rental right to a third party -- which is not provided for in 
the present foreign investment law," he said. Businesses would 
not need to try to buy the land, because the lease period would 
be for up to 99 years, more than adequate for business planning. 
The amendments would also provide more protection for foreign 
investors. 
  It is proposed to establish an industrial estate, partly 
because Laotian authorities are understaffed and already 
hard-pressed to monitor the 40-odd foreign industries already 
operating in Laos. "To have them in the same location will make 
our work easier and will also be to their advantage as the 
government will certainly develop necessary infrastructure and 
facilities in the estate," he said. 
  The first industrial estate is expected to be developed 
about 
30 kilometers north of Vientiane, on the way to Nam Ngum dam, if 
President Nouhak Phoumsavan announces approval. The official 
said the planned estate will not be located near Vientiane, to 
avoid polluting the capital. 
  Leuan Sombounkhan, vice president of the committee for 
planning and co-operation, told THE NATION that tax incentives 
would be given to businesses which locate in industrial estates. 
  The National Assembly conference is presided over by Saman 
Vi- gnaket, a member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party 
central committee and president of the National Assembly. The 
opening was attended by Prime Minister Gen. Khamtai Siphandon 
President Nouhak and other Politburo members, National Assembly 
members and Cabinet members. In his opening address, Saman told 
the assembly the world situation could have both favorable and 
complicated effects on national development and security. 
  "The world's people, especially those of developing and 
less- 
developed countries, struggle to safeguard their political 
independence while focusing efforts on socio-economic 
development to improve living conditions," the official quoted 
Saman as saying. 
  In Southeast Asia the emerging trend was towards peace, 
stability and co-operation between nations, which would 
facilitate national development.

<F P=106> ["Thai Talk" column by Suthichai Yun: "Laos sets its own </F>
timetable for change"] 
  [Text] Vientiane -- "Laos is still listed as one of the 
most underdeveloped countries in the world. Our roads are bad. 
Our phone system doesn't work. Our flights are inadequate. 
But nature is on our side. That's why you should come in now 
or you may miss the bus..." This was not meant as a threat to 
Thai investors. Nor was it an overstatement about Laos' 
abundant opportunities. The senior Lao official was stressing 
to a group of about 150 Thai businessmen here over the weekend 
that this landlocked country of 4.3 million people is in a hurry 
to revise all its investment laws to attractive foreign 
investors. But the pace of jumping headlong into a free market 
economy will be determined by the Laotians, not foreign 
investors. 
  The new breed of Lao leaders, a mixture of French-educated 
intellectuals well exposed to the capitalist system and those 
with socialist training from the former Soviet Union who had 
fought the Americans from their caves in the northeast in the 
1960s, is all set to embark on the path of modernization. 
  "We must face the facts. We don't have the technology. We 
don't have the capital. We don't have the management skills. 
We don't have the marketing experience. But we do have natural 
resources and the will to move ahead and open our country open," 
intones one of the young leaders in charge of drawing up "Laos 
in the Year 2000." 
  The plan represents an ambitious attempt to put Laos on the 
world's economic map. But there have been hiccups. "Some 
critics say our development plans are too much like Thailand's. 
Well, all economic plans have to start somewhere, based on 
certain elementary factors. But I am sure that ours will not be 
exactly like Thailand's plan. For example, our rural 
development plan will be different. Ours will work -- meaning 
that we won't allow the gap between the urban and rural areas to 
be a wide as that in Thailand," another senior official says. 
  The tone of self-confidence is unmistakable. So is the keen 
awareness to avoid Thailand's blunder of allowing a single 
foreign country to dominate its economic landscape. In this 
connection, the traditional love-hate relationship between 
Thailand and Laos has been invoked, albeit very subtly, by local 
critics here, in the wake of the onslaught of Thai investments 
pouring into Laos in the past few years. 
  Thailand's investments in Laos now stand at 47 per cent, the 
single biggest in this category. And the pattern is changing 
dramatically -- from small traders moving goods across the 
Mekong River to multinational firms based in Thailand winning 
major contracts in construction, mining, forestry, finance and 
all facets of the economy. 
  The Thai presence is overwhelming. Anti-Thai feelings may 
not have surfaced in any significant degree just yet. But the 
danger has been lurking. As a Thai academic who took part in a 
seminar here on "Thai-Lao Bridge: Economic and Investment 
Prospects in Laos" organized by Nation Publishing Group 
suggested: 
  "I can't help but look back 20 years and find a very close 
resemblance of how Japan came into Thailand as the biggest 
single foreign investor. We wanted Japan's capital and 
technology. But we didn't like the way they behaved towards us. 
We were against the Japanese but deep inside we envied their 
success as an economic power. That's what's happening in 
Vientiane when we talk about Thai investors in Laos..." 
  In private conversations, Laotian leaders would readily 
admit 
that attempts are being made to preempt such negative 
side-effects in the wake of their vigorous push to race against 
time to build up its economic infrastructure. Inevitably, 
Thailand, with clear advantages over other countries in this 
respect, has become the first to ride the wave of foreign 
investments in this country. 
  "We must face the facts. Whether we like it or not, we will 
have to deal with the Thais, yesterday, today or tomorrow. 
There is no escaping the fact that we are close neighbours and 
Thailand is further advanced than Laos and once we open the gate 
it is only natural that our big and rich neighbours would be the 
first to knock at our door. That's why our initial efforts will 
be to accommodate Thai investors, the good ones of course," said 
another senior official responsible for attracting foreign 
investors into Laos. 
  Some "bad investors" have been punished and ostracised. But 
"good investors" aren't easy to come by. They tend to be more 
demanding, posing tough questions and seeking guarantees on 
investment that the Laotian authorities aren't quite ready yet 
to offer in clear terms. The bad guys would come in on any 
terms, hoping to earn a quick buck, exploiting Laos' resources 
to the hilt but the real, solid ones are more cautious, waiting 
in the wings, weighing the pros and cons to decide whether to 
spend the same amount of money in Laos or Vietnam or Cambodia. 
The choice is never easy considering the varying degrees of 
uncertainty in all the three Indochinese countries. 
  But some "big names" from Thailand have arrived, waving 
their 
drafts of MoUs, or "Memorandums of Understanding", as a way to 
test the waters. Thai banks have made inroads in Vientiane and 
Thai construction companies have lobbied hard to win contracts 
through some complicated rules which require both a good 
understanding of how things are done and who to talk to before 
gaining entry into the game. 
  "Everything is negotiable," declared a top Laotian official 
in charge of drawing up the ground rules for foreign investors, 
responding to the growing complaints from Thai businessmen about 
unclear laws and regulations on a number of areas of investments. 
  The pledge to apply flexibility in all areas might have come 
as good news to some. But the same statement also spells chaos 
and disorder. "If everything can be discussed, it also means 
that what applies today may not apply the following day or vice 
versa," a Thai trader says. 
  The teething problems will be there for sometime. But one 
should not interpret the new sense of compromise as a gesture of 
weakness. The fierce sense of political independence which has 
been the hallmark of Laos' political philosophy through the Cold 
War remains as strong as ever. Any adjustments in its political 
structure will only come very slowly and after very careful 
consideration. 
  "We are quite convinced that our present political structure 
of a one-party system is ideal for us. But changes will come if 
we consider them appropriate. For example, our parliament, 
which used to be a very quiet and inactive body, has lately been 
activated. House debates are a common theme and newspapers in 
Laos now have become more critical about issues that affect the 
country..." the same official says. 
  The wind of change has arrived but this tiny country of calm 
and restraint appears determined to proceed at its own pace and 
with its own style. If Laos appeared to have picked up speed in 
recent years, that was only because Laos wants to make sure that 
it is not left far too much behind. 
  As one local resident told me: "We have been left behind for 
so long that we have to run very fast indeed just to remain 
where we are..."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
was asked about a report that the Khmer Rouge had forced Thai 
gem-miners out of Cambodia. He said that there has been no 
information to that effect given to the Foreign Ministry and he 
would like to check the accuracy of the report before answering 
newsmen. However, he said that it is the policy of the Thai 
Government that no Thai workers engage in trade with the Khmer 
Rouge. He noted that from what happened in the past, the Khmer 
Rouge provided facilities for Thai residents. 
  Asked about U.S. sanctions against three Thai companies with 
workers in Libya, he said the United States claimed that the 
three companies were helping Libya set up a chemical weapons 
production plant. The foreign minister said that U.S. 
ambassador to Thailand David Lambertson had already met and 
consulted with him on the matter. Prasong said the ambassador 
confirmed that the sanctions were against the three companies 
only and do not apply to other Thai companies or the Thai people.

  [Text] Thailand and the United States are scheduled to 
resume negotiations on aviation rights in Washington on April 
5-6, Thai Airways International [THAI] president Thamnun Wangli 
said at the weekend. This is considered the first move after a 
four-year impasse during which there has been no formal 
agreement. 
  The Thai delegation will be led by Mahidon Chantharangkun, 
permanent secretary of the Ministry of Transport and 
Communication; Sisuk Chantharangsu, director-general of the 
Civil Aviation Department, and Mr Thamnun along with THAI 
marketing and corporate planning staff. 
  Mr Thamnun declined to reveal the Thai position in the 
negotiations. 
  Currently THAI flies to the US four times, Bangkok to Los 
Angeles. US airlines Delta, Northwest and United operate a 
total of 21 flights a week to Bangkok. Flight routing and 
capacity levels are still at 1991 levels despite significant 
economic changes in the region. 
  Mr Thamnun said THAI had no plan to increase flights to the 
US in the short term, especially this summer while it tries to 
expand domestic service and develop other new routes. 
  An informed source in the Ministry of Transport and 
Communication said the US wants to increase flights to Bangkok 
now that the embargo against Vietnam has been lifted. 
Washington expects a lot more US tourists and businesspeople 
will want to travel to Vietnam via Bangkok. 
  As well, American Airlines is eying the Southeast Asia 
market, into which it wants to expand in a big way. The conflict 
began in 1990 with a difference of opinion between Thailand and 
the US on allocating a reasonable number of flights between the 
two countries. Washington supports an "open skies" approach in 
which US carriers can freely increase the volume of passengers 
and cargo to Thailand. Thailand believes in the principle of 
"capacity predetermination". 
  THAI believes "open skies" will hurt Thailand, because the 
US 
has more capacity to accommodate vast numbers of passengers and 
cargo on its many airlines. 
  The US-Thailand route is considered very lucrative since it 
includes significant stopover points such as Tokyo, Taipei and 
Seoul.

  [Text] Imposition of US Super 301 trade measures on Japan 
will not affect Thai exports, according to CP [Charoen Phokphan] 
Inter-trade Group deputy managing director Phonsin 
Phacharintanakun. Mr. Phonsin said the law, which is not 
concerned with Thai industrial products, will take a long time 
to come into effect. 
  Thai products exported to Japan are primarily semi-processed 
goods or raw materials which are subsequently used to produce 
other exports for the U.S. He said imposition of the law 
contradicts the GATT agreement which will come into effect in 
1995. 
  He believes there is ample time for the U.S. to resolve the 
conflict. The move is considered to be a political gesture 
after negotiations hit a snag. In the short run, Thailand does 
not have to adjust its export and international trade 
strategies, he said. But the Government and the private sector 
should follow development of the issue closely. 
  He agreed with the move by the Committee on Raising 
Thailand's Competitiveness, which is chaired by Deputy Prime 
Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak, to determine the country's 
long-term trade strategies.

  [Text] The foreign minister has reiterated that the Thai 
Government has no relations with the Khmer Rouge [KR] as charged 
by the United States ambassador to Thailand. 
  Commenting on the statement of the U.S. ambassador at a 
Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand dinner that the Thai 
Government still maintained ties with the Khmer Rouge, which 
continue to wage battles with the Cambodian Government, Foreign 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said he has already 
explained to the ambassador that the Thai Government only 
maintains diplomatic ties with Cambodia's legitimate government. 
The Thai Government has moreover complied with the UN 
resolution banning border trading with the Khmer Rouge. He said 
if there are any more comments to that effect, he will invite 
that person to check the situation at the place itself. 
However, he added, the Cambodian Government has not declared 
the Khmer Rouge faction as outlaws.

  [Text] U.S. Ambassador David Lambertson's remarks on 
Thailand's alleged ongoing contacts with the Khmer Rouge have 
irked the Foreign Ministry and the Army. Foreign Minister 
Prasong Sunsiri yesterday expressed "surprise" that the envoy 
had chosen to go public with his remarks instead of conveying 
his message directly to him when they met on Monday. While 
refusing to comment directly on Mr. Lambertson's statement, Army 
Chief Gen. Wimon Wongwanit said he felt "deeply bitter" after 
hearing the accusation. 
  The sour reaction by Mr. Prasong and Gen. Wimon was sparked 
by Ambassador Lambertson's speech at the Foreign Correspondents' 
Club of Thailand on Thursday night, when he expressed concern 
over the alleged ongoing cross-border contacts between Thailand 
and the Khmer Rouge, saying the U.S. wanted the Khmer Rouge to 
be isolated. The U.S. envoy also questioned the implementation 
of Thailand's policy which "has at times been less than clear." 
  Foreign Minister Prasong conceded that cross-border contacts 
with the Khmer Rouge continued due to the close relations 
between Thais and members of the Khmer Rouge which were forged a 
long time ago. But he insisted that the contacts had nothing to 
do with the Government because Thailand had sealed the border 
and banned trade with the guerrilla faction in accordance with a 
resolution of the United Nations Security Council. 
  "We honored the resolution of the United Nations Security 
Council," Sqn. Ldr. Prasong reiterated. "But the fact that the 
Khmer Rouge have maintained contacts with people in the area is 
due to their relations from the past," he added. The UN Security 
Council issued a resolution early last year requiring countries 
neighboring Cambodia [to] close the border and stop trading with 
the Khmer Rouge. The Foreign Minister said he was surprised as 
to why the U.S. envoy did not raise his concerns over the border 
contacts with him when the two met at the Foreign Ministry on 
Monday. 
  Mr. Lambertson accompanied Assistant Secretary of State for 
Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck on a visit 
to the Foreign Ministry. 
  Sqn. Ldr. Prasong seemed to be furious at complaints filed 
by 
other countries that Thailand maintains contacts with the 
guerrilla faction, so much so that he raised the matter with 
Australian Ambassador to Thailand John McCarthy, who called on 
him yesterday. The Foreign Minister even challenged those who 
made the allegation to visit the border with him to clarify 
their suspicions. "From now I will invite any individual or 
groups who make allegations against Thailand to inspect the 
border with me so they can see the facts with their own eyes," 
he said. Sqn. Ldr. Prasong said the Khmer Rouge has not been 
outlawed and continues to have contact with the Cambodian 
government. 
  Gen. Wimon said the allegation that the Thai military was 
still backing the Khmer Rouge made him feel bitter. Gen. Wimon 
said the allegation, though incorrect, was accepted as the truth 
by a number of people who did not know any better. "We have to 
have faith in Thai people and the army by not believing the 
allegations made by other countries," said the 59-year old 
commander. 
  The army commander made the comment while in Lop Buri 
Province, where he inspected an army exercise conducted by the 
2nd Cavalry Division in Phatthana Nikhom District. "We feel 
deeply bitter over such an allegation," the army commander said. 
Gen. Wimon said the Thai army had lost a large number of 
soldiers while doing their duties along the Thai-Cambodian 
border. 
  The last incident occurred early this week when a new army 
officer who just graduated from the Chunlachomklao Military 
Academy died when Khmer Rouge guerrillas and Phnom Penh forces 
fought a brief battle on Thai territory. He said the army 
officer died when he stepped on a booby-trap planted near the 
border. "This young officer died as a result of fighting between 
the two Khmer groups," said Gen. Wimon. "They (Cambodians) have 
caused a lot of suffering to us," said the commander. He said 
that the army would adopt stiffer military measures to deal with 
the problem along the border area. 
  Commenting on US Ambassador David Lambertson's statement 
expressing concern that the Thai military still had contact with 
the Khmer Rouge, Gen. Wimon refused to be drawn into an 
argument. He urged reporters to raise the question instead with 
Ambassador Lambertson who made the allegation. 
  A colonel attached to the Army Secretary said the army would 
not comment on the ambassador's statement, saying that it was 
the duty of the Foreign Ministry. The officer admitted that a 
number of senior army officers were surprised to learn of the 
ambassador's comments. They said they found it hard to believe 
that he would actually make such a statement.

  [Text] During their two-hour stopover at Don Muang Airport 
on the way home from Japan, Cambodian Co-prime Ministers Samdech 
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen held talks with Foreign Minister 
Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri on various issues including the 
international conference on the reconstruction of Cambodia held 
recently in Japan. 
  After the meeting, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri said the two Cambodian leaders rejected the report on 
Thailand's support for the Khmer Rouge [KR]. They said the 
report was unreliable and released by Cambodians who did not 
hold important positions and that the Cambodian Government has 
warned them against spreading such accusations. The foreign 
minister said Thailand still adheres to the policy of 
noninvolvement with the Khmer Rouge and supports the elected 
government. The Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri said: 
  [Begin Prasong recording] I would like to reaffirm that this 
government supports the elected government of Cambodia and not 
any other faction. I stressed this stand during my meeting with 
the two prime ministers and told them that Thailand is willing 
to support their elected government in the reconstruction of 
Cambodia as before. We spoke frankly to each other. [end

  [Text] Army Commander in Chief Gen. Wimon Wongwanit 
yesterday vowed to take tough action against Khmer guerrillas if 
they trespassed on Thai soil if the government gives the 
go-ahead. Wimon said people should not believe that the Army was 
still supporting the Khmer Rouge. "Thai people should believe 
that the Thai Army is not involved in the fighting between 
Cambodia's rival factions. They should understand that the Army 
would never support the Khmer Rouge," he said. 
  Wimon said many Thai soldiers had lost their lives helping 
to 
clear land mines planted by Cambodian factions along the border. 
"It's not worth it losing (our soldiers). If the government 
agrees with the Army to push back Cambodian intruders, we will 
be ready to use tough measures against them." The Thai military 
has complained that spillover of battles in Cambodian into 
Thailand has become common. But the Thai soldiers have refrained 
from drastic action. 
  Asked if he would talk with the Cambodian government about 
the issue, Wimon said he had nothing to talk about anymore. 
"I'll adopt a tougher stance against (Cambodian soldiers who 
intrude into Thai territory)," he said. 
  American Ambassador to Thailand David Lambertson said 
recently he wanted to see the Khmer Rouge cut off. He said the 
government's policy on this was very clear but implementation of 
that policy at times was not. "Whether and to what degree the 
old relationship between the Thai military and the Khmer Rouge 
is still being maintained has been a continuing concern of the 
United States," Lambertson said. 
  Cambodian General Khin Yean said in Kon Kreal on Sunday that 
the Thai military had "helped fresh Khmer Rouge troops come 
through Thai soil from Pailin". 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday reaffirmed that 
Thailand's policy toward the Khmer Rouge closely followed the 
1993 UN Security Council resolution. Responding to Lambertson's 
comments on Thailand's continued cross-border contacts with the 
Khmer Rouge, he said the country had sealed off border crossing 
points and stopped border trade with the Marxist group.

  [Excerpt] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Wimon Wongwanit 
yesterday emotionally reminded U.S. Ambassador David Lambertson 
that Thailand was a sovereign state and it was totally 
unacceptable for any foreigner to make groundless accusations 
against her. "The Foreign Ministry will not give in to any 
condemnation which is totally groundless. I consider that we 
are a sovereign nation and no one has the right to condemn us 
like this," said the army commander. He was speaking after 
presiding over a funeral ceremony at Wat Sommanatwihan of an 
army officer killed by a Khmer landmine at the border in Ubon 
Ratchathani. 
  The army commander made the remark after being asked by 
reporters to comment on Mr. Lambertson's statement on Wednesday 
about Thai military contacts with the Khmer Rouge. Gen. Wimon, 
however, said that the U.S. embassy here has clarified the 
ambassador's statement and denied the press report which quoted 
the ambassador as saying that the Thai military was still 
backing the Khmer Rouge. 
  Gen. Wimon said if a statement is made by an ambassador it 
must hold some truth. "The U.S. ambassador denied that he made 
such an allegation. I don't know how the press could go ahead 
and publish it when he (the U.S. ambassador) said he did not 
make the allegation," said Gen. Wimon. 
  Asked about Ambassador Lambertson's call asking the military 
to sever its contacts with the Communist Khmer Rouge, Gen. Wimon 
asked reporters whether the U.S. Government could bar Mexicans 
from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. "Can they do that? It 
could not be done as the common border is quite long. I'm a 
Thai and have dignity and would not allow anyone to criticize us 
without a basis. We have our own dignity," said the army 
commander. 
  Gen. Wimon said he feels bitter whenever he learns that Thai 
people have started believing in allegations made by foreigners. 
He said despite making it clear on several occasions on the 
neutrality of the Thai military over the conflict in Cambodia, 
outsiders have not stopped making such allegations against the 
Thai military. "If you reporters don't believe in what I say 
then it's time you stopped asking me any more questions," said 
the general. 
  When asked to comment on the border situation along the 
Khmer 
Rouge stronghold in Pailin concerning reports that Phnom Penh 
was rushing reinforcements to the area in preparation for a new 
offensive, Gen. Wimon quipped: "Ask the U.S. ambassador. He 
might be able to comment." 
  Meanwhile, Army secretary Maj. Gen. Chaturit Phromsakha Na 
Sakonnakhon also said that the U.S. ambassador had clarified the 
matter with the army over his remarks. Maj. Gen. Chaturit said 
the ambassador denied press reports quoting him as saying that 
the military is still backing the Khmer Rouge guerrillas. "That 
is not true," said Maj. Gen. Chaturit. "The U.S. government does 
not believe that the Thai Government or the Thai military still 
backs the Khmer Rouge." 
  He said the misquoted report dispatched by some foreign news 
agencies could cause a misunderstanding and tarnish the 
country's image. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time To Show the World the KR Have Been Cut </F>
Off"] 
  [Excerpts] With Vietnam's huge army pressing against the 
border, the Thai government's decision in 1979 to join the 
international effort to resuscitate the Khmer Rouge seemed like 
prudent thinking. The radical group had the world's reluctant 
backing and while Bangkok was aware of the Mao-inspired madness 
that had gripped Cambodia over the previous three years, the 
decision to help the group was justifiable in the service of 
Thailand's national interest. [passage omitted] 
  The Khmer Rouge which boycotted the election continues to 
wage war against the internationally-recognized government in 
Phnom Penh and most of the world still believes they are 
receiving support from venal Thai generals. [passage omitted] 
  Part of Thailand's image problem stems from the way the 
international press covered the Cambodian election. While the 
Khmer Rouge were belligerent and uncooperative, refusing to take 
part in the election, massacring ethnic Vietnamese and holding 
UN officials hostage, they were for the most part a sideshow. 
The real story was the murderous war the Cambodian People's 
Party was waging against Funcinpec. Nevertheless, foreign 
audiences, who for the most part had been introduced to the 
Cambodia tragedy by the 1984 movie "The Killing Fields", seemed 
to only want to know about the Khmer Rouge. 
  The result was acutely embarrassing for Thailand. The 
military's support for the Khmer Rouge, which had been an open 
secret in Southeast Asia for more than 10 years, was dredged up 
and examined for international consumption. The close business 
links, the Khmer Rouge safe houses, border sanctuaries, the 
rapacious logging and gem mining operations, it all came out and 
did little to support Thai claims that it was working for peace 
in Cambodia. [passage omitted] 
  The issue was rekindled once again on Wednesday when U.S. 
Ambassador to Thailand David Lambertson bluntly said Washington 
wants "the Khmer Rouge to be cut off." The envoy noted that the 
policy of the Thai government was very clear but, citing the 
massive arms cache found near the border in December, said the 
"implementation of that policy has been less than clear" 
  Lambertson's comments provoked furious denials from the 
Foreign Ministry but it seems unlikely the noises coming out of 
Bangkok are going to alter the world's perception of its 
relationship with the Khmer Rouge -- at least as long as 
well-founded reports continue to come out of Cambodia of cross 
border incursions. In the coming days, many observers expect the 
Cambodian army to launch a fierce assault on the Khmer Rouge's 
main base at Pailin, which sits across the Thai border. 
  The timber and gem-rich district is the main commercial 
center for the rebels. And for many observers it also typifies 
the uncomfortably cosy relationship between Thai businessmen, 
the Khmer Rouge and Thai military officers who oversee the 
border area. Army chief Gen. Wimon Wongwanit has vowed to 
repulse any Khmer Rouge intrusions that result from the 
offensive if the government gives its approval. His approach is 
the correct one. While it is not a Thai fight, the Khmer Rouge 
have served their purpose as far as Thailand is concerned. They 
refuse to discuss peace and their presence along the border has 
resulted in the death and maiming of Thai villagers. Thailand 
helped revive the Khmer Rouge once, this time they should be 
allowed to perish if that is to be the order of things in 
Cambodia.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Sad Day for Burmese Democracy Movement and </F>
Its People"] 
  [Excerpts] The United Nations in Geneva last week accused 
Burma's military government of persistent and extremely serious 
human rights violations, including torture and summary 
execution. [passage omitted] 
  But that's UN business. Apparently it is of no concern to 
ASEAN. ASEAN's main fixation with the illegitimate pariah regime 
in Rangoon is the abundance of wealth it is sitting on, and how 
to exploit those riches. How the Burmese generals run their 
country is their own "internal affair". 
  So after months of debate and soul-searching, ASEAN, 
comprising Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the 
Philippines and Brunei, has decided to invite Burma, for that 
country's well-being and as well as theirs, to attend its annual 
pow-wow in Bangkok in July as guest of the host nation. 
  We wonder though if the remaining five member nations would 
have done the same had one of them been the host of this year's 
meeting and thereby risked criticism by most Western governments 
which shun the brutal military regime in Rangoon. [passage 
omitted] 
  Another question is why Thailand, why this government, a 
democratically elected one, chose to ignore the exhortations of 
the media, its academics and most in the intellectual community 
to scrap its controversial "constructive engagement" policy with 
a regime hated by its people for its ruthless and arbitrary 
rule? As a democratic government it owes its allegiance first 
to its people. Not to a certain group of people with vested 
interests, and certainly not to a foreign government and a 
dictatorial one at that. This Government came into being after a 
bloody uprising less than two years ago in exchange for human 
lives and an end to military dictatorship. Yet today we are 
consorting with a regime and shaking a hand which is soaked with 
the blood of more than 3,000 of its own people who were killed 
in the 1988 suppression. 
  This Government justifies its association with the Burmese 
generals saying there can be no political development until 
economic stability has been restored to that country. And 
without economic stability there could be no security in Burma 
and Southeast Asia as a whole. To achieve this aim, its policy 
and those of its ASEAN counterparts is not to isolate Burma, 
instead to embrace it with open arms into the ASEAN fold with 
the hope of coaxing it into establishing democratic rule. 
  We believe this is a pipe dream on the part of ASEAN where 
the Burmese military government is concerned. Because without 
political stability there can be no economic stability, and 
therefore no security. They go hand in hand. Thailand should 
know that best. Like a leopard that never changes its spots, so 
are the rulers of Rangoon who call themselves the State Law and 
Restoration Council [SLORC]. It is convinced that might is 
right and the military is the government, and not the people. 
But not so to the 42 million Burmese who were robbed of a 
democratically-elected government in the May 1990 election. 
  If ASEAN, and Thailand in particular, really aspires to see 
a 
secure Southeast Asia, it should tell Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt and 
his cronies to return what they have robbed from the Burmese 
people. Tell them the days of military dictatorship are over. 
As the former premier of the once military-ruled Thailand in 
1991 said "Military might alone is no longer an adequate 
guarantee of national security.... No nation can feel secure as 
long as its citizens are deprived of the freedom of political 
expression and of the opportunities for a better and more 
meaningful life." [passage omitted] 
  ASEAN's invitation to SLORC is a disgrace. It will impact 
negatively on the Burmese democracy movement and Burma's 
oppressed populace.

  [Text] HANOI, March 14 (AFP) -- The Vietnamese authorities 
sounded an anxious new warning Monday about Western influence, 
with editorials declaring the communist regime must not be 
destabilized by "Western spiritual and cultural pollution." 
  The editorials have been stepped up since the lifting of the 
U.S. economic embargo on Vietnam earlier this year. 
  In the latest commentaries, both the party and military 
newspapers called on Vietnamese to make "the irreversible 
choice" toward socialism, taking into account "the thoughts of 
Ho Chi Minh" during this period of opening. 
  The Cold War language since the embargo was lifted earlier 
this year betrays the government's suspicions of Western 
influence, as increasing numbers [of] Americans have begun 
arriving in the country to do business, analysts say. 
  Following closely the actions of its neighbour China, which 
has been facing US pressure on human rights, Vietnam is 
emphasizing the primary importance of political stability, and 
rejects "interference in its internal affairs." 
  "The Vietnamese people recognize the leading role of the 
party, support political stability as helpful to doing business, 
and recognize that pluralism and a multiparty system are 
potential causes of social problems," the SAIGON GIAI PHONG 
(FREE SAIGON) daily wrote. 
  The leadership is particularly wary of the return of some of 
the one million "Viet Kieu," or overseas Vietnamese who fled to 
the United States after the fall of Saigon in 1975. 
  The leaders are eager for the money and business know-how 
the 
returnees would bring, but not the political and cultural 
influences picked up during years in the West, well-placed 
sources said. 
  The other threat to the regime, the sources said, comes from 
inside Vietnam itself in the form of Catholic and Buddhist 
dissidents, other intellectuals, and disgraced former party or 
military members. 
  The Vietnamese leadership now enjoys less ideological 
support 
abroad for its orthodoxy, with only Laos and Cuba left in the 
traditional communist camp. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrives for a visit 
next week.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 12. -- The British Government has 
decided to contribute a further USD [U.S. dollars] 1.9 million 
to the European Community International Programme (ECIP) for the 
reintegration of Vietnamese boatpeople who have returned from 
camps in the region, says a press release made available here by 
the British Embassy. 
  Seventy percent of the money will go into the very popular 
ECIP credit scheme which benefits ordinary people and 
repatriates as well as those who wish to borrow money to start 
small businesses. The rest will go into microprojects to 
improve the living standard in areas heavily affected by 
economic migration. 
  The decision reinforces the UK's position as the largest 
single national donor to the ECIP and takes the total British 
contribution to almost USD 10 million, not including the 
standard contribution which the UK pays automatically as a 
member of the EC. 
  Commenting on this event, British Ambassador to Vietnam 
Peter 
Williams said: `This additional sum underlines the UK's 
commitment to real cooperation with the Vietnamese Government in 
solving the tragic humanitarian problem of boatpeople in Hong 
Kong and elsewhere in the region. We believe that the ECIP 
offers the best possible source of assistance for returnees and 
for local authorities who have to reintegrate them into society. 
I hope that as many migrants as possible will understand this 
and avail themselves of the benefits of the ECIP by returning 
before the end of the programme in November.'

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 11 -- Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter 
Kooijmans and his wife left here this morning ending their 
three-day visit to Vietnam. 
  He was seen off by Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien. 
  Before leaving, the Dutch foreign minister held a press 
conference on the results of his visit which, he said, is a fine 
opportunity to promote the friendly and cooperative relations 
between the two countries. 
  While in Vietnam, the Dutch diplomat was received by Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. He affirmed that the Dutch Government is 
willing to seriously consider Vietnam's proposals on cooperation 
development in the future. Dutch businessmen have been 
interested in developing cooperation with Vietnam in many 
fields, especially industrialization, agriculture modernization, 
education, public health, and environment in small and medium 
scale, Mr. Pieter Kooijmans added. 
  Speaking to his guest Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet stressed 
that the Vietnamese Government welcomed Dutch businessmen, from 
both private and state-owned enterprises, to Vietnam for 
cooperation, especially in the fields of agricultural product 
and food processing, oil and gas exploration and exploitation.

  [Text] Ho Chi Minh City -- Thailand will seek a response 
from Vietnam on the proposed formation of a joint subcommittee 
on fisheries during Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's visit on 
Wednesday, according to Bangkok's ambassador to Vietnam, Bunthan 
Manklang. 
  "We want a correct channel to solve the fishing problem with 
Vietnam," Bunthan told THE NATION. 
  Vietnam has always insisted there must be an end to poaching 
and violation of its waters by Thai fishermen before there can 
be any cooperation on joint fisheries development. 
  Since the beginning of this year, Vietnamese authorities in 
Soc Trang Province have seized 11 Thai fishing boats and 67 crew 
members on charges of violating their waters. Three trawlers 
and 17 crew were freed after paying heavy fines last month. 
Last year, at least 80 Thai trawlers and 788 crew were seized 
by the Vietnamese. 
  The ambassador said he believes the two countries will 
eventually agree on a solution to the fishing issue, but it may 
take time. The two sides have mutual interests to share, he 
said. 
  "The fishing industry cannot survive without cooperation," 
said Bunthan, referring to Thai expertise in fishing technology 
and the abundant fish resources of Vietnam. 
  On Jan 25, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet ordered that all 
fishing licences given to foreign companies be revoked within 
three months to allow the Ministry of Aquatic Resources to 
review the fishing sector. 
  Ministry of Fisheries deputy chief of cabinet Nguyen Trong 
Binh said some of the agreements had been violated and others 
were unsuccessful. But Binh did not say the violators were all 
Thais. 
  Binh said some companies kept parts of the catch to sell 
back 
home and others trawled in waters reserved for local fishermen. 
  "We want all foreign fishermen to respect the law... 
otherwise we cannot allow them to continue in business," he said. 
  Affected by the order were four Thai fishing companies: 
Hoc-Thepnarong and Thai Phochana in Minh Hai, Surat Canning in 
Kian Giang, and Sirichai in Vung Tao. 
  An informed source said Thai fishing companies in Vietnam 
hope to continue in business despite the revocation of their 
licences. Their prime concern is how to recover the millions of 
baht they have already invested. 
  "There is no clear answer from the Vietnamese side so far on 
what criteria they will use to liquidate the assets put into the 
deal," said the source, who asked not to be named. 
  It is very difficult to clear the assets as in most joint 
ventures the Thais put capital into offices, vessels and other 
facilities and the Vietnamese invest in land.

  [Text] Recently in Ho Chi Minh City, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet held a meeting on rice procurement in the Mekong River 
Delta with related sectors. The prime minister instructed the 
banking and finance sectors to provide immediate credit to 
state-run companies so that they can purchase paddy from the 
peasants, primarily from their winter-spring crop. 
  To help companies in rice-export localities and enterprises 
that are efficient but financially strapped, the government will 
use the Price Stabilization Fund to subsidize partially interest 
payments to banks. The prime minister has requested that sector 
and local leaders satisfactorily organize the procurement of 
surplus paddy at reasonable prices so that peasants can make a 
profit and private traders not take advantage of peasants. 
  He has also directed the comrade minister of agriculture and 
food industry to form quickly a rice export corporation in the 
Mekong River Delta so that state-run companies can dominate rice 
procurement and export and to eliminate the number of 
intermediaries. At the same time, raw material-based 
investments for the state rice trading business in the Mekong 
River Delta must be increased so that the quality of rice 
exports will improve and state-run companies can better control 
the rice market. This will help peasants to implement the 
government's agriculture promotion policy. Now, the 
agriculture, finance, banking, and pricing sectors are actively 
implementing the prime minister's directive to organize the 
winter-spring rice crop procurement in the Mekong River Delta 
for the 1994 export target.

  [Text] The Navy party organization held its midterm party 
conference in Haiphong municipality recently. General Doan 
Khue, member of the party Central Committee Political Bureau, 
deputy secretary of the Military Commission of the party Central 
Committee, and minister of National Defense, attended the 
conference. 
  During the three-day meeting, the conference reviewed and 
appraised tasks during the past two years. The conference noted 
that the party organization has provided valuable guidance and 
supervision to the Navy, thereby firmly strengthening its 
political position and resolving numerous difficulties. The 
Navy has made great progress in building strong and pure 
grass-roots party chapters while comprehensively building strong 
and firm units and fulfilling other assigned tasks. 
  In the days ahead, the Navy party organization will 
integrate 
its efforts to strengthen the party building task, while helping 
the Navy to strengthen its political position. Efforts must be 
made to enhance its combat readiness to build the Navy into a 
standard, modern, and seasoned force, thereby effectively 
defending the fatherland's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
  Addressing the conference, Gen. Doan Khue stressed that the 
duty of defending the territorial integrity and the fatherland's 
coastal region and offshore islands is one of the two strategic 
tasks of our entire party, people, and armed forces. The Navy 
party organization must attach importance to helping the Navy to 
enhance its political background and develop its spirit of 
self-reliance in maintaining and utilizing military equipment, 
thereby meeting requirements of our armed forces in the current 
stage.

  [Text] In its March 1994 issue, TAP CHI CONG SAN carries 
many articles on industrialization and modernization, socialist 
economic orientations, cultural management, and the need to 
strengthen the great national unity bloc for the sake of a 
prosperous people, a powerful country, and an equitable and 
civilized society. 
  An article written by Comrade Deputy Foreign Minister Vu 
Khoan entitled "Experience Obtained in the World and the 
Process of Industrialization and Modernization in our Country" 
reads in part as follows: It is not that industrialization can 
be carried out by any country at any time. Industrialization 
requires certain conditions and premises. Therefore, as we 
embark on the task of encouraging industrialization and 
modernization, it would be useful to study the experiences of 
other countries. What we need to study and how to apply it 
will, of course, depend on the specific conditions of our 
country and on the current international situation. 
  Dealing with the basics for industrialization, the journal 
carries a number of articles critical of some incorrect views on 
market economy and socialism, the historic mandate of the 
working class, the issue of Marxist humanity, and so forth.

  [Text] The question of increasing the assigned frequencies 
for Motorola-type mobile phone service has become a focal point 
in the issue of opening the Japanese mobile phone market. 
Today, the Japan Mobile Communications Corporation [known as 
IDO] and Motorola reached agreement on the matter. Under the 
agreement, IDO will transfer part of the frequencies assigned to 
NTT [Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone]-type mobile phone service 
to 
the Motorola-type mobile phone service, with the two mobile 
phone services sharing the assigned frequencies half-and-half, 
and IDO working toward wider use of the Motorola-type mobile 
phone service by increasing the number of ground radio stations 
for the Motorola-type mobile phone service to 159 by the end of 
1955. 
  In connection with the issue of opening the Japanese mobile 
phone market, in mid-February the U.S. Government made clear 
that it would take steps for imposing sanctions on Japan. Next 
week, Japan and the United States will start governmental 
negotiations. A Japanese Government official said that with the 
agreement reached between IDO and Motorola, the possibility has 
grown that the U.S. Government will not slap sanctions on Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
reached a final agreement on the opening of the Japanese mobile 
telephone market, averting U.S. trade retaliation against Japan, 
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said Saturday. 
  The agreement followed a private-level accord reached 
between 
Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) and Motorola Inc. of the U.S. 
  The U.S. was scheduled to unveil a list by March 17 of 
Japanese products that will be subject to punitive tariffs 
unless there is a negotiated settlement. 
  The Japanese and U.S. Governments will hold regular meetings 
to check whether IDO is implementing its agreement with 
Motorola, as demanded by the U.S. Government. 
  Under the accords on governmental and private levels, IDO 
will open 159 new relay stations for Motorola-formula telephone 
service by October 1995 to expand Motorola's service network in 
Japan. 
  IDO will also change its radio frequency on the formula of 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) from 8 megahertz to 
6.5 megahertz, the same as the Motorola formula.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- The following is the 
`gist' of an agreement reached between the Japanese and U.S. 
Governments on the opening of the Japanese mobile telephone 
market. 
  -- Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) will open 159 new relay 
stations for telephone service on the formula of Motorola Inc. 
of the United States within a year and a half starting in April. 
  -- IDO will transfer 1.5 megahertz of its 8-megahertz radio 
frequency on the formula of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
(NTT) to the Motorola formula for allocation of 6.5 megahertz to 
both formulas. 
  -- The Japanese and U.S. Governments will hold regular 
meetings to assess implementation of the agreement. 
  -- The radio frequency change will be made with IDO 
transferring 1.5 megahertz of its 8-megahertz frequency 
allocated to it for the NTT formula to the Motorola formula. 
  The agreement was reached as a result of a meeting held 
Saturday night between Posts and Telecommunications Minister 
Takenori Kanzaki and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, 
ministry officials said. 
  Both governments agreed to hold consultations to assess 
implementation of the agreement every three months or on request 
by either government, the officials said. 
  On the basis of a 1989 Japan-U.S. trade accord meant to 
boost imports of U.S. cellular phones, IDO began service under 
the Motorola formula, in addition to the NTT formula, but the 
Motorola-formula service has not spread much. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor accused Japan last 
month of breaching the accord and set March 17 as the deadline 
for an announcement of sanctions over trade disputes with Japan. 
  In negotiations with Motorola, IDO proposed in late January 
to open 124 new stations for the Motorola-formula service by 
March 1997. 
  Motorola demanded that IDO open 159 new stations for the 
Motorola-formula service by February 1995 and allocate 3 
megahertz of IDO's 8-megahertz frequency for the NTT-formula 
service to the Motorola formula. 
  IDO made concessions to Motorola's demands to reach the 
basic agreement.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- U.S. Ambassador to Japan 
Walter Mondale announced Saturday night [12 March] that the 
United States and Japan have reached an agreement on the opening 
of the Japanese cellular telephone market. 
  In a statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, 
Mondale 
praised the Japanese Government for its hard work in resolving 
the long-standing problem. 
  "The government of Japan will take all available measures to 
ensure compliance with these commitments," the statement said. 
  Among the commitments are "to build 159 new base stations, 
containing an additional 9,900 voice channels, according to an 
agreed quarterly schedule, to provide coverage for 95 percent of 
the population by December 1995, and to reallocate spectrum for 
use by the U.S. technology-based system," it said. 
  "This agreement demonstrates that the U.S. and Japan can 
work 
together to achieve real market access in Japan," it said. 
  Meanwhile, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori 
Kanzaki issued a statement on the Japan-U.S. agreement, which 
read as follows: 
  1. Mr. Walter F. Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, and I 
have come to a final agreement today on the cellular phone issue 
between Japan and the United States of America. 
  2. Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) has drawn up a plan for 
expanded installation for the North American-type analog 
cellular telephone system and transfer of a part of the spectrum 
currently allocated to the company to the North American-type 
system portion. The Government of Japan and the Government of 
the United States of America have decided to take measures 
including holding of regular meetings to assess implementation 
of the IDO measures. 
  3. The Government of the United States will terminate 
actions under Section 1377 of of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competition Act in response to these measures to be taken by the 
Japanese side. 
  4. I would like to pay respect for cooperation by Ambassador 
Mondale and the efforts made by the corporations concerned 
during the process leading to the resolution of this issue. I 
earnestly hope that the settlement will translate into 
maintenance and further development of the good economic 
relationship between the two countries. 
  Later the same night, Mondale and Kanzaki had a joint news 
conference at the Post and Telecommunications Ministry. 
  Mondale said the agreement is a good example for promoting 
the U.S.-Japan trade framework talks. He added that although 
the cellular phone negotiations are different from the framework 
talks, both sides should have heart-to-heart discussions with 
utmost effort. 
  Mondale also said the agreement will facilitate competition 
in high technology and will eventually benefit Japanese 
consumers. 
  Kanzaki said that Japan did not agree to setting of 
numerical 
targets with the agreement.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, March 12 KYODO -- The United States 
called off threatened sanctions against Japan on Saturday [12 
March] after Tokyo bowed to U.S. pressure and agreed to a deal 
that will assure at least 300 million dollars in business for 
Motorola Inc., a major U.S. cellular phone system maker. 
  "We are delighted with the result," U.S. Trade 
Representative 
Mickey Kantor said in announcing that Washington has decided to 
drop retaliatory moves against Japan. 
  The cellular phone trade agreement, announced in Tokyo on 
Saturday, came five days before Kantor was set to unveil a list 
of Japanese products that would be subject to punitive import 
tariffs. 
  Kantor hailed the accord, which commits the Japanese 
Government to underwrite a commitment from Motorola's Japanese 
partner to expand the American cellular system in the 
Tokyo-Nagoya area, as the sort "results-oriented" trade pacts 
Washington wants from Japan in the future. 
  "That is what portends for the future in our efforts to open 
(the Japanese) markets," Kantor said at a news conference. 
  The agreement, which Motorola and its Japanese partner 
Nippon 
Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) concluded under prodding from U.S. and 
Japanese Governments, has set specific terms the Japanese firm 
must meet by December 1995. 
  Top among them includes a commitment by IDO, which operates 
both a Motorola and a rival Japanese cellular system, to build 
159 relay stations over an 18-month period. 
  That infrastructure facility would enable the Motorola 
system 
to cover 95 percent of the cellular market in a heavily 
populated corridor extending from Tokyo to Nagoya. 
  At present, the Motorola cellular system can be used only in 
40 percent of the localities in the Tokyo-Nagoya market. 
  The Motorola-IDO accord also commits the Japanese cellular 
operator to freeze the development of the rival cellular system 
developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and 
launch a sales campaign to promote the Motorola system. 
  Under a separate government-to-government accord, the 
Japanese Government has also pledged to "monitor and oversee" 
the completion of IDO commitments and review progress with the 
U.S. Government every three months. 
  "This agreement validates our results-oriented approach," 
Kantor said. 
  President Bill Clinton also hailed the cellular phone accord 
in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday as "a big win for 
everyone." 
  "Workers in the United States will gain because the 
agreement 
means more demand for cellular telephones and related equipment 
made in America. Japanese consumers win because they'll have 
access to better service and better technology at better 
prices," the president said. 
  Motorola President Christopher Galvin, who spoke to 
reporters 
after Kantor's press conference, said the infrastructure 
facilities IDO has undertaken to build will give his firm 300 
million dollars in extra business and create "hundreds of jobs" 
in the U.S.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- The Japan-U.S. agreement on 
cellular phones trade did not come because Tokyo bowed to U.S. 
pressure to open its market but as a result of a private-level 
accord, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Monday. 
  "It is not that we yielded to U.S. pressure... but it came 
after private-level talks made headway," the top government 
spokesman told a news conference. 
  But he also said, "Frankly, we are delighted at the result." 
  Earlier Monday, a Japanese Government source criticized the 
U.S. Government for overly intervening on behalf of a specific 
company. 
  The source said the way Washington helped Motorola Inc. to 
increase its market share in Japan was something Tokyo would 
never contemplate. 
  The Motorola negotiations were a matter of private business, 
and the U.S. Government could not deny it was working for a 
specific company, he said. 
  The source said he expects the U.S. may take a similar 
attitude in future trade negotiations. 
  "As long as Japan has such a huge trade surplus, Japan 
cannot 
take a tough stance toward such a U.S. attitude," he said. 
  Under the Japan-U.S. accord reached Saturday, Nippon Idou 
Tsusin Corp. [Japan Mobile Communications Corporation] (IDO) 
will launch a full-scale expansion of service in the Tokyo and 
Nagoya areas using the Motorola system. IDO will shift some 
service now geared to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. to 
the Motorola-oriented service.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Vice Postal Minister 
Futoshi Shirai denied Monday U.S. allegations that the Japanese 
Government has guaranteed a numerical target in solving a 
dispute with the United States over the opening of its cellular 
telephone market. 
  The agreement reached between Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. 
(IDO) 
and Motorola Inc. last week called for the Japanese firm to 
build 159 new base stations for the U.S. competitor by the fall 
of next year. 
  Shirai said IDO is expected to implement the agreement 
without fail. He added, however, that it would be wrong to 
construe that the government has guaranteed the numerical target 
accepted by IDO. 
  The government will do whatever it can to see to it that the 
agreement is carried out smoothly. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito also told reporters the 
Japanese Government will watch implementation of the agreement 
within its power. If there is any difference between Japan and 
the U.S. in the interpretation of the agreement, it is because 
the U.S. Government apparently misunderstood the accord, he said. 
  He said the government is in no position to intervene in 
private-sector affairs though it will keep a watch on the 
implementation of the accord.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Japan is unlikely to face 
pressure at a jobs summit from other Group of Seven (G-7) major 
industrialized nations on its financial measures, Vice Finance 
Minister Jiro Saito said Monday [14 March]. 
  Issues to be discussed at the summit will concentrate on 
"European nations and not Japan," Saito told a regular press 
meeting. 
  He was referring to earlier comments by U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who indicated discussions at the 
two-day meeting in Detroit from Monday would include financial 
measures. 
  "I don't know what he (Bentsen) actually said," Saito said, 
but the summit is to discuss "medium- to long-term structural 
problems," he indicated. 
  Japan has no such problems, Saito said. 
  Considering a meeting of finance ministers from the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Hawaii later 
this week, he said the gathering is intended to exchange views 
"freely" and not to stage negotiations. 
  He said a meeting between Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii and Bentsen is yet not set. 
  Meanwhile, Saito said his ministry will "soon" decide on a 
"strict" punishment for Kankaku Securities Co., which is accused 
of committing illegal loss-compensation practices. 
  Japan's Securities and Exchange surveillance commission 
recommended Friday that the ministry take administrative action 
against the second-tier brokerage house. 
  Kankaku is accused of compensating customers with losses 
through so-called "tobashi" deals, which are prohibited under 
the securities and exchange law. 
  The practice involves shifting loss-carrying transactions 
from one client to another with a promise to buy back the shares 
later at higher prices.

  [Text] Washington, March 11 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, a 
close associate of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and a 
possible trouble-shooter in the troubled U.S.-Japan ties, will 
visit the United States later this month, diplomatic sources 
said Friday [11 March]. 
  The sources said Ozawa is tentatively set to arrive in 
Washington on March 21. 
  Ozawa has a reputation for political savvy and has won 
admirers on Capitol Hill. He indicated his intention to visit 
Washington following the breakdown of trade talks last month 
that soured Japan's economic relationship with its U.S. ally. 
  Japanese diplomatic sources said the itinerary of Ozawa's 
trip has yet to be finalized. 
  Ozawa will probably stay in the U.S. for one week from March 
21, meeting congressional leaders and officials in the Clinton 
administration. A meeting with President Bill Clinton is also a 
possibility, the sources said. 
  One certainty in Ozawa's trip is a speech to be delivered at 
the National Press Club in Washington on March 23, the sources 
said. 
  Ozawa is secretary general of Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party), one of the seven parties that form the Hosokawa 
coalition government but he occupies no formal government 
position. 
  There has been speculation in Tokyo that Ozawa may come to 
Washington as Hosokawa's special envoy but Japanese diplomatic 
sources say they are unaware of any such decision. 
  The Japanese Government plans to unveil a package of market- 
opening measures by the end of this month and U.S. officials 
have said Washington is keeping a close watch on its contents. 
  Trade talks between the U.S. and Japan broke down on 
February 
11 after the Japanese Government rejected U.S. demands to set 
numerical indicators to measure progress in Japanese imports. 
  Ozawa raised expectations in Washington of a possible change 
of heart in Tokyo with a suggestion that Japan may accept 
voluntary targets he characterized as "endeavor indicators" so 
long as the U.S. does not take them as binding commitments. 
  House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt has expressed 
interest 
in the proposal, telling reporters Thursday he is "absolutely" 
comfortable with Ozawa's idea. 
  Gephardt, who is expected to meet Ozawa, also paid him a 
glowing tribute, saying he has found no political leader in 
Japan "more forthcoming" than Ozawa. 
  Ozawa, who wrote a best-seller calling for a restructuring 
of 
the Japanese political and economic system, also has an admirer 
in U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is fond of 
quoting a passage in Ozawa's book encouraging the Japanese to 
behave like a "normal country."

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher ended three days of difficult talks with 
China's leadership Monday [14 March], taking with him several 
promises of cooperation in human rights. 
  "I came to China to try to ensure that the Chinese side 
understands the importance of human rights to the United States 
in connection with the most favored nation (MFN) treatment," 
Christopher told reporters after a final meeting with Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen. 
  The high-level talks have been marked by China's point-blank 
refusal to accept any linkage between human rights and trade. 
It regards calls for progress in human rights as interference 
in its internal affairs. 
  The May 1993 executive order on China trade issued by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton has linked the renewal of MFN in June 
with "overall significant progress" on seven issues concerning 
human rights. Billions of dollars in trade is at stake. 
  During his trip, Christopher received a dressing down from 
both President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng on China's 
inflexibility over human rights issues. They made clear that 
China is ready to go on without MFN. 
  Despite the difficult meetings, Christopher characterized 
his 
final talk with Qian as better than before and listed five areas 
where China has promised to cooperate. 
  The two sides signed a statement of cooperation specifying a 
method to form "concrete assurances" that China is complying to 
a 1992 agreement concerning prison labor and which was specified 
in the executive order. 
  The Chinese side also agreed "to work to resolve the few 
remaining outstanding emigration matters," Christopher said. 
  Implementation of the prison labor agreement and the 
emigration problems represent the "two measurable conditions" in 
Clinton's executive order. 
  The remaining five are considered "nonmeasurable" and call 
for significant progress in areas including the release and 
accounting for political prisoners, humane prison treatment and 
protection of Tibetan religious and cultural traditions. 
  Christopher said the Chinese side handed over a "detailed 
accounting" on 235 political prisoners and is preparing 
information on 106 Tibetan prisoners. 
  China would also review interference in the broadcast signal 
of the Voice of America and will soon continue talks with the 
International Red Cross on prison visits while confirming its 
support of the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights, he said. 
  Christopher said he urged Chinese authorities to free 
political prisoners as well as begin dialogue with the Dalai 
Lama, Tibet's exiled religious leader. 
  In a contrast characterizing the tone of the meetings, 
China's foreign minister chose several different areas of 
agreement as the main emphasis of the visit. 
  Qian said the two sides agreed to continue high-level 
meetings with Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation 
Wu Yi. He said Song Jian, minister of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, will visit the U.S. in April. 
  The U.S. agreed to continue its support for China's entry to 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Qian said the two 
countries would hold bilateral meetings on defense conversion 
this spring. 
  Qian also mentioned the statement on prison labor and said 
China had agreed to help the U.S. try and locate several 
soldiers believed to have gone missing in action during the 
Vietnam War. 
  "I wouldn't describe it as a breakthrough," Christopher 
said. 
"It was a business-like and productive meeting, we began to 
narrow the differences." 
  Christopher also met with the U.S. business community in 
Beijing Sunday morning, with businessmen overwhelmingly calling 
for the renewal of unconditional MFN. 
  Tens of billions of dollars of bilateral trade are at stake 
if renewal is not granted. 
  The visit began in a tense atmosphere as Chinese police 
rounded up several of China's best-known dissidents in an 
apparent attempt at prevent activists from contacting the 
secretary. 
  Christopher was to fly to Vladisvostock Monday to meet 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will broach the sensitive issue of human rights with 
top Chinese leaders when he visits Beijing from Saturday [19 
March], government sources said Monday. 
  The sources said Hosokawa will call on China in talks with 
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng to 
"urgently address (the human rights issue) in a manner which can 
be understood by the international community." 
  The Japanese leader's projected Beijing visit comes on the 
heels of that by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who 
was coolly rebuffed last week when he took the Chinese 
Government to task over its human rights record. 
  Hosokawa is also expected to take a strong stance on the 
issue in the face of anticipated Chinese insistence that human 
rights are an internal affair, the sources said. 
  They said Hosokawa is likely to answer those arguments by 
suggesting that China could better win external assistance for 
its economic reform program by showing a desire to improve its 
human rights situation. 
  He will probably not, however, touch on specific human 
rights 
cases, such as the detainment of prodemocracy activists, they 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan's 1994 fishing quota 
of salmon in its 200-mile zone remains unchanged from the 
previous year at 4,819 tons, according to an agreement reached 
Friday [11 March] between Japan and Russia. Of the total, 3,444 
tons are allocated to fishing in the Pacific side and 1,375 tons 
to the Sea of Japan side, Japanese officials said. 
  Japan's quota in Russia's 200-mile zone is yet to be 
decided. 
Russia offered 14,000 tons, 1,000 tons less than in the previous 
year. Japan and Russia will continue negotiating on the private 
level, the officials said. 
  Japan agreed to pay 759 million yen to Russia in return for 
its 1994 fishing, unchanged from the previous year, they said. 
  The two countries negotiate annually about the quota of 
those 
fish which grow up in rivers in Russia and come out to the 
ocean, as well as on the fund payment for fishing by Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- The Iranian Government 
will defer payments of trade debts worth 2 billion dollars it 
owes to nine major Japanese trading firms, industry sources said 
Monday [14 March]. 
  Iran agreed with the Japanese trading firms, including 
Mitsui 
and Co. and Tomen Corp., to postpone payment of its trade debts 
due by March until 1996 to 1999, the source said. 
  The agreement was reached after Iran promised it will put 
priority on using its crude oil revenues to pay back the debts, 
they said. 
  Iran is delaying payment of a total of nearly 10 billion 
dollars in trade settlements, the sources said. 
  In February, Germany agreed to allow Iran to defer such 
payments worth roughly 2.5 billion dollars.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan and Kazakhstan 
signed an agreement Friday [10 March] to cooperate on 
destruction of nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan and to set up a 
committee to effectively carry out the work, the Foreign 
Ministry said. Japanese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Akira Matsui 
signed the agreement with Kazakhstan Foreign Minister Tuleutai 
Skakovich Suleymenov, in Almaty, the ministry said. 
  The agreement was the last to be signed between Japan and 
the 
four former Soviet republics. Tokyo signed similar pacts with 
Russia last October, Belarus last November and Ukraine earlier 
this month. 
  The accord follows Japan's announcement in April last year 
at 
a ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations that 
it would extend a grant-in-aid of 100 million dollars for the 
promotion of nuclear weapons destruction in the former Soviet 
Union. 
  The committee will include representatives of the 
Governments 
of Japan and Kazakhstan, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Thai-grown rice will 
account for at least 25 percent of blended rice to be retailed 
in March, instead of the 20 percent earlier intended, industry 
sources said Friday [11 March]. The Food Agency earlier this 
week ordered rice sellers to mix domestically and foreign-grown 
rice for retail sale, to avoid any hoarding of domestic rice. 
  The agency originally set the supply proportions for 
domestic, Thai, and U.S. and Chinese rice at 30 percent, 20 
percent, and 50 percent, respectively. But the delay in imports 
of Chinese rice so far has forced the agency to change the 
proportions to 50 percent, 25 percent and 25 percent, 
respectively. 
  Blended rice will likely be put on the market as early as 
next week despite much opposition from consumers and rice 
sellers. Some rice wholesalers said they will sell a set of 
foreign and domestic rice instead of blended rice, a choice the 
agency has tolerated. 
  A Tokyo-based wholesaler said, "consumers desire a 
domestic-foreign rice set, not blended rice. I think the 
proportion of Thai rice in the rice set will be approximately 
the same as that of blended rice."

  [Text] Tokyo, March, 11 KYODO -- The Food Agency said 
Friday [11 March] it has issued a notice to local governments 
and concerned sectors that they should make sure rice sellers in 
their areas are mixing domestic and at least 20 percent of Thai 
rice for sales to consumers. The agency's notice also banned 
sales of "sets" of domestic rice and imported rice in separate 
bags. 
  It noted the policy is to maintain fair supplies and to 
avoid 
any hoarding of domestic rice. If domestic rice only is 
preferred and purchased, it will be completely consumed before 
rice grown this year comes onto the markets, the notice said. 
  Blended rice will likely be put on the market as early as 
next week despite much opposition from consumers and rice 
sellers. Consumers say they want to have freedom of choice and 
if domestic and imported rice have to be sold in a certain 
proportion, then they want to have the rice in separate bags, so 
they can cook it in different ways according to the rice type. 
  Rice sellers say, reflecting such consumers' voices, that 
they want to sell separately. Some wholesalers said they also 
want to sell "sets" of foreign and domestic rice instead of 
blended rice. 
  The agency plans to organize meetings for consumers and 
sellers in order to avoid further confusion, officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic 
planner said Friday [11 March] her agency will keep watch to 
make sure that consumers are not subjected to price hikes 
because of a shortage of domestically grown rice. Manae Kubota, 
director general of the Economic Planning Agency, told a regular 
news conference that the agency is monitoring rice price trends 
to check if the supply shortage of Japanese rice is being 
translated into price hikes. 
  Kubota played down the seriousness of the alleged rice 
shortage, explaining that the government expects to secure 
stocks of three million tons of rice to meet demand in the 
coming six months. She said the three million tons comprises 
1.2 million tons in government holdings of Japanese rice, 1.7 
million tons in imports and 100,000 tons from this year's first 
harvest expected in August. 
  Consumers need not be panicky about getting rice, and should 
not rush to buy rice in excess of their needs, the EPA chief 
said. Kubota said the agency has no immediate plan to invoke a 
provision banning hoarding by rice wholesalers. 
  The government began importing rice last year to make up for 
a shortage of Japanese rice following a bad harvest.

  [Text] Yokohama, March 14 KYODO -- Health and Welfare 
Minister Keigo Ouchi joined the campaign to promote foreign rice 
on Monday [14 March] by declaring his satisfaction that 
inspectors at a Yokohama quarantine center have found nothing 
dangerous in imported rice. 
  At the end of a 30-minute tour of the center, Ouchi said he 
had told the Diet there is no cause for concern over chemical 
residue in imported rice, and that his own tour of the center 
had satisfied him that he had seen "an internationally high 
standard of surveillance." 
  Ouchi said he was relieved to be told at the center that 
staff have "not yet found anything dangerous" in the rice they 
have inspected. 
  Ouchi also said he is grateful to staff at the center for 
working weekends to clear a backlog of imported rice.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Agriculture Minister 
Eijiro Hata appealed to consumers on Monday [14 March] not to 
stockpile rice, assuring them that there will be no supply 
shortage. 
  Hata made the appeal at a meeting of rice dealers and 
consumers held by the Food Agency to hear views on imported rice. 
  Hata told the session there will be no shortage in rice 
supplies and said there is no need for consumers to rush to buy 
rice in excess. 
  Dealers and consumers asked the agency to bring down prices 
of imported rice and allow set sales of domestic and imported 
rice. 
  Hata said the government is not making it mandatory for rice 
dealers to blend domestic rice with imported rice in delivering 
to consumers. 
  Blending domestic and imported rice is simply an option, he 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
will keep a 50 percent customs duty on imported beef until the 
1995 start of the agreement reached in the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks, government officials said Friday [11 
March]. The decision was made during a regular cabinet meeting 
on the same day. 
  The government also agreed to accept the Agriculture 
Ministry's current policy of continuing the ceiling of beef 
imports on an emergency basis at the current level of 680,000 
tons annually, they said. The ceiling measures, agreed to by 
Japan and the United States, will allow the government to raise 
duties to 75 percent if beef imports surpass the level. 
  In the Uruguay Round talks, held under auspices of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Japan agreed that duties 
on beef imports will be reduced to 38.5 percent from 50 percent 
during the six years from 1995.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo TV Asahi Network in Japanese at 
0108 GMT on 6 March, during its weekly "Sunday Project" panel 
discussion program, carries a 47-minute live political debate 
including Tsutomu Hata, president of Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party), Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan (SDPJ), and Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), in Asahi's Tokyo studio, and 
by Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida in Osaka linked by remote 
hookup. Political commentator Soichiro Tawara acts as 
moderator, and two guest commentators -- Kyoto University 
Professor Masaaki Kosaka and journalist Hajime Takeno -- are 
also asked to give their views. 
  The first 17 minutes of the debate are devoted to the recent 
political turmoil over a failed cabinet reshuffle plan by Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. In the discussions, Hata and Ishida 
admit they had supported Hosokawa's plan to fire Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from his post. But Murayama and 
Ouchi insist the plan was ill-conceived, and add it was good for 
the unity of the coalition that the plan was discarded. 
  At 0125 GMT, the topic turns to the question of political 
realignment. Tawara says he believes that, from the time of the 
disagreement over the cabinet reshuffle incident, the coalition 
has been divided into two power centers -- Shinseito, Komeito 
and Hosokawa's Japan New Party on the one hand, and the DSP, the 
SDPJ, and Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger Party) on the other. 
He then asks Murayama of the SDPJ if the coalition will 
continue to exist in in a two-group format. Murayama replies, 
"It so happened that the views (of the SDPJ, the DSP, and 
Sakigake) matched on the question of the national welfare tax 
and on the issue of the cabinet reshuffle, and there were 
agreements on ways to ensure coalition stability and solidifying 
cooperation." He insists, "This condition has not been 
intentionally created to counter the Shinseito-Komeito bloc, as 
alleged by some people." 
  Tawara asks Ishida of Komeito if the coalition parties, in 
the face of the next general election, will eventually merge 
into one party or cooperate with each other while retaining 
their identities as separate parties. Ishida says the parties 
are "not yet in a condition of being able to accommodate other 
parties' positions" and to bring themselves together under one 
umbrella. Ishida, however, suggests all coalition member 
parties should move toward gathering together under one 
umbrella, insisting, "The election system requires that we move 
toward a two-party system." He notes that the "Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) is a big opposition party with more than 
220 seats in the lower house." 
  Asked a similar question, Murayama of the SDPJ says, "The 
parties should cooperate (in the next general election) to 
ensure that the LDP does not return to power," but he says the 
cooperation does not mean that all the parties should merge into 
one force. Murayama says such a merger would be "impossible." 
  At 0134 GMT, Ouchi of the DSP is asked to express his view 
on 
the issue of future political alignment. Ouchi says, "Political 
alignment really means forming new parties. All parties should 
make all possible efforts toward that end." However, noting 
that a failure to win in the next election could be a 
"catastrophe" for the coalition, he says the parties should not 
try to seek to form a single force at once from the beginning. 
He insists, "people who hold cautious stands and people aiming 
for higher targets should form parties of their own at first." 
He also says that in the next general election the coalition 
parties should do all they can to maintain the coalition 
government by cooperating with each other. He adds that one 
preferable way would be for the eight existing political groups 
in the coalition to merge into two or three parties, and for 
them to cooperate in the next election. 
  Asked to give his views, Hata of Shinseito says, "It is 
important for all the parties to make endeavors to become one 
group," noting "we -- the parties of different backgrounds and 
political ideals -- have been able to surmount all the 
difficulties arising from these differences, and to maintain the 
coalition over the past seven months." Hata says the parties 
should either merge into one big party or form a single joint 
floor group in the Diet. 
  Asked about reports that Komeito and Shinseito are heading 
for a merger, Ishida of Komeito asserts the reports are not 
correct. He says his party wants to create a new party which 
includes all other parties in the coalition. 
  At 0148 GMT, guest commentators -- Professor Kosaka and 
journalist Takeno -- are asked to give their comments on the 
views of the four political party leaders. With the debate 
coming to close, Tawara brings up the question of the cabinet 
reshuffle once again. Recalling that one of the reasons people 
did not support Prime Minister Hosokawa's idea on a cabinet 
reshuffle was the "bad timing" of the announcement of the plan, 
with the 1994 budget yet to be cleared by the Diet. Tawara asks 
Ouchi of the DSP if a reshuffle would be possible once the Diet 
completes deliberations on the 1994 budget. Ouchi says, "Common 
sense tells me that if he wants to reshuffle the cabinet, he 
should do it after the regular session of the Diet closes and 
major bills have been taken care of." Murayama, Hata, and 
Ishihara also express similar views.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- The ruling coalition's 
chief strategist Ichiro Ozawa met with seven members of the 
Japan New Party (JNP) of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on 
Friday [11 March] in a move believed to lead to a new political 
realignment, some JNP members said. 
  Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), exchanged views with the JNP 
legislators of both the House of Representative and the House of 
Councillors at a restaurant in Tokyo over the political 
situation and a future realignment of political parties, they 
said. 
  Ozawa called on those present to step up ties in the 
coalition to maintain the Hosokawa administration, the members 
said. 
  Prior to Friday's meeting, he had also met with three other 
JNP legislators on Monday, they said. 
  The powerful politician has been staying out of public sight 
since Hosokawa gave up his attempt to make changes to his 
seven-month-old cabinet early this month because of strong 
opposition from within the coalition and a tight Diet schedule. 
  Ozawa is widely believed to have urged Hosokawa to push for 
the cabinet reshuffle, whose primary purpose was to replace the 
premier's chief spokesman and chief of staff, Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Political sources said the honeymoon between Hosokawa and 
Takemura ended last December over their differences on policies. 
Speculation has arisen that Hosokawa was tilting in favor of 
ties with Ozawa, who is reported to be at odds with Takemura. 
  Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the third 
largest coalition bloc, are pursuing establishment of a 
two-party political system and insisted on unifying coalition 
parties to fight off the leading opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) in the next general elections under a new electoral 
system mixing single-seat constituencies and proportional 
representation. 
  The largest coalition bloc, the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), as well new party Sakigake (Harbinger) headed by Takemura 
and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), meanwhile, are aiming 
at multiparty system, but with fewer parties than at present. 
  The remaining coalition component is the minor United Social 
Democratic Party (USDP).

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Four key unions 
representing about 1.8 million workers have agreed to support 
candidates in the next general election who are not members of 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], political 
sources said Monday [14 March]. 
  The move marks a major policy shift from their longstanding 
support for the party, they said. 
  It also indicates that cooperation within the seven-party 
coalition led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will be a 
factor in whether candidates get support from the unions -- the 
All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, the Japan 
Teachers' Union, the Japan Telecommunications' Workers Union and 
the Japan Postal Workers' Union. 
  The sources made the remarks in reaction to a front-page 
article in the Monday morning issue of the ASAHI SHIMBUN, which 
said representatives of the four unions reached the agreement in 
a meeting at a Tokyo hotel on February 8. 
  The four unions have been among the key groups within the 
eight million-strong Rengo (Japanese Trade Union Confederation) 
and have traditionally backed the SDP. 
  But some supporters of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) 
inside Rengo have expressed reservations about solely rallying 
behind SDP and DSP candidates, a move seen as deliberately 
distancing themselves from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and 
Komeito [Clean Government Party], the ASAHI said. 
  The SDP, the DSP, Shinseito and Komeito are members of the 
ruling coalition along with Hosokawa's Japan New Party, new 
party Sakigake [Harbinger] and the United Social Democratic 
Party.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- The chief of the Fair 
Trade Commission (FTC) on Friday [11 March] denied allegations 
that the commission's 1992 judgment in a bid-rigging case had 
been influenced by external factors. The fair trade watchdog 
exercised its duty in an appropriate manner when it decided not 
to file a criminal accusation against contractors over alleged 
bid-rigging in public works projects in Saitama Prefecture, FTC 
Chairman Masami Kogayu told a news conference. 
  The denial followed the arrest by prosecutors earlier in the 
day of former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura over 
bribery charges involving top contractor Kajima Corp. 
  Nakamura allegedly accepted 10 million yen from Kajima as a 
reward for using his influence to fend off an FTC criminal 
complaint in the bid-rigging case. The FTC, after investigating 
the case, dropped the charge. 
  The FTC was not able to find evidence to support charges of 
a 
criminal act under the Antimonopoly Law, Kogayu said. The FTC, 
as an independent administrative organ, strictly enforced the 
law, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- The bribery scandal 
involving a major construction firm will deal additional damage 
to the already tainted image of Japan's big contractors and 
hence to their balance sheets, industry sources said Friday [11 
March]. The sources said the arrest of former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura earlier in the day will further hurt 
Kajima Corp., which allegedly bribed him, as well as other major 
contractors. 
  The tarnished image of these dominant players in the sector, 
involved in this and other scandals, has already driven many 
customers away. Worse still, the revelation of the malpractices 
comes at a time when construction orders had already sunk to a 
nadir. 
  Some industry officials, however, saw at least one benefit 
of 
the scandal. An executive at a second-tier contractor said, 
"because of this scandal, politicians will refrain from 
demanding bribes from us in the future." 
  "So far, we could not but give them bribes because they 
would 
cause us troubles unless we did so," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- Prosecutors plan to 
question Takashi Inoue, an opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) member of the House of Councillors, as a witness in 
connection with a bribery case involving a bid-rigging affair, 
informed sources said Saturday [12 March]. 
  Inoue, 69, is believed to be one of several Diet members 
that 
leading contractor Kajima Corp. asked to exercise their 
influence to help block an accusation by the Fair Trade 
Commission (FTC) against a bid-rigging scheme involving Kajima 
in Saitama Prefecture. 
  By questioning Inoue, prosecutors aim to prove a statement 
by 
Kajima's former vice president, Shinji Kiyoyama, 67. He claimed 
he asked several Diet members, including Inoue and former 
Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, to help his company. 
  Nakamura, 44, was arrested Friday on suspicion of taking a 
10 
million yen bribe from Kajima in January 1992. 
  Nakamura is suspected of taking the money for exerting his 
influence as deputy head of an antimonopoly lobby to help block 
the possible accusation by the FTC. 
  The sources said soon after the FTC made on-the-spot 
inspections on companies involving in the bid-rigging scheme in 
May 1991, Kiyoyama asked Inoue how to evade the accusations. 
  Afterwards, Inoue met then-FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, 62, 
at his Tokyo office and asked whether the antimonopoly watchdog 
would file a criminal complaint over the bid-rigging scheme, the 
sources said. 
  Inoue admitted he had met Kiyoyama but declined to comment 
on 
whether he was asked about ways to evade the FTC's accusations 
because investigations are still underway. 
  The FTC announced in May 1992 that it would not file an 
accusation with prosecutors due to a lack of evidence and 
instead ordered the contractors to stop the collusive activities. 
  The present chairman of the FTC, Masami Kogayu, told 
reporters Friday that the commission was never influenced by 
outside forces on decisions involving cases violating the 
antimonopoly law. 
  Inoue, former vice construction minister, is known for his 
close ties with the construction industry. He became director 
general of the National Land Agency in December 1993 under then 
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the LDP. 
  Kiyoyama, who is now on trial on charges of sending bribes 
to 
former Ibaraki Governor Fujio Takeuchi, was rearrested Tuesday 
for allegedly sending the bribe to Nakamura. 
  Meanwhile, attorneys who met Nakamura at the Tokyo Detention 
House told reporters that he had denied all the allegations 
against him when he was questioned by prosecutors. 
  During a 20-minute meeting on Saturday morning, Nakamura was 
quoted by the two attorneys as saying he has no complaints about 
the treatment he has received and that he had slept well.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- Some 10 Diet members of 
the Liberal Democratic Party contacted the Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) over a bid-rigging affair involving construction giant 
Kajima Corp., informed sources said Saturday [12 March]. 
  Besides former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislators are believed to have 
exercised their influence around late 1991 to bail out Kajima 
from a possible criminal charge over the bid-ridding case in 
Saitama Prefecture, the sources said. 
  Nakamura, 44, was arrested Friday on suspicion of taking a 
10 
million yen bribe from Kajima in January 1992. 
  Nakamura is suspected of taking the money for exerting his 
influence as deputy head of an antimonopoly lobby to help block 
the possible accusation by the FTC. The LDP was in power at 
that time. 
  Prosecutors are likely to question Kajima executives 
including Chairman Rokuro Ishikawa within this week in a bid to 
probe the whole picture of Kajima's political maneuvering over 
the case, they added. 
  The prosecutors also plan to question Takashi Inoue, an 
opposition LDP member of the House of Councillors, as a witness 
in connection with the bribery case involving the bid-rigging 
affair. 
  Prosecutors intend to prove a statement by Kajima's former 
vice president, 67-year-old Shinji Kiyoyama, who claimed he 
asked several Diet members, including Inoue and Nakamura, to 
help his company. 
  The sources said soon after the FTC made the second round of 
on-the-spot inspections in October 1991 on companies involved in 
the bid-rigging scheme, Kiyoyama asked Nakamura to dissuade then 
FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa from filing the criminal accusation. 
  Besides Nakamura, Upper House member Inoue also met Umezawa 
in late 1991 trying to help block the accusation, the sources 
said. 
  Around them some 10 LDP legislators from both houses 
separately met senior FTC officials in a bid to ask about the 
progress of the investigation, the sources said. 
  The FTC announced in May 1992 that it would not file an 
accusation with prosecutors and instead ordered the contractors 
to stop the collusive activities.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 13 KYODO -- The Tokyo District Court 
approved prosecutors' request to detain former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura, now under arrest for alleged bribery, 
for 10 days beginning Sunday [13 March], prosecutors said. 
  Nakamura, 44, was arrested Friday on suspicion of receiving 
a 
10 million yen bribe from giant contractor Kajima Corp. in 
January 1992. 
  Under the code of criminal procedure, a suspect can be 
detained for up to 20 days for interrogation before indictment, 
following the initial two to three days of detention after the 
arrest. 
  The money Nakamura allegedly accepted was intended as a 
reward for using his influence as a Diet member to help block 
the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) from filing an accusation 
against a cartel of 66 contractors, including Kajima, over 
bid-rigging practices, prosecution sources said. 
  At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chief of the Special 
Committee on Antimonopoly Laws of then governing Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
  Now an independent member of the House of Representatives, 
Nakamura has been in custody at the Tokyo detention house since 
Friday to undergo interrogation by prosecutors. 
  His arrest came immediately after the Diet stripped Nakamura 
of parliamentary immunity from arrest following prosecutors' 
request. 
  He had refused to comply with prosecutors' questioning over 
his bribery suspicion. In Japan, apprehending a Diet member 
while in a parliament session needs Diet approval. The Diet is 
in a 150-day regular session.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura, under arrest for alleged bribery, 
tried to strike a deal with the fair trade watchdog to have it 
drop a plan to file a motion against contractors in return for 
his support on its planned hike in bid-rigging penalties, 
informed sources said Monday [14 March]. 
  Nakamura, then deputy chairman of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) panel on antimonopoly laws, opposed a plan by the 
Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in December 1991 to raise the 
maximum penalty on violators to several hundreds of million yen 
from 5 million yen. 
  In the Structural Impediments Initiative talks with the 
United States, Japan was urged to raise penalties against 
corporations which violate the antimonopoly law. 
  In February 1992, however, Nakamura reversed his initial 
reluctance to support the hike after he allegedly received a 10 
million yen bribe from leading contractor Kajima Corp. in 
January and moved to persuade colleagues in the LDP construction 
lobby to give in to the FTC plan, the sources said. 
  Prosecutors arrested Nakamura Friday for allegedly accepting 
the 10 million yen bribe. He quit the LDP last Wednesday. 
  The money was apparently intended as a reward for using his 
influence to help prevent the FTC from filing an accusation 
against a 66-member cartel, including Kajima, for its 
bid-rigging practices on public works projects in Saitama 
Prefecture. 
  He met twice with then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa and 
pressured him not to file an accusation against the companies, 
sources said. 
  The FTC submitted a revised plan on the antimonopoly law to 
raise the maximum penalty to 100 million yen in March of that 
year. 
  It announced two months later that it would not file an 
accusation with prosecutors against the cartel. 
  FTC Chairman Masami Kogayu said Friday the commission was 
never influenced by outside forces on decisions involving cases 
impinging the Fair Trade Law.

  [Text] Mito, March 14 KYODO -- Former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura, under arrest for suspected bribery, 
told a city mayor to suspend a municipal project to build an 
education center, saying he should have been consulted first, 
informed sources said Monday [14 March]. 
  Nakamura, arrested last Friday after the Diet voted to lift 
his immunity, summoned Hiroshi Kanbayashi, mayor of Mitsukaido 
in Ibaraki Prefecture, to his political office and expressed 
anger at the project, the sources said. 
  The incident occurred last October 3 even though Nakamura 
had 
lost his cabinet place in the defeat of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) government in elections in August. 
  The city lies within the Ibaraki No. 3 constituency for 
which 
he sits in the House of Representatives. 
  Kanbayashi told KYODO NEWS SERVICE, "Although the project to 
build the center falls under the jurisdication of the city 
government, I could not refute his criticism as he abruptly 
forced his conclusion on me." 
  The sources quoted Nakamura as telling the mayor in an 
apparent expression of his disapproval, "Why did you decide to 
go ahead with such an important project without consulting me 
beforehand?" 
  Nakamura was apparantly angered at the news that the city 
government had picked a general contractor as the winning bidder 
for the 3.1 billion yen project without consulting him in 
advance, the sources said. 
  Kanbayashi asked for time to reconsider the matter. 
  In a session in September of the Mitsukaido Municipal 
Assembly, a questioner asked city officials why the city 
government had so quickly selected the contractor. 
  The project calls for completing the community center on the 
6,550-square-meter site in the year ending in March 1996. It is 
an exceptionally large project for the city, whose annual budget 
stands at around 13 billion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Ruling coalition and 
opposition parties failed Friday [11 March] to set a timetable 
for a Diet budget panel to deliberate the fiscal 1994 state 
budget because of a dispute over Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's loan from a scandal-ridden firm. 
  Senior members of the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee, comprising both ruling coalition and opposition 
parties, held sessions on and off to set a schedule to 
deliberate the 73.08 trillion yen national budget for fiscal 
1994, which starts April 1. Deliberations were earlier expected 
to start as early as Monday. 
  However, negotiations broke down after the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party 
(JCP) stuck to their demands for the government to submit 
detailed documents concerning 100 million yen Hosokawa borrowed 
from leading trucking firm Sagawa Kyubin Co., officials said. 
The dispute could force the panel to delay budget discussions 
until late next week, they said. 
  The government on Friday submitted to the panel some 
documents relating to the loan but the two parties were 
dissatisfied, saying the documents were not sufficient to clear 
their doubts on the matter, they said. The two parties renewed 
their demands that the government offer further detailed 
documents, the officials said. 
  Last December, Hosokawa said in a memo submitted to the Diet 
that he borrowed the money from Sagawa Kyubin in September 1982 
to buy a condominium in central Tokyo and repair his home in 
Kumamoto Prefecture. The premier said he repaid the money by 
January 31, 1991. 
  Sagawa is a leading parcel delivery firm which was involved 
in a money-and-mobster scandal which implicated former Prime 
Minister Noboru Takeshita and fallen LDP power broker Shin 
Kanemaru.

<F P=106> [Article by Kohei Murayama: "Higher Rates Hindering </F>
Optimistic Comments on Economy"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- Japan's financial 
officials are handling with care the recent bright spots to stop 
bond market players from overestimating them as clues to an 
imminent economic upturn. 
  At a press meeting Wednesday [9 March], Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii described the economy as "mixed" in a "delicate 
stage," backing off from his Sunday comment at an informal 
speech that it is his personal view the economy has hit bottom. 
  On the same day, Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno told 
reporters, "If the economic trend is poised to change, it's 
natural for long-term rates to rise but our assessment suggests 
that a more careful watch is necessary." 
  Mieno reiterated that the economy remains mixed with a 
further watch necessary over the "sustainability and 
expansionary potential" of the recent upward signs. 
  With economic indicators increasingly showing improvements 
over the past two months this year, the yield on the benchmark 
government bond issue dropped more than 1 percentage point to 
briefly top 4 percent for the first time since before the 
central bank last cut its official discount rate to a record-low 
1.75 percent. 
  Mieno advised against prematurely judging the improvements 
shown in some consumption and production indicators, with bad 
memories apparently fresh in the mind of economic policy makers. 
  At about the same time last year, financial authorities 
declared that the economy was poised to recover, given some 
clues in consumption and production. But against their 
expectations, the economy slipped further on the yen's sharp 
rise and the cold and wet summer. 
  With hopes dashed, overly pessimistic corporate and consumer 
sentiments rose and still undermine the overall economy, 
economists said. 
  This time, premature optimism poses a clear risk -- the 
continued rise in long-term rates further undermining corporate 
capital investment and putting a brake on housing spending, they 
said. 
  The higher market rates resulted in a round of hikes in 
long-term prime lending rates charged by banks to major 
companies. In addition, rates on private housing loans linked 
to the prime rates are certain to increase in April. 
  Mieno said higher long-term rates are "obviously negative" 
for the economy but it is just one of many factors determining 
business conditions. 
  Mieno said overestimated market reactions will be "digested 
in the basic economic current" and an "immediate impact is 
unlikely from the higher interest rates." 
  Fujii also said the bond market is overreacting and a 
correction is inevitable. 
  The Finance Ministry has its own reasons to stop long-term 
rates from rising since the latest rally in the bond market is 
partly blamed on its oversupply of government bonds. 
  The ministry said it plans to issue a record 36.53 trillion 
yen in government bonds in the coming fiscal year, up 6.61 
trillion yen from its original plan in the initial fiscal 1993 
budget. 
  That will break the record 29.92 trillion yen initially 
planned for the current fiscal year ending March 31. 
  On top of the two straight years of record-breaking bond 
supply, the ministry plans to increase placement in the private 
sector in fiscal 1994 because of tight budgets in the private 
sector led by its trust fund bureau. 
  Private-sector issuance is to rise 7.56 trillion yen from 
this fiscal year's initial plan to 28.76 trillion yen but the 
amount for the public sector will fall by 95 billion yen to 7.77 
trillion yen. 
  A ministry financial bureau official told reporters in 
announcing the bond plan in February that there was "no big 
concern" over rising rates as the economy remained stagnant and 
credit policy loose. 
  BOJ governor Mieno said increased bond issuance is one 
reason 
for higher long-term rates, although several other factors 
existed, such as a correction from excessive hopes for lower 
rates on the recent rally in stock prices. 
  Meanwhile, Mieno also made cautious comments in explaining 
the economic mix to avoid giving an overly pessimistic 
impression. 
  He stressed that the economy is in better shape than it was 
a 
year before, citing progressed inventory adjustments, expected 
effects from the latest 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package and 
the recent "state of remission" of the yen's rise. 
  Indeed, the latest developments seem to pose a double-edged 
sword -- higher rates if taken positively and dampened sentiment 
if taken negatively to stymie a recovery.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan's prefectural and 
municipal governments will issue a record 1,690.0 billion yen 
worth of bonds to maintain balanced budgets in the current 
fiscal year through March 31, the Home Affairs Ministry said 
Friday [11 March]. 
  The figure marks a sharp increase from 1,102.8 billion yen 
worth of issues made the previous year, the ministry said. It 
attributed the rise to a sharp decrease in prefectural tax 
income due to the recession. 
  Issues by the country's 47 prefectures account for 1,365.8 
billion yen of the total figure. It is the first time all of 
the prefectures will issue such bonds. 
  Twelve designated big cities, including Osaka and Nagoya, 
will float a combined 105.6 billion yen worth of bonds and 
650-700 other smaller autonomies 218.6 billion yen worth. 
  Prefectural and municipal governments are allowed to issue 
bonds when operational and residence taxes paid by corporations 
and others fail to reach estimated sums. The ministry estimates 
tax revenues for prefectural and municipal governments will fall 
1.4 trillion yen short of the originally projected 34.55 
trillion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Corporate business 
sentiment stopped deteriorating in February, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry said in a quarterly report 
Friday [11 March]. The industrial survey, conducted February 15 
on 162 firms in 20 sectors, said 21 percent observed 
deterioration in business conditions, an improvement from 29 
percent in the November survey. 
  On the other hand, 4 percent reported an upswing in business 
conditions, a minor increase from 3 percent in November. 
Seventeen percent forecast that business will worsen in the 
coming six months, compared with 28 percent previously. 
  Those who predicted a business pickup came to 19 percent, up 
from 12 percent, the survey showed. 
  On the course of Japan's economy, 19 percent forecast a 
recovery in six months, up from 15 percent, while 9 percent 
expect it to worsen, a change from the previous 24 percent. Of 
those polled, 95 percent replied their business conditions will 
not recover until the second half of 1994, while 98 percent said 
the domestic economy will not pick up until after the second 
half. 
  The survey found 17 percent optimistic about the likelihood 
of a rise in shipments in the coming six months, up from 14 
percent in the previous poll. Conversely, 18 percent forecast a 
drop in shipments in an improvement from 26 percent. 
  On the state of corporate inventory, 38 percent felt 
inventory to be in excess, down from 43 percent. 
  The poll revealed 25 percent expected their earnings to 
improve in the six-month period, up from 20 percent, while 21 
percent had a pessimistic outlook, down from 28 percent. 
  The survey said the nation's labor situation has worsened, 
with 27 percent feeling a manpower surplus against 22 percent in 
November. A MITI official said labor conditions serve as a 
lagging indicator for the economy. 
  The latest MITI survey contained a question regarding 
possible effects on the business mind of the yen's rapid gain in 
the middle of February. 
  Of 98 firms polled, 59 percent cited the Japanese currency's 
appreciation against the dollar as a factor eroding their 
earnings. The yen surged by a combined 6 yen-plus to the dollar 
on February 14 and 15, when the survey was conducted.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Corporations which open 
their stocks to investors will be obliged to disclose latent 
gains or losses on forward exchange contracts, starting in 
fiscal 1994, Finance Ministry officials said Monday [14 March]. 
  The officials said the decision was made in a revision of 
the 
Securities and Exchange Law, which was made public in the 
official gazette. 
  They said the new law makes it mandatory for companies 
listed 
on the market to disclose information related to forward 
exchange contracts. 
  It will mean revealing the outstanding amount of contracts 
and their value in yen terms at the time the contracts were 
signed and at the end of their business terms. 
  The officials said the decision was in line with 
recommendations made last June by an advisory panel for the 
finance and trade ministers. 
  Investors have raised demands for the disclosure of such 
information since last year after Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. 
suffered a loss of more than 100 billion yen in forward exchange 
contracts.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- The planned deregulation 
in June of interest rates on ordinary bank deposits may be 
delayed as intra-government negotiations over the issue have hit 
a snag, government sources said Monday [14 March]. 
  The Finance Ministry and the Posts and Telecommunications 
Ministry are at odds over how to set interest rates on the Posts 
Ministry's ordinary postal savings, scheduled to be liberalized 
in line with those on rival ordinary savings. 
  The Posts Ministry wants the savings' rates to be linked 
with 
market rates, such as certificate of deposit (CD) rates. 
  The Finance Ministry opposes the idea, however, and has 
demanded that ordinary savings rates move in tandem with those 
on ordinary deposits, to be set freely by banks from June. 
  The Finance Ministry has proposed that the postal savings 
bear interest rates somewhat higher than the average interest 
rates on ordinary deposits after deregulations come into force. 
  The Posts Ministry criticized the Finance Ministry for 
acting 
only for banks and ignoring the interests of consumers. 
Market-linked rates are expected to be relatively higher than 
bank-set rates. 
  "The Finance Ministry speaks on behalf of banks, which want 
to keep ordinary deposit rates as low as possible," a Posts 
Ministry official said. "The Finance Ministry should advise 
banks to be less egoistic." 
  The sources said the deadlock in the negotiations makes it 
look uncertain that a law revision required for the deregulation 
can be submitted to the Diet within April, the deadline for the 
change to be implemented in June as originally planned.

  [Text] Kushiro, Hokkaido, March 12 KYODO -- A group of 
dairy farmers in Hokkaido, northern Japan, said Saturday [12 
March] they plan to establish a new agricultural cooperative 
next month to cut the import cost of animal feed, fertilizers, 
and other materials. 
  The farmers expect to seek approval soon from the Hokkaido 
Prefectural Government on the proposed establishment of a 
regional cooperative, separate from an existing national network 
of agricultural cooperatives. 
  More than 100 farmers are likely to join the new 
cooperative. 
  Under present plans, the cooperative will sell South Korean 
fertilizers at 900 yen per 20-kilogram bag, instead of the 1,500 
yen charged by existing cooperatives, the farmers said. 
  Some farmers have complained about the allegedly high prices 
existing cooperatives charge for animal feed and fertilizers.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 13 KYODO -- A growing number of people 
in Japan are feeling misgivings about the country's food 
situation in the future, a government survey released Sunday [13 
March] said. 
  The survey showed that 71.1 percent of pollees expressed 
concern over the food situation in the future, up 8 percentage 
points from 62.8 percent in the previous survey in 1990. 
  Of those people, 66.3 percent cited as the reason for their 
concern bad harvests caused by unusual climate or natural 
disasters, sharply increasing from the previous 41.1 percent. 
  Asked about measures to secure a stable food supply, 77.4 
percent emphasized the domestic production of foodstuffs, 
slightly up from the survey before, while those who responded 
that the country should increase stockpiles shot up to 30.6 
percent from 15.4 percent. 
  The prime minister's office conducted the poll, the seventh 
of its kind, last November before Japan agreed in mid-December 
to partially open its rice market from 1995 in line with the 
results of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. 
  The survey sample covered 3,000 people aged 20 or older 
across the country with 74 percent responding. 
  It found that 77.4 percent favored the domestic production 
of 
foodstuffs even if the price is higher than products from 
overseas. The figure was more than four times the 17.4 percent 
of respondents who said they would prefer importation of cheaper 
foreign products. 
  On rice, 97.6 percent said they like the Japanese-style diet 
of rice and 94.1 percent regarded rice as the staple food in the 
country. 
  The figure for people who said the Japanese should eat more 
rice, however, dropped to around 56 percent from 68 percent in 
the previous survey. 
  Japan plans to import a total of two million tons of rice 
from China, Thailand and the United States to make up for a 
shortfall caused by a record poor domestic production last year. 
  Eating foreign rice is a rare experience for Japanese 
because 
the country has banned rice imports for many years. Since late 
February people have lined up to buy domestic rice with the 
apparent scarcity of it on the shelves. 
  Japan reversed its decades-old farm policy last December 
with 
an announcement that it will accept a compromise arrangement 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  The compromise requires Japan to buy up to 8 percent of its 
rice consumption from foreign growers over a six-year moratorium 
in return for full "tariffication" of rice imports.

<F P=106> [By Kim Chong-chin from Panmunjom] </F>
  [Text] This morning, North and South Korea held their 
working- level contact for the exchange of special envoys 
between the North and South at the House of Peace, in our side 
of Panmunjom. They are now discussing the procedure for the 
exchange of special envoys. 
  At today's contact, our side stressed that this year's Team 
Spirit exercise will be suspended, and that the third round of 
North Korean-U.S. high-level talks will proceed smoothly only if 
the exchange of special envoys is held. 
  Our side stated that it would flexibly accept North Korea's 
proposal on procedural matters if North Korea cancels its four 
demands, including the cancellation of President Kim Yong-sam's 
remarks regarding the nuclear issue that North Korea is 
demanding. 
  In his first remarks, Song Yong-tae, our side's senior 
delegate, said: It is regretful that despite the principled 
agreement between the two sides regarding the exchange of 
special envoys, the practical discussions have not proceeded 
because of the North side's demands that have nothing to do with 
the contact. He urged the North side to immediately comply with 
the discussions of the procedural issues without delaying the 
exchange of special envoys under the pretext of unjust demands. 
  Senior delegate Song Yong-tae pointed out that two of North 
Korea's demands -- including the issue of promoting the great 
unity of the whole nation proposed by the North side as an 
agenda item for the exchange of special envoys during the fifth 
North-South working- level contact -- will be met when the 
Nuclear Control Joint Committee begins operating and when the 
North-South agreement is carried out. Also, he urged the North 
side to accept the South side's proposal indicating that the 
North side's special envoy should first visit the South, that 
the envoy should stay for four nights and five days, and the 
exchange of special envoys should be made within 10 days after 
the signing of the agreement.

  [Text] On the morning of 12 March, the North held its 
sixth working-level contact with the South at the House of Peace 
in the South side's area of Panmunjom to discuss issues such as 
the actual procedures for the exchange of special envoys. 
  At today's contact, the South side stressed that this year's 
Team Spirit exercise will be suspended, and that the third round 
of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks will proceed smoothly only 
if the exchange of special envoys is held. In relation to the 
actual procedures, the South side revealed it would be willing 
to consider flexibly accepting North Korea's proposal on 
amendments to the agreement on exchanging special envoys if the 
North side renounces its four demands that include President Kim 
Yong-sam taking back his remarks regarding the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  While repeatedly demanding that "the South side must express 
its position, in any form, regarding the North side's four 
demands," Pak Yong-su, the North side's chief delegate, receded 
slightly from his previous position by saying that he would 
"take note of the South's indication that the North side's four 
demands were problematic." 
  Chief delegate Pak also proposed that they issue a joint 
communique on the will of both sides "to exchange special 
envoys" prior to adopting an agreement.

  [Text] Panmunjom, Mar. 12 (YONHAP) -- South and North 
Korean delegates met at the truce village here Saturday to 
discuss the proposed exchange of special envoys, but failed to 
reach any substantial agreement. The two sides, however, 
decided to meet again next Wednesday to carry on with their 
talks. 
  An informed source said that at the sixth working-level 
contact held at peace house in the southern sector of Panmunjom, 
North Korea eased up somewhat on its four key demands. But the 
North Koreans issued a fresh demand that the two sides jointly 
announce an "agreement on the principle of the exchange of 
special envoys" before discussing procedural matters for the 
exchange, the source said. The South brushed aside the North 
Korean proposal as unnecessary. 
  Stressing that the principle of exchanging special envoys 
has 
already been agreed, the South called on the North to begin 
discussing procedural matters, he said. 
  With Saturday's failure to agree on the envoy exchange, it 
has become practically impossible for the two Koreas to exchange 
special envoys before March 21 when the third round of 
U.S.-North Korea high-level talks are supposed to take place.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials and an article in vernacular Seoul dailies published 
on 13 March on the result of the sixth North-South contact for 
the exchange of special envoys. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries an 
800-word editorial entitled: "We Should Take a Firm Stance 
Against the North's Shirking." The editorial denounces North 
Korea for "gesturing as if it hopes to settle the issue for the 
envoy exchange" and "easing up on its four key demands while not 
agreeing to the envoy exchange." The editorial insists, in 
return, "there should be no more tolerance nor magnanimity 
toward the North." The editorial calls on the ROK and U.S. 
Governments to "firmly express their will to put off 
indefinitely the U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, set for 21 
March, and to push ahead with a plan to resume the Team Spirit 
exercise. " 
  Pointing out that the North issued a fresh demand that the 
two sides jointly announce an "agreement on the principle of the 
exchange of special envoys" before discussing procedural matters 
for the exchange, the editorial reports that "Pyongyang attempts 
to use this as overseas publicity that it has fulfilled the 
precondition of `the envoy exchange,' while neglecting to 
putting this into practice." The editorial concludes that "even 
if the North may use the same old trick of placing blame on the 
South, it is about time for us to inform the North side the 
South is discontinuing meaningless working-level contacts." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries an 
800-word editorial entitled "North Korea's True Intent is 
Imaginable." Terming North Korea's intent of holding 
working-level contacts with the ROK a "meaningless show" 
designed to realize the high-level talks with the United States, 
the editorial questions if working-level contacts are indeed 
necessary under such circumstances. Making a detailed analysis 
of North Korea's proposal that Seoul's envoy should visit 
Pyongyang first around mid-April, the editorial reports "after 
all, as Kim Il-song's birthday is 15 April, the North intends to 
reduce the envoy's mission to mere participation in Kim Il-song 
birthday celebrations and one of a congratulatory delegate." 
  With the failure to conclude discussions on the envoy 
exchange, the editorial forecasts chances that the two sides 
will exchange envoys before 21 March deadline have dimmed, 
though are not completely dead. Then the editorial calls on the 
ROK side to "deeply examine the issue on suspending the 
contacts" to further avoid being ridiculed by Pyongyang and "to 
manifest clearly to Pyongyang that our side can never accept the 
envoy exchange through its insincere show or for the purpose of 
its political celebration." The editorial concludes: "The ROK 
and U.S. Governments should demonstrate a solid bilateral 
alliance and their positive interest in inter-Korean contacts." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean on page 3 carries 
an 
800-word editorial entitled: "We Should Properly Read the 
North's True Intent." The editorial deplores that the ROK 
Government has committed two mistakes from the start of 
contacts: First, "its failure to commit in writing to the envoy 
exchange in the North Korean-U.S. agreement"; and second, its 
failure "to materialize ROK-North Korean-U.S. tripartite talks 
to discuss the North's nuclear issue and inter-Korean issues." 
The editorial contends: "This notwithstanding, the government 
is optimistic about the North-South dialogues without any 
reason." Stating that the North's basic policy toward 
unification has not changed a bit, the editorial calls on the 
government to "answer Pyongyang with firm principles by reading 
Pyongyang's true intent and avoid being caught in a trap set by 
the North." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on page 3 carries 
a 700-word article by Kang Tae-ho on chances for the 
simultaneous realization of the envoy exchange and the North 
Korean-U.S. high-level talks. The article appraises Pyongyang 
for showing flexibility by its backing down on the four 
preconditions it had set for the envoy exchange. Quoting the 
Chief ROK delegate Song Yong-tae's remark that "North Korea has 
expressed its intention that the four issues can be discussed in 
the process of exchanging envoys. This can be interpreted as a 
virtual withdrawal of the four preconditions," the article 
assesses such a stance of the North as a step forward to the 
envoy exchange. Calculating each side's loss and gain from the 
sixth round of contacts, the editorial notes "the North gained 
the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit whereas the ROK 
and U.S. sides have attained International Atomic Energy Agency 
inspection of the North's nuclear facilities." The article 
concludes: "Based on this, it is possible that the tripartite 
parties will agree to the envoy exchange simultaneously with the 
third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks."

  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States will hold updated consultations on the North 
Korean nuclear situation Saturday to discuss the results of the 
latest inter-Korean contact on exchanging special envoys. 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and visiting U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert Gallucci will meet for a luncheon 
conference with their aides that is expected to last about three 
hours. 
  Gallucci is said to have put off a scheduled press 
conference 
to later in the afternoon to allow for further consultations 
with South Korean officials following the inter-Korean contact. 
The inter-Korean contact Saturday is realistically the last 
opportunity for the two sides to reach agreement on the envoy 
exchange. 
  Washington earlier promised high-level talks with Pyongyang 
on March 21 in Geneva, on condition that the envoys have come 
and gone between the two Koreas before that date. 
  Han and Gallucci have two very different scenarios to 
consider, depending on whether the envoy exchange takes place 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in 
North Korea end successfully. Just in case, officials said they 
will draw up contingency plans for a new date for the North 
Korea-U.S. high-level meeting and the talks' agenda. 
  They will also plan for more stringent action if the IAEA 
rules that the inspection of North Korean facilities was 
unsatisfactory, including resumption of South Korea-U.S. war 
games and referral of the problem to the U.N. Security Council.

  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- Washington remains 
hopeful that inter-Korean envoy exchange will take place before 
March 21 so that it can go ahead with high-level talks with 
Pyongyang, U.S. State Department official said here Saturday. 
  Despite disappointing results at inter-Korean contact 
earlier 
in the day, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci told a 
press conference he doesn't "understand the talks as having 
broken down." 
  But he was clear that exchange of envoys was the bases to 
the 
next high-level talks with North Korea, repeatedly referring to 
the Feb. 25 "agreed conclusions" with Pyongyang with both 
Washington and Pyongyang taking simultaneous steps. 
  Gallucci, chief U.S. negotiator to the high-level 
negotiations with North Korea, had come to Seoul for 
consultations on how to counter Pyongyang's nuclear situation. 
  He refused to speculate on what would happen if North Korea 
did not meet the demand on inter-Korean envoy swap, saying only 
Seoul and Washington will "deal with that when that happens." 
  He repeated U.S. hopes of keeping the promise of the meeting 
with North Korea, leaning more toward optimism than pessimism. 
  "I would like to go to Geneva on March 21. I have not given 
up hope that the exchange (of envoys) will take place," he told 
reporters. 
  He foresaw even more difficult negotiations ahead in the 
next 
round of high-level dialogue with North Korea where he said the 
United States "is willing to go beyond the nuclear issue." 
  "But we do that only if we reach an understanding in other 
areas and move together in that direction," said Gallucci. 
These other issues are what the United States "would like the 
opportunity to talk with (North Korea) about." 
  On Feb. 25, North Korea and the United States agreed on 
simultaneous steps that brought Pyongyang's nuclear problem out 
of immediate crisis. 
  North Korea agreed to reallow International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspection on its declared facilities and to 
resume inter-Korean dialogue. 
  The United States, in return, would cancel this year's 
annual 
military exercise "Team Spirit" held jointly with South Korea 
and hold high-level dialogue with North Korea on March 21 in 
Geneva. 
  "We made clear in the days before that understanding that 
the 
meeting on 21st of March was agreed on the premise...that there 
would be exchange of envoys." 
  While not saying per se that the March 21 meeting will be 
delayed if the envoy exchange is not implemented by then, 
Gallucci said the envoys' cross visits were "the bases" to the 
steps to be taken. 
  The IAEA inspection team is currently in North Korea and in 
middle of its activities. 
  Gallucci admitted that the inspections were not going 
"perfectly smoothly, that there have been differences." 
  But like inter-Korean dialogue, "activities are still 
ongoing," said Gallucci, and the U.S. position is to wait until 
the activities are concluded in full. 
  On possibility resuming the Team Spirit this year and 
mobilizing the troops, the official said "if it became 
necessary, the forces in the United States and Republic of Korea 
would be able to accomplish that."

  [Text] The South-North working-level contact for the 
exchange of South and North special envoys was held at Panmunjom 
on 12 March. However, because no agreement was reached, the 
sides decided to meet again on 16 March. Therefore, it seems 
certain that the third round of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks 
slated for 21 March will be postponed. 
  A high-ranking government official said on 12 March: "Even 
if complete agreement were reached on 16 March on the exchange 
of special envoys, it really quite difficult for the exchange 
of special envoys to take place before 21 March. Because it was 
decided to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks after the 
exchange of special envoys, it is certain that the DPRK-U.S. 
talks slated for 21 March will be postponed." 
  The official added: "Regarding the content of the 12 March 
South-North contact, even if the 16 March contact was 
successful, the exchange of special envoys could not be possible 
before 26 March, which our side is calling for; or 31 March, 
which the North Korean side is calling for. It is believed that 
the United States will hold another New York contact with North 
Korea to adjust the date for the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
high-level talks to after the exchange of South-North special 
envoys takes place." 
  During the 12 March South-North contact, the North Korean 
side proposed to announce a "joint communique" saying that an 
agreement has been reached on the willingness to exchange 
special envoys between the two sides. Our side, however, 
rejected such a proposal. 
  In a news conference after the contact, our side's senior 
delegate, Song Yong-tae, said: "Because reaching an agreement 
on matters of different opinions is not a simple task, we cannot 
be optimistic about the exchange of the special envoys issue."

  [Text] The government decided on 12 March to indefinitely 
postpone the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks and resume the Team 
Spirit exercise sometime next month in view of the fact that the 
exchange of South-North special envoys will not take place 
before 21 March, the deadline set between the United States and 
North Korea. The ROK and the United States decided to provide a 
new joint countermeasure regarding this matter. 
  A government official revealed on 12 March: "The South-North 
working-level contact to discuss the exchange of special envoys 
was once again postponed until 16 March. Therefore, it seems 
difficult for the exchange of special envoys to take place 
before 21 March, the date slated for the third round of 
U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. The ROK and the United States 
jointly believe that the North Korean side unilaterally 
invalidated the agreement reached with the United States." 
  This official added: "It was already decided at the 11 March 
ROK-U.S. working-level strategic meeting that if the exchange of 
special envoys does not take place before 21 March, the third 
round of U.S.-DPRK high-level talks will be indefinitely 
postponed and the Team Spirit exercise will be resumed as soon 
as possible. Since the Team Spirit exercise was suspended under 
these conditions, the ROK and the United States have no problems 
in resuming the Team Spirit exercise sometime next month." 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, who 
participated in the ROK-U.S. working-level strategic meeting as 
the chief delegate, confirmed such an agreement reached between 
the ROK and the United States in a news conference on 12 March 
and said: "If the ROK and the United States determine it is 
necessary to resume the Team Spirit exercise, we are fully 
prepared to carry it out at any time. The ROK and the United 
States have already provided measures for all possible matters 
that may arise if the exchange of South-North special envoys 
does not take place." 
  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci also said: "The 
United States and North Korea agreed last month that four 
matters--the smooth inspection of North Korea's nuclear 
facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] 
inspection team; the realization of the exchange of South-North 
special envoys; the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise; and 
the holding of the third round of U.S.-DPRK high-level 
talks--must be carried out in a package deal. Even if the 
IAEA's inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities were to be 
carried out smoothly, the agreement between the United States 
and North Korea would be meaningless if the exchange of 
South-North special envoys did not take place."

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Yi Sung-chol: "Is the Exchange of </F>
Special Envoys Possible Before 21 March?"] 
  [Text] In spite of the pessimistic view on the exchange of 
North-South special envoys before 21 March, high-ranking ROK and 
U.S. officials believe that "it is not yet a desperate state," 
thus attracting the people's attention. 
  In a news conference held just before his departure from the 
ROK on the afternoon of 13 March, Robert Gallucci, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, 
said that the situation is "hopeful," unlike the general 
observation that the issue "has gone up the river," although he 
did not elaborate on this. 
  Such remarks by Assistant Secretary Gallucci may be 
construed 
as an expression of mere formality intended to not influence 
negatively the ongoing North-South working-level contacts for 
the exchange of special envoys. However, people believe that 
since he has experience in sitting face to face with the North 
Korean side during the first and second rounds of talks as 
senior delegate of the U.S. side, his remarks should not be 
taken lightly. 
  After holding the working contact on 12 March, Song 
Yong-tae, 
vice minister of the National Unification Board and our side's 
delegate to the North-South working-level contact, also revealed 
that although he is not definitely sure, the exchange of special 
envoys before 21 March is not technically impossible, thus 
making a similar suggestion to the one made by Assistant 
Secretary Gallucci. 
  Then, what is the reason they have not abandoned hope 
despite 
the prevailing general pessimism? 
  The day in which the exchange of special envoys could be 
possibly held, without breaking the "25 February North 
Korea-U.S. agreement," would be the first day of the week 
immediately following the 16 March North-South contact, or 21 
March, which is designated as the date for the North Korea-U.S. 
high-level talks. It is the unanimous view of government 
authorities that the exchange of special envoys during the 
weekend is practically impossible in view of past instances. 
Therefore, the date to which both the ROK and the United States 
pay attention is 21 March. The two countries believe it is very 
likely that North Korea will propose this date. 
  It has been learned that the two sides discussed this issue 
in depth during Assistant Secretary Gallucci's visit to the ROK. 
  North Korea will possibly propose 21 March as the date for 
exchanging special envoys because, by doing so, it can avoid 
international criticism for breaking the "25 February North 
Korea-U.S. agreement," which requires the exchange of special 
envoys before the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, and because 
it can propagandize that it is simultaneously pushing for North 
Korea-U.S. high-level talks and North-South dialogue according 
to its own intention. 
  Besides, the "21 March special envoy exchange" corresponds 
to 
North Korean foreign negotiation tactics in the "settlement of 
all problems at the same time at the last moment." 
  There is an eight-hour time difference between Seoul and 
Geneva, where the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks are to be 
held. Therefore, the exchange of special envoys on 21 March 
would not necessarily mean that "the 25 February North 
Korea-U.S. agreement" was broken. 
  The ROK and the United States have not finished finalizing 
their positions toward this speculation but are intensively 
discussing whether or not they would accept such a North Korean 
proposal. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu temporarily showed a negative 
position toward "the possibility of the special envoy exchange 
on 21 March." However, an official close to him revealed that 
Minister Han is keenly attentive to this possibility. 
  Because of President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming visit to Japan 
and China slated for 24 to 30 March, the government has not 
finalized its strategy to cope with a possible North Korean 
proposal for an envoy exchange on 21 March. 
  A relevant government official said: The 21 March special 
envoy exchange would be the best card for North Korea. Although 
there were many negative views on the proposal on our side at 
first, positive opinion is now growing gradually from the 
standpoint that it is not necessary for us to drive North Korea 
into a corner by any means.

<F P=106> [Article by Yun Yong-chan: "Why Did Prime Minister Yi Make </F>
Remarks About North Korea?"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang suddenly convened a 
news conference on 10 March and strongly criticized North Korea 
for its insincere attitude toward the working-level contact for 
the exchange of special envoys. The prime minister's office 
said that particular news conference was nothing unusual. The 
news conference itself, however, was a deliberate act to a great 
extent. 
  Prime Minister Yi called the news conference after attending 
a high-level strategic meeting at his residence in Samchong-tong 
that morning and at a time when the North-South dialogue was 
deadlocked. 
  Prime Minister Yi looked stern and expressed his 
uncomfortable feeling about North Korea. He stated: "North 
Korea assumed an insincere attitude toward the working-level 
contact," and "We doubt if North Korea has the will to exchange 
special envoys," and "We express strong regret." 
  During the news conference Prime Minister Yi primarily 
criticized North Korea for its insincere attitude, even though 
he also discussed ways to give financial assistance to 
government-patronized organizations and government restructuring. 
  He made hard-line remarks about North Korea for various 
purposes. First, we can say Prime Minister Yi felt it necessary 
to express the government's strong will, as some people 
criticized that the "government has been pulled and hauled by 
North Korea." He said that the government would not "beg" for 
dialogue with North Korea anymore. He reportedly expressed a 
strong uncomfortable feeling about North Korea at the high-level 
strategic meeting, as well. This means that the government has 
turned hard-line. 
  Prime Minister Yi made those remarks also because of the 
demand by Tom Hubbard, U.S. assistant secretary of State, and 
Warren Christopher, secretary of State, that the ROK National 
Security Law be abolished. Prime Minister Yi was much 
displeased with this interventionist demand and, therefore, felt 
it necessary to clearly express our government's own position on 
the North-South dialogue, without regard to the United States. 
  We can say that by making those remarks, Prime Minister Yi 
strongly asked North Korea to change its attitudes at the sixth 
working-level contact scheduled for 12 March. The government 
thinks that if no agreement was reached at the sixth 
working-level contact, it would be impossible for the North and 
South to exchange special envoys by 21 March, when North Korea 
and the United States are scheduled to start the third round of 
high-level talks. 
  We can also say that as it is virtually impossible to 
exchange special envoys given North Korea's attitude, Prime 
Minister Yi made those remarks in order to stress that North 
Korea would be held responsible for a possible breakup of the 
North-South talks. The government believes that North Korea has 
deliberately excluded South Korea from discussions on the 
nuclear issue and that it has also delayed the working-level 
contact for the exchange of special envoys, judging that it has 
nothing to lose even if the North Korean-U.S. talks are 
postponed.

  [Text] A relevant government official said on 11 March: 
During the course of the nuclear inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] -- which started on 3 
March -- North Korea has so far refused to allow the IAEA 
inspection team to take samples from the "hot cell," which is a 
facility to extract or process plutonium from the radiochemical 
laboratory, one of the key objects of the nuclear inspections. 
Therefore, North Korea has been in conflict with the IAEA. 
  Taking samples from the hot cell is an important means for 
the nuclear inspection to check North Korea's plutonium 
processing. Also, this is an important clue in determining the 
differences between the amount of plutonium extracted as 
declared by North Korea and the amount of plutonium North Korea 
has really processed. 
  A relevant government official said that "the ongoing 
conflict between North Korea and the IAEA regarding the nuclear 
inspection is due to North Korea's refusal to allow the 
extraction of the samples from the hot cell," and that "the IAEA 
and the United States are very dissatisfied with its refusal." 
  He said that "despite its agreement with the IAEA in the 
course of nuclear negotiations regarding the sample extraction 
from the hot cell, necessary for guaranteeing nuclear safety, 
North Korea had refused an actual inspection." 
  Concerning this, a relevant Foreign Ministry official said 
that "whether the North Korean refusal to allow the inspectors 
to obtain samples from hot cells has threatened the objective of 
the inspection is a matter that the IAEA should decide on" and 
that "we need to watch the other processes of the inspection 
because there are some other means to check the plutonium 
extraction without the extraction of samples from the hot cell."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that North Korea had trouble 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection 
team from the beginning of the inspection because it did not 
comply with the agreement to allow IAEA's full-scope inspection 
[chonmyon sachal] but only allowed limited inspection, including 
the replacement of surveillance devices. 
  It has been learned that the IAEA will closely review the 
inspection results as soon as the inspection team returns early 
this week in order to decide whether or not to call a special 
Board of Governors meeting. 
  According to information from a well-informed IAEA source 
obtained today, during the 10-day inspection, which began on 3 
March, North Korea did not allow the checking of the points for 
the full-scope inspection required by the IAEA and only allowed 
limited inspections, including the replacement of surveillance 
devices. 
  The source said North Korea only allowed limited 
inspections, 
including the replacement of surveillance devices, and that 
inspections on North Korean facilities did not go smoothly from 
the beginning. It seemed that the inspection team and the North 
Korean authorities had considerable disagreement regarding the 
broken seals in the radioactive chemical laboratory, in 
particular. 
  The source said the inspection team considered returning 
earlier than the original two-week schedule because North Korea 
did not immediately allow follow-up steps for the confirmation 
of the contents due to the broken seals in the radioactive 
chemical laboratory. 
  The inspection team finished their preparations to leave on 
11 and 12 March and will return early this week. The IAEA 
established a policy to call an emergency special Board of 
Governors meeting if it concludes that the inspections required 
by the IAEA were not conducted after receiving a more accurate 
inspection report from the inspection team.

<F P=106> [By reporter Pak Tu-sik] </F>
  [Text] It was learned on 12 March that the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has made partial changes on its 
inspection plan, in which the agency was to begin inspections on 
North Korean nuclear facilities on 3 March and finish them 
around 14 March. It decided to have some members of the 
inspection team remain in North Korea for additional inspections. 
  Since North Korea postponed inspections on the radioactive 
chemical laboratory in Yongbyon, contrary to what it had 
promised to the IAEA, and sufficient inspections cannot be 
completed by 14 March -- the deadline for scheduled inspections 
-- the IAEA decided to extend the schedule and have some members 
stay there for one or two more days to inspect the facility. It 
has been learned that the IAEA had already made a tentative 
agreement with North Korea on the inspection method of the 
radioactive chemical laboratory, which is believed to be a 
nuclear reprocessing facility. The IAEA plans to have 
inspection members, aside from the ones who will stay longer, 
return to the IAEA secretariat office in Vienna on 15 March as 
scheduled. 
  A well-informed diplomatic source in Seoul explained: "The 
IAEA actually finished inspecting the North Korean nuclear 
facilities during the past inspections and is eager to have the 
results back at the IAEA headquarters for analysis. Some 
members will stay for a more thorough inspection of the last 
radioactive chemical laboratory, and all of them will be back by 
the middle of next week." Regarding the broken seals, the IAEA 
verified the information and accepted North Korea's explanation 
that "those were because of careless handling." 
  The source said: "North Korea intended to test the will of 
the ROK and U.S. Governments by deliberately creating obstacles 
to the exchange of North and South special envoys; however, the 
IAEA appraises that North Korea accepted comparatively easily 
the IAEA inspections, which are directly connected with UN 
sanctions."

  [Text] It has been learned that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] will decide this week whether it will 
convene a special Board of Governors meeting to intensively 
discuss the North Korean nuclear issue after hearing the precise 
report of the inspection team's activities in North Korea. 
  North Korea did not allow the inspection team to immediately 
confirm whether some seals, which are the core target of the 
current inspection, were broken or not. Thus, North Korea 
restricted the team's inspection activities. The IAEA regards 
this as an act of breaking the agreement. 
  Accordingly, the IAEA inspection team was going to leave 
earlier than the originally scheduled period of two weeks. 
However, the inspection team abandoned the early departure idea 
in consideration of China's reaction. 
  The IAEA inspection team is going to leave Pyongyang around 
15 March after completing its inspection activities.

missiles with a longer range than Nodong-1 (whose range is 1,000 
km). 
  Regarding foreign papers' recent reports that North Korea is

or 3,500 km (tentatively named Taepodong 1 and 2), a government 
intelligence source said: The contents of the reports are 
generally true. U.S. intelligence authorities notified ROK 
authorities early this year about this development. 
Intelligence authorities of the two countries have thereby been 
keeping careful watch.

  [Text] Seoul, March 14 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
reorganized various factories and state-run enterprises on a 
grand scale to strengthen the competitiveness of foreign trade 
and light industry, the National Unification Board (NUB) said 
Monday. 
  NUB said that North Korea had embarked on a large-scale 
restructuring of various production facilities across the 
country, after admitting to the failure of the third seven-year 
economic development plan at the 21st plenary session of the 
party's sixth Central Committee last December. 
  Through the reorganization, the communist North is 
drastically reducing the functions and scale of heavy industry, 
while concentrating on fostering trade and light industry to 
promote exports, NUB noted. 
  A NUB official said, "North Korea's reorganization of 
production systems is focused on strengthening light industry 
and foreign trade. However, it does not mean any change in the 
fundamental economic system of socialism."

  [Text] The government will sharply relax rules concerning 
military suppliers for the U.S. armed forces in Korea to remove 
barriers to new entrants. Currently, Korean firms or individuals 
wanting to register with local administrative bodies as the 
suppliers of goods and services to the U.S. army have to meet a 
set of requirements. For instance, the firms should be 
capitalized at 50 million won ($62,000) or more, while 
individuals need to maintain a minimum daily deposit of 10 
million won for one month upon application. In addition, the 
suppliers also have to meet certain qualification conditions in 
terms of manpower and facilities stipulated by separate business 
laws. 
  The biggest obstacle for the would-be suppliers, however, 
has 
been the requirement to join a cooperative of purveyors which 
awards a clean bill for security to its members, another must to 
become a military supplier government officials said. The 
capital and qualification requirements will be abolished under 
the new rules, which will be fixed at an administrative 
deregulation meeting next week. The provision which obligates 
the obtaining of security approval will also be removed, the 
officials said. As of the end of last month, there were 534 
purveyors to the U.S. army, and their 1993 business volume 
reached $327 million, they said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, Japan and 
Russia start month-long joint testing of the East Sea from March 
18 to look for signs of contamination from radioactive waste 
dumped by Moscow, Foreign Ministry officials said Saturday. 
  The 4,000-ton Okean, a Russian survey vessel, will cover 
seven test points in the area, which lies between Korea and 
Japan, during the one-month period, officials said. 
  A total of 32 surveyers -- seven from South Korea, nine from 
Japan, 15 from Russia and one from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) -- will participate in taking samples of 
the water, seabed and plankton. 
  The three countries agreed to bear the cost equally. 
  On-the-spot test results will be out within one month after 
the Okean completes its route, but the final analysis will not 
come out until approximately a year later. 
  A second set of surveys is planned sometime in the middle of 
the year, officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korean companies 
are gearing up for serious advancement into China in time for 
President Kim Yong-sam's state visit to Beijing later in the 
month. Trade officials and industry sources said Saturday that 
major Korean companies have high hopes as they prepare to jump 
at wider Chinese investment opportunities created by the 
momentum of the Seoul- Beijing summit. 
  Samsung Electronics Co. and Goldstar Telecommunications Co. 
have their sights set on Beijing's three-phase communications 
modernization plan, which is likely to adopt the Korean 
telecommunications exchange system, time division exchange, for 
its central communications network, and are poised to expand 
production at their joint-venture factories in China. 
  Further encouragement comes from a recent visit to Beijing 
by 
a team of experts, who were assured by Chinese officials that 
serious consideration will be given to the TDX system for use in 
the communications network in the central mainland. 
  One trade official who went with the team said China is 
disillusioned by the high cost of products from Japan's NEC and 
France's Alcatel, which are currently used in the network. As a 
result, they have tentatively decided to add the Korean system 
due to its price and quality, and are currently conducting a 
final screening, the official said. 
  Seoul and Beijing are also near agreement on holding a 
large- 
scale exhibition of Korean electronic products, sponsored by the 
Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry and Electronics Industry 
Association of Korea (EIAK), in China sometime before the summer. 
  Hyundai Group Chairman Chong Se-yong and Hyundai Motor Co.'s 
vice president of exports, Paek Hyo-hi, visited China for four 
days from Feb. 27 and discussed exports of completed cars and 
possible joint ventures with senior Chinese officials. 
  Daewoo Group Chairman Kim U-chung, who already visited China 
last fall, left on an American tour on Friday with automobile 
executives to sound out opportunities there and will stop in 
China for the same reason on their way home. 
  Beijing is currently talking about allowing Korean auto 
exports in return for Korea purchasing Chinese auto parts: One 
Korean automaker is reportedly near a deal on joint manufacture 
of auto parts. 
  China, which had stuck to a policy of allowing just eight 
foreign automakers access to its market to protect its own 
industry, recently became more flexible by permitting local 
joint-venture firms to acquire two or more foreign partners. 
Industry experts predict Beijing may allow more foreign firms to 
make inroads, citing recent plans to expand production of cars 
to 2 million units and of commercial vehicles to 1 million by 
2000. 
  Korean business leaders are expected to accompany President 
Kim on his visit to China or go there beforehand to promote 
their businesses.

  [Text] Chunchon, South Korea, March 12 (YONHAP) -- 
President Kim Yong-sam was briefed Saturday on Kangwon 
Province's administrative plan for 1994 on the last leg of a 
tour of 15 provinces and cities. Governor Yi Sang-yong and 
Superintendent of Educational Affairs Kim Pyong-to explained to 
the president about Kangwon Province's plan. 
  President Kim said, "using the opportunity of Visit Korea 
Year, South Korea should promote the tourism industry and 
enhance the level of service offered to foreign tourists." He 
asked the governor to make optimum use of Kangwon's beautiful 
tourism resources and turn the province into a top-class tourist 
destination. Kangwon Province, famous for its beaches, ski 
resorts and beautiful mountains, is already the country's top 
tourist draw along with Cheju Island. 
  President Kim said, "the beautiful scenery of Sorak Mountain 
and the east coast has made the province an excellent tourist 
site." He instructed the governor to find and analyze problems 
with Kangwon Province's tourism and study composite measures to 
eliminate such problems. Kim added, "Kangwon Province is a 
`future land' which has unlimited potential for development. It 
should study its functions and role as the center of the Korean 
peninsula in the post-unification era." He told the governor to 
push ahead with a composite development plan for the 21st 
century.

  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry 
said Saturday that any Yulgok military buildup project entailing 
an outlay of 1 trillion won will require cabinet and National 
Assembly approval from next year. The ministry will make the 
minimal number of changes in force requirements but if more are 
needed, the Force Requirement Coordination Committee will 
conduct an in-depth study. 
  In addition, the ministry will set up a clear channel of 
officials responsible for every Yulgok project while simplifying 
the process of acquiring military hardware. These plans were 
contained in a report released by the ministry on Saturday. It 
was compiled by the National Defense System Improvement 
Committee, headed by the superintendent of the Korea Military 
Academy, Lt. Gen. Chang Sung. The committee studied the plans 
over a period of two months. 
  The report deals with 30 fields covering the system, 
regulations, organization and manpower of the Yulgok program and 
military supplies. It recommends 164 improvement tasks, of 
which 141 short-term items will be dealt with from this April 
through 1995 and 23 medium- and long-term problems will be 
handled after 1996. 
  "The proposal for reform of the Yulgok projects and military 
supplies procurement system placed emphasis on efficiency, 
rationality, responsibility, speciality and transparency," said 
Gen. Chang. "The committee will form a follow-up committee in 
order to push the proposed reform continuously for one year," he 
added. 
  Accordingly, the 31-member National Defense System 
Improvement Committee formed under special orders by Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae last April 10 will be disbanded as of 
Tuesday. It will be replaced by a follow-up committee 
comprising five to six officials. 
  The Yulgok project has received its budget from the 
government based on overall estimates in the past. But from 
1995, the government will decide on each project before making 
allocations, except for those requiring secrecy because of 
purchase negotiations. If any project costs more than 1 trillion 
won, the government will form a special committee of concerned 
ministers to study it before seeking cabinet and National 
Assembly approval. 
  When a change in force requirements must be made, a Force 
Requirement Adjustment Committee comprising officials from the 
Defense Ministry, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the three 
branches of the Armed Forces will study it so that the proposed 
change does not depend on any one particular official. In order 
to make it clear where responsibility lies in every stage of the 
decision-making processes, the Joint Chiefs of Staff will decide 
on changes to forces requirements and procurement methods, while 
the kinds of weapons will be decided by the ministry under the 
direction of the second assistant minister. Negotiations and 
contracts will be made by the Logistics Center (LOGC) and simple 
weapons procurement will be left to each branch of the Armed 
Forces.

  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korean business 
firms had 2,984 overseas branch offices as of the end of last 
year, the Bank of Korea said on Saturday. The figure does not 
include the overseas offices of Korean banks. 
  At the end of 1992, the number of overseas branches stood at 
2,656, meaning the figure rose by 27.3 per month over the next 
year. Based on these statistics, the current total is estimated 
at more than 3,000. But out of the branch offices, only 494 are 
actually conducting business and the remaining 2,490 are just 
offices handling liaison affairs and research. Of the branch 
offices, 1,495 are based in Asia, 694 in North America and 407 
in Europe. By country, 659 are located in the United States, 624 
in Japan, 192 in Hong Kong, 184 in China and 143 in Indonesia. 
  Last year 128 new offices were set up in China, reflecting 
Korean companies' keen interest in that country. Vietnam and 
Russia attracted 31 and 19, respectively. 
  By sector, manufacturing numbered 1,102, followed by trading 
at 693: Transportation and fishing at 296: Tourism at 234 and 
construction and services at 214. 
  Meanwhile, banks have 145 overseas offices, up 15 from 130 
at 
the end of 1992. Sixty-eight are located in Asia, 40 in North 
America, 27 in Europe, two in the Middle East and eight in other 
areas.

  [Text] Forty-eight items have been added to the list of 
products enjoying tariff reduction when they are imported by 
domestic research institutes, the Ministry of Finance said 
yesterday. The government levies only 20 percent of customs 
duties on any of the items when a research institute affiliated 
with a corporation imports them for the purpose of technology 
development. The ministry said it has given priority to the 
needs of semiconductor, auto and aerospace industries in 
selecting the new items. Favors have also been given to research 
institute working on machine tools and measurement instruments 
mainly used by small- and medium-sized corporations, it said. 
  The newly selected items include gas turbines, electron 
lithography systems, chip-mounting machines and optical wave 
length meters. Dropped from last year's list of 243 items for 
tariff reduction are 50 items, all of which can be replaced by 
locally manufactured products, the ministry said. While changing 
the specifications of another 75 items, the ministry said, the 
government has redesignated 118 items for tariff reduction. As a 
result, 241 items are eligible for tariff reduction.

  [Text] Seoul, March 14 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
decided to change the official title of "the April 19 (student) 
righteous uprising" to "the April 19 revolution" in a 
re-evaluation by the Kim Yong-sam administration of the event's 
historic significance. 
  The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said Monday 
that the change was occasioned by both popular and scholarly 
opinions, collected at public hearings and academic forums, 
urging the government to rename the historic event. 
  On April 19, 1960, students across the country rose up 
against the reputedly dictatorial and corrupt government of 
President Syngman Rhee, accused of rigging the presidential 
election on March 15, and succeeded in ousting Rhee. 
  The first South Korean president announced his resignation 
on 
April 26 and sought refuge in Hawaii on May 30. 
  The event, however, was allegedly played down by the 
following governments of Presidents Pak Chong-hui, Chon Tu-hwan 
and No Tae-u. 
  The government will consult with related ministries before 
putting the revision to the regular session of the National 
Assembly this September, seeking to change the event's title as 
stated in laws on the privileges of patriots and veterans, 
according to the ministry. 
  Meanwhile, the Education Ministry is looking into 
designating 
the event, whose title currently differs from textbook to 
textbook in middle and high schools, as "the April 19 
revolution," ministry officials said.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 12 March Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] on 11 March 
revealed that Sadayuki Hayashi, who was named deputy 
vice-minister of foreign affairs the same day, would visit the 
United States next week and meet with Bowman Cutter, deputy 
assistant to the President (for economic policy) who is the U.S. 
official in charge of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
The purpose is to look for clues on reopening the framework 
talks. 
  The United States says it will "decide on reopening the 
talks 
after studying the substance of the market liberalization 
measures to be finalized by the Japanese Government by the end 
of March," (according to Secretary of State Christopher), but 
there are unclear points, such as which area of measures the 
United States is most interested in. The MOFA is hoping to find 
out the accurate intentions of the U.S. Government and use this 
information in helping restore the relations between the 
countries. 
  In meetings with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, Secretary Christopher urged Japan to come 
up with import promotion measures which will be effective, 
saying, "Ambiguous steps are not good." Regarding market 
liberalization plans, the Japanese Government has offered to 
finalize them in two steps -- doing part of them by the end of 
March, and the rest of them by the end of June. Christopher's 
remark is believed to have been a warning to Japan against using 
this "two-step formula" as an excuse for delays, and for not 
coming up with any effective measures in March. 
  Resuming and making progress in the framework talks can be a 
justification for stopping the imposition of the Super 301 
provision (definition of unfair trade practices and nations 
engaged in such practices, and sanctions against them). Thus, 
MOFA wants to put emphasis on the work of finding out the true 
intentions of the United States with respect to resumption of 
the talks.

  [Text] The sixth working-level delegates' contact was held 
for the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and 
the South. The sixth working delegates' contact for the exchange 
of top-level special envoys of the North and the South was held 
in the South side area of Panmunjom on 12 March amid great 
expectations and interest of the people at home and abroad. The 
head of our sides' delegation made the following keynote 
statement regarding the contact: 
  We had the sixth round of contact today with a keen 
awareness 
of the importance to the nation of the mission of the delegates 
of the two sides. 
  The people at home and abroad are uneasy now about the 
prospects for the exchange of special envoys and are expressing 
deep worries over the continually slow progress of our working 
delegates' contact. Therefore, we think we should give good 
news to the people at home and abroad who are observing this 
contact by announcing a breakthrough in the present stalemate 
[kyochak sangtae] by joint efforts at today's contact, and would 
like to clarify our position. 
  As your side is aware, the issue of exchanging top-level 
special envoys of the two sides was initiated by our side, and 
we have since made all sincere efforts to realize it. 
  Our side initiated the proposal for the exchange of special 
envoys last year, from the ardent desire to truly improve and 
develop North-South relations, paying attention to your side's 
[South Korea] remarks -- as have already been reported -- that 
your side would place the nation at a foremost position and that 
no ally can be better than the nation after the launching of the 
civilian regime, expressing hopes for a meeting of top-level 
leaders at, for instance, Mt. Paektu or Mt. Halla or any place. 
  If your side truly possessed the will to resolve all the 
important issues raised between the North and the South between 
fellow countrymen, hand in hand with the national position, and 
maintained the position to hold a meeting of top-level leaders, 
your side should have sincerely accepted our new proposal for 
the exchange of special envoys. 
  Your side, however, suddenly changed the attitude you took 
in 
the initial stage of the launching of the regime and rejected 
our proposal for an envoy exchange by insisting on working talks 
on a lower level. Moreover, deviating from the national 
position, your side attempted to harm the fellow countrymen in 
cooperation with outside forces. Your side even went so far as 
to say that your side cannot shake hands with the dialogue 
partner with nuclear weapons, thus totally rejecting the envoy 
exchange. 
  In fact, our nation consists of fellow countrymen connected 
with one blood lineage whether they live in the North or in the 
South. The fellow countrymen in these relations are conducting 
large-scale nuclear war exercises against the fellow countrymen 
and seeking an international alliance [kukje kongjo cheje]. 
What need and what good will this bring about for our nation? 
  The North and South are fellow countrymen, not strangers, 
even though they have different ideas and systems. Dialogue 
between us should be dialogue for national interests, not 
dialogue for outside force, even though we have different views. 
  Therefore, from a sincere attitude of giving priority to 
national dignity and interests and resolving all issues based on 
the principle of national independence, we sometimes gave advice 
to your side and criticized your side's unjust position and 
attitude, and at other times showed generosity and concessions 
and expected that your side would assume a national position and 
become an independent dialogue partner. 
  Because we expected your side, just like our side tried to, 
would sincerely assume a national position and exchange special 
envoys for the sake of national interests, we demanded that your 
side discontinue all large-scale nuclear war exercises and 
abandon an international alliance. Moreover, we recently asked 
your side to cancel its plan to introduce Patriot missiles and 
its remarks that it cannot shake hands with those who have 
nuclear weapons. We did so not to pick a fight but to sincerely 
exchange special envoys and improve North-South relations in 
compliance with basic national interests. I think our sincere 
position has won deep sympathy from public opinion at home and 
abroad and sympathy and due support even from many people on 
your side. 
  Because the exchange of top-level special envoys of the 
North 
and South is an important matter and because the missions of 
special envoys are urgent for the sake of national interests, 
correctly solving problems, which are stumbling blocks to the 
exchange of special envoys, is a pressing task that should be 
resolved on a priority basis. 
  Our just proposal and position has not received a due 
response from your side for almost one year. We repeatedly 
expressed regret over this to your side, gave exhaustive, 
lengthy explanations and advice to your side, and patiently 
urged your side to agree on the contact for the exchange of 
special envoys. 
  As a result, your side has today changed its course toward 
exchanging special envoys -- changing last year's opposition to 
the exchange of special envoys. 
  Of course, your side's present attitude is still different 
from the position our side assumed when it proposed the exchange 
of special envoys. Your side has tried, first, to exchange 
special envoys to pursue its own interests. 
  Under circumstances in which your side has accepted our 
proposal for the exchange of special envoys and has tried to 
exchange special envoys, no matter the reason your side may have 
done so, our side would like your side to clarify its position 
on a few matters. 
  Your side must make clear, first, is that it is necessary 
for 
your side to admit that when we proposed the exchange of special 
envoys, you automatically [toponoko] opposed it. We acknowledge 
that your side must make this matter clear without fail for the 
successful exchange of special envoys. 
  The second thing your side must make clear is that your 
side consistently opposed our side's proposal regarding the 
envoy exchange in the past. 
  Our side had proposed to your side's former authorities when 
the first North-South dialogue started 20 years ago that the 
North-South summit should be held. Later, we have proposed on 
many occasions through official and unofficial channels that the 
North-South summit should take place. In particular, our side's 
special envoy visited Seoul in early April 1992 and invited your 
side's top-level leader to Pyongyang. At that time, heads of 
state and government and prominent figures of many countries 
came to Pyongyang and congratulated our respected and beloved 
leader on the occasion of his 80th birthday and had significant 
meetings with him. 
  Your side, however, even though we are the same fellow 
countrymen, did not come to Pyongyang, turning down our special 
envoy's proposal and, as a result, the North-South summit failed 
to take place. However, we have never mentioned this. 
  The reason we make this clear today is because we want to 
prevent the unpleasant past regarding the envoy exchange of the 
North and South from occurring again. 
  Realizing the exchange of special envoys by the two sides 
and 
resolving all pending issues, including the issue on 
denuclearization, through discussions is the earnest desire of 
the nation. Such being the case, under any circumstances, the 
two sides should exert joint efforts to realize the envoy 
exchange from the view of being the same fellow countrymen. By 
so doing, we will prepare a starting point for North-South 
relations. 
  Accordingly, if the two sides continue to debate over 
whether 
we cannot accept your proposal since it is yours or that you 
should accept this because it is ours by holding firm 
[choltaehwa] to its own position, as we did in today's contact, 
the opportunity for the envoy exchange, which was achieved with 
much effort, will never materialize again. 
  Out of a such stance, we deeply studied and examined your 
side's proposals and remarks made during the last working-level 
contacts and a private meeting between the heads of both sides. 
Putting all accounts together, we reached the conclusion that 
your side suggested that the issues of giving up the 
international alliance and canceling all large-scale nuclear war 
exercises, which were put forth by our side, might be dealt with 
and resolved when special envoys are exchanged. 
  Your side also said that the decision on suspending the 1994 
Team Spirit joint military exercise had been made and more 
efforts should be concentrated, from the national view point, on 
the international alliance. Your side said the plan for the 
introduction of Patriot missiles had been shelved. Your side 
said it reversed its decision not to shake hands with those who 
have nuclear weapons because the situation had changed since the 
remark was made last June and because your side's top authority 
said later that the North had no nuclear weapons judging from 
information available. 
  This position of your side, on the whole, is short of our 
expectations, but we would keep it in mind [kue yuuihagojo 
handa], as an expression of understanding the feasibility of the 
four demands we raised. 
  Therefore, I would like to put forth the following 
constructive proposal as a momentous step to conclude the 
working delegates' contact today and exchange the top-level 
special envoys of the North and the South. 
  First, I propose to take one momentous joint step to give 
the 
people at home and abroad a hope for the envoy exchange. For 
this step, we suggest that the North and the South promulgate at 
home and abroad in the form of a joint communique [kongdong 
podo] that the two sides reconfirm their intention to exchange 
top-level special envoys and have completely agreed to exchange 
the special envoys at an early date. 
  If we issue this joint communique, we will be able to give 
great joy to the people at home and abroad, who are worried 
about the prospects of the envoy exchange, and it will be a 
manifestation that the delegates of our two sides are fulfilling 
their responsibility to the nation. 
  Second, I propose that the two sides seriously discuss and 
bring to a conclusion the draft agreement on procedural matters 
that they have put forward in today's contact. In this 
connection, since our side has put forward a new 
counterproposal, fully taking into consideration the draft 
agreement that your side put forward during the previous 
contact, we think that the two sides can easily arrive at a 
settlement if we hold clause-by-clause discussions on it. 
  We think there is no reason why your side should not accept 
our new proposal. As our side has shown broad-mindedness in the 
generous position to realize the envoy exchange urgently, it can 
be said that the early realization of the envoy exchange is 
entirely dependent upon your side's attitude. We express a hope 
that the top-level special envoys of the North and the South 
will travel between Pyongyang and Seoul at an early date as a 
result of your side positively responding to our sincere 
position. [end DPRK delegate statement] 
  After the conclusion of the statement, the two sides began 
to 
discuss specific problems. Our side repeatedly urged the other 
side to take steps to announce to the nation in a joint 
communique that the two sides reconfirmed each other's intention 
of exchanging special envoys and agreed to realize it at an 
early date. The South side, however, refused to accept our 
side's proposal to take joint steps with unreasonable excuses 
and pretexts. The South side said that they can only issue a 
joint communique if the two sides agree on the working 
procedural matters as well, and made an absurd assertion that 
taking joint steps is meaningless. 
  Refuting this assertion of the South side, our side 
questioned the reason for not issuing a joint communique on the 
two sides' agreement on the exchange of special envoys now that 
all suspicions have been dissolved -- the suspicion of the South 
side that the position of our side, which initially proposed the 
envoy exchange, for the envoy exchange is doubtful [pultumyong 
hadago]; and the suspicion of our side of the doubtful view of 
the South side, which obstructed the envoy exchange by laying 
four crossing gates [negaji chadanbongul mandulgo]. 
  When the head of the delegation of our side asked the South 
side if it objects to the envoy exchange [tuksa kyohwanul 
haryonundenun tarungosi omnungarago murunde taehae], the South 
side said no. So our side stated that the intention of 
exchanging special envoys is reconfirmed. When our side asked 
the South side if it has a different opinion on the exchange of 
special envoys at an early date, the South side also said that 
it shares the same view of our side. So our side confirmed that 
the two sides share the same view on this matter as well, and 
asked under these circumstances why the two sides cannot issue a 
joint communique to inform the nation. However, the South side 
blindly opposed the issuance of a joint communique. 
  Our side repeatedly questioned if we can brand the South 
side's attitude as their lack of intention to exchange special 
envoys and as its intention to delay the envoy exchange. 
However, the South side could not reply. 
  Our side stressed again and again that there is no reason 
why 
the two sides cannot issue the communique now that the two sides 
have clearly confirmed the intention to exchange special envoys 
and shared the same view that the envoy exchange should be made 
at an early date. In addition, our side strongly asserted that 
under the circumstances in which a joint communique cannot be 
issued, the two sides should report it as each side considers 
appropriate. 
  However, the South side said that it cannot do this, either. 
  Our side said emphatically that we will report it in our 
own way [urinun uridaero podohalkosirago] irrespective of the 
South side's intention. 
  During the contact, the working procedural matters were 
discussed for the envoy exchange. 
  In the discussion of the working procedural matters, out of 
the 28 points of 13 articles contained in the draft agreements 
put forward by the two sides, they agreed in principle on all 
but four articles. 
  In the discussion of the working procedural matters, the 
South side insisted on its unreasonable position and took a 
negative attitude toward the principled and important matters 
related to the tasks of the special envoys, such as adherence of 
the North and the South to the principle of national 
independence, confirmation of the way of national reunification, 
and the promotion of the great unity of the whole nation. 
  Our side gave a logical and reasonable refutation to the 
South side's unjust assertion, repeatedly stressed the justness 
of our side's draft plan of working procedural matters, and 
hoped that the South side will take a position to bring about a 
turning point by coming to the next contact after making further 
study of our side's plan so that the two sides may affix their 
final signature to the draft agreements without fail. 
  Then followed a tete-a-tete contact of the senior delegates 
of the two sides. 
  It was agreed that the seventh working contact would be held 
at the Tongilgak in our side's area of Panmunjom on 16 March.

  [Text] JAKARTA, March 12 (AFP) -- Indonesian President 
Suharto, who has been at the helm of the world's fourth largest 
nation since 1967, said Saturday that he would step down after 
his current five-year term ends in 1998. "When do I stop? Later, 
after I have accounted for my duties in five years. So, in 
another five years I will stop," Suharto said in response to a 
question at a national consultation meeting of the 
government-sponsored Indonesian National Youth Committee. "I 
have no ambition of becoming president for life," the 
72-year-old head of state said. 
  Suharto urged qualified Indonesians to show the people their 
accomplishments so that they could possibly be elected as 
president by the People's Consultative Assembly, the country's 
highest legislative assembly. 
  "Feel free to compete, who is the (nation's) best son and 
has 
the best performance, so as to be seen by the people," Suharto 
said at the rare question and answer session at the presidential 
office. He said that aspirants could come from officialdom, the 
military or the civilian population. 
  Suharto laughed in response to a statement by one of the 
youth committee members that the organisation wanted him to 
serve another five-year term. "In that year (1998), how old 
would I be?" he replied. "This should be taken into account. The 
laws of nature prevail and should be taken into account.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, March 11 KYODO -- The United States and 
Japan are close to resolving a cellular telephone trade dispute, 
U.S. officials said Friday [11 March], predicting the deal will 
inject a healthier tone to troubled trade ties between the two 
countries. 
  "We are getting close to an agreement," U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Ron Brown said. 
  Brown told KYODO NEWS SERVICE the two sides have made 
"significant progress" in resolving their differences and 
indicated a final deal could come at any time. 
  "We are pleased with that progress but you never announce 
agreements before they are finally reached," Brown said. 
  White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers earlier Friday 
characterized the bilateral negotiations as "going very well." 
  Reports from Tokyo indicated Motorola Inc. and its Japanese 
partner, Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO), the two firms 
embroiled in the dispute, have worked out a tentative accord and 
are now working on the specifics. 
  In a statement released Friday, U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor cautioned against undue expectations over an 
imminent deal, saying the two countries have yet to work out 
"all the terms" necessary for an agreement. 
  "At this time progress has been made but the United States 
and Japan have yet to reach agreement on all the terms," Kantor 
said in a brief statement issued while on a visit to Chile. 
  The dispute stems from charges Kantor made a month ago that 
the Japanese Government has breached a 1989 trade accord that 
provides for "comparable market access" in the cellular phone 
service in Japan. 
  Kantor has threatened to impose trade sanctions on Japan 
unless there is a negotiated settlement and the U.S. Government 
is scheduled to unveil a list by March 17 of Japanese products 
that will be subject to punitive tariffs. 
  Brown sounded a note of optimism in his interview with KYODO 
when asked about the impact of a cellular phone accord on the 
overall bilateral relationship. 
  "Every success is a good sign in improving the trade 
relationship," he said. 
  Laura Tyson, head of the White House Council of Economic 
Advisers, echoed Brown's assessment. 
  A cellular phone agreement would be "a step forward in terms 
of the trade tensions and trade relations between the two 
countries," Tyson told KYODO. 
  Saddled by a vast Japanese trade surplus, trade ties between 
Japan and the U.S. have taken a sharp plunge with the collapse 
of top-level trade talks February 11 between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. 
  Kantor has seized the cellular phone dispute as an example 
of 
Japan's unwillingness to open its markets, particularly in 
high-technology sectors, to foreign competition. 
  The prospect of a settlement in the cellular phone dispute 
under the threat of U.S. sanctions has convinced some officials 
in the U.S. Government that a "get-tough" trade policy with 
Japan works. 
  "We have taken a very firm position" with regard to Japan, 
Brown told a news conference Friday. "I happen to believe that 
the results of that policy are now looming to fruition," he said.

<F P=106> [By reporter An Song-kyu from Panmunjom] </F>
  [Text] Before holding the closed-door meeting of the sixth 
South-North working-level contact on the morning of 12 March, 
delegates from the South and North expressed a strong will for 
the success of the talks. 
  Pak Yong-su, head of the North side's delegate, said: 
"Recently, when I met Koreans residing in the United States who 
were visiting North Korea, they said that prospects for the 
realization of the exchange of special envoys of the South and 
North was not that bright. They also said, however, that we 
should not be so pessimistic about this matter." 
  Pak Yong-su continued: "Since I am determined to open a 
breakthrough in today's contact, I came here with the 
determination to reach an agreement." 
  In this connection, Song Yong-tae, the South side's senior 
delegate, said: "In a news conference after the fifth 
South-North contact on 9 March, I said that the sixth round of 
contacts will mark a turning point in the success or failure of 
the contact." He also proposed: "Even though today is a 
Saturday, if we do not reach an agreement in the morning, let us 
extend the contact into the afternoon so that we can come to a 
conclusion." 
  The North Korean head delegate Pak Yong-su said: "When 
viewing the profound secrets of nature this year--the 49th 
anniversary of the `division'-- we are experiencing a rare 
phenomena with such a heavy snowfall yesterday. In particular, 
a double rainbow appeared at the summit of Chongil peak at Mt 
Paektu in mid-February. Our people view this as a sign of 
extremely good luck for our nation. We even made a song 
entitled, `Reunification Rainbow.' This has become one of the 
most popular songs." 
  In this connection Song Yong-tae responded by saying: "The 
slogans and songs on reunification are important, but what is 
more important is for us to create practical conditions for 
reunification." 
  The North Korean reporters who entered the House of Peace at 
around 0940 for the contact said: "It seems that today, some 
kind of important result will be achieved." They expressed deep 
interest in the purpose and schedule of U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State Gallucci's visit to South Korea. 
  The North Korean reporters asked to the last detail and took 
notes of the purpose and schedule of Gallucci's visit to South 
Korea. When they heard that it was decided between the ROK and 
the United States that the third round of DPRK-U.S. high-level 
talks will be postponed if the exchange of special envoys does 
not take place before 21 March, they showed a somewhat sensitive 
response by saying that it is a violation of the agreement 
reached between North Korea and the United States. 
  The delegates of the South-North contact waged a light 
verbal 
battle on whether to hold the contact openly. 
  The North Korean head delegate Pak Yong-su said: "People of 
the whole nation as well as reporters here have great 
expectations in today's contact. How about holding the contact 
openly? 
  In this connection, the South Korean senior delegate Song 
Yong-tae insisted on holding the contact behind closed doors by 
saying: "Is there a special reason for holding the contact 
openly?" 
  The North Korean head delegate said: "There is no special 
reason so let us follow your opinion and hold the contact behind 
closed doors." Thus, the contact started behind closed doors at 
1015.

  [Text] Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan is said to have offered 
to step down as Sabah chief minister to resolve the present 
crisis in the state. This was disclosed by his brother Datuk 
Jeffrey Kitingan, who is the Parti Bersatu Sabah, PBS, [Sabah 
United Party] assemblyman for Bingkor. Datuk Jeffrey said he 
will inform Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and 
his deputy, Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, of the offer in a special 
meeting tonight. 
  Datuk Jeffrey was speaking to reporters at the open house 
hosted by Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir at Sri Perdana [prime 
minister's official residence] today. 
  The three Parti Bersatu Sabah assemblymen who quit the party 
last Saturday lodged a police report against Chief Minister 
Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan and two others at the Bukit Aman 
Federal Police Headquarters early this morning. 
  UMNO [United Malays National Organization] information 
chief, 
Haji Karim Zain, said the report by the trio -- Datuk Lajim 
Ukin, Rubin Balang, and Datuk Zainal Ishak -- alleged fraud 
against Datuk Pairin, State Assembly Speaker Datuk Haji Hasan 
Alban Sandukan, and Assembly Secretary Datuk Francis Yap in 
respect of their update undated resignation letters as state 
assemblymen. 
  In their reports, lodged in about 1:45 AM, they denied that 
they had consented or given approval that their letters be 
submitted or that they had instructed anybody to put a date to 
the letters and submit them to the state assembly. 
  The three assemblymen also asked police to investigate their 
case and to take appropriate action. They were accompanied by 
two lawyers when making the police report. 
  The three state assemblymen announced their resignation from 
PBS to throw their support behind Barisan Nasional [National 
Front] last Saturday. They issued a statutory declaration 
stating that all documents or letters signed by them -- whether 
dated or undated -- pertaining to their resignation from the 
state assembly were null and void. 
  Hours after the announcement which put Datuk Pairin's 
three-week-old state government in jeopardy, Datuk Yap announced 
that the trio had resigned from the state assembly and that 
by-elections would be called.

  [Excerpt] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says he will study the 
offer by Datuk Joseph Pairin to step down as Sabah chief 
minister in order to resolve the political crisis within the 
state. The prime minister said many factors need to be 
considered before he could make any decision on the offer. 
Speaking to reporters at his Hari Raya [end of fasting month] 
open house in Kuala Lumpur, he said it was difficult to make a 
decision because many events had occurred since the state 
elections last month. He said his decision had to take into 
account the actions of several Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United 
Party, PBS] assemblymen who had resigned to join the Barisan 
Nasional [National Front]. 
  Pairin, who is PBS president, told his younger brother, 
Datuk 
Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan, who is the Bingkor assemblyman and Sabah 
Foundation director, of his wish to step down as chief minister. 
Interviewed by reporters at the prime minister's residence, Sri 
Perdana, this morning, Dr. Jeffrey said Datuk Pairin wants to 
play a different role and is prepared to withdraw as a means to 
avoid political crisis. Dr. Jeffrey is expected to convey 
Pairin's offer to Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir and Deputy Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim at a separate meeting in the 
federal capital tonight. [passage omitted]

  [Text] KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs.--THE CANBERRA TIMES, one of 
two Australian newspapers that alleged Malaysian politicians had 
been bribed by the Australian Secret Information Services 
(ASIS), will not divulge its sources to Malaysian police. 
  The daily's editor, Michele Garttan, said the sources had 
been assured of anonymity when they agreed to give their story 
to the newspaper. 
  "Their identity is confidential and we will not betray their 
trust in us," said Garttan said in a telephone interview today. 
  On whether she would cooperate with Malaysian police in 
their 
investigations, Garttan said they had not been approached as yet. 
  "We will decide on this if and when we are approached," she 
said. 
  Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Rahim Noor said on 
Tuesday that they had sought the help of the Australian Interpol 
to interview the former ASIS agents who had made the accusations. 
  Rahim said police also wanted to interview the editors and 
journalists of the THE CANBERRA TIMES and the SUNDAY TELEGRAPH 
regarding the reports. 
  Garttan said there had not been many reports in the 
Australian newspapers over the last few days on the issue as 
interest seemed to have died down. 
  The SUNDAY TELEGRAPH reported on Jan 16 that opposition 
leaders in Malaysia and Singapore had been paid bribes, while 
the report by THE CANBERRA TIMES on Feb 3 stated that the 
recipients of these bribes included Government politicians. 
  The reports claimed that the payments were made without the 
full knowledge or consent of the Australian Government. They 
claimed that payments were first made when the leaders were 
junior politicians and increased as they grew in stature. 
  It was reported today that the editor-in-chief of the SUNDAY 
TELEGRAPH, John Hardigan, had agreed to cooperate with Malaysian 
police in their investigations. 
  Police are expected to send several officers from the 
special 
team set up to investigate the allegations to Australia soon. 
The team has already recorded statements from several 
politicians here. 
  Meanwhile, the Australian journalists' union has rejected a 
Malaysian suggestion that reporters should reveal to Malaysian 
police their sources for allegations that Australian spies had 
bribed Malaysian politicians. 
  Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance national secretary 
Chris Warren said in Canberra that Australian journalists would 
not reveal this information to Malaysian authorities or anyone 
else because journalists here are bound by a code of ethics not 
to prejudice sources or breach any other confidences.

  [Text] The government is currently racking its brains for 
devising measures to open Japan's markets to U.S. products. On 
10 March, it decided to review Japanese business practices and 
the keiretsu system of interlocking corporate groups -- which 
have drawn severe criticism from foreign countries -- looking 
for possible measures to reduce Japan's trade surplus. 
  A "distribution and market opening division" is to be 
established under the Administrative Reform Promotion 
Headquarters to discuss deregulatory measures which can produce 
immediate effects. The government plans to ask the division to 
discuss business practices and review them. This idea has 
already been approved by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
has been conveyed to each ministry as the prime minister's plan. 
  According to a government source, the government decided to 
review business practices because: 1) the United States has not 
been satisfied with the measures that Japan has worked out to 
cut its trade surplus, and the government has faced difficulties 
formulating measures to open markets in priority trade areas, 
such as autos and auto parts, which resulted in the breakup of 
the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks; and 2) Japanese business 
practices lie behind arguments that "Japan is different from 
other countries" and behind U.S. demands for Japan to set 
numerical targets, as well as its impatient actions toward 
imposing sanctions on Japan. 
  The government is worried that the United States and other 
countries might intensify their criticism that "Japan's trade 
surplus is aggravating the world's employment situation" through 
a G-7 job summit scheduled in Detroit this month and a Naples 
summit in July. 
  The distribution and market opening division, which will be 
inaugurated at the end of March, is to review business practices 
and the keiretsu system. Specifically, it will review keiretsu 
transactions among interconnected business groups and groups in 
which banks form the central elements. Also, it will discuss 
group boycotting, a practice in which a group of companies 
prevent newcomers from entering their markets, as well as 
collusive bidding practices in tenders for public works 
projects. The division is expected to reach a conclusion before 
the Naples summit.

  [Text] In connection with the mobile phone issue which has 
created much trade friction between Japan and the United States, 
the U.S. Government has informally asked the Japanese Government 
to guarantee the fulfillment of a contract between the Japan 
Mobile Communications Corporation [known as IDO] and Motorola by 
preparing to impose sanctions against the IDO to force it to 
fulfill its contract with Motorola. This was disclosed on 10 
March by a source in the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications 
[MPT]. Negotiations between the IDO and Motorola have almost 
been settled, but the MPT, which sees the U.S. demand as 
unreasonable, is concerned that if the United States sticks to 
its demand, the results of the negotiations will be nil. 
  The same source said the U.S. Government has also asked the 
Japanese Government through informal channels to have the IDO 
cancel the transfer of its mobile phone business rights and 
licenses to third parties. On 10 March the IDO and Motorola 
agreed: 1) the IDO would increase the number of ground radio 
stations for its Motorola-type mobile phone service to 159, and 
2) of the NTT-type mobile phone service frequencies, 1.5 MHz 
would be allotted to the Motorola-type mobile phone service. 
Now they are meeting to finalize details of the agreement. 
  It is said the U.S. Government has been pressing the 
Japanese 
Government to promise that if the IDO fails to fulfill its 
contract with Motorola, Tokyo will impose sanctions on the IDO. 
So far the MPT has not negotiated directly with the U.S. 
Government, but a top MPT official states: "Our ministry may 
need to make a commitment in some form to the U.S. Government." 
Specifically, the ministry has thought of giving the United 
States a guarantee that it will simplify and quicken the current 
procedures for licenses. The MPT is reacting against the U.S. 
demand for fulfillment of the contract between the IDO and 
Motorola, claiming the contract cannot be fulfilled by 
administrative punishment, and any commitment to the fulfillment 
of the contract could be turned into numerical targets. The 
ministry intends to sound out the real intentions of the U.S. 
trade representative.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Market Access Equivalent to Agreement on Mobile </F>
Phones Urged"] 
  [Text] Japan-U.S. negotiations over the issue of opening 
up the Japanese mobile telephone market finally produced an 
agreement in Tokyo on 12 March. Because of this, there is no 
possibility that a retaliation list, which the United States 
prepared, will be disclosed. Since the mobile telephone issue 
was not included in the agenda of the Japan-U.S. comprehensive 
economic talks, which ruptured, attention was focused on recent 
discussions. The discussion over the phone issue was a part of 
the Japan-U.S. comprehensive talks. However, we positively 
appraise the fact that retaliation has been avoided for the time 
being. 
  The intention of the United States, which tried to solve the 
issue of economic friction by introducing strong measures, was 
to open up the Japanese market, and the marketing strategies of 
Motorola Inc., which wanted to make inroads into Japanese market 
by riding on the wave of the government's attempt, combined into 
one. It seems that Japanese businessmen, who were troubled from 
beginning to end by the offenses of the United States, just 
could not help but feel that the U.S. demands were unreasonable. 
  In the field of mobile telephones, Japan and the United 
States have intermittently had friction over the past ten years. 
Japan liberated the communications market in 1985. The United 
States immediately decided to treat the mobile telephone issue 
as a main theme of the Japan-U.S. Market-Oriented Sector 
Selective (MOSS) talks and demanded that Japan open up its 
market to the Motorola method. In 1986, the United States 
managed to obtain a pledge from Japan. 
  From the beginning, Japan was lacking individuality in its 
countermeasures and, without clarifying problem points, adopted 
the NTT and the Motorola systems, which are not compatible with 
each other, in this small country. Succumbing to the hard-line 
stance of the United States, Japan continued to make 
inconsistent compromises one after another, even after 
acceptance of the Motorola system. However, causes of friction 
continued to exist. 
  In 1989, the United States pointed out that the Japan had 
violated the MOSS agreement for mobile telephones and named 
Japanese goods which are subject to retaliation based on the 
strength of the 301 provision of the trade law. After this, 
Japan, in addition to the NTT method, allowed Motorola to 
introduce its system in Japan. At that time, the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry said "there are no more available 
frequencies." But the ministry allotted frequencies to Motorola 
at the last moment. 
  The friction over the mobile telephones was created by the 
fact that Motorola's share in the Japanese market did not grow 
as they expected and that the United States assumed a hard-line 
stance due to its fear that it would lag behind Japan in 
introducing a digital system. As far as the United States is 
concerned, the share did not grow because Motorola "was not 
given market access equal to that of the NTT." 
  In comparison, Japan actually assumed a passive stance. 
Japan repeated hasty negotiations as it did several years ago. 
Since Japan did not have firm conviction at the beginning of 
the negotiations, it continued to negotiate with the United 
States without serious commitment. Due to such an optimistic 
stance, the electric communications field became a main target 
at negotiations over trade friction. 
  As a result, Nippon Ido Tsushin Corp. (IDO) was forced to 
make a major compromise. Japanese businessmen, who sat at the 
negotiating table while feeling that U.S. demands are 
unreasonable, were once again obliged to bow to U.S. pressure. 
Now, IDO has to make a significant increase in the number of 
base stations for the Motorola system. Motorola successfully 
managed to win more frequencies as well. 
  However, it was progress that Japan and the Untied States 
became more willing than before to settle issues on a 
private-level. Both countries need to study the differences in 
feelings about "equal market access" and to deepen mutual 
understanding. We hope that Japanese and American businessmen 
will attach importance to their conversations to prevent public 
intervention from becoming excessive.

<F P=106> [Article by MAINICHI SHIMBUN Economics Department reporter </F>
Yoshiyuki Itsumi: "Accord on Talks on Mobile Phone Should Not Be 
Overestimated"] 
  [Text] With the 12 March the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. 
negotiations on mobile phones, views have been expressed within 
the government that the Japan-U.S. agreement -- which a senior 
Foreign Ministry official regards as the "first accord between 
Japan and the United States since the failure of the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks at the summit talks in February -- will 
serve as breakthrough in the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic 
relations. However, such views are the minority opinion within 
the government, and the agreement is not a guarantee that the 
Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act (sanction measures 
against unfair trade partners) will not be applied to Japan. 
Therefore, the majority of opinions within the government is 
that "it is dangerous to have an optimistic view" (according to 
a top official of Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI]). 
  The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have remained 
deadlocked. Regardless of the outcome of the recent negotiations 
on mobile phones, how the United States will assess details of 
market opening measures which the Japanese Government plans to 
announce late this month is the key to the resumption of the 
economic framework talks. The U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] 
is to pick out unfair trade partners and trade areas as the 
subject of sanctions under the Super 301 provision from a list 
of unfair trading nations and areas described in a annual report 
on foreign trade barriers which is scheduled to be worked out by 
the USTR late this month. It is most likely that dozens of 
trade items -- which involve some areas of trade with Japan -- 
will be listed in the report as unfair trade areas. 
  The recent agreement has both a bright and a dark side. 
Underlying the conclusion of the negotiations is how the U.S. 
Motorola and the USTR steamrolled the negotiations, and it seems 
that the results of the negotiations helped the United States 
reaffirm its view that "Japan gives up when pressure is 
applied." Now, the USTR can propagate that showing a stand of 
imposing sanctions is effective when holding negotiations. 
  However, there is the bright side, too. This is because the 
agreement can be taken as "a concrete signal" (according to a 
senior official of MITI) that reflects the position of the 
United States, which has said that failure in the economic 
framework talks "will not lead to a trade war between Japan and 
the United States" (as stated by Secretary of State 
Christopher). But it seems that the current jerky Japan-U.S. 
relations will remain uncorrected until the Naples summit (of 
industrial nations) is held in July.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 Mar Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Between the Japanese and U.S. Governments there are 
now emerging subtle differences of views on interpretation of 
the agreement on opening up of the cellular phones (portable and 
automobile phones) market, and this can be a new seed of trouble 
in the Japan-U.S. friction. The U.S. Government talks loudly 
about "achievements," insisting that "the Japanese Government 
has given a de facto guarantee on the use of U.S. company-made 
cellular phones," and ignoring the Japanese Government's 
refutation that "we have not given a guarantee." The United 
States indeed is poised to press for adoption of a similar 
framework of agreement in the Japan-U.S. framework talks. 
  The main point of the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular 
phones 
is that the Japanese Government has agreed to help Japan Ido 
Corporation fulfill its pledges to U.S. Motorola Company, 
including the establishment of 159 ground stations, using "all 
available measures." The seed of trouble is the difference 
between Japan and the United States over the interpretation of 
this expression -- "all available measures." 
  It looks clear that the Japanese Government wants to avoid 
giving much meaning to the expression, and Vice Foreign Minister 
Kunihiko Saito insists, "All this means is to do something like 
conducting, on a regular basis, checks on degree of progress 
being made in dealings between the private companies." But on 
the U.S. side, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor openly 
praised the accord as "the first step in result-oriented 
agreements." It is apparent that the U.S. Government interprets 
the accord as "containing in effect the government guarantee" 
regarding progress made in market access. 
  In fact, there was a fierce tug of war on this expression. 
One of the officials who took part in negotiations said, "In 
Japan's original draft, a limited expression of 'measures within 
the scope of law' was used." But at the strong resistance of 
the United States, Japan was forced to swallow the expression 
"all available measures." This shows how the United States was 
determined to get its way whether the other party wanted it or 
not. 
  Some ranking government officials are concerned about the 
United States' firm attitude lest "the automobiles and auto 
parts, which is one of the three priority areas in the economic 
consultations, should become the next target. Private auto 
manufacturers are now moving toward presenting "voluntary 
targets to purchase U.S.-made products," but the officials are 
concerned lest the U.S. Government should ask the Japanese 
Government to provide de facto guarantee on their performance as 
done in the recent agreement on cellular phones. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is 
already alarmed, insisting, "This area is different from the 
telecommunications. The government issues few permits and 
licenses in this area, hence has little room to interfere." But 
in the framework talks, confrontation between two nations 
continues -- as the United States wants to have certain future 
targets set as "objective criteria," while Japan stands by the 
position it will not accept anything other than a yardstick to 
measure the degree of the past market access. As such, there is 
the possibility that the method the U.S. Government used in the 
negotiations this time will become a "bridgehead," based on 
which the United States will push for Japan's compromise. The 
next move by the United States can be one which will put Japan 
into real anguish.

  [Text] In a 11 March Japan-U.S. Committee for 
Consultations on Security meeting, Defense Agency Director 
General Kazuo Aichi expressed his desire to somehow adopt the 
concept of the Theater Missile Defense [TMD] system in the new 
defense program, which will replace the existing "defense 
program outline." However, now views in the government and 
coalition parties are emerging questioning his TMD position, 
citing the (1969) Diet resolution on peaceful use of space and 
the doubtful performance of interceptor missiles. It is 
apparent that the matter will have to undergo further 
adjustments of views. 
  In the meeting, Director General Aichi said: "As far as I am 
concerned, I would like to present a concept (on TMD) in the 
revised program for defense." 
  Even if this concept comes to be adopted, the expression for 
"TMD" is expected to be changed to something like "missile 
defense improvement" in the new defense program. It is likely 
that the United States has taken "the remark (of Aichi) as 
Japan's pledge for cooperation in the TMD program." 
  Within the ruling coalition parties, the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] thinks the TMD concept goes against the 
Diet resolution on the peaceful use of space. On the other 
hand, from other parties there are strong voices asking: "Can 
the system cope with the Nodong-1 missiles of the DPRK (North 
Korea)?" because of the recent reports that data show the 
Patriot missiles that came into the limelight in the Gulf war in 
fact had poor accuracy.

  [Text] Kadena -- Following the leakage of jet fuel from 
Kadena Air Base [KAB], Kadena Town Assembly (chaired by Eiji 
Miyahira) unanimously adopted a "resolution to protest against 
the accident" at the beginning of a regular session which began 
on the afternoon of 11 March. Moreover, the resolution 
"protests with a sense of fury" against the U.S. military, the 
Defense Facilities Agency, and other government agencies, urging 
them to "take all possible measures to prevent similar accidents 
from happening again." 
  Nine members of the same town assembly's Special Committee 
for Base Affairs (chaired by Morisada Inamine) visited the KAB 
on 9 March and inspected the site of the accident. 
  The resolution strongly criticizes the U.S. military, 
saying: 
"Strong and foul smells enveloped the entire area, and the 
highly flammable material provoked fear among the residents. 
The anger of the townspeople has reached its outer limit. 
Accidents frequently occurred following the 1967 incident 
dubbed the "flammable well" and... These are the consequences 
of careless base management, which ignores the well-being of the 
residents." 
  Members of the town assembly plan to visit relevant 
organizations to file a protest in early April following the end 
of the regular session in March.

  [Text] On 11 March, Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota, 
commenting on the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee's 
taking up issues regarding the streamlining and consolidation of 
U.S. military bases on Okinawa, including the early return of 
Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, said: "This was a big step forward 
in resolving military base issues. It is hoped that concrete 
steps will be taken to bring about the consolidation and 
retrenchment of U.S. military forces and facilities." 
  The governor thanked Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and 
Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi, saying: "The fact 
that issues concerning the consolidation and retrenchment of 
U.S. military facilities in Okinawa were taken up at the highest 
level of consultations between Japan and the United States 
regarding security and other relevant affairs indicates a big 
step has been taken in resolving problems related to military 
bases, such as the return of U.S. military bases and prevention 
of damage caused by military bases." 
  Governor Ota also expressed some expectations, adding: "As 
indicated in such developments as the recent visit to the United 
States by Ichiro Yoneyama, director general of the Defense 
Facilities Administration Agency, the Japanese and U.S. 
Governments have come to understand the importance of military 
base issues and have thus decided to come to the negotiating 
table. It is very encouraging since this indicates that 
prospects are growing brighter toward bringing about a solution 
to our problems."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Persistent Anti-Military-Base Move Is Needed"] </F>
  [Text] A Japan-U.S. foreign and defense ministerial 
Security Consultative Committee meeting was held at the prime 
minister's official residence in Tokyo on 11 March. At the 
meeting, the issue of U.S. military bases on Okinawa was taken 
up. In a joint announcement released after the meeting, it was 
specified that "the two sides pledged to continue their efforts 
for consolidation and realignment of facilities and areas, 
particularly on Okinawa." 
  At a vice ministerial meeting held at the Defense Agency 
after the joint announcement was released, U.S. Defense 
Undersecretary Frank Wisner reportedly hinted at the possibility 
of the early return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. 
  Since the coalition government was inaugurated, Okinawa 
Prefectural Governor Ota; concerned cities, towns, and villages; 
and civic groups have been looking forward to seeing progress in 
talks on military base affairs. We appreciate the fact that at 
the first security consultative committee meeting under the new 
government, the United States indicated a forward-looking 
attitude on the return of lands being used by the U.S. forces 
and the abolition of military practices. 
  When the U.S. official's remarks on the return of the 
Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield by end of this year were reported, Yomitan 
residents welcomed the report with happy expectations. However, 
the relocation of the parachute training area and the 
maintenance of functions of the adjacent communications facility 
are preconditions for materializing the "early return" of the 
Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. When Director General Yoneyama of 
the Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA] visited the 
United States on 26 February, a high-raking U.S. official showed 
him a forward-looking attitude in connection with the return of 
the airfield. In view of this, it can be said that Defense 
Undersecretary Wisner's reported remarks were to reconfirm what 
the high-ranking U.S. official said to DFAA Director-General 
Yoneyama. 
  About this time last year, it was constantly reported that 
the U.S. forces were considering relocating the parachute 
training area to Camp Hansen adjacent to Kin town and Ginoza 
village, which later objected to the relocation of the training 
area. Unless this issue involving both Kin town and Ginoza 
village is settled, Yomitan villagers will not be able to openly 
welcome the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. 
  At the ministerial meeting, Foreign Minister Hata and 
Defense 
Agency Director General Aichi singled out the issues stemming 
from the military bases and called for the return of the Naha 
Port, the stoppage of live-fire exercise across highway 104, and 
the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. In response, 
Secretary of State Christopher reportedly said that he is aware 
of the situation. 
  If the U.S. forces should again study possible construction 
of the parachuting training area in Kin town, which is calling 
for stopping the live-fire exercise, it would run counter to the 
Japan-U.S. announcement that "the two sides pledged to continue 
their efforts for consolidation and realignment of facilities 
and areas." 
  The two governments have to bring those issues to a 
satisfactory settlement with the outcome of the ministerial 
meeting confirming that each military base issue is an important 
issue to be solved. 
  The Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee, which was 
originally started as a vice ministerial-level meeting, was 
upgraded to a ministerial meeting in December 1990. The two 
sides held the first ministerial meeting recently with the goal 
of reconfirming the two countries' stand of maintaining the 
Japan-U.S. security system amid worsening bilateral economic and 
trade relations. 
  On the issue of military bases on Okinawa, the joint 
announcement says: "The continued harmonious use of facilities 
and areas by U.S. forces in Japan is indispensable to deterrence 
and to the readiness of U.S. forces in Japan." We believe that 
maintaining harmonious relations between towns and villages is 
also indispensable in addition to harmonious relations between 
the locals and U.S. forces. 
  The Yomitan Village Office has already mapped out its own 
plan for use of lands after their return. But before that, it 
is necessary to solve such issues as land ownership involving 
former land owners and farmers who are tacitly allowed to engage 
in farming in the area of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. At 
the same time, it is necessary to take this opportunity to give 
impetus to moves calling for the return of military bases and 
the solution of issues resulting from military exercises.

  [Text] Japan-France Commission Joint Chairman Henri Martre 
(honorary chairman of Aerospatiale Co.), who is now on a visit 
to Japan to attend a general meeting of the Japan-France Club, 
granted an interview to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter in Tokyo 
on 10 March. In the interview, he stressed: "France-Japan 
cooperation in settling the issue concerning the reconstruction 
of Cambodia is a good example of cooperation between the two 
countries. On the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, it is possible for 
the two countries to make joint efforts to settle the ethnic 
strife there." In addition, he said: "In the tripolar structure 
among European nations, Japan, and the United States, 
strengthening relations between European nations and Japan is 
urgently needed." 
  Regarding the United States' reinstatement of the Super 301 
provision of the Omnibus Trade Act (sanctions measures against 
unfair trade partners), he expressed concern over the U.S. move, 
saying: "The United States' attitude is very much like someone 
sitting at a negotiating table on trade issues with a gun at 
their side." 
  The Japan-France Commission plans to submit to Prime 
Ministers Hosokawa and Balladur in the near future a report 
discussing relations between Japan and France in the long-term. 
He said the report will include a statement saying "it is 
important to improve bilateral economic relations."

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 12 March Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The "Japan-France Club," where Japanese and French 
businessmen discuss measures to strengthen ties between Japan 
and France, ended its two-day 10th general meeting on 11 March 
at a hotel in Tokyo. At the meeting, businessmen of both 
countries agreed on the view that both countries should 
cooperate with each other for economic development in such areas 
as the Asia-Pacific region. They also confirmed their 
understanding that both countries need to firmly maintain a free 
trade system without falling into protectionism. 
  During discussions at the meeting, Dietman Koji Kakizawa 
pointed out that "Japan and France should contribute to economic 
development in the Asia-Pacific region and other areas by 
expanding cooperative ties between the two countries." Alan 
Berune [name as published], advisory editor of the French 
newspaper LE FIGARO, stated: "Europe and Asia need to develop 
perfect trust (in the post-Cold War world)." 
  Regarding the Super 301 provision (designed to identify and 
retaliate against unfair trade partners and acts) of the Omnibus 
Trade Law, which the United States has revived, French 
businessmen expressed their concerns one after another. On the 
other hand, Japanese attendants disclosed their views, saying 
that "although we are against managed trade, it is necessary for 
Japan to reexamine Japanese business practices to see if there 
are some things which are unacceptable to international 
society," (according to Junichi Miyako, director of the Japan 
Comprehensive Research Institute). 
  On future ties between Japan and France, Akira Arai of NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN stressed: "The problems the world is confronted 
with now are peculiar to a changing period of history. Japan 
needs to cooperate with France and other countries to solve 
environmental, population, AIDS, and other issues."

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will visit Russia 
for two days from 20 to 21 March taking advantage of consecutive 
holidays. It was confirmed on 14 March, however, that Hata will 
not meet with President Yeltsin because he will take a two-week 
leave and will not stay in Moscow during Hata's visit to Moscow. 
The primary objective of the foreign minister's visit to Russia 
is to ask the president to reaffirm the "Tokyo Declaration" on 
which both Japan and Russia agreed last October and to express 
Japan's intention to continue its assistance for Russia's 
reforms. The foreign minister is not hiding his embarrassment at 
this development.

  [Text] Top officials of the Japanese and ROK shipbuilding 
circles held a meeting in a Tokyo hotel on the afternoon of 12 
March. While Japan, which is suffering from sluggish prices of 
ships, called on the ROK to curb the buildup of its facilities, 
the ROK refused by saying, "Japan's demand is against the move 
toward liberalization." Thus, they failed to reach an accord. 
  Another meeting of shipbuilders of Japan, the ROK, and 
European countries is scheduled for 14 and 15 March. 
  Several ROK builders, including the Samsung Heavy Industrial 
Company, have so far announced plans to build new docks for very 
large crude carriers (VLCC). With regard to their plans, 
Japanese representatives led by Shigeru Aida, chairman of the 
Shipbuilders Association of Japan, (chairman of Sumitomo Heavy 
Industries Ltd.), urged self-restraint on the buildup of 
facilities, insisting: "There is already a surplus in 
shipbuilding facilities in the world. Building more facilities 
will cause excessive competition for contracts." 
  However, ROK Shipbuilders Association Chairman Song Yong-su, 
(president of the Hanchin Heavy Industrial Company), and other 
participants insisted on difficulties in curbing the buildup of 
facilities, explaining: "We would like Japan to understand our 
circumstances. After the change of political regime, everything 
is moving toward liberalization." 
  Thanks to the increase in the yen's value against the won, 
the number of orders received by the ROK has been increasing in 
recent years, becoming number one in the world in 1993, 
exceeding that of Japan.

  [Text] Leaders of the Japan New Party [JNP], including 
Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka, will hold separate meetings 
this week with leaders of the ruling coalition parties, 
including Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary 
General Ichiro Ozawa. Through the meetings with coalition 
leaders, the JNP intends to seek their cooperation for its idea 
of setting up a "policy study group," taking into consideration 
the proposal by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, JNP 
representative, to form a unified parliamentary group of the 
ruling parties within the House of Representatives. The idea 
leads to an attempt to build a structure led by the ruling 
coalition parties in preparation for an upper house election set 
for the summer of next year as well as the next general 
elections. This JNP move means that the party has come into 
close relations with Shinseito and Komeito which are citing the 
need to form a "new party" in a bid to establish a political 
system based on two major parties. For this reason, JNP leaders 
are expected to face tough going in coordinating views with the 
SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger 
Party] which are trying to differentiate between them and the 
Shinseito-Komeito bloc. 
  Immediately after Prime Minister Hosokawa gave up his plan 
to 
reshuffle his cabinet, the JNP changed its executive members at 
the prime minister's designation, and members who have close 
ties with Sakigake have been excluded from the party executive. 
In response to this, the JNP has been activating its exchanges 
with both Shinseito and Komeito. For example, Shinseito 
Secretary General Ozawa ate successively with young JNP members, 
and young members from the JNP and Komeito have started a study 
group.

  [Text] As the most important "post-political reform" task, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa has firmed up his intention to come to 
grips with the administrative and financial reform that includes 
the merger and abolition of government ministries and agencies, 
and special corporations. The prime minister has instructed 
concerned officials in government and the ruling coalition 
parties of his intention to study ways to promote the reform. 
The prime minister is aiming to win the people's understanding 
of his intention to push for the administrative and fiscal 
reform by announcing his plans to "make the government lean" 
after judging that debates on tax increases are inevitable in 
the course of sweeping reform of the current tax system for 
Japan to prepare itself for a society of senior citizens. While 
the idea is surfacing within the ruling coalition parties of 
merging three agencies -- the National Land Agency, the Hokkaido 
Development Agency, and the Okinawa Development Agency -- the 
prime minister plans to review the need to maintain various 
corporations and business corporations. The prime minister's 
plans, however, will encounter twists and turns because the 
government ministries and agencies are expected to react against 
them. 
  The prime minister believes that his failure to mention how 
he will work to reform and streamline the administration was one 
of the reasons for the national welfare tax coming under attack. 
The prime minister thinks it is indispensable for the government 
to show a posture to make itself lean and not to meet all fiscal 
requirements through tax increases. Among the ruling coalition 
parties, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which 
wants to avoid raising the consumption tax, is responding 
positively to the prime minister's plans. 
  Along with the prime minister's intention, the 
Administrative 
and Fiscal Subcommittee in the "Tax System Reform Consultative 
Council on Social Welfare" (headed by Koken Nosaka, chairman of 
the SDPJ Diet Administration Committee), is now working on a 
full-fledged review, and a plan is surfacing for merging the 
Hokkaido Development Agency and the Okinawa Development Agency 
into bureaus in the National Land Agency. 
  The plan has been incorporated three times in all in reports 
compiled by the Second Provisional Administrative Survey Council 
in 1981 and the Second Provisional Administrative Reform 
Promotion Deliberation Council in 1987 on the need to promote 
the comprehensive and integrated development of national land, 
but it has never been put into effect. 
  In this connection, moves are afoot to reexamine the way the 
Hokkaido-Tohoku Development Finance Corporation, the Okinawa 
Development Finance Corporation, and the Amami Gunto Promotion 
Development Credit Fund are managed. The Third Administrative 
Reform Council, which tried to promote reform of special 
corporations in the closing days of the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP], scrapped plans to compile a final report in the face of 
backlash from government ministries and agencies shortly after 
the Hosokawa government was inaugurated. Taking this background 
into account, the prime minister is showing his eagerness to 
grapple with the policy task that was left unaccomplished during 
the LDP era. The prime minister is poised to study broad ways to 
merge, abolish, or privatize corporations, business 
corporations, and financial corporations, and funds whose 
management is intransparent, whose work is duplicated, and whose 
significance of existence is lost in view of the objective of 
their establishment. 
  Government ministries and agencies in Kasumigaseki [name of 
Tokyo town where government ministries and agencies are located] 
very strongly resist any reform that affects directly the fate 
of their organizations and a loss of their vested interests. In 
response to the plan for the merger of the three agencies, the 
Hokkaido Development Agency and the Okinawa Development Agency 
are voicing their strong opposition to concerned officials in 
the ruling coalition parties. Some point out that "it is 
doubtful how much in financial resources the government will be 
able to save by reorganizing government ministries and agencies, 
and reforming special corporations." 
  The prime minister, Kasumigaseki, and the ruling coalition 
parties are expected to engage in a fierce tug of war in the 
future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article in "People" column: "Prime Minister </F>
Takeshita, Who Was Feigning Sleep, Has Begun To Move! Top Secret 
Scenario for a `Keiseikai New Party' in Second Act of 
Realignment"] 
  [Text] Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, whose 
influence had grown much weaker, along with that of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP], has once again begun to move. He has 
given up on the LDP and plans formation of a new party based on 
the Obuchi faction (Keiseikai), of which he is the originator. A 
Diet member who belongs to the Obuchi faction reveals it. 
  "The idea is that, as the first step, Takeshita will change 
the identity of the Keiseikai to that of a policy group, not a 
faction. In order to do that, he will abolish the name Keiseikai 
and will also close its traditional office in the Sabo Kaikan 
Building. Having done that, he will call people from other 
factions as well, hold a study meeting on policy, and make it 
into a new party at one stroke. Kajiyama is promoting this 
Keiseikai breakup plan under Takeshita's direction." 
  The Keiseikai has a tradition that goes back to Eisaku Sato, 
so for it to leave the Sabo Kaikan, which the Tanaka and 
Takeshita factions made their stronghold, is probably a 
manifestation of extraordinary resolve. The Sabo Kaikan was also 
a symbol of the conservative mainstream. 
  We are talking about Takeshita, who turns every situation to 
his profit. He has an intricate ulterior purpose in this concept 
of a new party. According to more than one member of the 
Keiseikai, the blueprint of the Takeshita-Kajiyama line is as 
follows: First, by taking the lead in liquidating factions, 
which people have not been able to actually embark upon, 
although everyone speaks of it as one of the party reforms, 
Takeshita and Kajiyama will be able to wipe their slates 
completely clean. Next, it will sweep Diet members of other 
factions into the net under the pretext of a study group, 
without actually breaking up the organization of the Keiseikai. 
Then, when the Keiseikai has built in scale to 100 members, the 
formation of a new party; and by that Takeshita will seize, at 
one stroke, the leadership in realignment of the political 
landscape--of course, the aim of crushing Shinseito President 
Ichiro Ozawa is also concealed within this. 
  Practically speaking, there is virtually no prospect of the 
LDP recovering a majority in the next general election. 
Moreover, because of regard for how such a move would appear to 
the nation, it is difficult to conceive of a party that would 
form a coalition with the LDP in its present state. Such being 
the case, its options for getting back into the center of 
governing power are limited. 
  "The only course open is to break up the LDP and make each 
of 
the present factions into a new party. And then create a liberal 
democratic alliance and form a coalition government with such 
parties as Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party" (LDP 
Diet member). 
  In point of fact, Takeshita and Kajiyama have been making 
appeals to all quarters in order to translate this plan into 
reality. At the end of 1993, they telephoned Prime Minister 
Hosokawa any number of times to transmit their intention of 
forming a Keiseikai new party; and on 23 December, at 
Takeshita's strong request, a top secret meeting was realized at 
the Hotel Okura. At the meeting, while hinting at Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's scandals involving money and women, which have not 
yet come to public attention, Takeshita made a proposal, saying, 
"The coalition government will probably not last long either. 
Ozawa's Shinseito and Komeito do not fit in with your views of 
the constitution or your image of politics in the future. Next 
time let us form a government together." 
  Meanwhile, Kajiyama is said to be contacting SDPJ [Social 
Democratic Party of Japan] Chairman Murayama frequently and 
appealing for a cooperative relationship and establishment of a 
coalition government in the future. 
  The greatest obstacle to Takeshita and Kajiyama's plan, 
however, is still the existence of Ichiro Ozawa because Ozawa is 
also appealing to all quarters for participation in a coalition 
government. In particular, a fierce struggle has developed over 
Michio Watanabe. Watanabe, who is being courted by both 
Takeshita and Ozawa, disclosed to a close associate, "I will 
join whichever one will support me (for prime minister)." 
  In any case, it seems likely that the malice that has 
existed 
since the breakup of the Takeshita faction will also exert great 
influence on the upcoming second act of the realignment of the 
political map.
