  [Excerpts] Vientiane, March 18 (KPL) -- The new state 
policy and the socioeconomic development plan of Laos currently 
implemented until the year 2000 will ensure an 8 percent annual 
increase in economic growth. The socioeconomic activities will 
need to concentrate on management of inflation rate at a level 
of no more than 10 percent increase per annum and the promotion 
of the investment in various sectors with no less than 15 
percent of the gross domestic products. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice-president of the Committee 
for Planning and Economic Cooperation of the Lao PDR [People's 
Democratic Republic] pointed out that the economic structure in 
the country was based first and foremost on the country's 
agriculture and forestry sector which should be closely linked 
to processing industry. [passage omitted] 
  The urgent task, he said, was to concentrate efforts to 
integrated rural development activities, to improve the economic 
mechanism and get rid of the remnants of the former centralised, 
state-subsidised economic management mechanism and replacing 
this with the market-oriented mechanism. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A foreign-based Filipino communist leader, in a 
letter intercepted by military authorities, said recently that 
Jose Ma. Sison, self-exiled Communist Party of the Philippines 
(CPP) chairman, is losing his grip on Philippine and Western 
Europe cadres. Lucas Fernandez, believed to be the alias of 
revisionist bloc leader Nathan Quimpo, wrote in a letter from 
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, that Sison is no longer enjoying the 
support of communist members abroad. 
  In a press statement, the Armed Forces of the Philippines 
Civil Relations Service (CRS) quoted Quimpo as saying "almost 
all solidarity groups in Western Europe, North America, and the 
Asia- Pacific Region have started distancing themselves from 
Sison." 
  Quimpo said the Sison-led Stalinist bloc has lost support 
from revolutionary, progressive, and centrist political parties, 
including the Eurocommunities, left socialists, "greens," social 
democrats, and labor parties. As gleaned in his letter, he said 
over 60 percent of CPP members in Western Europe and 70 percent 
of National Democratic Front (NDF) members in the Philippines 
oppose Sison's leadership. 
  He accused Sison of steering the underground movement 
towards 
a more extremist and violent strategy against the government. 
"Sison is slowly transforming the CPP-NPA-NDF [Communist Party 
of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front] 
into another Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)," Quimpo said.

  [Text] The National Economic and Development Authority 
(NEDA) board yesterday approved four projects estimated to cost 
P [Philippine pesos] 34.7 billion as part of the government's 
program to spur infrastructure development in the country. Three 
projects amounting to P21.7 billion are agro-industrial projects 
while the remaining program costing P13 billion involves 
long-term urban sewerage and sanitation. 
  The agro-industrial projects approved are the Metro-Cebu 
Development Project Phase III (MCDP III), the Lower Agusan 
Development Project-Irrigation Component (LADP-IC) and the 
Strategic Industries Development Program (SIDP). These projects 
are expected to hasten agro-industrialization through 
investments in the countryside, Socio-economic Planning 
Secretary and NEDA Director General Cielito Habito said. 
  Funding support will come from loans under the 19th-Yen 
Credit package of Japan. These will be coursed through the 
Municipal Development Fund and government financial institutions 
such as the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development 
Bank of the Philippines. 
  The P15.9 billion MCDP III will include the construction of 
a 
Cebu South Expressway, a south reclamation project, an urban 
circumferential road and five new distributor roads in Cebu. 
Habito said the Japanese government was willing to shoulder 80 
percent or P6.6 billion of the Cebu South Expressway component. 
  The LADP-IC, costing some P1.09 billion, is planned to give 
farmers of Butuan City 95 kilometers of irrigation canals, 27 
kilometers of new roads and 69 kilometers of drainage canals and 
on-farm facilities. 
  The SIDP, with P4.5 billion in funds, will modernize the 
country's shipping sector. 
  The sewerage and sanitation program, meantime, will involve 
a 
national policy, strategy and action plan for urban sewerage and 
sanitation, particularly in urban areas.

<F P=106> [By Subin Khuaenkaeo in Shan State, Burma] </F>
  [Excerpts] Drug warlord Khun Sa says he will allow the 
proposed Upper Salween Dam project, which will divert water to 
Thailand, to be implemented only if the Shan State in northern 
Burma is granted independence. "Many big rivers in this area 
flow into the sea and that's not very useful. It would be 
better if we could make use of these rivers," Khun Sa, who is 
also the leader of Muang Tai Army (MTA), said. But the Upper 
Salween-Mae Taeng project is, in his opinion, a matter between 
the Shan (Tai Yai) and Thai peoples who are "brothers". "It's 
not difficult for us brothers to reach an agreement," he said. 
He insisted that it has nothing to do with the Burmese military 
junta. 
  The area designated for the dam site is located in the Shan 
State opposite Wiang Haeng in Chiang Dao District, Chiang Mai. 
It is widely speculated the project is to be financed by 
Japanese investors through Thai businessmen. 
  It is true the Salween River passes many towns belonging to 
Burma, he said, but the proposed dam site is in the Shan State 
which he claims is free from Burmese influence. "At present, 
Burma fails to extend its influence over this area. If the Thai 
Government gives money to Burma for the dam, it's definite SLORC 
(the State Law and Order Restoration Council, Burma's ruling 
junta) will use the money to purchase more weapons to kill all 
Tai Yai people. I don't want that to happen." 
  Khun Sa spoke to the BANGKOK POST at an MTA military parade 
of newly-trained soldiers at one of his camps not far from the 
headquarters. The 4,564 young soldiers, described by the drug 
warlord as excellent fighters, will be posted at strategic areas 
along the banks of the Salween River. 
  He said some Thai businessmen had visited him to convince 
him 
of the dam project, but to no avail. "I told them this is a big 
deal. The project will take some time and need many workers. I 
am also worried about the impact on natural resources, like the 
forest and wildlife." But Khun Sa said he was ready to talk to 
the Japanese investors rather than the brokers. He said he 
sympathised with the Thai people affected by drought. 
  "I wish the Thai people had a chance to use the river too. 
But they should understand that I will never allow the dam to 
materialise as long as Burma is involved and gets money to buy 
weapons. I think the Thai people will be sympathetic to us as 
well." [passage omitted] 
  In the north, more than 5,000 Burmese soldiers are heading 
towards Muang Ton and Muang Kaen in Shan State which is not very 
far from the designated dam site in Tha Sala. It is believed 
the Burmese army targeted Muang Sanklang because of its 
strategic advantages. 
  Khun Sa said his stronghold had been surrounded by the 
Burmese army for about four months. "The Burmese army reached us 
and stepped back because they dared not pull the trigger. We 
fired at them four or five times and claimed no less than 100 
lives. The Burmese then sent some 200 United Wa State Army 
fighters to attack us but they also moved back because we are in 
a better position. The Burmese soldiers came on December 1 last 
year and I have kept an eye on them ever since. I think they 
realise that they will be defeated if fighting breaks out. They 
will lose face. Therefore they dare not attack us," claimed 
Khun Sa. 
  The drug warlord said the MTA would fight to the end. "I 
always tell my soldiers that our camps are our lives and we have 
nowhere to escape. If we can keep the bases, we can keep our 
lives. Either the Burmese die or us." The Tai Yai, the name 
used for Shan people of Burma, have fought the Burmese army for 
48 years, he said. "When we had rice and money the Burmese took 
them away. We just have our lives left and Burma still wants to 
take us and use us as draught animals to carry military supplies 
for them. That's why we have to fight. I have never negotiated 
with the Burmese." 
  Khun Sa said he was not certain that negotiations would ever 
be possible."I don't think there will ever be talks. Maybe they 
don't know where I will be seated. I am a drug warlord and I am 
entitled to a higher position," he said with a laugh. 
  The MTA leader said he disagreed with the plan to invite 
Burma to attend the ASEAN meeting in Thailand as a guest 
country."In fact, the association should invite me. Burma has 
no compassion as the SLORC kills its citizens every day. Even 
the US realises this." he said.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A reliable source in the New 
Mon State Party informed PHUCHATKAN that five members of the 
party's Central Committee, namely General Htaw Mon, commander of 
the National Mon Liberation Army; Tainin Aung, leader of the Mon 
refugees; Nai Sumi, governor of (Marid) Province; Lieutenant 
General Kao; and Nai Lawin Mon, member of the New Mon State 
Party's education section; have been assigned to hold peace 
talks with the Burmese side. 
  Representing the Government during the negotiations were 
Lieutenant General Khin Ngunt, secretary general of the State 
Law and Order Reform Council or SLORC, and other high-ranking 
military officers including Major General Kett Sein, commander 
of the Burmese Army in the southeastern region. It was reported 
that Nai Shwe Kyin, 81, leader of the New Mon State Party, did 
not attend the meeting. 
  The negotiations are scheduled to begin 17 March at the 
command headquarters of the Burmese southeastern army region in 
Moulmein, where the two sides earlier held similar talks. The 
chairman of the New Mon State Party reportedly disagreed with 
the idea of holding peace talks with the SLORC because, he 
believed, the latter is insincere and has no intention of 
accepting conditions proposed by the Mon side. 
  The conditions proposed for the peace talks by the Mon 
included the presence during the negotiations of representatives 
of neutral nations, news media, and the United Nations, release 
of all political prisoners, a nationwide cease fire, and 
meetings with representatives of the DAB, or Democratic Alliance 
of Burma. Rangoon could not accept all the conditions proposed 
by the two factions, particularly the one calling for the 
meeting to be held in Thailand, because the request was turned 
down by the Thai Government. 
  A source in the New Mon State Party said the party has 
accepted the proposal for cease-fire talks because it wanted to 
demonstrate its intention to settle the conflict through 
peaceful means. The success of the negotiations, however, 
depends on the sincerity of the SLORC. He noted that the 
party's decision to come to the negotiating table with the SLORC 
should not be viewed as an act of disarmament or giving up the 
struggle for the Mon national cause. As long as the military 
regime is in power, the party will not give up its weapons. 
  A [Thai] National Security Council source told PHUCHATKAN 
that the cease-fire talks between the Mon and SLORC are likely 
to be successful. The two sides are expected to sign a 
cease-fire agreement in April. The Karen group will reportedly 
hold peace talks with Rangoon in the near future.

  [Text] The Japanese Government is reluctant to accept a 
U.S. Government demand to further open Japan's markets to U.S. 
products in the automobile and auto parts and semiconductors 
sectors, in addition to the mobile telephones (portable and car 
telephones) sector. It says this would constitute "excessive 
intervention in the private sector." 
  Private businesses, too, are all reacting strongly against 
the United States, bewildered at its hard-line attitude. The 
Japanese automobile industry has made firm its plan to set up a 
consultative body together with the U.S. Big Three automakers to 
discuss ways to increase Japanese procurement of American 
automobiles. The government, thus, plans to emphasize these 
points to gain U.S. understanding. 
  The United States is seeking a new action program aimed at 
maintaining the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor 
market at a 20-percent level. In this regard, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] stresses that "a 
20-percent share was never a commitment, to begin with." Even 
if the United States should formally ask Japan to work out an 
action program at bilateral consultations to be held in Hawaii 
next week, MITI officials plan to tell U.S. negotiators that 
Japan "cannot accept share-based targets." 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese semiconductor industry has reacted 
to 
the situation in a relatively calm manner, saying that its 
"relations with the U.S. semiconductor industry are not in a 
critical state," (as stated by an executive official at a major 
electronics maker). The reason is that although the foreign 
share of the domestic semiconductor market has indeed shown a 
downward trend, sales of foreign semiconductors have steadily 
increased. 
  According to the Users' Committee of Foreign Semiconductors 
(UCOM), which has been organized by domestic electronics 
businesses, the sales of foreign semiconductors in Japan in the 
first half (April-September) of fiscal year 1993 increased by 25 
percent over the same period in the previous fiscal year. As a 
result, hardly any U.S. maker has voiced dissatisfaction, even 
though the share of foreign semiconductors in the Japanese 
market has dropped. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has asked the 
Japanese Government to guarantee further opening its markets to 
American automobiles and auto parts. In this regard, MITI has 
expressed strong objection, saying that "the automobiles sector 
is a free market since access is not limited in terms of 
locality, in contrast to the case of mobile telephones," (as 
stated by MITI Deputy Vice Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu). 
  In the case of mobile telephones, the government has the 
authority over issuing licenses regarding such matters as the 
use of certain frequencies. MITI, however, stresses "the 
automobile sector is a matter of private business, and 
intervention in this sector would run contrary to a principle in 
the framework trade talks that efforts would be made to increase 
market access in areas which the government is capable of 
handling," (as stated by a senior MITI official). 
  Japanese automakers, which have given consideration to U.S. 
demands and are currently working on a new plan for purchasing 
American auto parts, have also begun to stiffen their attitudes. 
They maintain that "since the purchase plan is purely a 
voluntary target, it would definitely lead to managed trade if 
government guarantees were to be included," (as stated by a 
senior official at a major automaker). 
  The Honda Motor Co., Ltd., which plans to purchase 
approximately $4.9 billion worth of American auto parts in 
fiscal year 1994, finds it difficult to fulfill its plan due to 
dropping sales in its passenger vehicles department. 
Consequently, the company "is considering plans to hammer out 
cooperation with U.S. firms again on a medium- and long-term 
basis," (as stated by a company executive).

  [Text] A "draft package of measures to open the Japanese 
market and expand Japan's domestic demand" that the government 
is mapping out this month in a bid to break the deadlock in 
Japan-U.S. economic talks, came to light on 16 March. The major 
points of the draft package of measures are to 1) review the 
basic plan for public investment; 2) use financial and 
investment loans to promote Japan's imports and foreign 
investments in Japan and 3) promote deregulation and establish 
objective criteria to deal with bilateral negotiations on 
individual sectors under the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks. The Finance Ministry, however, disapproves of expanding 
public investment, and the coordination of views within the 
government will be sped up in the future. 
  There are two draft packages. One has been mapped out by the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] with the 
intentions of the private sector taken into account, and the 
other has been worked out by the Prime Minister's Office. The 
two packages place priority on macroeconomic policy. The 
"United States is interested in bilateral negotiations on the 
individual sectors rather than in macroeconomic policy," (says a 
source at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo). There is a growing view 
among some government officials that "even if Japan comes up 
with macroeconomic policy that gives no pain to anyone, it could 
not break the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks. The government and the private sector should work on 
bilateral negotiations on the individual sectors with a resolve 
to suffer pain." The government will make a political decision, 
and the eleventh-hour coordination of views within the 
government will be reached. 
  According to the draft package, the government, in line with 
the macroeconomic policy, will review the basic plan for public 
investment that envisions an investment of 430 trillion yen by 
the year 2000, cuts income tax and residential taxes by 20 
percent uniformly for one year, and studies the possibility of 
setting numerical targets for reducing Japan's current account 
surplus. 
  The review of the basic plan for public investment will 
raise 
the question of whether it is compatible with the current 
Five-Year Plan for Economic Development that the Miyazawa 
government under the Liberal Democratic Party drew up in June 
1993 with the aim of building Japan into a life-style 
superpower. For this reason, the government is likely to ask 
the Economic Deliberation Council to discuss ways to formulate a 
new five-year plan within this year. In the course of 
discussing the ways, the council is likely to specifically 
recommend how much should be added to the basic plan for public 
investment. The draft package worked out by the Prime 
Minister's Office clearly indicates that the basic plan for 
public investment should be increased by 100 trillion yen. The 
draft package formulated by MITI gives no specific figure. The 
final package of measures to open the Japanese market that the 
government will map out during March is expected to only 
indicate the need for a review of the basic plan for public 
investment for early legislation. 
  As for the tax cut issue, the government's position is that 
it will wait until the ruling party Tax System Reform 
Consultative Council completes its debate, but the government is 
hoping for an early settlement to revamping the current tax 
system. With regard to setting numerical targets to reduce 
Japan's current account surplus, the draft package of the Prime 
Minister's Office calls for studying the possibility of reducing 
Japan's current account surplus to about 2.0 percent of the 
gross domestic product (GDP) as Japan's voluntary medium-term 
numerical target. The Finance Ministry and the Economic 
Planning Agency have reacted strongly against setting such a 
numerical target on the grounds that if Japan fails to meet the 
numerical target, the United States may slap sanctions on Japan. 
  As steps to promote foreign investments in Japan, the Japan 
Development Bank will give American firms more access to the 
current low-interest loan system by using financial and 
investment loan funds. As measures to promote Japan's imports, 
presently under consideration are the expanded application of 
the preferential tax system, the upgrading of the import 
infrastructure, the construction of more port terminals, and the 
use of financial resources to implement public works projects. 
  As to the bilateral negotiations on individual sectors under 
the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the draft package 
provides ways to deal with three priority sectors. In the 
government's procurement of telecommunications gear and medical 
equipment, the government will study the possibility of setting 
objective criteria to measure the trend of government 
procurement which has increased in the past. As for the 
insurance, automobile and auto parts sectors, the government 
will deal with them by relaxing regulations.

  [Text] The U.S. Department of Transportation has refused 
to allow the Japan Air Lines to inaugurate a regular 
Sendai-Honolulu flight. Commenting on the refusal by the U.S. 
Department of Transport at a news conference on 17 March, 
Michihiko Matsuo, administrative vice minister of the Transport 
Ministry, criticized the U.S. Department of Transportation, 
saying, "Japan has the right to ask the United States to allow 
the inauguration of such a new regular flight for the Japanese 
airline in accordance with the Japan-U.S. Aviation Agreement." 
As for Japan's countermeasures, including restrictions on 
flights by American airlines to Japan, he said, "What we have to 
do first is to continue to ask the United States to go along 
with our request for opening the regular flight." In this way, 
he made clear that Japan will not think of taking any 
countermeasures against the United States for the time being. 
  The Japan Air Lines planned to inaugurate its first 
Sendai-Honolulu regular flight on 17 March, but it hurriedly 
shifted to a charter flight. The chartered airliner with 275 
passengers aboard left Sendai for Honolulu on the evening of 17 
March.

  [Text] On 16 March, the Japanese automobile industry 
decided on the outline of its voluntary plan to increase 
purchases of U.S. products. Following the breakdown of the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks in February, the industry 
has been studying measures to increase purchases of U.S.-made 
products at the private-sector level. The two main points of 
the plan are: 1) to set up a new consultative organization 
between the U.S. Big Three automakers and Japanese car dealers 
in the field of finished cars; and 2) to increase members of the 
existing consultative body between Japanese automakers and the 
U.S. auto parts industry in the auto parts field. The Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association [Jikokai or JAMA] (chaired 
by Yutaka Kume) and other organizations will brief the U.S. 
industry on the plan. Together with voluntary plans now under 
study by individual automakers, including Toyota Motor 
Corporation, the Japanese industry intends to make a final 
decision on its plan by late this month when the government is 
to issue its study on a package of market-opening measures. 
  As far as the expansion of imports of finished cars is 
concerned, JAMA will serve as mediator in urging the Big Three 
automakers to set up a consultative body between the Japan 
Automobile Dealers Association (chaired by Keishin Kato) and the 
U.S. Automobile Manufactures Association, an organization of 
U.S. automakers. JAMA has maintained that "the increase in 
sales of American cars on the Japanese market is decided by the 
thinking of consumers," (as stated by JAMA Chairman Kume). 
Because JAMA has stated the need for U.S. makers to negotiate 
directly with Japanese dealers, it plans to establish a venue 
for negotiations between the two sides. 
  Meanwhile, JAMA and the U.S. Motor Equipment Manufacturers 
Association (MEMA) have already set up a consultative body in 
the auto parts field. The Japan Auto Parts Manufacturers 
Association (Bukokai, chaired by Masao Itagaki) plans to join 
the consultative body. Because about 140 auto parts makers of 
Bukokai, which has approximately 500 members, own production 
bases in the United States, the association intends to increase 
those Japanese-affiliated makers' procurement of auto parts in 
the United States.

  [Text] The information and telecommunications working 
group of the government's headquarters for promotion of 
administrative reform (headed by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa) held its first meeting at the prime minister's 
official residence on the morning of 14 March. Using the 
"Information Super Highway Project," which the United States 
plans to introduce by 2000, as a model, the group confirmed that 
it will study the possibility of promoting a similar project 
aimed at easing regulations and creating new projects in the 
field of information and telecommunications. 
  In the United States, Vice President Albert Gore has played 
a 
major role in promoting the "National Information Infrastructure 
(NII) Concept" (also known as the Information Super Highway 
Concept). This is designed to create optical fiber 
communication networks throughout the nation and link ordinary 
households to various places -- such as schools, hospitals, and 
libraries -- and enabling people to exchange data through 
screens. To popularize this system under the private sector's 
leadership, the U.S. Government has studied the easing of 
regulations, give preferential tax treatment, and grant 
subsidies to promote technological renovation. From the same 
viewpoint as that of the United States, Japan will promote its 
own project. 
  The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and NTT [Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation] have already showed a 
concept designed to construct optical fiber communication 
networks by 2010. However, at the 14 May meeting, the working 
group of the headquarters for promotion of administrative reform 
clearly launched a plan to study the concept from the viewpoint 
of easing government regulations. 
  The prime minister gave a speech at this meeting and said: 
"Deregulation is one of my cabinet's biggest tasks. I would 
like you to tackle this task to bring about tangible results. 
Although time for this work is limited, I would like to ask for 
thorough and in-depth discussions on this matter." In this way, 
he explained that he expects the working group to present 
concrete measures to ease regulations in the information and 
telecommunications sector. 
  The group comprises five ministers, including the prime 
minister, the international trade and industry minister, and the 
posts and telecommunications minister, as official members and 
four experts from the private sector, such as Takeo Shiina, 
chairman of IBM Japan. The group aims at reviewing the current 
regulations to help the industrial sectors create new projects 
in the information and telecommunications sector. 
  This is the administrative reform headquarters' second 
working group following the first 1 March one on housing and 
land transactions. The headquarters plans to form another 
working group for expanding imports, opening up the market, and 
improving the distribution system late March. By starting these 
three working groups, the headquarters intends to work out 
comprehensive measures for deregulation, hopefully by late June.

  [Text] Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and 
industry, when asked about reports that the United States wants 
Japan to ease 45 instances of regulations, admitted, "I 
understand that such a request came in January in addition to 
the three priority areas in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework 
talks." Talking to reporters following a cabinet meeting on 15 
March, Kumagai then said, "It will be impossible to finalize 
deregulation issues by the end of March; it will probably take 
until the end of June to resolve them." 
  As for the direction of future tax cuts and financial 
resources to cover the resulting shortfalls in revenue, which 
are the issues that the United States is concerned about, the 
minister said: "Because the matter will have an impact on the 
formulation of the 1995 budget, we must arrive at a conclusion 
on it by the end of June. I am shocked by the thinking of some 
people who believe that this matter can be put off." The 
minister insisted that the matter should be settled by the time 
of the [Naples G-7] summit, and he served a warning to the 
members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan and others who 
are indecisive about the tax-cut question.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called on 
parliamentary vice ministers to come up with deregulation 
measures and remedies for such exclusionary business practices 
as keiretsu [interlocking corporate groups]. He made the 
remarks at a meeting of parliamentary vice ministers held at the 
second office building for lower house members on 17 March. 
  Hosokawa then stressed his intention to strengthen 
enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law. Also, he called for the 
vice ministers' positive attitudes toward narrowing disparity 
between Japanese and international prices, saying: "I want all 
of you to work on the subject without exceptions because this is 
closely related to the consumers' interests."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Negotiations Should Be Held Toward Achieving </F>
the Return of the Yomitan Airfield Within This Year"] 
  [Text] A plan is taking shape for the return of the Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield [YAA] used by U.S. military forces. This 
return is strongly demanded by local residents, particularly the 
residents of Yomitan village, where the YAA is located. 
  This issue was taken up for discussion at a meeting between 
the visiting Frank Wisner, U.S. under secretary of defense [for 
policy], and Shigeru Hatakeyama, Japanese Defense Agency vice 
minister. During the meeting, Wisner reportedly indicated the 
United States' intention to return the YAA as early as this 
year, saying: "In the near future, certain progress is expected 
to be made in talks (on the return)." 
  Ichiro Yoneyama, Defense Facilities Administration Agency 
[DFAA] director general, visited the United States in late 
February in a bid to settle issues concerning the U.S. military 
bases in Okinawa. As for the return of the YAA, a U.S. 
Government official told Yoneyama that "we will study the 
possibility of returning it." Thus, the United States appears 
to be studying details of the plan for its return. 
  Yomitan villagers are pleased wholeheartedly by the report 
that the YAA may be returned as early as this year, and all the 
more so because they have earnestly called for its return. 
Yomitan village Mayor Tokushin Yamaguchi said: "I have waited 
for this day. I have a lump in my throat all the more so 
because the struggle for the return has been hard." The 
feelings of the local people are completely understandable. 
  However, it does not seem that a "return within this year" 
has become definite. Japanese Foreign Ministry and DFAA 
officials have denied the possibility of the return within this 
year, explaining that the United States merely said that among 
the three plans presently under consideration (the return of the 
Naha naval port, the transfer of functions and the return of the 
YAA, and the cancellation of live-fire exercises across 
Prefectural Highway 104), "the return of the YAA may be 
possible." On the contrary, a senior DFAA official said that 
the possibility of its being returned within this year is "very 
low." 
  It appears premature to be pleased by the report. However, 
judging from Wisner's remarks after the U.S. Government 
indicated its views to Yoneyama, it is certain that the United 
States is studying in an in-depth manner the details of the plan 
to return the YAA. 
  Prior to the Wisner-Hatakeyama talks, a ministerial-level 
meeting of the Japanese-U.S. Security Consultative Committee was 
held and was attended by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Defense 
Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, Under Secretary of Defense Frank Wisner, and 
other officials. A statement saying that the retrenchment and 
consolidation of U.S. military bases on Okinawa will continue to 
be discussed was included in the joint communique released after 
the meeting. The meeting was aimed at confirming that the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is still playing an important role. 
It is believed that Japan and the United States are currently 
discussing intensively the retrenchment and consolidation of 
U.S. military bases on Okinawa because Aichi during the meeting 
touched on the return of the Naha naval port and the two other 
plans. 
  U.S. military bases on Okinawa were built during the cold 
war 
era as frontline strongholds of the West. However, the global 
situation has changed greatly in these 50 years after the last 
war. The cold war between the East and West has ended, and the 
Japanese-U.S. relationship has also changed. Above all, Japan's 
international status has improved. In spite of this, extensive 
bases of foreign military forces are located on Okinawa, which 
is part of Japan, thus obstructing economic development and 
becoming great a impediment to the people's livelihood. We 
cannot ignore such a situation any longer. That is why the DFAA 
director general himself visited the United States to settle the 
return of the Naha naval port and the two other issues. 
  Efforts must be made so that Yomitan villagers' and Okinawan 
residents' elation will not be in vain. The government should 
strongly urge the U.S. Government to return its bases, including 
the YAA, at an early date to meet the demands of Okinawa's 
residents.

  [Text] Speaking at a news conference on 14 March, Shigeru 
Hatakeyama, Defense Agency [DA] administrative vice minister, 
referred to the issue of Japan's possible participation in the 
U.S.- proposed theater missile defense (TMD) plan and said that 
"if a technical and special study finds (TMD) to be needed, we 
want to work positively for the plan," thus indicating a 
positive attitude toward developing TMD. 
  Vice Minister Hatakeyama then said, "If the government plans 
to formulate a new defense program outline, we want to add our 
position on TMD to it." In this way, he hinted that whether 
Japan should participate in the plan will be decided, it is 
hoped, by end of this year because the new defense program 
outline is scheduled to be formulated this year. 
  The TMD plan seeks to protect its allied members from being 
attacked by the ballistic missiles of North Korea and other 
nations which are suspected of developing nuclear weapons by 
locating their missiles with reconnaissance satellites and the 
airborne warning and control system (AWACS) and then 
intercepting them with the theater high-altitude area defense 
(THAAD) system and improved Patriot missiles. 
  The United States has been calling for Japan's participation 
in TMD. In this connection, at the Japanese-U.S. Security 
Consultative Committee talks held on 11 March, DA Director 
General Kazuo Aichi said that "we are considering defining 
(Japan's cooperation in developing the TMD) in the new defense 
program outline," thus indicating a positive view on Japan's 
possible participation in TMD.

  [Text] The details of a comprehensive Russian aid program, 
which Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata plans to present to 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev during talks with him, 
were disclosed on 16 March. Hata is scheduled to visit Russia 
on 19 March. 
  According to the disclosure, Japan plans to extend $60 
million in aid in two stages to help promote reform in Russia. 
In the first stage, $40 million is to be used for specific 
projects. The main feature of the aid program is the opening of 
a "Research Center for Education on Japanese Business 
Management" (tentative name) to be utilized for a business 
management course under the Moscow University's economics 
department. The purpose of the research center is to teach 
Russian students about Japanese business management and 
financial know-how, among other topics. Approximately $10 
million is to be appropriated for the research center's 
construction. The aid program is aimed at promoting a smooth 
transition of the Russian economy to a free market economy by 
taking full advantage of Japan's experience -- as a nation which 
has developed into an "economic superpower" -- in postwar 
rehabilitation and reconstruction. Japan is the first nation to 
extend such an aid program, the primary objective of which is to 
foster human resources. 
  This aid program is in line with agreements made at the 
summit meeting of major industrialized nations (G-7) held last 
April. These agreements have served as the basis of Japanese aid 
to Russia. Japan and Russia have previously considered plans to 
work out specific projects on the basis of documents drawn up 
between the governments of the two nations regarding agreements 
on implementing Japanese support in promoting reform in Russia 
and humanitarian aid. The two nations worked out the agreements 
during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. 
  The research center to be constructed on the campus at 
Moscow 
University is scheduled to open in September 1995. Courses are 
to be set up on such topics as the privatization of state-run 
enterprises, banking and financial know-how, and the Japanese 
language. Business experts at private Japanese firms and banks 
are to be sent to the research center as instructors. 
  Future plans are to model the research center after the 
so-called "business schools" in the United States. It is hoped 
that the research center "will become a center for personnel 
exchanges between Japan and Russia," (as stated by a Foreign 
Ministry source). Foreign Minister Hata plans to sign papers for 
the agreement on construction of the research center when he 
visits Russia. 
  In addition, there are plans to set up training facilities, 
called "Japan Centers," in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. Here, 
seminars will be held on business management, the Japanese 
language, and other subjects for businessmen, public employees, 
and students. Another $10 million is to be appropriated for the 
construction of these facilities.

  [Text] Concerning Japan's plutonium policy, a senior 
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] said on 17 March that "Japan should pace down (the use of 
plutonium)." His remark indicates that the government intends 
to review its nuclear fuel recycling project using plutonium in 
consideration of global fear that Japan may arm itself with 
nuclear weapons. 
  Japan's plutonium policy is currently under study by MITI's 
Advisory Committee for Energy [ACE] and Science and Technology 
Agency's Atomic Energy Commission [AEC]. A prevailing view in 
their discussions is that while maintaining basic principles of 
its plutonium policy, the government should "carefully use 
plutonium" taking such measures as burning it at nuclear power 
plants in order not to have excess plutonium. The senior MITI 
official's remark backs this idea. 
  The official said: "International tension has been hightened 
due to the issue concerning DPRK acceptance of nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." 
On Japan's plutonium policy, he said: "It has no intention of 
producing nuclear weapons. Even so, (other countries) are 
closely watching us because of our capability to produce them." 
In this way, he stressed the need for Japan to give 
consideration to international opinion. He added: "It is not 
good for Japan to store (plutonium) intently. Japan needs to 
make efforts to increase openness of plutonium use so that other 
nations will understand our policy." 
  The government is considering postponing the operations of a 
fuel recycling plant for extracting plutonium from spent fuel. 
Also, the ACE and AEC are expected to reach a conclusion that 
the government should give more importance to reducing the 
amount of plutonium by burning it than to effectively using it 
through reprocessing.

<F P=106> [Article by editorial staff member Keiko Ito: "Totally </F>
Bogged Down MITI"] 
  [Text] According to statements by some section heads in 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], a 
special meeting of senior officers was held at the ministry on 
the afternoon of 8 February. Those attending were the 
administrative vice minister, director of the minister's 
secretariat, directors general of each bureau, heads of 
divisions in the secretariat, and so on, all members of regular 
ministerial discussions. 
  At this meeting, an A4-size paper entitled "Proposed 
Comments 
on Economic Stimulus Measures" was reportedly distributed to all 
members. The word processor had produced such entries as: 
"Point 1. Welcome and highly evaluate the decision on the 
largest-ever economic stimulus measures which will exceed Y 
[Yen] 15 trillion (...omitted). 2. Support the government's 
idea to attempt to correct the direct and indirect tax ratio." 
"Model 1. Highly evaluate the government's decision for 
putting forward the largest-ever Y15 trillion economic stimulus 
measures, which include Y6 trillion in income tax/residence tax 
reductions (...omitted)...." 
  One section head explained to Administrative Vice Minister 
Hideaki Kumano that they were planning to send this document to 
economic organizations. 
  On 8 February the government decided upon and announced 
comprehensive economic measures. This paper was the "example" 
which they wanted leaders of economic organizations to use when 
making comments to the media. It told them to evaluate the 
government stimulus measures along these lines. 
  Vice Minister Kumano was said to have made the point: "Isn't 
it rather inappropriate to use a `model'?" 
  But by then, this paper had already been faxed to four 
business organizations. 
  It was faxed twice to the Federation of Economic 
Organizations [Keidanren]. 
  The first fax was received by the Finance Division at around 
11 in the morning. It was addressed to Management Director 
Keijiro Koyama. But this paper was entitled "Proposed Comments 
on the Tax Reduction Issue." The content of this paper was 
almost identical as the "Proposed Comments on Economic Stimulus 
Measures," but numbers such as "Y6 trillion in income tax 
reductions" and "Y15 trillion in economic stimulus measures" 
were not included. It was around noon that day when the 
coalition government, which had been discussing economic 
stimulus measures, agreed on "proceeding with a Y6 trillion tax 
reduction." The concrete economic measures were announced that 
evening. Adjustment seems to have also been made in the MITI 
example, reflecting this decision. 
<H5>  "Not A High-Level Composition" </H5>
  The "Proposed Comments on Economic Stimulus Measures," which 
included the contents as announced, was sent to the four 
organizations between three and four in the afternoon. 
  It must have been compiled in a great hurry: there were 
typographical errors such as "to secure the source of revenue 
for the tax reduction" and irregular indentations. 
  People who were involved say: "There were some passages in 
which I could not tell what the subject of the sentence was. We 
thought it was a badly written, hard to read document." 
  The other three organizations received only the "Proposed 
Comments on Economic Stimulus Measures," but by the time the fax 
arrived, all these organizations had already made their leaders' 
comments public. The result was that the "unheard of" guidance 
by fax only made the businessmen laugh. 
  "It was insulting," according to Managing Director Masaji 
Shinagawa of the Japanese Association of Corporate Executives. 
  "It did not affect us," said Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa of 
Keidanren. 
  One staff member of a business organization angrily said: 
"We are not kids. We can make our own judgments. The 
government does not have to instruct us." 
<H5>  Industrial Policy Bureau Director-General Position Was Vacant </H5>
  On 14 February, when the proposed comments became known in 
the newspapers, at his regular news conference Vice Minister 
Kumano answered: "I did not know anything (about sending out 
the proposed comments)." He then explained that the paper was a 
memorandum prepared by a staff member of the Industrial Policy 
Bureau staff for internal use only to clarify matters in his own 
mind. It was not intended to force others to accept this 
thinking. 
  "There were some inappropriate expressions which we regret." 
  However, he said "it is not clear" who prepared and faxed 
it. 
  According to Hiroshi Yokokawa, head of the General 
Coordination Division of the Industrial Policy Bureau, on 8 
February the Industrial Policy Bureau resembled combat on a 
battlefield. 
  The government's plan for a tax increase and a tax reduction 
had changed twice and three times respectively since the 3 
February early morning commotion over a national welfare tax. 
Everyday the government parties negotiated within the 
coalition. At midday on 8 February, the outline was finally 
decided upon. The Industrial Policy Bureau was extremely busy 
working in preparation for the evening news conference. It is 
said that in these chaotically busy conditions, some junior 
staff member might have produced the "proposed comments" and 
faxed them. 
  "When policies are announced, we often receive questions 
from the business sector as to what the significance is. That 
document was a point paper that staff members had for dealing 
with such questions. However, it was a mistake to have faxed 
it." 
  There has been no director general for the Industrial Policy 
Bureau since 24 December of last year. The director general 
until then was Masahisa Naito. He submitted his resignation 
when he was told to do so on the grounds he had given 
preferential personnel treatment to the eldest son of the former 
administrative vice minister. 
  As of 15 February, Director General Tomio Tsutsumi assumed 
the position in the Industrial Policy Bureau, which is the most 
senior position among the directors general in MITI. But at the 
time of the faxing incident, Administrative Vice Minister Kumano 
was holding it as an additional position. 
<H5>  Anxious Because Imperfections Have Became Noticeable </H5>
  MITI admits that "guidance" by fax is unheard of. But it is 
also a fact that, before announcing major policies, phone calls 
from MITI are always made to economic organizations soliciting 
them to "please offer a favorable comment." 
  Naito, who was popular among people in the business sector 
because "he was not like a petty official and had a broader 
personality," had been performing this function of making phone 
calls from the time he became director of the Secretariat. 
  According to a person involved in the economic 
organizations: 
"Until now they have been working things out in advance 
[nemawashi], relying on intuitive good timing. But this time, 
because they have no director general, they messed things up." 
  The tax reduction is limited to one year. There is no 
prospect for a source of revenue. The comprehensive economic 
stimulus measures of the coalition government reflected the 
internal situation of the coalition government, which consisted 
of a "pickup team." Imperfections were noticeable in the 
content of the measures. Some economists say: "Weren't they 
too impatient because they thought they could not get the 
economic sector to provide a strong evaluation of such 
countercyclical measures?" 
  But MITI's apprehension turned out to be groundless, and 
comments by leaders of the business sector all welcomed the 
stimulus measures. 
  Chairman Ken Moroi of Chichibu Cement Co. Ltd., who is also 
vice chairman of Keidanren, these days often senses a "tragic" 
feeling coming from MITI. 
  There is a great recession, historically unprecedented. 
There is the somewhat unclear meaning of the U.S.-Japan 
alliance relationship in the post-Cold War era. He sees this as 
a time when we cannot use the old manuals for domestic politics 
and foreign policy. 
  "When there was a clear goal to strive for economic growth 
and to catch up with the developed countries, it was an era when 
the bureaucrats could be most active. Because there is no need 
to create anything new, they only have to think up ways to 
proceed most efficiently toward the goal. But today Japan has 
to create the goals itself. This cannot be done by bureaucrats." 
  To create new goals is essentially a task for politics. But 
he says that, under the continuously chaotic coalition 
government, the Japanese bureaucrats are driven by a sense of 
duty to the effect that "we must do the job." 
  At the end of last year also, Chairman Moroi was astonished 
when MITI Administrative Vice Minister Kumano called on him, 
together with Ministry of Finance Administrative Vice Minister 
Jiro Saito. 
  "It must have been the first time in history that two vice 
ministers from the greatest ministries come together to ask for 
a favor." 
  After greetings by Vice Minister Saito, Vice Minister Kumano 
made an appeal for an understanding on the argument for 
consolidating the tax increase and tax reduction. The two vice 
ministers were said to have desperately tried to persuade him 
that the next 15 months would be the period which would 
determine the destiny of the Japanese economy. They said that 
during this period, the government would mobilize every possible 
policy measure to achieve the recovery of good economic 
conditions, and for that purpose the sources of revenue would be 
used up. Therefore the consumption tax must be raised to 7 
percent in the future.... 
  Some in the economic sector also point out that "it just 
happened to show up symbolically in MITI that the bureaucrats 
are running about in confusion as things change." 
<H5>  Reform Movement Within the Junior Ranks </H5>
  In this style of MITI, there is also movement for reform. 
Two or three years ago, when the recession had become serious, 
a "junior officers study group" emerged in MITI. Originally 
this was a study group initiated by 25 people who had entered 
the ministry in 1980. They held discussions in the evening, 
mainly over dinner. 
  Topics included the structural recession, the reduced 
population of people of a productive age, aging, women's 
advancement in society, and the collapse of the seniority system. 
  "The old bureaucratic office system has become fatigued. We 
wanted to think how MITI should respond to this time of 
transition," says Hisato Nagao, deputy head of the General 
Coordination Division in the minister's Secretariat and the 
person who called for the study group. 
  Centering on the officers in charge of laws and ordinances 
in each division, it has expanded the circle to younger people. 
Current participating members number around 400 who entered the 
ministry between 1980 to 1989. To collect concrete policy 
proposals from this younger generation, they have been meeting 
several times each month, in groups based on the same entry 
year, since last October. 
  Ironically, it was in the midst of such activity that the 
issue involving Director General Naito and the fax incident 
occurred. 
  According to one of the initiators of the study group, Seiji 
Hagiwara, deputy division head in the General Coordination 
Division of the Industrial Policy Bureau: "It is a fact that 
the study group has become a platform for considering the issue 
of how to deal with the changing environment. Everyone thought 
MITI's role was being questioned by society, and we had to brace 
ourselves. But all we can do is to reply by putting forward 
solid policies as bureaucrats." 
  [Following is the content of the faxed paper] 
<H3>  Proposed Comments on the Economic Stimulus Measures </H3>
Point 1. Welcome and highly evaluate the decision on the 
largest-ever economic stimulus measures which will exceed Y15 
trillion. (...omitted) 2. Support the government's idea to 
attempt to correct the direct and indirect tax ratio. 3. Come 
to a rapid conclusion on a national consensus for tax reform 
discussion, including tax revenue sources. 4. Achieve rapid 
implementation through rapid formation of budget and tax 
legislation. 
Model 1. Highly evaluate the government's decision for putting 
forward the largest-ever Y15 trillion economic stimulus 
measures, which include Y6 trillion in income tax/residence tax 
reductions, corporation special taxes, automobile consumption 
taxes, and so on. (mention appropriate contents) 2. Support 
the government's idea to correct the direct and indirect tax 
ratio from the standpoint of to secure the source for lost tax 
revenues such as income taxes, and attempts to review what the 
people's burden should be in relation to the increased expense 
of an aged society. 3. As for the revenue source issue, it has 
been decided that the discussion is to continue. But 
considering it will be the people themselves who pay the debts 
in the end, we want you to make a responsible judgment quickly. 
As the time of a full-scale aged society is approaching, we 
also want you to settle on a discussion to achieve tax system 
reform with a national consensus, and to make efforts to pass 
the legislation within the year. 4. Expect the government to 
attempt to quickly pass the third supplemental budget, the 
original 1994 budget, and budget legislation-related bills--such 
as tax system related legislation--at an early date, and that 
the stimulation measures will be quickly implemented.

  [Text] The New Visual Information Industry Panel has 
compiled a report forecasting the future of the visual and 
multimedia information industry. The Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry [MITI] adopted the report at a meeting of the 
panel on 16 March. 
  The panel is a private panel for the chief of the MITI 
Industry Policy Bureau. The report, pointing to the drastically 
growing demand for visual information in the individual 
entertainment and office work sectors, estimates the visual 
information market will grow from 15 trillion yen in 1992 to 71 
trillion in 2015. The report points out that for the market to 
expand in the future, it is important to deregulate and upgrade 
the current information and communications infrastructures and 
to establish an intellectual property rights system to protect 
copyrights. 
  Visual information uses computers to transmit images and 
sounds to the human visual and auditory senses. For this reason, 
the report predicts that visual information will make it easy to 
get information, and the demand for visual information will grow 
drastically, especially in the exchange of information between 
individuals and enterprises. The report analyzes that the demand 
for information in the medical, education, and distribution 
sectors will grow. 
  The report estimates the visual information market will grow 
from 15 trillion yen (3.2 percent of the GNP) in 1992 to 25 
trillion yen (4.2 percent of GNP) in 2000, and to 71 trillion 
yen (8.3 percent of GNP) in 2015. The report points out that for 
the visual information industry to develop in the future, it is 
necessary to upgrade the current infrastructure, create an 
information and communications network, establish a center where 
visual information is stored and utilized, and establish a 
visual information industry complex where related industries are 
concentrated. The report advocates the need to provide financial 
assistance to entrepreneurs eager to participate in the visual 
information industry.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 17 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- At the 
opening of the spring session of the Mongolian Parliament, the 
prime minister of the country, P. Jasray, made a speech about 
the course of realization of the government programme for 1994. 
In his speech, he outlined in few words the socioeconomic 
situation in the country. As he said, wintering and breeding of 
cattle are going on relatively well, and if such a state of 
things remains further, so in the current year in the country 
8.2 million heads of young cattle can be raised. At the same 
time, there are difficulties in carrying out the spring field 
works in consequence of the fact that agricultural technical 
fleet is not ready for sowing, and financial situation in 
agricultural units remains complicated. 
  In industry the volume of production of goods has dropped by 
1.6 percent, compared with the same period of the last year. 
Increased is production of 16 kinds of goods out of 60 main 
kinds of goods, including production of concentrated copper has 
increased by 75 percent, concentrated copper has increased by 75 
percent, concentrated molybdenum by 2 times, lime and fluorspar 
by 11-28 percent, leather and knitted wear by 66-70 percent, and 
carpets and cashmere articles by 5-5.6 percent. The main 
problems producers are facing now, as the prime minister said, 
are lack of financial means, absence of a market for sale of 
finished articles, misfirings in electric energy supply, and the 
fact that reconstructions are not finished. 
  As the prime minister said, cases of breakdown and damages 
at 
electric power stations, misfirings in electric energy supply, 
which have become frequent, are connected with irresponsibility 
of definite persons. In connection with this, the prime 
minister announced that officials who are guilty of creation of 
such a situation should bear the responsibility for this. 
  External trade turnover in the first two months of the 
current year, said P. Jasray, has reached 52.2 million U.S. 
dollars, having a positive balance worth 24 million U.S. dollars. 
  In the same period the state budget incomes have constituted 
8.9 billion tugriks, when expenses constituted 11.9 billion 
tugriks. Thus, the budget expense volume turned out to be by 2 
billion tugriks lower than the planned level. But, said the 
prime minister, because of the lack of means we failed to 
realize financing worth 3.7 billion tugriks. 
  The centralized state budget losses constituted 1.5 billion 
tugriks. 
  According to the data of Mongol Bank, by 1 March, the volume 
of outbank money turnover constituted 8.5 billion tugriks. 
  In the last months, said the prime minister, a tendency for 
reduction of increase of prices and inflation for their 
stabilization is to be observed. 
  Market is being provided with goods normally. 
  As the prime minister said, since the beginning of the 
current year a tendency for reduction of the national currency 
rate is appearing. But this fluctuation should be considered as 
a normal thing for a market economy. 
  Mongol Bank has sufficient currency reserves for carrying 
out 
intervention to market in case of need. 
  Summing up this part of his speech, the government head 
appraised the present economic situation as positive. In his 
view, market relations are extending, relative stability on the 
main macro- showings is being marked. [sentence as received] 
  In the second part of his speech, the Mongolian premier 
spoke 
about the main directions of socioeconomic policy of the 
government for the current year. The government, he said, 
considers as its basic task strengthening of positive starts in 
economy, restoration and revival of industrial potential. 
  In connection with this, he defined six priority 
orientations 
of the government activity. 
  Among them there are restoration of national industrial 
potential with assistance of mechanisms of the state market 
regulation, priority development of infrastructure, light and 
oil industries, private sector of economy, and food supply of 
the population.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 17. (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" publishes an information about the spring 
session of the State Great Hural (SGH). It is informed that at 
the opening of the SGH session the State Great Hural member T. 
Elbegdorj made a speech on behalf of the representatives of the 
Mongolian National Democratic and the Mongolian Social 
Democratic parties in the Parliament. T. Elbegdorj noted that 
the Parliament postpones consideration of draft laws proposed by 
the opposition parties, does not give an opportunity to citizens 
to get acquainted with video recordings about the course of the 
Parliament sittings. T. Elbegdorj criticized the government for 
not fulfilling the promises to stop economic deterioration in 
the country in 1993, not to allow production volume drop as 
compared with the level of 1992. He noted that the Parliament 
members, representing the Mongolian National Democratic and the 
Mongolian Social Democratic parties, are suggesting to discus 
jointly with the country's leadership the ways and methods of 
overcoming crisis, solution of the main problems of national 
security and state policy. 
  As the newspaper informs, the SGH session set to 
consideration of the draft law on statistics in the second 
reading. 
  The newspaper publishes an information of the Prime Minister 
P. Jasray about the government measures and tasks on 
stabilization of economy. 
  The prime minister described the economic situation in the 
country and pointed out to the tendencies for reduction of 
increase of prices and inflation level, for stabilization of 
economy. 
  As P. Jasray announced, in the country there are necessary 
reserves of fuel and lubricants, of some necessary goods, and 
fluctuations in the rate of tugrik do not exceed the limits of 
normal fluctuations characteristic of free economy. The prime 
minister submitted for consideration to the parliament the 
proposals on consolidation of progress in economic life, 
increase of production, restoration of economic potential. 
  The newspaper notes that many ministries, departments and 
establishments on pretext of drop of currency exchange rate are 
trying to introduce different illegal "taxes". 
  The trade union newspaper "Hodolmor" publishes an interview 
of its correspondent with the chairman of the Association of 
Trade Unions of Workers of Transport, Communication and 
Oil-Supply, P. Tseyen. He notes that as a result of demands of 
trade unions the government has positively solved an issue about 
compensation of payments of auto-transport workers, who in 1993 
participated in harvesting, but has considered impossible to 
compensate a payment for the time of standing idle. P. Tseyen 
notes that the government has instructed the corresponding 
departments to allot a corresponding share of credits of the 
World Bank to renewal of the motor-fleet of inter-city transport 
organizations. 
  In P. Tseyen's view, the government regards social problems 
of auto-transport workers with understanding. 
  The newspaper points to importance of amalgamation of the 
leather goods companies "Uyan" and "Ugalz". As the newspaper 
writes, the new joint-stock company "Mongol Savvhi" ("Mongolian 
Leather") links production of leather goods with supply with raw 
materials. "Huyklmur" [as received] notes that the 
leather-dressers should show initiative and enterprise in 
successful work under conditions of market. 
  As the newspaper informs, in Calcutta opened is an 
exhibition 
"Mongols-Nomads". At the exhibition, which will function in the 
course of a month, displayed are materials of the Museum of 
National History of Mongolia. The newspaper informs about the 
day of Esperanto, which was celebrated at the State Pedagogical 
University. This measure was organized by the Mongolian Center 
of Study of Esperanto and was devoted to the regular Congress of 
Esperantists of the World, which will be held in July in Seoul.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yu Ui-taek, DPRK official </F>
responsible for the North Korean Far East forestry mission, by 
YOMIURI SHIMBUN correspondent Akihiro Naito in Khabarovsk on 15 
March] 
  [Text] There has been a flurry of reports that many North 
Korean workers have deserted their logging sites in the Russian 
Far East region which have been run by the DPRK (North Korea) 
and that they have been rushing for the South Korean Embassy in 
Moscow and other South Korean diplomatic missions in Russia in 
search of political asylum. It has been reported that they have 
deserted because of harsh labor conditions and economic 
difficulties in their homeland. YOMIURI SHIMBUN correspondent 
Akihiro Naito interviewed Yu Ui-taek, the party secretary 
general [title as published] responsible for the North Korean 
Far East forestry mission, at the mission's office in Khabarovsk 
on 15 March. The mission is the organization responsible for 
overseeing the logging operations. 
  Referring to the desertion of North Korean loggers, Yu 
admitted -- the first time that a North Korean official has done 
so -- their desertion, saying, "In the past one year, three or 
four workers have fled." Yu added that they were murderers or 
thieves. In the interview, Yu denied a South Korean report that 
"they have deserted by the hundred." As for labor conditions at 
the logging sites, which international human rights 
organizations have described as an "inhuman environment," Yu 
stressed that the loggers are given three meals a day and that 
they are treated well. 
  In the interview, Yu said: "A total of 10,000 North Korean 
loggers are now working here, and some bad loggers have 
committed crimes. North Korea has asked Russian police to 
search for them." In this way, he suggested that Public Security 
Ministry (North Korea's police organization) officials posted at 
the logging sites have not been engaged in "hunting for the 
deserters," as some media have reported. In the interview, Yu 
said "workers who commit crimes" are either deported to North 
Korea or are sent to an "educational facility" at the logging 
sites to be corrected. 
  In the interview, Yu stressed: "Because our workers do not 
live in cities, there are no welfare facilities. We import 
vegetables and food from North Korea. Our workers live here 
free of concern." 
  North Korea launched a full-fledged logging operation in the 
Russian Far East region after an intergovernmental treaty [was 
concluded between North Korea and the former Soviet Union] in 
the 1960's. Under the intergovernmental treaty, the former 
Soviet Union was committed to providing machinery and fuel while 
North Korea was committed to supplying workers. The former 
Soviet Union (and now Russia) have taken 64.5 percent of the 
logs, while North Korea has taken 35.5 percent of them. 
  According to Yu, about 10,000 North Korean laborers are now 
working at the logging sites, which are concentrated in 
Chegdomyn in the Khabarovsk region and in Teinda in the Amur 
region. There are nine logging sites in the Khabarovsk region, 
and 6,000 North Korean workers are logging there, with some of 
them living together with their families. 
  The intergovernmental treaty expired at the end of 1993. 
According to Yu, Russia has asked for a higher quota, and 
negotiations on extending the treaty are under way between the 
two countries. For this reason, the two countries have agreed 
to provisionally extend the treaty to the end of March 1994.

  [Text] Indonesia does not oppose the institutionalization 
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] if the 
institutionalization process is normal is not hasty. Wisber 
Luis, director general for foreign economic relations in the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, said this to reporters in 
Honolulu today in conjunction with the two-day informal meeting 
of APEC finance ministers that starts there today. According to 
Wisber Luis, currently the institutionalization of APEC is not 
proceeding normally because its activities are taking place 
outside of normal senior official and ministerial meetings. 
Indonesia -- which will host this year's informal APEC summit 
-- will call for more dialogue and consultations on 
macroeconomic matters during the finance ministers meeting in 
Honolulu.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas by </F>
TEMPO correspondent Yuli Ismartono in Jakarta on 6 March] 
  [Text] [Ismartono] Is it true that the Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM] has taken a rather delayed initiative on the Bosnian issue? 
  [Alatas] I do not think so; on the contrary, the NAM is now 
more united in supporting Bosnia's cause at the United Nations. 
In the past, there were fundamental differences among its 
members regarding the status of the former Yugoslavia. Things 
are different with the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO], 
because this group is smaller and the views of its members are 
less contradictory. 
  During Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic's visit to 
Indonesia, President Suharto promised that we would support him 
both at the United Nations and in Indonesia's contacts with big 
countries. This has actually been implemented by our roving 
ambassadors through diplomatic channels. 
  [Ismartono] Therefore, the delay was caused by differences 
in 
perception? 
  [Alatas] Yes. The differences are not limited to the Bosnian 
issue. All NAM members think the ethnic cleansing [preceding 
three words in English] in Bosnia is too much, but there is a 
school of thought within the NAM that believes the old 
Yugoslavia was an artificial merger of several states. The 
country was only united because of the strong political 
influence of Joseph Tito. As soon as he died, the unity was 
shattered. Those who hold this view can accept the present 
reality, albeit reluctantly. They are willing to allow those 
states to become independent. When the war broke out, those who 
held this view within the NAM considered Serbia to be the 
aggressor. We must support the victim of aggression. This view 
is held by the members of the ICO, including Indonesia. 
  [Ismartono] What about the other school of thought? 
  [Alatas] The other one -- consisting of 15 countries, mostly 
from Africa -- considers what is happening in the former 
Yugoslavia an issue of separatism. They do not want to take 
tough action against Yugoslavia. The NAM must at least give 
that country a chance to solve its problems. 
  This is the situation Indonesia faces in its capacity as 
chairman of the 110-member movement, where all decisions must be 
made by consensus. We have urged the second school of thought 
to follow the majority's view, but of course we cannot impose 
our will. 
  [Ismartono] What about the Bosnian task force? 
  [Alatas] Well, we managed to complete our work on this 
issue. 
Due to the changing situation -- both in Bosnia and within the 
NAM -- Bosnia has now agreed to the convening of a new 
international conference. We began to make efforts on this 
issue as soon as the Cambodian problem was solved. We believe 
it would be good to solve the Bosnian issue the same way as the 
Cambodian conflict; namely, the warring sides and neighboring 
states should get involved with seeking a solution. The 
European Community rejected this idea, however, because Portugal 
objected to Indonesia's leadership of the NAM. This made me 
furious, because this issue has nothing to do with East Timor. 
Well, our foreign policy has been criticized because of this. 
  [Ismartono] There has been criticism that your foreign 
policy 
is defensive, passive, and tends to respond to events instead of 
the other way around. 
  [Alatas] You must first know the facts. What about the 
statement: "Indonesia's initiative to convene an international 
conference on Bosnia"? This is in fact not a new initiative, 
but an old idea from when Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic 
earlier visited Indonesia. He was the one who called for the 
convening of this international conference, and he needed the 
NAM's support. As soon as he gave the green light, we began to 
move. So we are not late. As for those who say the Somali task 
force formed by the NAM two years ago has not materialized, I 
say this is not true. This task force has started its work and 
our roving ambassador, Sayidiman, has taken part in the Addis 
Ababa conference and other meetings. 
  [Ismartono] What about criticism that the Foreign Affairs 
Department did not play a major role in the normalization of 
diplomatic relations with the PRC? 
  [Alatas] Once again, people must see the facts. The move to 
normalize diplomatic relations was initiated by the late Foreign 
Minister Adam Malik, and by subsequent Foreign Minister Mokhtar 
Kusumaatmaja about 10 years later. Both attempts failed because 
the political climate was not yet ready. When I became foreign 
minister, I saw an opportunity. In April 1988 Indonesia hosted 
an ESCAP [Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific] conference. A PRC deputy foreign minister came to 
Indonesia as a participant in the meeting after 22 years of 
frozen diplomatic relations. 
  After obtaining President Suharto's approval, I met the PRC 
deputy foreign minister to begin the normalization process. Of 
course, we had to hold secret talks at first. Finally, in July 
1990, I went to Beijing with President Suharto's message and 
tried to negotiate and sign a memorandum of understanding [MOU] 
with them. In August 1990, I signed the MOU with PRC officials. 
Therefore, I am amazed to hear some people's views that the 
Foreign Affairs Department only played a minor role in 
normalizing diplomatic ties with the PRC. 
  [Ismartono] But the Foreign Affairs Department was kept in 
the dark on Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's visit to Indonesia. 
  [Alatas] It is like this: there are decisions, like Rabin's 
visit, in which the department deliberately prefers not to get 
involved. Another example is the Taiwan issue. Otherwise, the 
government would be seen as giving implicit recognition to the 
two countries. 
  [Ismartono] There is also criticism that the Foreign Affairs 
Department is too accommodating. For example, it only pays 
attention to the groups that benefit the United States and 
Japan, such as APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] and ARF 
[ASEAN Regional Forum], which are expected to produce economic 
benefits. 
  [Alatas] Who initiated the establishment of APEC? Who else 
if not our ministry? The idea originated in Australia, but they 
consulted us first because I was chairman of the ASEAN Standing 
Committee at the time. Therefore, APEC can be established in 
accordance with ASEAN's needs. The same is true of the ARF. 
Indonesia is ASEAN's largest member country, but we are not 
eager to boast of our achievements. 
  [Ismartono] There is a proposal to establish an agency 
comparable to the National Security Council [NSC] in the United 
States. 
  [Alatas] That proposal is worth studying, but it must be 
remembered that even in the United States the NSC does not work 
smoothly. It often clashes with the State Department. There 
were tugs-of-war between Kissinger and Rogers and between 
Kissinger and Vance to the point that Vance had to quit. In 
fact, Indonesia already has an agency like the NSC -- namely the 
Office of Coordinating Minister of Political Affairs and 
Security -- where the foreign minister, minister-state 
secretary, home minister, defense and security minister, armed 
forces commander, chief of the State Intelligence Coordinating 
Agency, and information minister sit down to discuss issues, 
including foreign policy. The truth is that the Foreign Affairs 
Department cannot stand and operate alone; we need feedback from 
other agencies. During our meetings at the Office of 
Coordinating Minister for Political Affairs and Security, we 
usually discuss all variables. Then, when we report to the 
president, I can tell him that other agencies have been 
consulted. Do not forget that our foreign policy is determined 
by the president. 
  There are times when we must move fast, and I have to meet 
the president without consulting the Office of Coordinating 
Minister for Political Affairs and Security. But I can always 
meet with them for discussions later. If they want to upgrade 
the procedure, I will certainly lend my support. 
  As for allegations that our foreign policy is defensive, 
unresponsive, and inefficient, let me explain first. We have 
been pursuing initiatives to solve the Cambodian problem since 
1988, and finally managed to find a respectable solution. We 
normalized diplomatic relations with the PRC after they had been 
frozen for 23 years. The Indonesian president visited the 
Soviet Union for the first time in 25 years. Besides, President 
Suharto managed to meet Gorbachev before the collapse of the 
USSR. Our foreign policy was also responsible for the birth of 
APEC. Above all else, our foreign policy was also responsible 
for us becoming chairman of the NAM despite the East Timor 
issue. We are still active on several international issues; for 
example, as chairman of the Nuclear Test Ban Convention at the 
United Nations. Can you call our foreign policy passive and 
defensive? 
  [Ismartono] As for the East Timor issue, are we really 
making 
any progress? 
  [Alatas] We are making slow progress in our efforts to seek 
a 
comprehensive solution to the problem. We feel that Portugal 
does not want to solve the issue or is unable to solve it 
because of internal conflicts. They themselves have not yet 
reached agreement, so they make Indonesia a scapegoat. This 
makes things difficult, and UN assistance is needed. East Timor 
remains one of the major issues facing our foreign policy. This 
is especially true because many countries pay a lot of attention 
to it.

  [Excerpt] Ari Wong-araya, permanent secretary in the 
Interior Ministry, granted an interview to reporters at a hotel 
in Hue, Vietnam on 17 March. He stressed the need for the Thai 
Government to provide security for Israeli diplomats and the 
Israeli Embassy in Thailand: 
  [Begin recording] [Ari] According to a report, the person 
intended to do something to the Israeli Embassy. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is that true? 
  [Ari] Yes, according to the report. Therefore, an order 
must be issued to provide security for the Israeli Embassy as 
well as Israeli diplomats. 
  [Second unidentified reporter] How about Israeli 
businessmen? 
Do they need to be taken care of? 
  [Ari] Probably. We would if they asked us. They must 
also take care of themselves, though. 
  [Second reporter] Is it necessary for a special request to 
be 
made to provide security for Israeli Embassy officials and the 
embassy? 
  [Ari] All of this is according to agreement. The area 
surrounding the embassy is our responsibility; they have 
exclusive diplomatic rights for the territory inside their 
embassy compound. 
  [Second reporter] Will we only protect outside the embassy 
grounds? 
  [Ari] If they ask us to take care of the inside area as 
well, then it might be necessary. In the process of examination 
and investigation, sometimes it is necessary to go inside. 
  [Second reporter] Could you please elaborate on what you 
mean 
when you say: do something to the Israeli Embassy? 
  [Ari] The dead person was found to be a driver who was 
hired by someone. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Authorities yesterday ordered security stepped up 
for foreign embassies in Bangkok after police accidentally 
uncovered what appeared to be an international plot to blow up 
the Israeli Embassy with a huge truck bomb. A one-ton bomb was 
found yesterday in a rented six-wheel truck that had been seized 
by police and parked in front of Lumpini police station since it 
had been involved in a minor traffic accident near the Israeli 
Embassy on March 11. 
  Its owner, who had turned up to claim the vehicle yesterday, 
found a steel water tank on the truck and, together with the 
police, discovered that it contained a bomb. Bomb disposal 
experts who were called in to defuse the bomb said it was made 
with ammonium nitrate, diesel oil and six bars of C-4 plastic 
explosives wired to a car battery and a switch in the dashboard 
near the driver's seat. The bomb experts said it was big enough 
to destroy a large building. The steel water tank also contained 
the body of a Thai man identified later as Chom Phila, 43, the 
driver of the rented truck. 
  Later, Police Department chief Prathin Santipraphop told 
reporters after chairing an urgent meeting of top policemen and 
officials at the National Security Council that he had ordered 
security tightened at all foreign embassies in Bangkok. He said 
the bomb belonged to a "sophisticated" international terrorist 
gang and was intended to be used against foreign nationals. 
  Lumpini Police said they had seized the truck near Chitlom 
intersection about 300 metres from the Israeli Embassy, after it 
hit a motorcycle taxi on March 11. Government House sources 
quoted the police report as saying that the bomb was believed to 
be on its way to the embassy when it hit the motorcycle taxi as 
it came out of the Central Department Store parking lot on 
Chitlom Road. 
  The same day, Muslim protesters had rallied outside the 
embassy compound to protest against the February 28 massacre of 
Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron. Pol Gen [Police General] 
Prathin insisted that it was still too early to say if the truck 
bomb had been intended for the Israeli Embassy. The embassy 
yesterday sent its security officer to observe the defusing of 
the bomb. 
  The Metropolitan Police yesterday sent ten investigative 
teams to hunt for the terrorists. Metropolitan Police 
Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said that although the attack 
was to have taken place several days ago, he believes the 
terrorists are still in Thailand. 
  Sketches of an Arab-looking man who had been driving the 
truck was drawn from the account of the motorcyclist who was 
involved in the accident, and has been distributed to all police 
stations and the Immigration Police. All Arab-looking travellers 
leaving Don Muang Airport yesterday were reportedly thoroughly 
searched. 
  The National Security Council's Anti-Terrorism Centre chief 
Lt- Gen Saiyawit Sirimonthon told reporters the authorities had 
been alerted about a possible terrorism attack in Bangkok 
recently by the Thai Embassy in Turkey. The embassy, he said,did 
not give any details about the attack except to say that it 
could happen this month. The country's policy of opening to 
tourism has made Thailand vulnerable to international terrorism, 
he said. 
  The danger was not over yet, he added. Just because the 
police had discovered one plot did not mean that the terrorists 
who were responsible would not try again, he claimed. 
  Investigators yesterday questioned the truck's owner, Thawin 
Pawaratphichit, 41, and the motorcyclist, Boonsoem Saendi, 21, 
to try to obtain more details about the Arab man who rented and 
drove the truck the day the accident took place. Police quoted 
Thawin as saying he lad rented the vehicle on March 8 to the 
Arab for 12,000 baht "to pick up goods" in Chiang Mai. He had 
assigned Chom Phila, the driver of the rented truck who was 
later murdered, to deliver the truck to the client at Makro 
store in Bangkapi on March 10. 
  Chom had telephoned him at about 8 p.m. on the same day to 
tell him that the truck had been delivered to the client and 
that he had received 5,500 baht in partial payment of the rent. 
Chom told him that the man would pay the rest of he rent on his 
return from Chiang Mai. Chom had not been heard from until his 
body was discovered yesterday in the steel water tank of the 
truck. 
  Pol Col [Police Colonel] Sombun Tantrakun, a doctor at 
Police 
Hospital, said Chom had apparently been strangled to death, 
judging from the severe bruise around his neck, and both his 
wrists had been broken. 
  Boonsoem, the motorcyclist, said the Arab looking driver of 
the truck had gotten out of the vehicle after the accident near 
Chitlom intersection to try to negotiate and had handed him some 
foreign banknotes. They had difficulty understanding each 
other, though, and the man finally walked into the department 
store and disappeared. 
  Lumpini policemen who were called to the scene, drove the 
truck to the station on Wireless Road and left it there. Its 
owner, Thawin, turned up at the station to claim it yesterday. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said the discovery 
of the bomb was "very fortunate" and pledged to increase 
security. "This is a good lesson. Policemen will be more 
watchful," he said. He said he is waiting for a detailed police 
report for Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, who is on an official 
visit to Vietnam.

  [Text] Terrorists travelling on fake passports find safe 
havens in tourist districts frequented by Middle Eastern 
visitors in Bangkok and the Muslim-majority provinces in the 
South, according to police. Pol Col [Police Colonel] Sanit 
Miphan, of the Tourist Police, said the terrorists, most of them 
Palestinians, usually arrive in Thailand through the southern 
provinces by way of Malaysia. "Once they arrive in the four 
southern provinces they destroy their fake Indian or Pakistani 
passports and live among the local Muslims, waiting for new sets 
of fake travel document," Sanit said. 
  Many of them specialize in the making of bombs and accept 
commissions to carry out acts of terror and sabotage. 
"Afterwards, they usually flee the country through the southern 
provinces into Malaysia, and onto a third country using fake 
passports," he said. 
  Sanit said several suspected terrorists were known to have 
taken refuge at some time or other in Bangkok's tourist district 
of Soi Nana Nua frequented by visitors from the Middle East, as 
well as various mosques in Bang Rak and Phra Khanong areas. He 
said police also kept a dossier on Middle Eastern gangsters 
active in Soi Nana and Bang Rak areas. 
  A close watch was being kept on areas frequented by Middle 
Eastern visitors as part of the investigation into the discovery 
of a truckload of explosives yesterday. Sanit called on foreign 
tourists to report to police any foreigners they suspected of 
involvement in crime, and not to panic because of yesterday's 
discovery. 
  Shortly after the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New 
York City in February last year, there was speculation that some 
of the terrorists involved had slipped into Thailand and taken 
refuge for a time before leaving for a third country. The 
officer said there was insufficient evidence to establish a link 
between yesterday's discovery and the World Trade Centre tragedy.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Police pledged stricter 
security at major foreign embassies. "We haven't received calls 
for greater protection, but we will keep closer watch on those 
which deserve greater attention," said Chaiyasit. A secretary 
from the Israeli Embassy, Zosar Suk, visited Lumpini Park and 
inspected the truck yesterday. He met Pol Lt Col Aphichat 
Chuachet, deputy chief of southern Bangkok police, and asked for 
details of the March 11 accident. The diplomat declined to talk 
to reporters. 
  Police sources said that after the Hebron incident, senior 
government officials instructed police to tighten security at a 
Jewish synagogue in Sukhumwit Soi 22 and at the Israeli Embassy. 
Police bomb expert Somkiat Nakhon said if the explosives on the 
truck had been detonated, the resulting blast would have spread 
over at least a one-kilometre radius. 
  A police report seen by reporters said the explosives had an 
"inestimable destructive power". "I have been involved with 
bombs for 10 years," said Sgt Maj Somkiat. "This is the largest 
amount I have ever seen. It is the work of real professionals." 
  Crime Suppression Police said they were joining with Bangkok 
police to investigate the case. All "suspicious" Middle East 
immigrants in Thailand were having their records checked, said 
Crime Suppression Commander Pol Maj Gen Wannarat Kaacharak. A 
police source said a number of Arabs had been under the police 
surveillance, but law enforcers could not restrict them because 
"they have done nothing illegal". He added that it was very 
likely the plotters were not on the police blacklist. 
"International terrorist groups like to use people who are not 
blacklisted in a country to strike in that particular country," 
he said. 
  The source dismissed the possibility that the 
explosive-primed truck was the work of southern Thai 
secessionist terrorists. "Southern terrorists have never 
operated outside the southernmost provinces. And in this case 
it's quite obvious that a foreign facility, not our government 
buildings, was the target. 
  Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said 
there was no concrete evidence so far to link the explosives to 
international terrorism. "It's sheer luck that the truck owner 
sensed something wrong with the water tank," Banyat said.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan talked to 
reporters at Government House this morning about police officers 
at Lumpini Police Station in Bangkok finding explosives and a 
dead body in a six-wheel truck in front of the station. He said 
that there is no new developments from what the Police 
Department director general has said. Police officers will 
follow up the case closely in accordance with their preliminary 
assumption, which is based on the evidence. Further information 
will be sought. Although preventive measures have been regularly 
reviewed and implemented, there are still some loopholes, he 
noted. 
  Commenting on the same incident, Deputy Prime Minister 
Bunchu 
Rotchanasathian said the National Security Council has followed 
up the issue. He admitted that it is fortunate that the 
explosives were discovered before a serious incident occurred. 
Regarding this, he believes it will not be difficult to find 
the culprits. 
  To prevent such an event from happening is difficult, he 
went 
on to say. For example, in other countries, despite stringent 
preventive measures, these sorts of incidents are still 
possible. On the question of whether stringent measures will be 
imposed on incoming and outgoing passengers at Bangkok 
International Airport, Bunchu said officials are prepared to 
catch the suspects there and he believes the offenders are still 
in Thailand. Judging from the purposes of the offenders, no 
Thais are believed to be involved in the operations, but the 
offenders may have some connection in Thailand.

  [Text] Israeli Ambassador `Uzi Manor said last night he was 
waiting for results of police investigations to establish the 
motive or the possible target of the explosives. He said the 
embassy always takes precautionary measures but Thai police have 
not assigned extra reinforcements to guard the embassy. 
"Reinforcements are at the discretion of the police," he said. 
  The embassy is located in Soi Langsuan. Police suggested 
earlier in the day that the explosives could have been designed 
to avenge the massacre last month at Hebron on the West Bank. 
"But it could be the embassy was selected at random. The 
incident may be connected with the problems in the South. 
Whatever it is, the result could have been a major disaster," 
he added. 
  The embassy has reported the finding of the explosives to 
Jerusalem. "This is standard practice in these circumstances," 
he said.

  [Text] Hawaii -- Thailand is to permit five new foreign 
bank branches by 1997 according to its latest offer to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), Finance Minister 
Tharin Nimmanhemin said here yesterday. 
  The proposal, which also includes the country's agreement to 
treat ATM machines operated by foreign bank branches on equal 
terns with local banks, has been passed on to Lloyd Bentsen, the 
US treasury secretary. 
  "Secretary Bentsen welcomes our proposal," Tharin said 
yesterday. He is leading a delegation of Thai officials to the 
meeting of finance ministers of 17 member countries of 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec), which will start the 
official meeting on Saturday. 
  The US government has been pushing for financial 
liberalization and market access under the new Gatt round. The 
new Gatt round due to be signed in the middle of April, hinges 
on the US demand that financial market access should be tied to 
the Gatt signing. 
  The US is understood to be angry with other countries' 
refusal to meet financial market access demands on the ground 
that the Americans have the most liberalized market in the 
world. It is not clear yet what the US would do if the financial 
liberalization is not resolved by the middle of next month. 
  Tharin said Thailand will be doing more than other Asean 
countries in opening up the financial market. He said five 
licencees of Bangkok International Banking Facilities (BIBF) 
will be upgraded to full branches by 1997. Thailand also told 
Bentsen that it is separating finance and securities companies 
which would allow foreign financial institutions to hold a 49 
per cent stake in a securities company and up to 25 per cent in 
a finance company. Currently, foreigners can only hold up to 25 
per cent of a finance and securities company. But Thai 
authorities have yet to define the ATM status of foreign banks; 
whether one machine will be counted as a branch or allowed to be 
classified in general terms under the national ATM pool system. 
"I don't mind either one or the other," Tharin said. 
  Meanwhile, the US is threatening to pass a law to withdraw 
the most favoured nation status from countries which do not 
yield to its market access demand. But such action would 
contradict Gatt rules. 
  At the same time, Tharin said Asean will have to hasten the 
implementation of Asean Free Trade Area (Afta)'s tariff cut 
programme from 15 years to 10-12 years. This is because the 
Gatt refuses to extend the 15-year tax cut process. The offer 
was part of a package proposal improved on the old version 
submitted to Gatt last December.

<F P=106> [Letter to the editor by former Foreign Minister Thanat </F>
Khoman; from the "Post Bag" column] 
  [Text] Sir: I am surprised and disgusted to see an 
ambassador, in this case US Ambassador Lambertson, treat 
Thailand as if it were an American colony. Who does he think he 
is? A satrap of an American emperor? Or a "gauleiter" of a new 
Hitler? As a diplomatist, he did not learn about the "comitas 
gentium" (I hope he understands what these words mean.) 
  Do knock it into your head, Mr Ambassador that contacts 
between Thailand and the Khmer Rouge, much to our displeasure 
started at the time when communist Vietnam invaded and 
militarily occupied Cambodia. At that time, the US was nowhere 
to be seen, probably hiding its head in the sands suffering from 
the Vietnam syndrome. And the contacts were meant to help repel 
the Vietnamese. There is no kinship between Thais and Khmer 
Rouge who are a product of French culture. 
  As to the sanctions against Thai companies dealing with 
Libya, suffice it to say that it is by no means proved that 
those so-called plants would serve to build chemical weapons. 
It is in fact an American assumption to show its power and 
dominate the world. In any case, who appoints the US to be 
judge and arbiter -- or simply international "cops"? If the US 
continues to behave like this, sooner or later and sooner rather 
than later, according to the Law of Karma, it will have to pay 
for its wanton and egregious behaviour. There will be more 
floods, more earthquakes and hurricanes descending upon that 
land, causing destruction and sufferings to its people who do 
not deserve the punishment for the crimes of their leaders. 
[Signed] Thanat Khoman, Bangkok

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said 
yesterday Vietnam should be invited to discuss overlapping 
territorial waters over which Cambodia has called for talk with 
Thailand. Surin said Vietnam has also declared an exclusive 
economic zone of 200 nautical miles which creates an overlap 
with the waters of Thailand and Cambodia. 
  "Vietnam should be invited to discussions on unclear 
boundaries, so that the problems can be solved," said the 
minister. Thailand and Vietnam have held several rounds of 
talks, without the presence of Cambodia which at the time still 
had internal conflicts. 
  Recently a Cambodian minister called for urgent talks with 
Thailand on the disputed zone following discovery of oil near 
the area. Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri welcomed the move, 
saying Thailand is ready to talk on the issue. Thailand has 
urged Cambodia to set up a joint commission on boundaries but 
Cambodia shelved the matter for unknown reasons. 
  Surin said Bangkok and Phnom Penh have used different maps 
in 
defining boundaries. The problem is exacerbated by the fact 
that the Cambodians say they used the maps when they formulated 
their Constitution, Surin said without elaborating. "Cambodia 
doesn't seem to be ready for talks as it has just emerged from 
civil war and is busy with national reconciliation and 
reconstruction," he said. 
  The minister will next Wednesday visit Cambodia to deliver a 
speech at an international seminar. He said during his three-day 
visit to the country he would meet with senior Cambodian 
officials and the boundary issue would be among scheduled topics. 
  The military will adopt severe counter measures against 
Cambodian brigands if they continue robbing, harassing and 
sometimes killing local Thais living along the border, a senior 
military officer said yesterday. First Army Commander Chettha 
Thanacharo said Army Commander in Chief, Gen Wimon Wongwanit, 
has urged troops manning the border to subdue the Cambodian 
bandits and if they still resist, severe suppression would be 
used. "Armed persons have to surrender their weapons when they 
step into Thai territory," Chettha said.

<F P=106> [By Somphon Thapanachai and Peter Maitri Ungphakon] </F>
  [Text] Australia's Trade Minister Bob McMullen yesterday 
renewed his country's calls for Thailand to grant Australians 
business rights equal to those allowed Americans, and for lower 
tariffs on breakfast cereals. The calls were made during a 
meeting with Thai Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon and 
included a request for Qantas, the Australian airline, to be 
granted more landing rights and easier tax terms. 
  One of the issues Mr Uthai raised during the meeting at the 
Commerce Ministry was a complaint about excessively tight 
immigration restrictions for Thai businessmen and women, and for 
students. No resolutions were reached during the meeting, but Mr 
McMullen stressed afterwards that he considered the differences 
to be a small part of a "rapidly growing and harmonious" trade 
relationship. 
  Some progress was made on setting up a bilateral economic 
commission, but details have not yet been completed, Mr McMullen 
said. With Thai and Australian leaders due to meet again in the 
next few weeks, including Australia's Prime Minister Bob Keating 
-- who will visit Thailand to open the bridge across the Mekong 
River to Laos next month -- an announcement on the commission 
might be made in a month or so, he said. 
  Mr McMullen is on his first trip outside Australia since his 
appointment in January. He is making a series of courtesy calls 
in ASEAN before attending a meeting in Kuala Lumpur of the 
Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), a regional body 
representing governments, business and academics. 
  Australia, along with other developed countries, such as 
those in the European Union, has been calling for rights equal 
to those granted to Americans under the 1966 Thai-US Amity 
Treaty, which allows US citizens to engage in a number of 
services and professional occupations normally restricted to 
Thais. 
  Under pressure, both bilaterally and through the Uruguay 
Round of multilateral trade talks, Thai ministers and officials 
have been considering whether to withdraw the special rights 
granted under the Thai-US treaty or to extend the same rights to 
other trading partners. 
  Mr Uthai said he explained to his Australian counterpart 
that 
the Thai-US treaty was signed when Thailand had no elected 
government. The present, elected Government is reviewing the 
treaty to determine whether it should be maintained, revoked or 
amended. "I personally do not want to talk about revoking the 
treaty because it may harm the relationship (between Thailand 
and the United States). But a revision to reduce the coverage 
of the treaty is necessary to make it reflect the current 
situation," Mr Uthai said. 
  Australia also wants Thailand to reduce the import duty on 
breakfast cereals from 60 percent to 20 percent. From 
Canberra's point of view, this would mainly affect products made 
in Australia by Kelloggs, a US company. Kelloggs wants the duty 
cut so that it can better compete with Nestle's corn flakes, 
which are made in the Philippines and enjoy a 6 percent tariff 
as an ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture -- a programme that cuts 90 
percent from basic rates for at least four years. 
  Thai sources say that in previous discussions, they proposed 
that the Australians talk to ASEAN as a whole. They also 
suggested that Australian-made breakfast cereal could be given a 
different customs classification because it is made using a 
different process. 
  The Australian national flag carrier, Qantas, wants 
increased 
landing rights, but the two sides differ over whether the 
flights should be considered as using Bangkok as a stop-over 
point for passengers or as an origin or destination point. 
Qantas also desires its value-added tax [VAT] assessment to be 
"zero-rated" instead of "exempt". The former would allow the 
airline to claim VAT rebates for tax paid on purchases even 
though no tax is paid on sales, while the latter does not 
because it puts the airline outside the VAT system. The Finance 
Ministry has ruled that zero rating will be reciprocal, meaning 
it will be granted only to companies from countries that also 
grant zero rating to Thai firms. Mr Uthai said he had told Mr 
McMullen that these issues are not handled by the Commerce 
Ministry but he would pass on the requests. 
  The two sides had prepared information for discussing 
multilateral issues such as the future of the Cairns Group of 14 
agricultural exporting nations, and the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) group, but Mr McMullen, who left yesterday 
afternoon for Manila after less than a day in Bangkok, said 
there was not enough time to discuss these matters. 
  He said he could discuss the Cairns Group and APEC with 
Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak and Mr Uthai at 
the PECC meeting in Kuala Lumpur next Tuesday. Briefing 
reporters at the Australian Embassy, Mr McMullen said his 
priority for the year is "open regionalism" through the 
development of APEC, which would be the dominant framework of 
Thai-Australian relationships and such issues as the Cairns 
Group. His comments reflected what Thailand and other ASEAN 
countries see as Australia's aggressiveness on developing trade 
and investment cooperation within APEC. ASEAN advocates a 
slower approach. 
  Mr McMullen said he favours making the Cairns Group a 
permanent body to monitor implementation of the Uruguay Round 
agreements on agriculture. The Cairns Group was set up to lobby 
in the Uruguay Round for farm trade liberalisation. Australia 
is chairman and Thailand plays an active role. Dr Suphachai has 
also said he favours making the Cairns Group permanent. 
  The group is to meet in Marrakech, Morocco, next month, when 
the 118 participants in the Uruguay Round convene to sign the 
round's agreements. Another formal Cairns Group meeting is to 
be held in May in Uruguay.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters after his meeting with the 
Chinese ambassador to Thailand on 17 March, Deputy Prime 
Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian said he and the envoy had 
discussed economic and trade cooperation between Thailand and 
China and efforts to improve the living standards of the Thai 
and Chinese peoples. A special topic for discussion, he said, 
was the situation of various Asian countries, namely China, 
Thailand, and Japan, in encountering the protectionist trade 
measures imposed by the United States and European Union. Both 
Thailand and China have agreed with the concept of an Asia for 
Asia cooperation program. 
  Under this program, Asian nations will join hands in 
developing the quality standards of their products, boosting the 
standard of living of their peoples, and coordinating the 
management of their natural resources in line with their 
cultural values so that they will not be dominated by western 
and U.S. influences. 
  Bunchu said: "Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will bring up 
this 
issue for discussion and consultation with Japanese officials 
during his visit to Japan in April." 
  Asked if the Asia for Asia program is a form of free trade 
cooperation, Bunchu replied that configuration has not been 
discussed. Further consultation must be held with all countries 
concerned to decide what can be done. Several countries will 
participate in this plan, which will include cultural 
cooperation. 
  Bunchu also said that he will visit China at the invitation 
of the Chinese trade minister, and discuss with the Chinese side 
trade and investment cooperation among the four nations 
[Thailand, Laos, Burma, and China] under the Northern Quadrangle 
economic development program.

  [Excerpt] France has lifted its ban on Thai fishery product 
imports, ending a month-long dispute between the two countries, 
according to official sources. French diplomats in Bangkok would 
not confirm or deny the reports, but Deputy Commerce Minister 
Chaiyot Sasomsap said the French Government had notified its 
Thai counterpart through the Thai Foreign Trade Department that 
Paris would abide by its commitments to allow the imports. The 
source said the Thai Commercial Counselor's office in Paris had 
reported that France would today freely allow the imports to 
enter. 
  A Commerce Ministry source said the ministry could not 
indicate why the process of adding Thailand to the list of 
countries allowed to export fishery produce to France was 
speeded up, after the Thai Government made diplomatic protests 
last week. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- The chances that the third 
round of talks between North Korea and the United States will be 
held within the agreed upon time are very small, North Korean 
Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil said. 
  Meeting journalists in Moscow on Thursday, the ambassador 
blamed the American side for thwarting the meeting planned for 
March 21, saying that not a single obligation it has assumed 
under the February 25 agreement has been fulfilled. 
  He stressed that North Korea has done its best to observe 
the 
conditions of the agreement, particularly it allowed 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts into its 
nuclear facilities and started consultations with 
representatives of South Korea to prepare for the exchange of 
envoys. 
  Son Song-pil brushed off accusations that North Korea 
"treated IAEA exerts unsatisfactorily and did not grant them 
access to some nuclear facilities." He described such 
allegations as "a fabrication of the Western mass media." 
  The ambassador pointed out that recently the North Korean 
Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering received a telegram from 
the IAEA deputy director which claimed that North Korea had 
failed to provide normal conditions for the operation of IAEA 
experts and overpriced materials they used for analyses. 
  "From the very first day of their stay in North Korea all 
necessary conditions were created for their work," he said. 
However, "their demands were too high and corresponded to a 
large-scale rather than limited nuclear inspection which was 
approved by North Korea," the ambassador continued. The 
question of carrying out comprehensive inspection was due to be 
discussed at the upcoming round of U.S.-North Korean talks, he 
said. 
  Son Song-pil stressed that the fate of the third round of 
talks depends on the U.S. Administration which should abandon 
"unreasonable conditions" and strictly observe the agreements 
reached by the sides at their February meeting.

  [Text] Son Song-pil, ambassador of our country to Russia, 
on 14 March held a news conference in connection with the 
ongoing North-South working-level contact for the exchange of 
top-level envoys. 
  Present at the news conference were reporters of the Russian 
papers PATRIOT and (WETCHERAN,) and the Russian radio 
broadcasting network. 
  The ambassador spoke at the conference. The ambassador 
pointed out that thanks to our side's sincere effort, the 
North-South working-level contact for the exchange of top-level 
special envoys, which was suspended in October last year, was 
resumed and that our side proposed last year the exchange of 
North-South top-level special envoys and made every possible 
effort to realize the exchange at an early date. 
  He said: During the current contact, our side put forward 
four-point proposals that the large-scale nuclear war exercises 
be suspended; the so-called the international cooperative 
system, which is intended to harm fellow countrymen on a pretext 
of so-called the nuclear issue, be discarded; the introduction 
of Patriot missiles into South Korean be suspended; and the 
remarks by the person in authority in South Korea that he cannot 
shake hands with a dialogue partner should be canceled. This 
proceeded from a sincere position to create an atmosphere of 
trust between the North and the South and to smoothly resolve 
the issue of exchanging the special envoys. 
  Nevertheless, the South side, from the outset, evaded 
expression of its attitude toward the principled demands put 
forward by our side. The South side repeated its previous claims 
that our just demands are issues and preconditions not related 
to talks in an attempt to justify its erroneous position on 
dialogue, thus laying a barrier to the working-level contact. 
  This illustrates that the South side has no intention to 
exchange top-level special envoys with us. The South Korean 
authorities even made presumptuous remarks that although the 
working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys began, 
they cannot take an optimistic view on North-South relations, 
the United States will not hold a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks 
before special envoys are exchanged, and so forth. 
  By doing this, they revealed their vicious intention to put 
the brake on DPRK-U.S. talks, to block a solution to the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula, and to harm fellow countrymen 
together with outside forces while continually pursuing 
North-South confrontation. 
  The four-point simultaneous action steps for a package 
solution of the nuclear problem, which was agreed upon during 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, have not assumed any 
precondition. However, the South Korean authorities made unjust 
assertions that the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and holding of a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks assume 
the exchange of North-South special envoys and inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] as preconditions. The 
purpose of their unjust demand is to rupture [patan] the 
DPRK-U.S. talks by taking part in discussion of the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula. 
  As has been known to the entire world, the nuclear problem 
on 
the Korean peninsula is the question that should be resolved 
between us and the United States. 
  The South Korean authorities have neither authority nor 
qualification to participate in this. They have nothing to do 
with the issue. 
  The third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, when they are held, will 
be an important occasion for a solution to the nuclear problem 
on the Korean peninsula, and the pending issues between the 
North and the South will be resolved easily. 
  Therefore, the most important issue is to sincerely fulfill 
the agreement made in DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, and to 
realize DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date. 
  If the South Korean authorities are interested in resolving 
the pending issues between the North and the South in a manner 
of dialogue and negotiation by realizing the exchange of special 
envoys, they should discard the attitude of confrontation 
denying dialogue, instead of laying barrier to dialogue by 
raising unjust conditions, and should come to contact for the 
exchange of North- South special envoys with sincere attitude 
without any precondition. 
  Success in dialogue totally depends on the position and 
attitude of the South side. 
  Following this, the ambassador answered reporters' 
questions.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- Yuriy Fadeyev, Russian 
ambassador to Korea, hosted a reception at his embassy on the 
evening of March 17 to mark the 45th anniversary of the signing 
of the agreement on economic and cultural cooperation between 
Korea and Russia. 
  Invited to the reception were Yi Song-tae, chairman of the

  [Text] The South Korean puppet clique's insincere attitude 
lacking will for dialogue [taehwa uijiga omnun pulsongsilhan 
taedo] has created severe obstacles [omjunghan nangwan] to 
North-South working-level contacts for an exchange of top-level 
special envoys, which have been arranged after a long time 
[mochorom maryondoen]. 
  According to Seoul radio, in a meeting with reporters on 15 
March, Yi Yong-tok, South Korean puppet unification board 
minister, made absurd remarks that the Panmunjom working-level 
contacts for the envoy exchange would end in failure, that the 
result of the contacts is unpredictable, and the like. 
  Puppet defense minister Yi Pyong-tae also openly talked 
about 
resuming the Team Spirit joint military exercise this year when 
he met with the U.S. undersecretary of defense that day, saying 
that the exchange of special envoys between the South and the 
North was unlikely to be realized. 
  The puppets' insidious remarks of discouraging [chanmurul 
kkionnun] the working-level contacts for the envoy exchange 
vividly show that the Kim Yong-sam group has no will to discuss 
pending issues between the North and the South. 
  It is entirely related to the South Korean puppet clique's 
unjust behavior [pudanghan chosawa kwallyon toemnida] that the 
North-South working-level contacts for the exchange of special 
envoys, which have been resumed according to the agreement 
reached in the New York contact between the DPRK and the United 
States, went four rounds in March but failed to get anywhere. 
  The South Korean puppets' maneuver to create deliberate 
obstacles [inwijogin nangwan] to the envoy exchange was utterly 
proven in the seventh working-level contact. The South side 
objected to our side's proposal for announcing a joint 
communique informing that the two sides reconfirmed the will for 
the envoy exchange and agreed to exchange special envoys at an 
early date. It also blindly [toponoko] objected to our side's 
suggestion that the issues of observing the principle of 
national independence, deciding on the way of national 
reunification, and promoting the great unity of the whole nation 
be stipulated in the draft agreement with regard to the missions 
of special envoys. 
  The measure our side has taken is a constructive 
[konsolchogin] proposal that creates a significant momentum not 
only for hastening the envoy exchange but for making a new 
starting point in North-South relations and giving hope to all 
compatriots who are concerned about the prospect of the envoy 
exchange. 
  Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets are trying to prevent 
the envoy exchange from being realized and are driving the talks 
to a dangerous situation by stubbornly insisting that they 
cannot accept the epochal measure proposed by us.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
staged an all-round air war exercise targeted against the North 
on March 16 by mobilizing formations of fighter-bombers, 
pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical take-off and landing] 
assault planes from their overseas bases, in coordination with 
flying corps of the U.S. Seventh Air Force in South Korea, 
according to military sources. 
  More than 350 planes of various types were flown in the 
exercise, which was staged with the air above Kapyong, Yongwol 
and Kongju, South Korea, as the operation theatre, for the 
purpose of intensive bombing, aerial warfare, support for ground 
units and airlifting. 
  Meanwhile, groups of large-calibre artillery pieces and 
bandits of the South Korean puppet army fired more than 100 
shells and 1,500 bullets at spots adjacent to the Demilitarized 
Zone and toward the Military Demarcation Line from Paju and 
Yonchon Counties, Kyonggi Province, and Chorwon County, South 
Korean Kangwon Province, on the 16th. 
  Formations of several dozen helicopter gunships and 
transport 
helicopters belonging to the puppet army staged an exercise for 
supporting ground units and airlifting in the air above Yonchon 
County and Inje and Chorwon Counties, South Korean Kangwon 
Province. 
  The frantic war gamble directed against the northern half of 
Korea fully revealed the bellicose nature of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets.

<F P=106> ["They Sharpen Sword Behind Dialogue"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- The reckless war 
exercises such as "defence exercise against landing" staged by 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique behind the scene of dialogue show 
that they seek a way out only in confrontation and war, 
challenging the nation's desire for peace and peaceful 
reunification, declares NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  If the puppets are interested in North-South dialogue and a 
peaceful settlement of the reunification question, they must 
refrain from war exercises against the dialogue partner. 
  Their continued play with fire, which is incompatible with 
dialogue, cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate act to 
obstruct the working-level contact at Panmunjom and frustrate 
the exchange of special envoys. This is proved by the South 
Korean rulers' wrong dialogue stance toward the working-level 
contact. 
  By making the exchange abortive, they intend to put a spoke 
in the wheel of DPRK-U.S. talks, hinder the settlement of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and slay fellow countrymen 
with the help of foreign sword. 
  The double-faced acts of the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs, 
who sharpen the sword against fellow countrymen behind the scene 
of dialogue for the exchange of special envoys, are bound to 
face criticism at home and abroad. 
  The nation will never pardon the "civilian"-veiled 
warmaniacs 
who stick to confrontation at a time when the entire fellow 
countrymen are all out to achieve reunification in the 1990s 
through the unity of the nation.

<F P=106> ["Abolition of `National Security Law' Is Demand of Times " </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today urges that the Kim Yong-sam traitorous 
clique should look squarely at the trend of the times and scrap 
the ill-famed "National Security Law [NSL]" without delay as 
demanded by the people at home and abroad. 
  The "NSL" in South Korea is an anti-communist fascist law of 
the worst kind in history, the article says, and goes on: 
  It is an anti-national, anti-reunification evil law that 
defines the same fellow countrymen as the enemy and totally 
denies national unity. It is a fascist law that most ruthlessly 
tramples and cracks down upon the people's desire for 
independence, democracy and reunification in South Korea. 
  The "NSL" defines all the organizations and population of 
the 
northern half of the country, the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan and all the 
progressive overseas Koreans living in different parts of the 
world as "anti-state organizations" and "members of anti-state 
organizations" and regards them as objects of "punishment". 
  It is a crime and a disgrace of the nation to have such 
anti-national, anti-reunification evil law like the "NSL" that 
denies the same fellow countrymen. 
  Terrorism, murders, unwarranted arrests and killing tortures 
against dissident political forces and guiltless people 
committed by fascist dictators in South Korea up until now were 
"legalized" as a whole under the notorious "National Security 
Law". 
  Unless the ill-famed "NSL" is abolished in South Korea, the 
independence and democratization of society cannot be realized, 
nor can the reunification of the country be achieved, nor can 
human rights abuses be uprooted in South Korea. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors, however, are intending 
to maintain the notorious "NSL" in a bid to incite North-South 
confrontation and block the reunification of the country and to 
further strengthen their "civilian" fascist rule in South Korea. 
Kim Yong-sam is, indeed, a traitor to the nation who is pursuing 
the treacherous policy against the nation, reunification and 
democracy more maliciously than any preceding dictators of the 
successive military dictatorial "regimes" did in South Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told a plenary session of the House 
of Councillors a few days ago that the reexamination of the 
"outline of the defense program" was not aimed at reduction of 
defence forces. 
  Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today declares it reveals 
Japan's intention to promote arms buildup and overseas 
aggrandizement more openly. 
  The news analyst says: 
  No country in the world now can match Japan in the growth 
rate of military spendings and the scope of armed forces 
reinforcement. 
  Japan's move to become a military power and arm itself with 
nuclear weapons fully reveals the Japanese reactionaries' wild 
design to build up enough strength to enter into the scrambles 
for world supremacy. 
  They intend to extend the operational scope of the 
"self-defence forces" worldwide and realise their dominationist 
ambition with strength, crying for Japan's "international role 
commensurate with its power." 
  In order to legitimate their dangerous nuclear armament and 
overseas aggrandizement, they are making a fuss about the 
"nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  If the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is resolved 
fundamentally and it becomes a nuclear-free zone, the Japanese 
reactionaries will lose the pretext for turning Japan into a 
military power and promoting its nuclear armament and will be 
unable to stage a comeback to the Korean peninsula, a part of 
their old dream of "the greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere". 
This is why they are creating obstacles to the settlement of 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, hurling mud at the 
DPRK, and are aggravating military confrontation and tension in 
this part of the world. 
  They must know that their reckless act will only precipitate 
their self-destruction.

received the Korean ambassador on March 8 and said that the 
United States must stop setting preconditions in implementing 
the agreed conclusions reached between the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea and the United States and come out to the 
third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks with sincerity. 
  The chairman of the National Executive Committee of the Left

the Korean ambassador on March 9. He said the United States 
should honestly implement the agreed conclusions, and added: 
"The third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks must be held as 
scheduled and the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be 
resolved in a package deal as proposed by the DPRK." 
  The chairman of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, 
Narayan 
Man Bijukchhe, released a statement on March 4 saying that the 
"nuclear issue" on the Korean peninsula had been invented and 
scenarized by the United States and it had rendered the 
situation of the Korean peninsula strained against the interests 
of the Asian people. 
  He voiced firm solidarity with the Workers' Party of Korea 
and the Korean people in the consistent efforts they are making 
for the relaxation of the situation of the Korean peninsula 
through talks, maintaining a principled stand, undaunted by the 
U.S. pressure and threat.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- The International 
Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of 
Korea and the Foreign Ministry gave a reception Thursday evening 
to mark the lapse of eight years since the Korea visit by Fidel 
Castro, first secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of Cuba and president of the Council of State 
and president of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of 
Cuba. 
  Addressing the reception, Kim Yong-nam, Politburo member of 
the WPK Central Committee and vice-premier of the Administration 
Council and foreign minister, said Comrade Fidel Castro visited 
Korea and had a significant meeting with the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song, and this was a realisation of the 
long-cherished ardent desire of the peoples of the two countries 
who were fighting in the same trench of the common struggle 
against imperialism and for independence and socialism, and a 
historical event that developed the traditional Korea-Cuba 
relations of friendship and cooperation to a new high level. 
  Noting that the Cuban people are accelerating socialist 
construction, successfully frustrating the U.S. imperialists' 
manoeuvrings to isolate and seal off Cuba, under the 
revolutionary slogan "Let us defend the motherland, revolution 
and the gains of socialism!", he said the Korean people extend 
firm solidarity to the Cuban people in their cause of justice. 
  He stressed the party and people of Korea will advance 
shoulder to shoulder with the Cuban party and people along the 
straight road to victory of socialism for ever. 
  Jose Ramon Rodriguez Varona, Cuban ambassador to Korea, in 
his address said "Comrade Fidel's visit to the DPRK, the first 
of its kind in the history of Cuba, was a realisation of the 
cherished desire of our comrade supreme commander to personally 
visit heroic Korea and spend supreme days with Comrade President 
Kim Il-song, the great leader of the Korean people." 
  He underlined the excellent bonds of friendship and unity 
existing between the governments and peoples of the two 
countries that are defending socialism under so difficult 
conditions. 
  He added that unquestioned support for Korea's cause of 
reunification is the first and foremost political activity of 
Cuba and it will be always invariable.

farmers of the Komsan cooperative farm in Sukchon County who set 
an example in carrying out the technical revolution in the 
countryside. 
  This cooperative farm set a target a few years ago for all 
farmers to learn how to operate tractors and other farm machines 
and sent 520 farmers to the Sukchon agricultural mechanization 
school to study while working on the occasion of the 30th 
anniversary of the publication of the rural theses. 
  Managerial and junior officials of the farm and three 
revolution team members dispatched there themselves learned how 
to drive tractors, leading farmers. 
  Thus, 520 farmers have graduated from the school and been 
able to operate all farm machines.

Comrade Kim Chong-il sent 500 tractors and 250 trucks to rural 
communities of Chongdan, Yonan and Paechon Counties, South 
Hwanghae Province. 
  These counties are situated in the Yonbaek plain on the west 
coast, one of the nation's granaries. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il gave on-the-spot guidance to the plain 
several times to clearly indicate the direction and ways of 
improving the people's living standard and increasing 
agricultural production, and this time sent many tractors and 
lorries to the rural communities there so as to follow up the

wise 
guidance and deep loving care of our party has turned into a 
modern socialist countryside good to live and work in and a 
place holding a big share in the nation's production of grain. 
  They vowed to harvest more than ten tons of rice or maize 
from each hectare this year by doing farming including sowing 
and rice transplanting as demanded by the chuche method of 
farming.

<F P=106> ["Great Vitality of WPK's Idea and Theory on Position and </F>
Role of County" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article contributed by Pang Chun-sam, chief secretary 
of the Sakju County, North Pyongan Province, Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea, on the lapse of 30 years since the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published his famous work "Position 
and Role of the County in Socialist Construction." 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: 
  "To enhance the role of the county and remove the gap 
between 
town and country and the gap between the working class and the 
peasantry is a strategic task facing the working-class party and 
state after the establishment of the socialist system." 
  The author of the article says: 
  The idea, theory and policies set out in the work have 
displayed a great vitality in promoting socialist rural 
construction, developing the local economy and improving the 
people's standard of living. 
  The validity and vitality of the idea and theory on the 
position and role of the county in socialist construction find 
expression, first of all, in that the rural base of socialism 
has been consolidated through the dynamic promotion of the 
ideological revolution and active efforts to make the party 
members and other working people revolutionary and assimilate 
them to the working class. 
  The function and role of the county party committee have 
been 
enhanced and ideological education of the working class on the 
revolutionary and working-class lines has been strengthened, 
with the result that the party members and other working people 
are firmly equipped with the revolutionary idea of our party, 
the socialist idea of chuche, and they take the chuche idea as 
the guiding principle. 
  Although the imperialists and reactionaries have launched a 
more vicious political and ideological offensive than ever 
before to undermine the people's faith in socialism, our 
agricultural working people firmly trust the party and the 
leader and are building socialism with might and main, full of 
confidence and optimism, meeting the challenge of the enemy. 
  The great vitality of the idea and theory on the position 
and 
role of the county in socialist construction finds clear 
expression also in that a great progress has been made in 
promoting socialist rural construction and removing the gap 
between town and country. 
  In Korea today the county serves as a centre linking town 
and 
country in all spheres of politics, the economy and culture and 
as the basic unit of guidance and management of agriculture. 
  With the increase of the state's material and technical 
assistance to the countryside with the county as the base, 
advanced industrial management and production culture have been 
introduced widely in rural communities and the gap between 
industry and agriculture is getting narrower. 
  The great vitality of the idea and theory on the position 
and 
role of the county in socialist construction finds another clear 
expression in that the local economy has been developed 
comprehensively so as to satisfy the growing material demands of 
the people and evenly develop all parts of the country. 
  Comprehensive development of the local economy makes it 
possible to diminish the differences between local areas in 
economic development by enabling every county to make an 
effective and rational use of its favorable natural and 
geographical conditions and production reserves to the maximum. 
  All counties, either in plain areas or in-mountainous areas, 
have done away with age-old backwardness and taken on new looks, 
those in-mountainous areas making use of mountains and those in 
the coastal areas making use of the seas in the development of 
the local economy. They are now positively contributing to the 
development of the local economy and the improvement of the 
people's standard of living.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The People's Absolute Trust in the </F>
Party is a Revolutionary Ethos in Our Society"] 
  [Text] In the course of the struggle for the revolution 
under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, our party has been absolutely supported and trusted by 
the popular masses. Also, it has gained a noble achievement in 
maintaining the solid unity and cohesion with them. The 
people's absolute trust in the party is just a true 
revolutionary ethos in our society. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Our 
people only recognize the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] as their 
political guide and totally entrust their fate to the party. 
They are also overflowing with a firm resolution to consummate 
the chuche revolutionary cause to the end under the leadership 
of the party. 
  The devotion and greatness of our party -- which sacrifices 
itself to the interest and happiness of the popular masses -- 
our people's absolute support and trust in the party, and the 
invincibility of the unity and cohesion between the party and 
the popular masses have been fully embodied in our social ethos 
in which the party serves the people, while the people trust and 
follow it. 
  The party's political leadership for the masses and the 
people's trust in the party are inseparably related to each 
other. The people's trust in the party will be deepened only if 
the party's leadership, the party's politics, serves the popular 
masses. Also, the working class party can maintain close ties 
of kinship with the popular masses. 
  Under the wise leadership of the great comrade leader and 
the 
dear comrade leader, our party has, first of all, formulated the 
people-oriented policies in all stages of the revolution, as 
well as in all areas of the social life. By vigorously 
implementing them, it has established a high leading authority 
among the popular masses. As a result, it is absolutely 
supported and trusted by the people. 
  Ties between the party and the masses can be maintained 
based 
on the people's absolute trust in the party. Also, the people's 
trust in the party can be consolidated based on the party's 
people- oriented policy. If the party encroaches upon the 
interest of the popular masses or carries out a policy running 
counter to the people's intent, it cannot obtain support from 
the masses nor maintain close ties of kinship with them. 
  Our party has given priority to satisfying the demands of 
the 
people even when it has to adopt a decision. Also, it has 
considered the people's convenience first even when it has to 
build a certain plant. All our party's policies are rooted in 
the people's interest and happiness. 
  By regarding the constant enhancement of the people's 
standard of living as the best principle for our party's 
activity, the dear comrade leader has led the party to 
energetically struggle to responsibly and endlessly take care of 
the people's material and cultural lives and to provide them 
with an abundant life. 
  Even today, our party has constantly carried out the grand 
plans and operations to significantly raise the people's 
standard of living. It has also resolved to do everything if it 
is for the people. 
  This is why our people entirely entrust their destinies to 
our party and fight through fire and water for the party. 
  Our party also wins the people's great confidence by 
providing all members of society with worthy lives and by 
trusting them. The party's and leader's trust is the 
ideological and spiritual source that makes the popular masses 
trust the party and the leader. People can enjoy worthy lives 
because they trust the party and the leader. 
  Our people's confidence in the party is being amplified by 
our party's trust that guides and enables them to glorify their 
valuable political lives forever. 
  Thanks to the great trust of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, who values the people's social and political lives 
above all, all working people in various classes and strata have 
been able to grow to be undaunted revolutionaries with precious 
social and political lives even in the environment of our 
country, which has a very complicated social structure of 
residents [chumindurui sahoejok kusongi maeu pokchaphan 
urinaraui chogonesodo]. 
  Today, our people are firmly uniting themselves around the 
party and the leader to repay the trust of the dear comrade 
leader, who has prepared the most precious political lives and 
is glorifying them forever, with their fervent loyalty. 
  Our people's boundless confidence in the party is a valuable 
social trait that stands as a symbol for the blood relations 
between the party and the popular masses. The revolutionary 
trait of the socialist, communist society is an embodiment of 
the leader's [suryong] noble affectation. The loyalty of the 
popular masses, who, enthralled by noble characteristic of the 
leader [yongdoja] the revolution, uphold the party and the 
leader [suryong], is indeed pure and dutiful. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is leading all us along 
the single road of revolution with his boundlessly noble trait, 
magnanimity of embracing all the people in his bosom, and 
boundless love. Extraordinary traits of a great leader 
[yongdoja] evoke pure ideologies and feelings in people's minds. 
  Our people call, from the bottom of their hearts, our party 
a 
motherly party. They always think of the party's bosom whether 
happy or sad, and regard living in the warm bosom of the party 
as the greatest honor and happiness. 
  The lofty ideological feeling of the popular masses, who 
boundlessly trust, follow, and uphold the party, is an 
expression of their absolute confidence based on the 
revolutionary sense of duty and faith. Our people's confidence 
in the party is based on their absolute faith in the greatness 
of the leader [yongdoja] of the revolution. 
  Today, our party members and working people consider it a 
great national pride to carry out the revolution under the dear 
comrade leader's leadership, and are devoting themselves to 
implementing the party's sacred cause, entrusting their entire 
destinies to him. 
  Our party's confidence in the party is the purest, firm, and 
eternal one that will be protected and inherited through 
generations. As they have endless confidence in the party, our 
people are overflowing with the faith that they will follow the 
single road of loyalty with the party. 
  Today, when the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is leading 
our party and people, our people trust and follow the party more 
firmly than ever and are advancing toward the future of the 
revolution with firm confidence, united around the party. 
  Because our party takes care of the people while our people 
have boundless confidence in the party, as mentioned above, the 
most solid relationship has been established between the party 
and the popular masses. The blood linkage between our party and 
our people has been realized at the highest level, and it has 
invincible vitality. 
  The unity between our party and the popular masses is an 
invincible unity based on our people's firm faith to protect the 
party and the leader politically, ideologically, and 
death-defyingly and to thoroughly follow the leader's ideas and 
the party's intent. 
  Deeply experiencing the greatness of our party, which spares 
nothing for the sake of the people, our people trust and follow 
only the party invariably whether in glorious or severe days. 
Thanks to this lofty spiritual trait of our people, the 
beautiful deed of advancing toward the road directed by the 
party with the single- hearted unity around it is being spread 
in the whole society. 
  All our party members and working people should harden their 
revolutionary will to trust and follow the party and should be 
endlessly loyal to our party's ideology and leadership, so that 
they should accelerate the socialist cause.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- The production of 
grain increased 2.1 times, the number of tractors and lorries 
respectively 7 and 6 times, the number of agro-technicians and 
experts 13 times, and the amount of chemical fertilizers applied 
to each hectare 7.4 times in Unyul County, South Hwanghae 
Province. 
  These are achievements made in the county over the past 
thirty years after the publication of the socialist rural theses. 
  The county situated in the central western coast of Korea 
was 
a backward agrarian county in the past. 
  The agriculture of the county began to develop after the 
liberation of the country and made a rapid progress from the 
mid-1960s when the socialist rural theses was published. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song gave on-the-spot 
guidance to work of the Changyon, Wonpyong, Kwanhae and other 
cooperative farms in the county and clearly indicated the 
direction and ways of the county's agricultural development. 
  The county has put big efforts into agricultural irrigation. 
It dammed the Hanil, Kuwang and other rivers and streams to 
build reservoirs, including the Kwanhae and Kuwang reservoirs, 
and set up more than 400 pumping stations and completed a 200 km 
waterway project. Thus, all paddy and non-paddy fields were 
brought under irrigation. 
  The area of the cultivated land increased by hundreds of 
hectares through the reclamation of tideland and acquisition of 
more land. 
  With many dwelling houses, nurseries, kindergartens, 
hospitals, and public welfare and service facilities built in 
the countryside the rural villages have turned into socialist 
cultured ones good to live and work in. 
  At the cooperative farms where comprehensive mechanization 
has reached a stage of completion the farmers joyfully do 
farming with the help of machines. 
  The cooperative farms in the county have sixtyfive farm 
machines of more than 20 kinds each on an average. 
  Each farmer tends 10 hectares of maize fields at the 
Changyon 
and other cooperative farms. 
  Grain production has increased year by year in the county. 
Over 23,000 more tons of grain was produced last year than the 
previous year, countywide.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The "Youth Science and 
Technology March" is actively being conducted in Korea. 
  Many important scientific and technical questions arising in 
the realisation of chuche-orientation, modernization and 
scientification of the national economy have been solved in the 
course of the movement. 
  Last year alone, more than 20,000 technical innovation 
proposals including 600 odd inventions were presented. 
  Noticeable successes made last year were the development of 
a 
general diagnostic system of great importance in the advance of 
the machine tool industry, the completion of a new method of 
heat treatment, a steel plate processing robot controlled by a 
computer, a solar heat oven and the production of ornamental 
tiles from industrial wastes. 
  The development of medicines efficacious for malignant tumor 
and diseases and an artificial skin for healing burns and the 
production of new phosphate fertilizer are achievements in the 
scientific researches for public health and agriculture. 
  The "Youth Science and Technology March" is a mass movement 
of young people to rapidly develop the country's science and 
technology by accelerating the technical revolution. Starting 
in 1989, the movement set it as its goal to guide each young man 
and woman to acquire one or more kind of scientific knowledge 
and technique, elevate his or her level of technique and skill 
to a higher grade and realise at least one invention or one 
innovation and rationalization proposal. 
  Young people at industrial establishments and scientific 
research institutions across the country have developed and 
introduced more than 100,000 inventions and innovation proposals 
in the past five years, greatly contributing to the economic 
development of the country and the improvement of people's 
livelihood. 
  The technical innovation youth shock brigade and the 
automation youth shock brigade play a very big part in the 
movement. More than 2,850 technical innovation youth shock 
brigades and 850 automation youth shock brigades are active in 
the country involving tens of thousands of young people. 
  Nearly 10,000 new technological successes are annually 
introduced by them. Production and technical processes have 
been further modernized and much workforce, materials and fund 
have been saved thanks to their contributions. 
  The vigorous movement has produced a great many engineers, 
assistant engineers and experts and more than 3,000 inventors.

<F P=106> ["Revolutionary Comradeship Is Ideological and Moral Source </F>
of Our Singlehearted Unity" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
runs a signed article headlined "Revolutionary Comradeship Is 
Ideological and Moral Source of Our Singlehearted Unity". 
  The article quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as 
saying: 
  "The unity and cohesion of the party will be powerful when 
love for revolutionary comrades underlies it." 
  The paper further says: 
  Revolutionary comradeship is noble ideological and mental 
feelings between revolutionary comrades who are fighting in the 
same ranks to achieve common purpose and ideal under the 
guidance of the leader. 
  Our revolutionary comradeship is, above all, a major source 
of the close unity of the entire people around the illustrious 
leader in ideology and purpose and in-morality and obligation. 
  For the revolutionaries, the leader is a great comrade and a 
lifesaver who takes care of their destiny and future with full 
responsibility. Loyalty to the leader is the supreme 
manifestation of revolutionary comradeship. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great comrade and 
a 
great father of our revolutionary soldiers and people. The 
Korean people follow the dear leader with unshakable conviction 
and a sense of obligation, holding him in high esteem as the 
centre of unity, the centre of leadership. 
  Our singlehearted unity has an invincible might as we fully 
display revolutionary comradeship, resolved to share the same 
idea and destiny with the dear leader. 
  Unprecedented in history is such singlehearted unity based 
on 
revolutionary comradeship between the leader and the soldiers in 
which the leader loves and believes in his soldiers and the 
soldiers trust and remain loyal and devoted to him. 
  Our revolutionary comradeship also unites all members of 
society in a big harmonious family by turning the relations 
between them into true comradely bonds. 
  Being comradely love based on loyalty to the dear leader, 
our 
revolutionary comradeship closely rallies all the members of 
society like kinsmen. 
  An increasing number of people unhesitatingly donate their 
blood and flesh and cover handgrenades with their bodies on the 
point of explosion to save their comrades. These noble traits 
are a proud reality of our country today. 
  If they viewed the relations among people from the viewpoint 
of equivalent compensations, they would not have saved their 
downing comrades at the sacrifice of their lives. And young men 
and women would not have volunteered to marry disabled soldiers 
and adopted orphaned children and brought old men with no one to 
support them to look after them as their family members. 
  As they value comradeship most, all our people are true 
revolutionary comrades who share the same destiny on the road of 
the revolution. 
  In the course of fighting under the guidance of the dear 
leader, comradely love is regarded as most precious and our 
singlehearted unity is unbreakable. 
  With this powerful weapon, we are firmly defending 
Korean-style socialism and triumphantly advancing the revolution 
and construction, decisively frustrating any challenge of the 
imperialists.

  [Text] Canberra, March 17 (AFP) -- Australia had no 
intention of resuming defence cooperation with Burma until the 
military-ruled nation improved its human rights record, 
Australian Defence Minister Robert Ray said here Thursday. 
  Ray said Australia's re-establishment of accreditation of a 
defence attache did not mean there would be any change in that 
position. 
  Answering a question in parliament, Ray said the attache's 
role was merely to report back on what the Burmese regime and 
its military were doing. 
  "He is not there for defence links between the two 
countries," Ray said. "It's an erroneous view that has been in 
the press. 
  "The Australian government has no intention of resuming 
defence links with Burma. 
  "Given their human rights record, they are certainly not 
deserving of any substantial defence links at this stage. We 
certainly won't be doing such things as defence exports or 
military to military links. 
  "I can guarantee that we will not re-establish the normal 
sort of regional sort of defence relationship with Burma until 
they have a massive improvement in their human rights record." 
  Australian defence cooperation with Burma has been minimal 
and ties were cut entirely in 1991 with the Burmese SLORC [State 
Law and Order Restoration Council] regime's refusal to implement 
democratic reforms. 
  The SLORC military junta seized power in Burma in 1988 after 
blocking the clear winner of national elections, Aung San Suu 
Kyi, from taking power and suppressing the resultant nationwide 
pro- democracy protests. 
  Although Australia has an embassy in Rangoon, the defence 
attache accredited to Burma is based in Bangkok and will make 
occasional visits.

<F P=106> [By Michael Field] </F>
  [Text] Auckland, March 18 (AFP) -- Life used to be languid 
in the Cook Islands but its secretive offshore banking operation 
has now put the Pacific archipelago at the centre of a hurricane 
of claims of corruption and tax-dodging. 
  Cook Island understanding of it is deliberately hindered by 
laws which make it illegal to discuss tax laws publicly, while 
in New Zealand, where commercial papers have been leaked, High 
Court orders have kept the issue out of the headlines. 
  The head of the New Zealand First party, Winston Peters, on 
Wednesday accused the Cooks' government of a role in defrauding 
governments in Australia, Japan and New Zealand of "untold 
millions" in tax revenue. 
  It was done, he said, by dual bookkeeping -- issuing 
certificates to foreign companies saying they had paid 
withholding tax in the Cooks when, in fact, they had not. He 
said the Cooks pocketed a share of the money the companies saved 
by not paying tax in their home countries. 
  "Put simply, the government of the Cook Islands collects tax 
but gives it back to the favoured and malevolent few," he 
declared. 
  Corrupt officials in Australia, New Zealand and the Cook 
Islands were responsible for the system, he charged. 
  Peters' attack followed similar allegations made in 
Rarotonga, the islands' capital, on March 2 by Richard McDonald, 
former director of the Cooks' government auditing, and who is 
now an opposition candidate in general elections next Thursday. 
  Cooks Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Henry denies any 
corruption 
involved in his country's status as a tax haven. 
  "Our position has been and will continue to be that there 
has 
been no false certificates issued," he said. 
  But another politician, opposition Cooks' Alliance leader 
Norman George who was once in Sir Geoffrey's cabinet, made no 
sec@et the whole rationale of the operation was to make money by 
helping people not pay taxes in other countries. 
  "The more revenue we get the easier it is on the other 
(Cooks) taxpayers -- we do not want to break laws to get it but 
if we can do it legally then it we should," George said. 
  The ruling National Party successfully prevented Peters on 
16 
previous occasions from tabling papers that he says prove his 
claim. 
  But this time, the party in a tactical blunder forgot to 
raise the necessary oral objection to his production of papers. 
  Known as the "wine box" papers, for the way they first 
arrived in New Zealand, they are internal documents of Hong 
Kong-based European Pacific International (EPI). 
  EPI is a mysterious organisation whose activities are 
closely 
protected by the Cook Islands laws, and it is believed to be the 
vehicle for encouraging and channelling corporate funds int@ the 
tax haven. 
  It was founded by Australian David Lloyd who, with Sir 
Geoffrey, established the Cooks' offshore banking in 1981. 
  EPI's New Zealand representative David Lloyd rebutted any 
suggestion of wrongdoing, saying the company had at all times 
worked within the laws of countries where it does business. 
  At the same time, however, he angrily attacked Peters for 
tabling "confidential" documents that, he said, had been 
"stolen" from the company. 
  In a further development Thursday, an arm of EPI, the 
European Pacific Trust Co., won a court order in Rarotonga 
preventing another opposition group, the Democratic Party, from 
using "specified documents" related to the controversy, the 
party said. 
  EPI, contending that publication of the documents would do 
enormous harm to the Cooks, has also taken court action to gag 
three New Zealand media outlets from publishing them.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Kim Yong-sam by NHK </F>
announcer Hiroko Kuniya at the Chongwadae presidential offices 
in Seoul, South Korea; Kim speaks in Korean with superimposed 
translation in Japanese; the following is translated from 
Japanese -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Video shows Kim sitting face to face with Kuniya 
at a room in the Chongwadae] [Kuniya] Mr. President, you are 
set to pay your first official visit to Japan next week. What 
do you think of Japan? 
  [Kim] I lived under Japanese colonial rule when I was child. 
There were many things I witnessed for myself. Our nation was 
liberated from Japanese colonial rule when I was a third-year 
student at junior high school. It is no exaggeration to say 
that I am well aware of what happened at the time. I have 
thought long and hard about the position of South Korea in the 
world during my time in politics and I have come to believe that 
although our people cannot forget Japan's past colonial rule, 
they must pardon it. Prime Minister Hosokawa has called Japan's 
past war an aggressive one and sincerely apologized for it. I 
rate the Japanese prime minister highly for taking such action. 
Successive past Korean Governments have asked the Japanese 
Government to compensate Korean comfort women. I have said we 
do not need such compensation. We do not need compensation at 
all. It is said that although Japan and South Korea are 
geographically close, they are far apart in other respects. I 
think the expression should be changed. The two nations are now 
close neighbors. 
  [Kuniya] I think some Koreans still believe Japan should be 
asked to compensate for its past colonial rule of Korea. 
  [Kim] Forty five million people live in our country and, 
yes, some of them feel that way. A majority of the Korean 
people, though, think my civilian government is different from 
previous governments. I head the civilian government and I was 
elected president fairly by popular vote. I am the president 
they chose. The people, therefore, think my civilian government 
is different from previous governments. There some Koreans who 
feel Japan should be asked to compensate for its past colonial 
rule, but they do not represent a majority of the Korean people. 
I am sure of that. 
  [Kuniya] It has been said that an exchange of culture 
between the two countries would serve to erase an lingering ill 
feeling between the two countries. South Korea has a policy of 
preventing Japanese popular culture from flowing into it. 
Looking at the reality, however, Japanese popular culture such 
as popular songs and comic books have already infiltrated South 
Korean society. Are you considering changing policy and 
allowing Japanese popular culture into South Korea in the near 
future? 
  [Kim] If I decide to allow Japanese popular culture into 
South Korea in a forced way, it would adversely affect 
friendship between South Korea and Japan if things go wrong. 
Therefore, I think it best that Japanese popular culture is 
allowed into South Korea in a natural way over a period of time. 
I believe it is desirable to think of introducing Japanese 
popular culture into South Korea step by step. I think it will 
be good for the mutual, friendly relations of the two nations to 
deal with the matter in a steady manner rather than to be too 
hasty about it. 
  [Kuniya] Do you think this can be realized sometime during 
your term of office? 
  [Kim] Yes, I think so. I think this can be resolved during 
my term of office. The governments and people of the two 
countries need to make efforts toward that. 
  [Kuniya] You decided to tear down the old Japanese 
Governor-General's Office in Korea which is considered a symbol 
of Japanese colonial rule and has for so long been subject of a 
debate as to whether or not it should be torn down. Talking 
about ramifications of what you said just now and the thinking 
that led to your decision on the building, could you dwell on 
the background to making that decision? 
  [Kim] I thought for a long time -- for a long time before I 
was elected president -- that it is not desirable to leave the 
Japanese Governor-General's Office as it is. That is because 
the building represents a symbol of colonial days. Its 
existence reminds the people of the past. Every time they pass 
by it, they see it and are reminded of the past. It is not 
desirable to let the people recall the past forever. I think we 
can free ourselves from the past. Removing the building is 
indeed a way of freeing ourselves -- a way of securing peace of 
mind. I have always thought tearing it down would provide a way 
of enabling us to be freed from the past, and thus will be to 
the benefit of relations and friendship between the two nations. 
  [Kuniya] If there is anything that represents a change in 
Japan-South Korea relations most symbolically, I think, that 
would be a visit to South Korea by the emperor. What do you 
think, Mr. President? Do you think the emperor's visit will be 
realized during your term of office? 
  [Kim] I think the emperor's visit to Korea has much meaning. 
You asked if it would be realized during my term -- I expect 
that his visit to South Korea will be realized during my term of 
office. In order to help this take place, it is very important 
that the people of the two nations create an atmosphere of 
sincerely welcoming the visit. Very important is the 
atmosphere wherein the people of Japan would think the emperor's 
visit to Korea is desirable, and the people of Korea would 
sincerely think it is good to have the visit realized. 
  [Kuniya] You will soon visit Japan. How do you plan to deal 
with the question of the emperor's visit? 
  [Kim] I would like to convey the wish to invite him. I am 
not supposed to say this in advance. 
  [Kuniya] In the past year, you have done so much to remove 
corruption from the business world, military, and government. 
Your campaign is even called revolutionary. What do you think 
is the reason for the campaign's success. What is its secret? 
  [Kim] It cannot be called a secret. It was possible because 
of my firm conviction. Injustice and corruption were 
deep-rooted in South Korea as a result of military rule for some 
decades. There was the need to drive out this injustice and 
corruption, and to correct the people's wrong sense of values. 
In order to do that, I thought it was necessary to change the 
perception of the people and public officials. What I kept on 
emphasizing was the need for political reform. It was my belief 
that elections must be conducted in a clean and fair manner. I 
talked about this every time there was a chance to say it. And 
now, finally, the political reform bills have been enacted. 
This is a great feat that can be called almost a political 
revolution. 
  [Kuniya] You have done so much in a one-year period. On the 
other hand, there is criticism saying that with so much power 
given to one person as president, it is nothing more than 
civilian dictatorship. What is your comment on such a view? 
  [Kim] That is erroneous thinking. What I have done so far 
-- all of it -- is based on law. South Korea's government 
system is a presidential system like that of the United States. 
The president, elected by the people's will, is entrusted with 
performing all the responsibilities. His rights are guaranteed 
by the constitution. The president needs to guide the nation 
under his responsibility. In Korea, freedom of speech is such to 
be called excessive. There are people who talk about civilian 
dictatorship, but they are wrong. I have pointed this out to the 
mass media every time there is an opportunity. It is only 
natural that a president in a nation with a presidential system 
must perform his duties under his responsibility. 
  [Kuniya] So, you think strong leadership is needed in 
South Korea of today -- if it is to change, right? 
  [Kim] Yes, I think so. After all, the destiny of a nation 
is determined by its leader. That is clear if we see the 
history of other nations. That applies to Korea too. 
  [Kuniya] As far as South-North Korea issues are concerned, 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] recently conducted 
a nuclear inspection of North Korea, though the agency was 
unable to conduct complete inspections. What is your view on 
the nuclear threat of North Korea? 
  [Kim] The latest nuclear inspections by the IAEA were 
imperfect, and the IAEA could not check two important nuclear 
sites. This is a very regrettable thing. The issue of 
conducting nuclear inspections in North Korea is very important 
from the international standpoint. The nuclear inspections of 
North Korea are also very important for South Korea and we 
cannot help being jittery. North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development must be cleared up. 
  [Kuniya] You have said that you are willing to hold a summit 
meeting with North Korea, if necessary, to put a stop to the 
nuclear threat. If a summit meeting becomes a possibility, what 
will you say to President Kim Il-song? 
  [Kim] If the summit meeting is held, the nuclear issue will 
be raised for discussion. I intend to discuss with my North 
Korean counterpart how North and South Korea should move toward 
reunification while building a relationship of trust between 
them. As for how the two countries should be reunified, I think 
the method used in Germany -- where one country absorbed the 
other -- is not desirable. I intend to unify North and South 
Korea eventually through a national federation formula while 
acknowledging the recent North Korean system. It may be a 
longer way of achieving the goal, but I think it would better. 
  [Kuniya] Mr. President, you like to climb mountains and you 
have said that some day you want to climb Mt. Paektu, the 
highest mountain in the North. When do you think that will 
become possible? 
  [Kim] It is impossible to predict when the reunification of 
South and North Korea will become a reality. It might come in 
the near future, but it might take a rather long time. My dream 
is to be able to climb Mt. Paektu in the not too distant future 
-- while I am still alive.

  [Text] In the belief that it is now time to basically 
reexamine its policy on the North Korean nuclear problem, the 
government plans to adopt hardline policies, including the 
resumption of the Team Spirit exercise, if North Korea does not 
show a change in its attitude by 21 March. 
  Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for diplomatic 
and security affairs, pointed out today that progress in the 
North Korean nuclear issue up to now has been very 
unsatisfactory and the possibility of this issue being turned 
over to the UN Security Council is highly likely. He noted that 
the government is being forced to basically reexamine its 
previous policies, thus expressing serious concern over this 
situation. 
  However, Senior Secretary Chong Chong-uk said that the 
governments of the ROK and the United States are making 
last-stage efforts in various ways to make North Korea fulfill 
the agreement reached between the United States and North Korea, 
including sincere acceptance of inspection and the exchange of 
North-South special envoys. He noted that he has not discarded 
the hope for a peaceful solution to the problem. 
  Senior Secretary Chong Chong-uk revealed that the government 
will finalize its position after watching the special meeting of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors 
slated for 21 March and a North-South working-level contact 
slated for 19 March. He pointed out that in the event that the 
special Board of Governors meeting concludes that the nuclear 
inspection ended in failure and that no progress is made in the 
issue of exchanging special envoys, resumption of the Team 
Spirit exercise and introduction of Patriot missiles will be 
inevitable.

  [Text] Seoul, March 18 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean nuclear 
issue is almost certain to be referred to the U.N. Security 
Council at the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] 
special board meeting on March 21, a high-level government 
official said Friday. "If the international community decides to 
impose sanctions (on North Korea), our government cannot block 
it, will not try to block it, and is not in a position to block 
it," the official said. 
  Inspections conducted by the IAEA were 80 to 90 percent 
complete and satisfactory on the whole, he said. There was no 
sign that North Korea diverted nuclear fuel or reprocessed the 
spent fuel from its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. "But the core of 
the problem is that North Korea did not stick to the agreement 
with the IAEA made last Feb. 15," said the official. 
  The consensus at agency headquarters in Vienna is that North 
Korea's refusal to allow full checks at its radiochemical 
laboratory was a clear breach of the Feb. 15 agreement, he said. 
  Seoul's policy on the issue is inclined toward sanctions 
while simultaneously trying to engage in dialogue, he noted. 
  IAEA experts have just concluded a two-week inspection but 
came back disappointed, reporting they were denied access to 
certain critical sites. As a result, the IAEA announced it 
could not verify whether North Korea had or had not diverted 
nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. 
  China opposes taking the matter to the Security Council "but 
it will accept the situation as inevitable," the official 
predicted. "China no longer has the justification to oppose. It 
is now in a position to be angry at North Korea." 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam embarks on a trip to 
Japan and China next week. His meetings with Chinese leaders 
are certain to focus on mobilizing Beijing's tacit approval in 
case the matter is put to a vote at the Security Council. 
  The official admitted Seoul's past policy had failed to 
achieve the ultimate objective -- ensuring transparency in North 
Korea's covert nuclear development program. "But everything was 
part of a necessary process. China can no longer oppose, and 
the international community will fully condone our decision that 
all diplomatic efforts have been exhausted," he said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] ROK vernacular newspapers publish on 18 
March articles and editorials reacting to the assessment made by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the inspections 
of the North Korean nuclear facilities. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word 
article by reporter Pak Tu-sik on the ROK Government's moves. 
The article reports government authorities were "quite at a 
loss" with the IAEA report and "the trend is leaning toward the 
inevitability of referring the issue to the UN Security Council." 
  The article notes that the government showed an attitude 
quite different from previous ones quoting Nuclear Ambassador 
Kim Samhun as saying: "Our patience has come to a limit. We 
doubt if North Korea is a dialogue partner." The article 
analyzes that such a shift to a hard-line position was based on 
the judgment that only "dialogue with sanctions" could solve the 
problem. 
  CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article on U.S. 
reaction by correspondent Chong Hae-yong from Washington. 
Describing that "the United States is enraged and embarrassed to 
be cheated again," the article reports that although voices 
demanding stronger measures are increasing, the U.S. Government 
will not completely close down the communication channel with 
North Korea but seek a resolution through dialogue while 
pressing it with UN sanctions. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 2 a 500-word 
article on the background and prospects of the IAEA Board of 
Governors' special meeting by correspondent Kim Uk-hui from 
Bonn. While expecting a strong IAEA resolution against North 
Korea, the article speculates that the IAEA will not immediately 
announce that the continuity of safeguards has been broken and 
impose sanctions. The article expects that "the resolution will 
focus on demanding additional inspections." 
  TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article by 
reporter Kim Cha-su analyzing ROK Government's view on the 
nuclear issue. The article says the government is preparing to 
resume the Team Spirit exercise and expedite the deployment of 
Patriot missiles. The article also reports that a government 
official explained that "dialogue is meaningless under the 
situation in which the international community is heading for 
ultra-hard measures." 
  The article also speculates that North Korea might not come 
to the 19 March North-South working-level contact for the 
special envoy exchange due to the ROK Government's drastic 
change of attitude. 
  TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article on 
Washington's view on the IAEA inspection results by 
correspondent Nam Chan-sun from Washington. The article reports 
there are various analyses as to why North Korea had not open 
the radiochemical laboratory. One of them is that North Korea 
intended to use the last inspection during the special envoy 
exchange negotiation or the third-round of talks with the United 
States to do so. Another is that North Korea really has 
something to hide. The article says "if the latter is the case, 
the nuclear negotiation will completely fall into a deadlock 
which can only be resolved by a dramatic change of North Korea's 
attitude." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "Is There Any Way To Secure North 
Korea's Cooperation?" The editorial says it is time that the 
ROK Government develop more effective measures to deal with the 
North Korean nuclear issue. Stressing that "the most imperative 
goal of North Korea at the moment is to maintain its 
establishment," the editorial says the ROK Government should 
first decide whether it wants to support or interfere with North 
Korea's efforts to maintain its establishment in order to 
develop a strong initiative for the negotiation. 
  SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 an 1,200-word article by 
correspondent Yi Kyong-hyong from Washington on the U.S. view. 
Along with an ultimatum for the complete acceptance of nuclear 
inspections, the article expects that "the United States will 
exercise various types of pressures including the deployment of 
Patriot missiles and the mobilization of the aircraft carrier 
currently conducting sea exercises in the north Pacific." The 
article states that "the U.S. pressure will still be based on 
its policy to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue." 
  The article also expects that UN sanctions will not 
immediately begin with ultra-hard ones but be taken in a phased 
manner. 
  SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article by 
reporter Yi Sung-chol on ROK Government's view. The article 
contends that the government believes that the direction for the 
resolution of the nuclear issue should be changed now but would 
still like to wait to see how serious the IAEA was when it said 
the inspections were "insufficient" and continue with dialogue 
effort. 
  SEOUL SINMUN also publishes on page 5 an 800-word article by 
reporter Yu Se-chin on the IAEA view. Noting that the 
inspection result, which is usually announced two weeks later, 
was announced only one day after the inspection team returned, 
the article reports that "this implies the suspicion over 
military use of nuclear material is very serious." The article 
also speculates that the IAEA "was prepared" for the negative 
result. 
  The article says the only choice left for the IAEA is to 
refer the issue to the UN Security Council after giving North 
Korea one last chance to unconditionally accept thorough 
inspections. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "Wake Up From Fantasy of North 
Korea." The editorial says "the broken seals no doubt mean that 
North Korea used nuclear material for other purposes" and urges 
both ROK and U.S. Governments to stop mollifying North Korea 
because "Pyongyang will never come back to shake hands." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article 
by 
reporter Yi Sung-chol reporting that "the moderate Foreign 
Ministry wants the resumption of Team Spirit exercise to be 
announced after a final conclusion is reached that the North 
Korean nuclear issue can no longer be resolved through dialogue 
while the hard-line National Defense Ministry wants the decision 
made based on the result of IAEA special 21 March Board of 
Governors meeting." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article 
by 
correspondent Yi Chong-yon from Washington reporting that 
hard-line voice is again rising in the United States. The 
article reports that "diplomatic sources in Washington expect a 
dramatic change of attitude from North Korea around Kim 
Il-song's birthday, which falls on 15 April." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 700-word article on 
the prospects of the 21 March IAEA Board of Governors special 
meeting by correspondent Son Tong-u from Bonn. Noting that the 
two undeclared facilities had not been included in the check 
list of the recent inspection, the article says that it is clear 
that the IAEA is conducting the inspection in accordance with 
"political negotiations" and therefore "the IAEA is not expected 
to take a decisive countermeasure during the 21 March meeting."

<F P=106> [By reporter An Song-kyu] </F>
  [Text] It has been revealed that early in 1992, the final 
year of Former President No Tae-u's Sixth Republic, the North 
and the South made active moves to hold inter-Korean summit 
talks, dispatching their emissaries--the South's director of the 
Agency for National Security Planning and the North's Workers 
Party of Korea [WPK] secretary--to Pyongyang and Seoul 
respectively and exchanging presidential messages between them. 
  North Korean President Kim Il-song proposed summit talks to 
former President No Tae-u in April 1992 through Yun Ki-pok, WPK 
secretary in charge of southward operations, who visited Seoul 
secretly. Former President No dispatched Yi Sang-yon, then 
director of the Agency for National Security Planning, to 
Pyongyang as his emissary around 15 April that year, and the 
emissary delivered his message congratulating President Kim 
Il-song on his birthday and expressing his willingness to hold 
summit talks. 
  This was confirmed as Pak Yong-su, the North's senior 
delegate to the inter-Korean working delegates' contact, 
mentioned it at the sixth round of contact and confirmed by 
those who had been involved in the preparation for summit talks 
at that time. 
  The former highest-level person in authority who was 
actively 
involved in the inter-Korean issues at that time said: I know 
that presidential emissaries made trips several times to each 
other's capital, apart from the then-ongoing North-South 
high-level talks, in an attempt to hold summit talks. 
  Another former high-ranking person in authority who had been 
involved in the inter-Korean dialogue at that time also 
confirmed this and said: I understand that emissaries who made 
trips between the North and the South were the director of the 
Agency for National Security Planning from the South side and 
Yun Ki-pok, WPK secretary in charge of southward operations, 
from the North side.

  [Text] Daewoo Group and Hyowon Mulsan plan to import 
drinking water from North Korea. According to business circles, 
Daewoo Group has held negotiations with North Korean trade 
companies, such as Taesong Trade Company and Nungna Trade 
Company to import drinking water from North Korea. Hyowon 
Mulsan -- which is a professional trade company that imports 
agricultural products from North Korea -- has negotiated with 
the North Korean Taedonggang Trade Company to import "Sindok 
Water." 
  The National Unification Board said that it would not 
immediately allow ROK enterprises to import drinking water from 
North Korea because the Ministry of Public Health has not yet 
allowed enterprises to sell drinking water in Korean markets. 
It added, however, that it would positively consider importing 
drinking water from North Korea for the people's health only if 
the Ministry of Public Health allows it. 
  Up to now, North Korea has developed approximately 100 
plants 
to produce drinking water. These main plants include Sindok 
Water, Kangso Water, Mt. Paektu Water, Changson Water, and 
Sambang Water.

  [Text] Washington--U.S. CIA Director James Woolsey on 17 
March denounced North Korea as one of the states involved 
directly and indirectly in exporting mass lethal weapons and 
terrorism. 
  Appearing on the NBC television network that day, Director 
Woolsey pointed out North Korea, which recently refused a 
full-scale inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
as being such a state, along with Iran, Iraq, and Libya. 
  He stressed that these two points, including the export of 
terrorism, will possibly impose a serious threat to us, and 
therefore, these points should be dealt with at top priority. 
  Director Woolsey again revealed "the fact that North Korea 
has extracted plutonium capable of manufacturing at least more 
than one nuclear weapon is the view of the majority of U.S. 
intelligence authorities." He said that "there is a possibility 
that North Korea will threaten peace in Northeast Asia and that 
North Korea is a state which proliferates weapons, thus posing a 
serious problem."

  [Text] Seoul, March 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has high 
hopes for 1994 exports to its biggest market, the United States, 
since the major economic power expects economic growth of 3 
percent this year, the highest since 1988, the Korea Foreign 
Trade Association (KFTA) said Friday. 
  U.S. imports are expected to increase up to 10 percent this 
year because the economic recovery is fueled chiefly by rising 
consumption and investment rather than growth in exports, KFTA 
officials said. Korea's exports to the United States, which have 
recorded losses or less than 1 percent growth since 1989, are 
expected to rise as much as 5 percent to total 19 billion U.S. 
dollars, the officials said. 
  Sunny skies are forecast for exports of electronics, 
machinery and motor vehicles, but the prospects for textiles 
remain cloudy due to weakening competitiveness, they said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Thursday that he will travel to Russia in the near future 
after visiting Japan and China this month. "Visits to these 
countries are not only for security reasons but also to 
strengthen economic cooperation to beat off the competition," 
Kim told top-grade graduates of 126 universities and their 
parents whom he invited over for lunch. Government officials say 
it is yet to be decided when Kim will visit Russia, but a likely 
date is around June. A European tour timed with his visit to 
Russia is also being considered, they say.

  [Text] Pilots of Korean Air [KAL] are undergoing flight 
training at Tianjin Airport in China, paving the road for new 
cooperation in the fields of civil aviation between the two 
countries. 
  The national flag carrier signed a contract for use of the 
airport with Tianjin Airport authorities last November for the 
training of its pilots with the permission of related government 
offices such as the Foreign and Transportation Ministries. 
  The Chinese airport was chosen as the site for KAL's pilot 
training, which it could not secure at home due to noise 
pollution from the flight exercises. 
  KAL plans to renew the one-year contract every year. 
  The training began from Jan. 14, and a total of 28 pilots 
and 
co-pilots have had takeoff and landing exercises, so far, 
Transportation Ministry officials said yesterday. 
  Three different aircraft -- Boeing 747, Boeing 747-400 and 
Airbus 300-300 -- have been employed for the training of cockpit 
crew. 
  The training is given every day. The aircraft leave Kimpo 
International Airport in the morning and arrive in Tianjin via 
the south of Cheju-to Island, and return home in the afternoon, 
according to the officials. 
  Maintenance crew accompany the pilots in preparation for 
possible troubles of the aircraft and Air China helps KAL in 
maintaining the aircraft in Tianjin, they added.

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- Zarubino port 
authorities in Maritime Province, Russia, have contacted major 
Korean companies about a port-development project worth 500 to 
600 million U.S. dollars, industry sources said Thursday. 
  The head of Khasan district, Anatoly Melnichenko, and the 
director-general of Khasansky Sea commercial port visited the 
Maritime and Port Administration (MAPA) Thursday to discuss 
opening a sea route between Sokcho, a northeastern port here, 
and Zarubino. 
  The Russians said they wanted to improve the port facilities 
independently from the central government in Moscow and are 
therefore negotiating with neighboring countries such as South 
Korea and Japan to attract foreign investment. 
  They proposed creating joint-venture companies to major 
business groups here such as Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo and Hanbo 
and received a positive response, the Russians said. 
  Zarubino was developed as a fishing port and administered by 
the central government before the Soviet Union collapsed in 
1991, but administrative power has since been handed over to the 
private sector. 
  Zarubino is located 70 km from the Chinese city of Hunchun, 
which was selected as a key area under the Tumen River 
development plan sponsored by the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP) in 1991. 
  If its facilities are modernized, Zarubino Port will thus be 
in a good position to link North Korea, China and Russia in a 
day's time, the Russians said. 
  Zarubino port can currently handle four 20,000-ton-class 
ships at a time, but it plans to build a 1.9-km quay for six 
ships. 
  The port also aims to construct loading facilities and to 
improve rail links with the Trans-Siberian railroad.

  [Text] Inchon, South Korea, March 17 (YONHAP) -- The 
Swedish mine-laying ship "Carlskrona" put in at Inchon port on 
Thursday, with 154 Swedish Naval Academy students and crew 
aboard. 
  The 3,300-ton mine layer, which boasts the latest weapons, 
shooting control equipment and advanced navigation system, left 
Sweden on Jan. 4 for a round-the-world trip and has visited 
Morocco, Hawaii and Japan, crossing the Atlantic and Pacific 
Oceans. 
  Carlskrona, the first Swedish Navy vessel to stop in South 
Korea, is expected to help promote bilateral relations. 
  The students and navy men plan to visit the truce village of 
Panmunjom, folk village in Yong-in and other major historical 
sites before sailing for Hong Kong. 
  The ship will also visit Bangkok, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, 
Turkey and Spain before returning to Sweden in May.

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- The 250-man South Korean 
peacekeeping mission to Somalia returns home Friday morning 
after carrying out eight months of road construction and repair 
work in the strife-torn African nation. 
  The "Evergreen" Army engineering unit will be welcomed at an 
official ceremony in the afternoon by Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae and 2,000 other officers and family members. 
  The unit marked South Korea's first participation in U.N. 
peacekeeping operations. It arrived in Somalia last July and 
was to stay one full year but decided to follow Western nations 
including Italy, which was in charge of security in the area 
where the Korean unit was stationed, and pull out early. 
  The South Korean soldiers were to leave Somalia on April 1 
but pushed up the date because of an outbreak of endemic 
diseases such as cholera, officials here said. 
  Some 500,000 U.S. dollars' worth of equipment including 
jeeps 
and electric generators was donated to the U.N. mission 
headquarters as the South Korean unit departed from the Somali 
capital of Mogadishu on Wednesday. 
  Other equipment left Mogadishu on Monday aboard a 5,500-ton 
German vessel and will arrive in the southern port city of Pusan 
around April 10. 
  The United Nations will pay the entire 800-million-won cost 
of transporting the unit and equipment.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ku Tu-hun from Yonggwang] </F>
  [Text] About 300 people, including members of the farmers' 
society of Yonggwang County, South Cholla Province, members of 
the National Catholic Priests' Environment Protection Committee, 
and members of Wonbul Buddhist Association, staged a 
demonstration for about 30 minutes on 15 March in front of 
Yonggwang Atomic Power Station in Kyemari, Hungnong-up, 
Yonggwang County. They opposed the loading of nuclear fuel in 
and operation of the No. 3 atomic power reactor in Yonggwang. 
  In the demonstration staged under the leadership of the 
Council for Expulsion of the Yonggwang Nuclear Power Station 
(Chairman: Father Pak Chae-wan), they held that "there are 
safety problems in the operation of the No. 3 reactor--a 
Korean-type model without any operational experience"--and 
demanded the suspension of "the operation of the No. 3 reactor, 
which places the lives of Yonggwang County residents under 
liability." They also demanded that details of the accident 
that occurred at the nuclear power station and truth of injuries 
of workers on the spot be disclosed. 
  Prior to this, on the afternoon of 14 March, they held an 
antinuclear seminar in the Wonbul Buddhist temple in Yongsan, 
Paeksu-up, Yonggwang County, and resolved to rise in a 
pan-national antinuclear movement. At about 1030 [0100 GMT] 
that morning, they held an event to "declare a pan-national 
antinuclear movement to check the loading of nuclear fuel at the 
No.3 reactor of the atomic power station" at the Wonbul Buddhist 
temple in Yonggwang. Following the event, they staged a street 
demonstration. 
<H5>  No. 3 Yonggwang Reactor </H5>
  The No. 3 reactor at the Yonggwang nuclear power station is 
the first in domestic production, responsible for 95 percent of 
the domestic manufacturing rate. Construction of this reactor, 
which has 1 million kilowatt power generation capacity, began in 
July 1989, and it is now undergoing a trial operation with the 
goal of beginning operation in March 1995. Unlike other 
reactors, the No. 3 Yonggwang reactor is being built by domestic 
enterprises. The main design was by Korea Electric 
Technological Corporation; manufacturing was by Korea Heavy 
Industry Complex; engineering by Hyundai Construction Company, 
and the reactor type was designed by the Korea Atomic Energy 
Research Institute. CE Company [as published] of the United 
States and other firms are participating as subcontractors. 
  Ordinary-temperature water-pressure tests for the No. 3 
Yonggwang reactor were completed in December last year, and a 
high-temperature function test is to be conducted soon. After 
completing this test, nuclear fuel will actually be loaded in 
this reactor in August, and a final test will be conducted after 
this. 
  Although the No. 3 Yonggwang reactor is called a domestic 
product, the regulations of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA], and provisions applied to other atomic power 
stations at home have been applied to this reactor, and a safety 
evaluation work has also been carried out by a team of IAEA 
experts.

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- Electronics exports 
surged more than 50 percent in the first two months of this year 
over 1993 due to better quality and a strong Japanese yen, 
industry sources said Thursday.

dollars last year. 
  Exports of electronic equipment, including semiconductors, 
surged 58 percent to 630 million dollars from 400 million 
dollars. 
  Goldstar Co. saw exports rise 32 percent to 500 million 
dollars in the two months. 
  Exports to Asia soared 67 percent to 150 million dollars 
while new target areas -- the Middle East and Africa -- 
accounted for a 60-percent rise. 
  Daewoo Electronics Co. enjoyed a leap of 57 percent in 
January-February exports to 340 million dollars. Shipments of 
washing machines and refrigerators skyrocketed 103 percent and 
78 percent, respectively. 
  Growth in exports to the Commonwealth of Independent States 
and Latin America was most evident, Daewoo officials said. 
  Should the trend continue, Korean electronics exports may 
reach 30 billion dollars, up 3.5 billion dollars from the 
initial target of 26.5 billion dollars.

  [Text] HANOI, March 17 (AFP) -- Vietnam denied Wednesday 
reports by human rights groups that the leader of a dissident 
Buddhist church was under house arrest and in need of medical 
care, saying he was in good health and living normally at his 
pagoda in central Vietnam. 
  Western human rights groups and Buddhists have said that 
Thich Huyen Quang, the 77-year-old patriarch of the Unified 
Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), has been held under house 
arrest since February 1982 and has been cut off from all 
communications with the outside world. 
  But foreign ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan said: "He is now 
practising his religious services at the Hoi Phuoc Pagoda in 
Quang An" in central Vietnam. 
  The International Federation of Human Rights recently 
appealed to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to 
intervene with Hanoi as Quang was said to be in need of urgent 
medical care. 
  But Lan denied this, saying: "His physical health is 
normal." 
  Quang became head of the Church in 1992 after the death of 
Patriarch Thich Don Hau, but his succession has become the focus 
of a violent row with the government, who have refused to 
recognise Hau's right to choose his successor. 
  Fearful of unrest sparked by Buddhists, who make up 70 
percent of Vietnam's population, the government here has tried 
to bring all religions under the control of the communist 
party's Fatherland Front, a patriotic organisation of social 
groups. 
  Lan also brushed off reports of the "arbitrary detention" of 
another member of the UBCV, Vo Han Duc, a 48-year-old abbot 
sentenced to three years in jail in January. 
  "This man was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for 
his crimes against on-duty officials," Lan said, adding that the 
sentence had been handed down through normal legal processes 
following Duc's arrest in July last year. 
  A court in the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau 
imprisoned Duc for disturbing public order on charges of 
"conducting activities against the law" and "handing out 
documents hostile to the socialist government of Vietnam."

<F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh by station </F>
correspondent Thanh Hai on her visits to Algeria, Mali, Guinea, 
and Guinea Bissau, and her meeting with French President 
Francois Mitterrand; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Summary] Requested by Thanh Hai to outline the general 
purpose of the trip, its overall results as well as particular 
achievements in each of the country she visited, Nguyen Thi Binh 
said that "while we are carrying out the multi-faceted and 
multilateral policy, we should not forget our old friends. The 
primary goal of my trip was to consolidate and promote 
traditional and friendly relations with countries who are our 
long-time friends. The countries I visited are also in the 
process of developing their economies where cooperation and 
solidarity with other countries are essential, so the second 
goal of my trip was to study the possibility of cooperation 
between Vietnam and these countries in economic, trade, 
cultural, and social fields, and to exchange experiences in 
national construction." 
  Nguyen Thi Binh also revealed that she and her delegation 
have made "a number of agreements on economic, trade, cultural, 
science, and technology cooperation. The leaders of the 
countries I visited wanted us to help them in agricultural 
development." 
  She added that the leaders and people of these countries 
understood well the political and economic developments in 
Vietnam. They highly regarded achievements of the Vietnamese 
Government and people in renovating the economy and improving 
ties with the world community. As a representative of Vietnam, 
she was warmly and solemnly welcomed at all the countries she 
visited. The Algerian and Malian governments also conferred 
noble orders on her. 
  Asked to assess the prospects of cooperation between Vietnam 
and these countries in particular and Africa in general, Nguyen 
Thi Binh said presently both Vietnam and the African "friends" 
have limited capital, thus making economic cooperation 
difficult. However, Africa is a "potentially large market for 
Vietnamese agricultural produce and consumer goods" thus 
"promising mutually beneficial cooperation in the future." 
  Asked about her impression on meetings with the French 
President Francois Mitterrand and the ministers of foreign 
affairs and cultural and francophone affairs, Nguyen Thi Binh 
said that although these were only courtesy calls, she had a 
chance to exchange views with French leaders on issues of common 
concern. She said: "The most profound impression I got from 
these meetings was that the ties between Vietnam and the world 
community in general, and France in particular, are constantly 
improving. The French leaders as well as businessmen wish to 
promote cooperation with Vietnam in all fields, which we 
heartily welcome."

<F P=106> [Speech by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai at a Hanoi </F>
Investment Seminar on 17 March -- recorded, in Thai fading into 
Vietnamese translation] 
  [Text] Dear friends: As has already been reported, the 
prime minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, Chuan Likphai, now on 
an official friendship visit to Vietnam, attended and delivered 
a congratulatory speech at the opening session of the seminar on 
environment and investment opportunities in Vietnam held in 
Hanoi this morning by Vietnam's State Commitee for Cooperation 
and Investment. He said: 
  [Chuan] It is my great pleasure and joy to have the honor of 
attending the seminar opening today, held in an atmostphere of 
cooperation between Vietnamese and Thai businessmen, who have a 
very important mandate to promote bilateral cooperation and 
investment. 
  Thailand and Vietnam are two close neighbors with historical 
ties of friendship. Now that the situation has changed and has 
become much better than in the past, the two countries must 
bring about improvements to achieve closer ties, especially on 
the issue of investment and trade cooperation on the basis of 
mutual benefit. 
  I would like to compliment Vietnam for the economic growth 
it 
has achieved since the introduction of its renovation policy in 
1987. Its economy has achieved tangible development. I believe 
that with their abundant natural resources and their 
determination, the Vietnamese people can achieve rapid national 
growth through economic development. The Thai Government is 
ready to cooperate with Vietnam in achieving that goal. The 
establishment of the Thailand-Vietnam Cooperation Committee 
provides a fine basis for the development of cooperative 
bilateral relations. This cooperation committee has met twice 
and its latest meeting was in November 1993. This reflects the 
goal of both countries to develop increasingly durable and 
closer ties. In the area Thai-Vietnamese trade relations in 
particular, the Thai Government has totally supported and 
encouraged the development of free bilateral trade. The volume 
of bilateral trade has increased from 2.876 billion baht in 1990 
to 4.916 billion baht in 1993. In addition, the two countries 
have reached a consensus that they will set up a trade 
subcommittee under the cooperation committee to promote 
bilateral trade. The Thai Government has agreed to provide 
long-term credit for Vietnam, to begin from December last year. 
All this shows that trade cooperation has become ever closer 
and has enjoyed opportunities for development, particularly in 
terms of investment. 
  Thai investors are showing increasing interest in Vietnam. 
From 1987 to 1991, Thai investors had 27 investment projects 
with a total capital of over $6 million licensed. This ranks 
them 12th in the list of countries with investments in Vietnam, 
and shows Thailand's growing interest in Vietnam. 
  As far as I see it, my exchange of views with His Excellency 
Vo Van Kiet yesterday has helped to create confidence for 
increased bilateral trade ties. The Thai Government has tasked 
its investment committee with the duty of creating favorable 
conditions for Thai businessmen wishing to invest in Vietnam. 
In 1992, the Thai Investment Committee and the Vietnamese 
Committee for Cooperation and Investment signed an agreement on 
investment cooperation. The Vietnamese Committee for 
Cooperation and Investment has cooperated with Thai Government 
agencies in various areas in the past. It has on several 
occasions welcomed many Thai delegations seeking investment 
opportunities and disseminated information on investment. I 
would like to emphasize here that it is the goal of the Thai 
Government to encourage Thai investors to invest in Vietnam on a 
mutually beneficial basis in line with the socioeconomic policy 
of each country. 
  On this occasion, allow me to thank his excellency the 
minister of state in charge of Vietnam's State Committee for 
Cooperation and Investment for having created opportunities for 
Thai investors to invest and do business in Vietnam. I also 
hope to have Your Excellency's support and attention for the 
period ahead to create confidence in Thai investors wishing to 
invest in Vietnam. I hope this seminar will help promote the 
rapid growth of bilateral cooperation and investment. 
  During my exchange of views with His Excellency Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet, we also stressed the need for the two 
sides to create conditions for the development of bilateral 
cooperation and investment. I also briefed his excellency the 
prime minister on the difficulties Thai investors now face, and 
expressed the hope that the Vietnamese side would create 
conditions for the quicker development of bilateral cooperation. 
  During my meeting with General Secretary Do Muoi, I also 
exchanged views with him. The general secretary said he would 
pay attention to creating the conditions for and help resolve 
the problems that have been held up. 
  It is hoped that investment and trade cooperation between 
Vietnam and Thailand will develop further.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai granted an interview to 
both Thai and foreign mass media representatives at the 
Vietnamese Presidential Palace in Hanoi before leaving for Hue 
yesterday. 
  The Thai prime minister said he was pleased that his visit 
to 
Vietnam was successful and believed that Thai-Vietnamese 
relations will consistently develop in all aspects. At the same 
time, the Thai Government is ready to encourage Thai businessmen 
to invest in Vietnam. 
  Asked about Vietnam wishing to become a member of ASEAN, the 
Thai prime minister said that Vietnam has continuously tried to 
solve various internal problems and he was confident that 
whenever Vietnam is ready, it will not be difficult for Vietnam 
to become an ASEAN member. Asked when Vietnam will be ready, 
the prime minister said the time factor was not discussed in the 
talks but he was confident that there will be no problem 
whenever Vietnam is fully ready. 
  The Public Relations Department correspondent additionally 
reported that Prime Minister Chuan and his delegation arrived in 
Hue yesterday. The prime minister informed Thai businessmen in 
the entourage of the results of talks with Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. He said both Thai and Vietnamese sides 
acknowledged mutual problems, such as the fishing issue and the 
development of the Mekong River basin. Both countries agreed to 
speed up the resolution of such problems. Regarding investment 
in Vietnam, about which Thai businessmen complained that there 
still are many inconveniences, the Vietnamese prime minister is 
willing to rectify the situation. 
  Prime Minister Chuan said that the Vietnamese prime minister 
and he agreed that Cambodia should be left to establish peace in 
the country independently and without interference from other 
countries. 
  Regarding Vietnamese refugees in Thailand, the Vietnamese 
prime minister urged those who have been given Thai citizenship 
to respect Thai laws, culture, and traditions. For the other 
Vietnamese in Thailand, who have not yet received Thai 
citizenship and are waiting for repatriation or settlement in a 
third country, the Thai prime minister told his Vietnamese 
counterpart that the Thai Government will award citizenship to 
the children of those refugees wishing to become Thai citizens. 
  Prime Minister Chuan's trip was morale-boosting for Thai 
businessmen, who he regarded as smart and sharp-witted with a 
capability to discover investment possibilities in Vietnam. The 
Thai Government will give them full support by improving 
political relations with Vietnam. The Thai prime minister urges 
Thai investors to think of the mutual benefit for both countries 
and to avoid seeking quick or one-sided benefits. 
  Today is the third day of the visit to Vietnam by Prime 
Minister Chuan and his delegation. The prime minister is 
scheduled today to visit the Mausoleums of King Minh Mang and 
King Khai Dinh and observe living conditions of the people in 
Hue in the morning. At 1630, Prime Minister Chuan will meet Thai 
businessmen in Ho Chi Minh City at the Thai consulate general. 
In the evening at 1900, the chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City 
People's Committee will host a dinner reception in honor of the 
Thai prime minister and the delegation.

  [Text] Hanoi -- After being put off from Wednesday due to 
coordination problems Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday 
witnessed the signing of four Thai joint-venture projects in 
Vietnam with a combined investment of Bt [baht] 12 billion. The 
four projects include Vina Siam Bank, a joint venture between 
Siam Commercial Bank (33 per cent), Charoen Phokhaphan Group (33 
per cent) and Bank for Agriculture of Vietnam (24 per cent). 
The investment in the new venture is US$15 million. 
  The second project is an industrial estate between Bang 
Pakong Industrial Park and Sonadezi Bien Hoa of Vietnam. The 
project is worth around Bt10 billion. 
  Third is a mining project between Usrint Industrial Groups 
and the provincial authority of Vinh Fu with an investment of 
Bt400 million. 
  And last is a joint project by Advance Paint &amp; Chemical 
(Thailand), Ngan Ha Economic &amp; Engineering Consultants and 
Dong 
Tam Co with an investment of US$2 million. 
  Chuan said that the agreements well reflected Thai 
investors' 
interest in entering the emerging economy. Speaking at a 
meeting on investment opportunities held by the Board of 
Investment (BoI) in Vietnam, Chuan said that the government has 
assigned the BoI to support Thai investors who wish to explore 
business opportunities in Vietnam. 
  Sunthon Arunanonchai, president of CP Land Co Ltd, said that 
the banking venture is a follow-up to CP's finance business 
overseas after CP succeeded in setting up a finance company in 
Shanghai. 
  The new banking venture should come into operation four or 
five months after receiving a banking licence. The headquarters 
of the bank should be located in Hanoi, Sunthon added. 
  Vietnam's Bank of Agriculture is the biggest 
state-enterprise 
bank in Vietnam with about 300 branches nationwide. It is the 
fourth local bank which has a joint venture with foreign banks. 
  Wikrom Khuwatcharacharoen, chief of Bang Pakong Industrial 
Park, said that the new industrial estate project will have a 30 
per cent stake on the Vietnamese side, while the remaining 70 
per cent will be shared among Bang Pakong Industrial Park, 
Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand, Exim Bank, CP Group, 
Bangkok Bank and some other Thai and foreign firms. 
  The site, covering 5,000 rai, is 32 km from Ho Chi Minh 
City. 
The area will be developed into a comprehensive industrial 
estate and can handle more than 100 plants. 
  After finalizing the size of the registered capital, the 
companies will start constructing the industrial estate a few 
months later.

<F P=106> [By Suphaphon Kanwirayothin in Hanoi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Thailand and Vietnam have agreed to set up a 
"hot-line" telephone link after taking a major step forward in 
settling the key bilateral issue of fishing rights. 
  Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said Vietnamese Premier Vo 
Van Kiet had agreed to the hot-line proposal after he presented 
it as a way of dispelling any doubts that might arise in future. 
"This (hot-line) is so we can make use of advanced technology 
to enhance mutual understanding. This is a good sign," said Mr 
Chuan shortly before leaving for the former imperial capital of 
Hue on the second stop of his four-day official visit. 
  "If Vietnam has doubts on any issue, the two foreign 
ministers can make direct telephone calls to each other," he 
said. 
  The hot-line plan emerged after the two countries agreed to 
set up a joint ministerial-level fisheries committee. 
  Mr Chuan, who met Vietnam's senior leader, Communist Party 
Secretary-General Do Muoi, during his stay in Hanoi, also 
confirmed Thailand's support for Vietnam's bid to become a 
member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations "at the 
right time". [passage omitted] 
  Mr Chuan emphasised that Thailand and Vietnam must translate 
words of agreement into deeds so that the two neighbours can 
press ahead with mutually beneficial cooperation to advance 
their common objective of economic development. 
  Regarding Vietnam's bid to become a full ASEAN member, Mr 
Chuan said the most important issue was the readiness of all 
parties ASEAN as well as Vietnam. 
  Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said his country 
was making "active preparations" to qualify for membership and 
the statements from ASEAN leaders so far had been encouraging. 
"Although I cannot specify the timetable, the process may happen 
sooner than what everyone previously expected," he said, adding 
the matter required further consultations and exchange of views 
among ASEAN countries and Vietnam. 
  Mr Chuan inaugurated an investment seminar attracting Thai 
and Vietnamese businessmen in Hanoi yesterday. During his 
speech, he pledged the Thai Government's backing for Thai 
investment and commercial activities in Vietnam. 
  He will arrive in Ho Chi Minh City from Hue today where he 
is 
scheduled to call on Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh and meet 
with the Thai business committee in the southern economic hub.

  [Text] Vietnamese and Thai deputy finance ministers held 
consultations in Hanoi yesterday. The Thai side proposed that 
Thailand and Vietnam take the lead to organize a meeting of six 
countries situated in the Mekong River basin in order to develop 
together the Mekong River basin. About 26 projects have been 
proposed by the Asian Development Bank for the development of 
the Mekong River basin. 
  Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri granted an 
interview to reporters in Hue, Vietnam, yesterday afternoon. 
  [Begin recording] [Trairong] Among these six countries, 
Thailand and Vietnam are the strongest countries since China 
will involve only one province. Thailand and Vietnam are 
stronger than the others. The six countries are China's Yunnan 
Province, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand. 
Therefore, what is agreed by Thailand and Vietnam, I think it 
would be concurred by the other countries. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Regarding the project to take water 
from the Mekong River for use in our country, will there be any 
objection from other countries? 
  [Trairong] This matter has already been discussed by the 
Thai prime minister. Therefore, there is no need for me to talk 
about it. The project to divert water from the Mekhong River 
for consumption is a high-level issue. Thai and Vietnamese 
prime ministers have discussed this issue. I, therefore, do not 
have to talk about it. We only discussed 26 projects including 
issues of the Mekong River, electricity, roads, railways, 
airports, tourism, environment, assistance in the field of 
education, and so on. [end recording]

  [Text] Hanoi -- Further progress was made yesterday in 
settling the fisheries problem between Thailand and Vietnam when 
the two countries agreed to set up a joint ad hoc committee at 
deputy foreign minister level and to restore order on 
overlapping sea-lanes. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, after discussions with his 
counterpart, Nguyen Manh Cam, said both sides agreed that the 
joint body should comprise members of government agencies 
responsible for fisheries, the management of national resources 
and restoring order in sea lanes. 
  Prasong said they had also agreed to accelerate negotiations 
to delineate territorial waters. 
  Both Vietnam and Thailand have declared a 200-mile exclusive 
economic zone. The subcommittee on territorial waters has met 
twice but has yet to agree on the criteria by which to define 
sea boundaries. 
  It is believed mineral resources and fossil fuels lie mostly 
in Thai waters while fishing resources are abundant in 
Vietnamese waters. 
  Prasong said each side agreed to form its own committee as 
soon as possible and will inform each other about progress 
through their respective embassies. Thailand earlier wanted the 
joint body to be at ministerial or higher level in order to 
hasten a conclusion to the issues. 
  The Thai side will call a meeting of agencies concerned, 
especially the Fisheries Department, to discuss the composition 
of the Thai side of the committee, he said. 
  Agencies to be included are the Foreign Ministry, National 
Security Council and the Naval Command and representatives of 
the Thai Fisheries Association. Pending settlement of 
overlapping maritime boundaries, Thailand will propose free 
access by fishermen of both countries to fish in the disputed 
areas, according to Fisheries Department Director General 
Plotrasop Suratsawadi. 
  Plotrasop said the Vietnamese authorities have agreed to 
free 
46 Thai fishermen arrested earlier this year. They are among a 
total of about 70 arrested since the beginning of this year.

assessment of Vietnam's role and position in the region, the 
Thai foreign minister said: Vietnam is a large country in the 
region, and therefore the fine relations between Vietnam and the 
ASEAN member countries in general -- and with each 
member-country of ASEAN in particular -- will be a positive 
element in maintaining security for the region and the world 
alike. We highly value the role and position of Vietnam.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 17 -- Vietnam begins this month the 
process of pilot incorporation of enterprises in a bid to 
improve the efficiency of the economy. 
  This process would help gradually eliminate the system of 
governing ministries, governing administrative levels and the 
distinction between centrally and locally controlled enterprises. 
  VIETNAM NEWS today quotes a prime minister decision as 
saying 
that group of enterprises will be established on a trial basis 
in Ho Chi Minh City and some ministries relevant to economic and 
technology management. The creation of group must assure 
restriction of monopolies on one hand, and uncontrolled 
competition on the other. 
  The decision emphasized that the chosen enterprises should 
include corporations or big companies which have played 
important roles in the national economy. 
  These groups are legal economic entities established by the 
state and each of them consists of at least seven member 
enterprises having a minimum legal capital of 1,000 billion dong. 
  The group' management board will be comprised of 
seventy-nine 
members appointed by the prime minister. 
  The State Planning Commission is expected to submit 
incorporation proposals to the prime minister for approval by 
June.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In the page one article of SAIGON GIAI PHONG 
entitled The Struggle Against Corruption Must Be More 
Resolute and Well-Coordinated, author Huynh Thanh Lam 
revealed that after 230 inspections and 282 investigations 
carried out in the anticorruption campaigns in Ho Chi Minh City, 
losses due to corruption have been pegged at 150.39 billion dong 
and $757,730; 824 ounces of gold; and 353,000 square meters of 
land. 
  The Anticorruption Steering Committee of the city, however, 
affirms that the number of corruption cases which have been 
uncovered is still far below its actual number. The noteworthy 
points drawn from the uncovered cases so far are that corruption 
activities nowadays do not exclude any particular areas, and 
that bad elements in various levels cooperate and protect each 
other. Many new forms of corruption have emerged, transforming 
state-owned property into private ones. 
  The City Anticorruption Steering Committee admits that there 
have been cases where corruption suppression activities were not 
timely, resolute, and just. The recovery of property, which had 
been lost to corruption, is still inadequate. Meanwhile the 
handling of complaints and denunciation is too slow, and the 
rectification and consolidation of the state management 
structure to prevent corruption are unable to match the demands 
of the new situation. 
  Generally, comprehensive measures to effectively detect, 
handle, and prevent corruption in Ho Chi Minh City have yet to 
develop. We cannot solve the problem hastily since the battle 
against corruption is a long and complicated one. But, we need 
more resolute and well-coordinated measures right from the 
beginning. We need to eliminate conditions that nurture 
corruption such as authoritativeness, and we need to constantly 
improve our structure, policies, and legal systems as our 
economy changes to a market-oriented one.

Opposing Peaceful Evolution -- A Pressing, Significant Task of 
the War Veterans Association [WVA]. 
  The article says: We must strive to foil the peaceful 
evolution scheme in order to firmly maintain the political 
situation; defend our national independence and freedom; build 
the fatherland; and triumphantly fulfill the objectives of 
making our people prosperous, our nation powerful, and our 
society civilized. Opposing peaceful evolution has become a 
very pressing task of our people and the war veterans force. 
Indeed, members of the WVA have actively participated in the 
struggle against peaceful evolution and have, together with 
people throughout the country, strived to heighten vigilance 
against the enemy's schemes and tactics. They have promptly 
detected and consistently monitored work of various 
organizations of reactionaries, especially their sabotage 
activities. Moreover, the WVA has also seriously implemented 
the foreign policy of our party and state, carried out tasks in 
accordance with our party lines and orientations, and motivated 
various people's strata to actively participate in the struggle 
against wicked schemes of the hostile forces.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii attended a meeting of his supporters at a U.S. military 
base last month, raising suspicion of violating a Japan-U.S. 
military agreement, political sources said Friday [18 March]. 
  Fujii, a member of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) in the 
governing coalition, was present at a general meeting of his 
supporters held February 20 at the U.S. base at Atsugi in the 
suburbs of Tokyo, the sources said. 
  They said the use of a U.S. military base by ordinary 
Japanese citizens is banned in principle under the Status of 
Forces Agreement between Japan and the United States. 
  Fujii told reporters he understood that the meeting was 
aimed 
at promoting friendship between U.S. forces and local 
residents, and therefore did not constitute a violation of the 
agreement. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said they were not sure if the 
U.S. side regarded the meeting as part of political activities, 
but added that the ministry will ask the U.S. military to be 
careful about offering its facilities for use by Japanese 
citizens. 
  The sources said about 300 members of the supporting group, 
including the mayor of Yamato, where the base is located, and 
members of the city's assembly, attended.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- The United States 
Government on Thursday [17 March] submitted its demand that 70 
Japanese construction and other firms pay more than 1.1 billion 
yen in penalties for rigging bids on construction projects at a 
U.S. naval air station southwest of Tokyo. 
  According to the notices, the firms inflated contract fees 
for the construction projects from 1984 to 1990 through a 
constructors' group at the U.S. naval station at Atsugi, 
Kanagawa Prefecture. 
  If the named firms, which include the Maeda Corp., 
Nishimatsu 
Construction Co. and Tokyu Construction Co., do not reply in 10 
days, the demands will be filed as a suit in court, the notices 
said. 
  The notices allege that the group engaged in illegal trade 
activities that injured the United States. 
  The president of the Japan Federation of Construction 
Contractors (JFCC), Kenji Maeda, remarked "there is no evidence 
of bid-rigging, because no orders were received." 
  "The talks among contracters that were indicated was to 
administer quality," said Maeda, who also heads the Maeda 
construction firm.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister 
hinted Friday [18 March] that Tokyo may cancel self-imposed 
restrictions on automobile exports to the United States, 13 
years after their introduction. 
  "The government has not yet decided, but the U.S. apparently 
does not appreciate the voluntary restrictions," Hiroshi 
Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, said at a 
regular news conference. 
  Japan has maintained a voluntary ceiling for its annual car 
exports to the U.S. since 1981, and is due to decide on a new 
limit at the end of the month. 
  Kumagai said that U.S.-bound exports of cars manufactured in 
Japan have remained below the ceiling recently, mainly due to 
increased output at so-called transplant factories, or Japanese 
plants located in the U.S. 
  The minister also cited the higher yen against the dollar as 
a reason why exports have slumped. 
  Japan's voluntary restrictions on automobile exports are 
included among the trading practices criticized for lacking 
transparency at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of global 
trade talks last December. 
  Under the accord, trading nations agreed to end such 
practices within four years after the agreement is put into 
effect.

<F P=106> [From "National and World News" program] </F>
  [Text] In a news conference following the cabinet meeting 
today, Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and 
industry [MITI], said the government is considering revising 
controls on exports of Japanese-made passenger cars, including 
the possibility of scrapping them totally from next year. 
  Kumagai said: As far as we see, the United States basically 
has no appreciation of them at all -- at least where the Clinton 
government is concerned. 
  Minister Kumagai also said that even though he has not 
formally decided whether to continue with the voluntary 
restraint system or not, such controls can bring the charge that 
they show Japan's auto manufacturers are cartelling. Attention 
must be paid to this point, he added. 
  The system of putting voluntary restraints on Japanese-made 
car exports to the United States was instituted in 1981 after 
such exports grew sharply. MITI thinks now that the U.S. auto 
industry is making high profits while Japanese auto exports are 
falling short of export control ceilings, there is little 
likelihood that auto exports to the United States will rise 
sharply. As such, MITI is coming to believe there is not much 
point in continuing export controls. 
  Minister Kumagai's remark today is believed to suggest his 
ministry is thinking about reviewing export controls for next 
year and thereafter, including the possible abolition of the 
controls altogether, once the government finalizes its measures 
on opening up Japan's markets to the United States by the end of 
this month.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- A Japanese life insurance 
leader said Friday [18 March] he cannot understand a fresh U.S. 
move that could target his industry for trade retaliation. 
  Responding to Senate passage of a bill that would allow U.S. 
retaliation against financial services, Toshiomi Uragami, 
chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan, told a news 
conference that he has heard no complaints from foreign life 
insurers about barriers to the Japanese market. 
  Uragami noted the 10 foreign companies in the association 
and 
said he was certain that Japan is running a trade deficit with 
the United States in the insurance sector. 
  The fair trade in financial services, passed Thursday by the 
U.S. upper house and expected to pass the House of 
Representatives to become law, was amended before passage to 
include insurance firms among those subject to retaliation. 
  Insurance is also a candidate for possible sanctions under 
the recently revived Super 301 provision in U.S. Trade Law and 
is one of three priority sectors in bilateral trade framework 
talks. 
  Asked about the effect on U.S. markets if Japanese life 
insurers pull out, Uragami said the impact of Japanese money 
fleeing currency and other risks would be limited because 
Japanese investors have been squeezing their dollar-based assets 
for the past two years. 
  They have also hedged their holdings against exchange and 
other risks, he said. Uragami, who is also president of 
Sumitomo Life Insurance Co., said two years ago that one-fourth 
of his company's assets were in dollars but now the portion is 
down to 9 percent, of which 4 percent is hedged. 
  Japanese institutional investors used to cover fund 
shortages 
in U.S. treasury and other capital markets, but Uragami said 
that influence has faded somewhat. 
  He indicated that he thinks U.S. officials do not consider 
the possibility of fleeing Japanese investment to be a big 
danger for the market.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan will take action 
against a U.S. move to cut the extension period of licenses for 
Japanese airlines serving the United States, escalating a feud 
over Trans-Pacific air service between the two nations, ministry 
officials said Friday [18 March]. 
  The officials said the Transport Ministry will extend 
licenses for five U.S. airlines, due to expire on March 26, 
until June 9, instead of October 31 as requested. 
  The step involves seven routes operated by the U.S. 
carriers, including Chicago-Tokyo flights operated by United 
Airlines, the officials said. 
  The action followed a similar move taken by the Department 
of 
Transportation against three Japanese airlines, extending 
licenses for their Trans-Pacific operations which expired last 
December 13 for only 179 days instead of one year, they said. 
  The U.S. decision applied to six routes, including Japan 
Airlines flights between Tokyo and Chicago, a Tokyo-New York 
route by All Nippon Airways and a cargo service between Tokyo 
and Los Angeles via San Francisco by Nippon Cargo Airlines, the 
officials said. 
  Friday's development will escalate a drawn-out civil 
aviation 
dispute between Japan and the United States over Washington's 
demand for the beyond rights for American commercial carriers. 
  The Japanese officials said Japan will revoke permission for 
the U.S. airlines to extend their service to Japan beyond June 
9 if the United States take similar action against Japanese 
carriers.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The foreign share of 
Japan's semiconductor market surpassed 20 percent in the final 
quarter of 1993 but failed to meet the benchmark in terms of 
yearly average according to an American calculation, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced Friday 
[18 March]. 
  Foreign-made semiconductor chips seized 22.1 percent of the 
Japanese market in the October-December quarter, based on a 
calculation formula favored by Japan, up from 19.7 percent in 
the preceding quarter. 
  The share stood at 20.7 percent on another calculation 
method 
devised by the United States, up from 18.1 percent. 
  As a result, the average foreign chip share in Japan in the 
full year of 1993 came to 21.2 percent under the Japanese 
formula, up from 18.7 percent the previous year, but slipped 
below 20 percent to 19.4 percent under the American calculation 
method, up from 16.6 percent. 
  Japan "substantially" boosted foreign chip buying during the 
reporting quarter, a MITI official told a press conference. 
  The latest results represent "a steady improvement" in 
foreign access to the Japanese chip market, the official said. 
  Under the 1991 bilateral chip accord, Japan expressed 
"expectations" that foreign chip shares in the country would be 
more than 20 percent. 
  In the third quarter of 1993, the share was below the 
threshold by both calculation methods, dropping from 21.6 
percent in the second quarter under the Japanese formula and 
from 19.2 percent under the American method. 
  The new statistics were calculated after Japan-U.S. talks in 
Hawaii that began Wednesday. 
  The 1991 pact incorporates two different methods for 
calculating the foreign market share in Japan. The U.S. relies 
on a system that counts only the sales of foreign chips in the 
open market. But the Japanese formula uses a broader 
measurement that includes so- called "captive" sales of foreign 
companies to their Japanese subsidiaries and those by Japanese 
companies under foreign brand names. 
  In the Japan-U.S. semiconductor trade talks in January this 
year, Washington urged Tokyo to formulate a new action program 
on chip trade that would augment the 1991 pact, stating the U.S. 
is seriously concerned about Japan's commitment on the trade. 
  But Tokyo rejected the demand, saying it sees no problem in 
Japan's foreign chip-buying efforts. 
  "The Japanese perception remains unchanged," the MITI 
official said. 
  The chip accord does not bind Tokyo to achievement of the 
stated trade figure, the official said. 
  The pact says the two governments agree that the 20 percent 
figure "constitutes neither a guarantee, a ceiling nor a floor 
on the foreign market share." 
  Sales of foreign semiconductors in Japan, calculated in 
value 
terms, kept growing during the whole of 1993 according to both 
calculation methods, MITI said. 
  But foreign shares fluctuated, affected by swings in overall 
chip demand in Japan stemming from seasonal factors, the 
official said, noting that foreign share is calculated by 
dividing sales of foreign chips by overall demand. 
  Japanese chip users are stepping up buying from foreign 
makers, the official said, citing the recent increase in 
"design-in" contracts between foreign chip suppliers and 
Japanese users. 
  The number of design-in deals featuring partnership from the 
initial stage of development exceeded 3,000 cases in 1993, up 
from 500 in 1986, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Japan and Europe remained 
split over quota of Japanese auto exports to the European Union 
(EU) for 1994 at the first day of two-day talks on Thursday [17 
March], Japanese negotiators said. 
  Japan sought an increase while the EU asserted that the 
quota 
should be unchanged from 1993. 
  In 1993, both sides agreed to cut Japan's exports by 18.5 
percent from the previous year to 980,000 vehicles in light of 
slumping demand in Europe. 
  They will try again to reach an agreement Friday, the second 
day of the bilateral talks at the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI), according to the negotiators.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday voiced renewed concern about North Korea's 
alleged nuclear weapons development program, a Foreign Ministry 
official said. 
  "In this (Asia-Pacific) region, a series of favorable 
developments can be seen after the end of the Cold War, but 
there are some destabilizing factors such as North Korea's 
nuclear (program)," the official quoted the premier as saying in 
an interview with journalists from China. 
  North Korea is suspected of producing nuclear weapons at its 
facilities in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. 
It has refused to permit the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, to 
conduct checks at a nuclear site. 
  The interview, held at the premier's official residence for 
nearly an hour, came a day before Hosokawa begins an official 
three- day visit to China. During his stay, he will meet with 
Chinese Premier Li Peng and other leaders in Beijing and make 
inspections of an economic development zone in Shanghai. 
  Hosokawa expressed hope to reaffirm with Chinese leaders the 
shared view that Tokyo and Beijing should further enhance their 
ties so that together they can contribute to the international 
community, the official said. 
  "I wish to have a meaningful and candid exchange of views 
with them to further promote Japan-China ties toward the 21st 
century," he reportedly said. 
  Touching on expanding bilateral trade and growing Japanese 
investment in China, Hosokawa also told the Chinese reporters 
that the prospects for Japan-China economic and trade relations 
are bright.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata urged North Korea Friday to take "new action" before 
Monday, when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meets 
to discuss its refusal to permit complete checks of its nuclear 
facilities. 
  Hata told a regularly scheduled news conference that Japan 
will continue using various channels to persuade North Korea to 
allow iaea experts to perform complete inspections at key 
nuclear sites. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is expected to encourage 
China to urge Pyongyang to accept full international inspections 
during a visit to Beijing over the weekend. China is regarded 
as having more sway over North Korea than any other country. 
  Speaking to members of his cabinet, Hosokawa said he expects 
to see various developments over the next week amid a flurry of 
regional diplomacy, according to government officials. 
  "I will be visiting China, and South Korean President Kim 
Yong- sam will visit Japan and China," he said. 
  On Monday, the IAEA is to hold a special meeting of its 
board 
of governors to formally assess its inspections of North Korea's 
nuclear facilities. 
  If the IAEA meeting declares North Korea in breach of 
nuclear 
safeguard accords, the matter would be referred to the UN 
Security Council, which might impose economic sanctions on 
Pyongyang. 
  The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog said earlier this week 
that Pyongyang barred a team of its inspectors from carrying out 
"important measures" at a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, 
which the IAEA regards as a nuclear reprocessing plant. 
  Western countries have long been suspicious that North Korea 
is developing nuclear weapons. Pyongyang denies the allegations.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan will implement in 11 
cities in the Russian Far East and east Siberia a form of 
assistance called "monetization," in which the recipients sell 
provisions below market price and use the profits for social 
welfare projects, the Foreign Ministry said Friday [18 March]. 
  The Japanese Government will offer such provisions as 811 
tons of condensed milk, 2,581 tons of vegetable cooking oil, 
1,165 tons of canned mandarin oranges and 1,082 tons of canned 
pork meat, the ministry said. 
  The 11 cities include seven in the far eastern region such 
as 
Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Yuzno-Sakhalinsk, and four cities in 
east Siberia, including Irkutsk and Ulan Ude, it said. 
  Japan will first implement the monetization on March 28 in 
Vladivostok and move on to other cities until the end of April. 
  In Russia, people classified as socially weak, such as 
pensioners, are facing difficulties because of inflation, the 
ministry said. 
  And since local administrations are short of sources of 
revenue for implementing social welfare projects, it is useful 
to implement the monetization system, it said. 
  Japan implemented the monetization last year in nine cities 
in Russia. The 4 billion rubles accumulated through 
monetization have been used to build hospitals and medical 
facilities and to purchase medical equipment, the Foreign 
Ministry said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan will extend a total 
of 8.2 million dollars to international humanitarian 
organizations to help the people afflicted in the conflicts in 
the former Yugoslavia, the Foreign Ministry said Friday [18 
March]. 
  Of the total, Japan will extend the World Health 
Organization 
(WHO) 3 million dollars for providing medicine and medical 
supplies, and 700,000 dollars to the U.N. Industrial Development 
Organization (UNIDO) for repairing the existing facilities to 
accommodate displaced people, the ministry said. 
  The assistance also includes 3 million Swiss francs, or 
about 
2 million dollars, to the International Committee for the Red 
Cross (ICRC) to provide safe water and medical equipment, and 
2.5 million dollars to the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) for 
providing educational material and equipment, it said. 
  The latest aid brought the total amount of Japanese 
assistance to the people in the former Yugoslavia to 14.7 
million dollars. 
  Since the outbreak of conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 
March 1992, about 4.2 million people have been afflicted and are 
facing a serious lack of food and daily necessities, according 
to the ministry.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan will send about 20 
election observers to oversee South Africa's [RSA] first 
all-race election in April and has begun making necessary 
preparations, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday [18 
March]. 
  Japan will send the monitors in response to a request by the 
South African Government, recognizing the historical importance 
of the April 26-28 election for the international community, 
spokesman Terusuke Terada said. 
  The election observers to be dispatched by the Japanese 
Government will be joined by 10 U.N. volunteers and several 
people from the private sector, he said. 
  A special assistant of the permanent mission of Japan to the 
United Nations will also be dispatched as a liaison officer to 
the U.N. Observer Mission to South Africa (UNOMSA), he said. 
  Japan has so far extended a total of about 34.8 million yen 
in aid to nongovernmental organizations working in South Africa 
to help voter education and provide vehicles for election 
observation, he said. 
  In a related move, a private Japanese aid organization, the 
Japan International Volunteer Center, also plans to carry out a 
project in connection with the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) to offer vocational training to assist the 
resettlement of returnees to South Africa, he said. 
  The project is aimed at giving training in woodworking, 
welding, plumbing and computer operation, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The government announced 
Friday [18 March] it is suspending new economic aid to Nigeria, 
which has been under military rule since last November. 
  Nigeria is not eligible for Japan's official development 
assistance (ODA) since the regime has dissolved the parliament, 
banned political rallies and taken other undemocratic measures, 
government officials said. 
  Japan, however, will continue to provide emergency 
humanitarian aid to the west African country, they said. 
  Japan will resume aid when Nigeria restores civilian rule, 
the officials said. 
  By fiscal 1992, Japan had provided 87.4 billion yen in 
yen-based loans to Nigeria, the second largest amount it had 
given an African nation, next to Kenya.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan had imported 612,300 
tons of table-use rice by Thursday, the Food Agency reported 
Friday [18 March]. 
  It also said sales of imported nonglutinous rice in Japan in 
the March 1-17 period totaled 170,000 tons, about 60 percent of 
the planned sales volume for March, the agency said. 
  Medium- and short-grain rice accounted for 90,000 tons of 
the 
sales and long-grain rice 80,000 tons. 
  Of the imports, 292,900 tons came from Thailand, 184,300 
tons 
from China, 101,100 tons from the United States and 34,000 tons 
from Australia, the agency said. 
  Japan plans to import a total of 1.7 million tons of rice to 
make up for a supply shortage as a result of the worst domestic 
crop last year since the end of World War II and has so far 
contracted to import 1.37 million tons, or 81 percent, of the 
total. 
  The agency said medium- and short-grain rice represented 
900,000 tons of the contract volume and Thai-produced long-grain 
rice 470,000 tons. 
  The Food Agency announced Thursday Japan will import an 
additional 400,000 tons to 2.1 million tons.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The Japanese Communist 
Party [JCP] said in a statement Friday [18 March] that an 
employee at a rice milling factory on the southernmost island of 
Kyushu found a dead mouse last January in rice that had been 
imported from Thailand. 
  The JCP statement said that the employee discovered the 
mouse 
at a milling factory in Fukuoka Prefecture while he was removing 
rice from a bag to put it into a flour milling machine. 
  Rather than consulting with the factory management, the 
employee brought news of the find directly to the local JCP 
branch office, the statement said. 
  The party's statement was issued to substantiate remarks 
made 
in the Diet earlier this month by JCP parliamentarian Yuko 
Takasaki, who claimed Japanese rice millers have so far found a 
dead mouse, bird bones and cockroaches in shipments of imported 
Thai rice. 
  The allegation has had the effect of creating widespread 
doubt among the general public about the quality and safety of 
imported rice, particularly that coming from Thailand. 
  Officials of the Food Agency, however, said that no such 
allegation has yet been confirmed. They said the factory in 
question has been subject to its inspection aimed at ensuring 
the quality of imported rice. 
  The Thai Embassy in Tokyo earlier this week expressed 
concern 
over the prominently reported allegations. 
  In a letter to a Japanese daily newspaper, the embassy said 
that each rice shipment is strictly inspected before export to 
Japan, by both Thai authorities and Japanese experts, and then 
reinspected upon arrival in Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- A senior leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) expressed resolve on Friday to 
demolish the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  "I suspect the coalition government is already virtually 
divided," LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told a news 
conference. "As our President (Yohei) Kono says, the coalition 
government's role is finished." 
  He said the LDP, ousted from government last summer after 38 
years of unbroken rule, will take a get-tough stance against the 
coalition in order to win back power. 
  Mori said the LDP is setting up a special panel within the 
party on Friday to probe the premier's receipt of money from a 
scandal- tainted parcel delivery firm, which Hosokawa called a 
loan he has since repaid. 
  As a condition for opening Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 
state budget, the LDP has demanded that Hosokawa produce proof 
to support his claim that he returned the 100 million yen he 
received from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. in 1982. 
  The premier has said he has already released all documents 
in 
connection with his loan from the now-defunct company that was 
at the center of the 1992-1993 money, mob and politics scandal. 
  Earlier Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
told a news conference that the government hopes Diet discussion 
on the budget will start as early as possible.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has predicted 
that governing coalition parties will reveal a contradiction of 
basic party policies among them more clearly. 
  Kono, assuming the top post of the party late last July, 
told 
KYODO NEWS SERVICE that the governing coalition parties have had 
clear-cut differences over the interpretation of the 
Constitution and other basic national policies. 
  Kono said the LDP will not be able to help the governing 
coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with their 
simmering political rift. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP) and new party Sakigake 
[Harbinger], two of seven coalition parties, have kept their 
basic stance of respecting the war-renounced Constitution and 
have been hesitant for Japan to participate in the U.N. 
peacekeeping forces. 
  But Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, two other 
coalition parties, envision that Japan should play a more 
positive role in world politics by shaking itself off from the 
role of an economic player in politics. 
  The rift among the four main coalition parties has seemingly 
deepened since Hosokawa failed to remove chief government 
spokesman Masayoshi Takemura from the post in an attempt to 
reshuffle his cabinet early this month, political sources said. 
  Kono turned his topic into a loan dispute involving Hosokawa 
and urged the prime minister to clear an allegation over a 
receipt of political donation from the scandal-tainted truck 
parcel delivery company. 
  Kono, the first head since the LDP lost the 38-year grip on 
power in August, said the prime minister should clear the 
suspicion as he has spearheaded political reform resulting from 
years of money scandals involving LDP politicians. 
  The LDP leader also said it is clear that Hosokawa's remarks 
in Diet deliberation over the allegation contains a 
contradiction of whether he owed 100 million yen to now-defunct 
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. which he borrowed to repair his home in 
Kumamoto Prefecture and buy a condominium in central Tokyo. 
  Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from 
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 to repair the home and buy the 
condominium, and fully repaid the money by January 31, 1991, 
using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor. 
  He served two four-year terms as governor from 1983 until 
February 1991. 
  Hosokawa has rejected an opposition party demand to submit 
more documents related to his loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. 
  The LDP, which set the submission of additional documents 
from Hosokawa as a condition to start deliberations of the 
fiscal 1994 state budget in the House of Representatives budget 
committee, reacted angrily, with the result that debates on the 
budget are likely to be delayed until later this month, Diet 
sources said. 
  "It will be unfortunate for the Japanese people if there is 
a 
further delay in Diet deliberations on the state budget," Kono 
said. 
  Concerning the possible return to power by the LDP, Kono 
said 
his party will present its clear-cut policies to the Japanese 
people to regain power from the coalition government in an 
upcoming general election.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Thirty-eight out of 
Japan's 3,300 local autonomous bodies have urged the government 
not to adopt the former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
government's redistricting plan in redrawing 300 new single-seat 
constituencies for the House of Representatives, the Home 
Affairs Ministry said Friday [18 March]. 
  The revelation came shortly before the government assembles 
a 
panel of experts commissioned with redrawing the border lines of 
the 300 constituencies for the 500-seat lower chamber. 
  The redistricting plan in question was sketched out by a 
panel of academics appointed by the 1989 LDP administration of 
then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. The plan also eyed the 
creation of 300 single-seat constituencies for the lower chamber. 
  Most of the 38 cities, towns and villages are demanding a 
change in the redistricting plan on the strength of the 
resolutions adopted by their local legislative assemblies, 
ministry officials said. 
  These governments are from Aomori, Saitama, Yamanashi, 
Nagano, Gifu, Aichi, Mie and Wakayama Prefectures. 
  These local governments are urging the new redrawing panel 
-- 
to be inaugurated soon by the administration of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa -- to comply with their specific requests in 
sketching out new redistricting proposals for the single-seat 
electorates of the lower chamber. 
  The local governments say the Kaifu administration's 
redistricting plan, if implemented without necessary 
adjustments, would break up their locally-unified blocs of 
policy administration with adjacent municipal governments or 
communities of local residents. 
  The city of Kuwana in Mie Prefecture told the ministry that 
the LDP-proposed connection of Kuwana and the other 
geographically separated municipal government in an unified 
constituency "would provide a serious stumbling block to the 
future development of our city." 
  The new redistricting law -- legislated on January 29 -- 
mandates the redistricting panel to "consider local conditions 
such as the shape of administrative blocs, geography and the 
availability of transportation means."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The coalition failed to 
break a stalemate in the Diet on Friday [18 March], as the 
opposition continued to hold up deliberations on the fiscal 1994 
budget over its demand that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
come clean on a questionable loan, Diet sources said. 
  Sadatoshi Ozato, parliamentary strategist of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), spurned a demand made by his 
coalition counterpart Koken Nosaka to end the weeklong boycott 
of business at the House of Representatives Budget Committee, 
the sources said. 
  Nosaka, chairman of the Diet Administration Committee of the 
Social Democratic Party, the largest force in the seven-party 
coalition, urged the LDP to put an end to its parliamentary 
walkout and rejoin deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget, they 
said. 
  Debate on the 73.08 trillion yen budget is already two 
months 
behind and compilation of a stopgap budget to cover government 
outlays for the initial 50 days of the new fiscal year starting 
April 1 is now unavoidable. 
  The LDP refuses, however, to budge unless Hosokawa agrees to 
submit documents that back up his assertion that he repaid a 100 
million yen loan from a scandal-ridden trucking firm, they said. 
  In past Diet sessions, Hosokawa has repeatedly said he took 
out the loan to help finance repairs on his residence in 
Kumamoto Prefecture and later repaid the loan to the Sagawa 
Kyubin network of trucking and parcel-delivery companies. 
  On Friday, the LDP established a panel of legislators to 
investigate the premier's loan scandal, naming former 
International Trade and Industry Minister Hikaru Matsunaga as 
its chairman. 
  The party says the money was actually an unreported 
political 
donation. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono said, "the premier should take the 
initiative in clearing up suspicions over the loan issue, as the 
essence of political reform lies in alleviating public distrust 
in politics." 
  Hosokawa told reporters at his official residence, "I have 
submitted to the Diet documents that can be submitted." 
  "As I have responded (to the opposition's questions) on the 
issue very honestly, it is difficult to comply (with further 
demands for documents on the loan)," he said. 
  Hosokawa also voiced reluctance to agree to the opposition's 
demand that his former Secretary Masatoshi Miyama testify before 
the Diet on the loan affair. 
  "I question the wisdom of summoning private citizens to the 
Diet as witnesses. We have to refrain from setting such a 
precedent," he said. 
  With the two sides adamant in their positions, next week's 
Diet session is expected to be contentious. 
  "We will undergo very strained Diet business from next 
week," 
Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chief of the LDP's Political Reform 
Headquarters, told a meeting in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. 
  "The LDP will continue to proceed for the time being by 
linking the submission of the documents and summons of 
witnesses" to starting deliberations on the budget, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa called Friday [18 March] for opening deliberations on 
the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994, suggesting he is 
ready to give more explanation over his loan from a 
scandal-tainted trucking company as demanded by the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
  "I have already answered (on the loan problem) 
wholeheartedly. (but) if the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee is held, (I) will speak about what I can tell," 
Hosokawa said. 
  The LDP has refused to open budget deliberations unless 
Hosokawa produces proof to support his claim that he returned 
the 100 million yen he received from Sagawa Kyubin Co. 
  Hosokawa, who spoke to reporters at his official residence, 
however, rejected an opposition demand to submit further 
documents related to his loan from Sagawa in 1982. 
  The premier also turned down another opposition demand that 
the Diet summon his former secretaries to clear up the loan 
problem. 
  "We must be careful not to set a precedent for calling up 
private (sector) people (to the Diet)," he said. 
  Hosokawa has insisted that he borrowed the money to repair 
his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and buy a condominium in Tokyo, 
and that he fully repaid the money nine years later. 
  The parcel delivery firm was involved in a money-and-mob 
scandal which forced former LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru to resign 
in disgrace in 1992. 
  Hosokawa also brushed aside the LDP's reported intensifying 
attempt to bring down the government, saying it is a matter of 
the LDP's interparty affairs.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan's economy has hit 
bottom and is set to stage a moderate recovery, the head of a 
national life insurers' group said Friday. 
  "I have a feeling that the economy has already hit bottom," 
Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of 
Japan, told a regular monthly press conference. 
  Some bright signs are seen in the latest macroeconomic 
statistics, and as for life insurers, new contracts have 
improved recently, he noted. 
  But a "sharp" economic recovery is unlikely as corporate 
capital spending remains sluggish, he said. 
  Against this backdrop, Japanese stock prices can be expected 
to "move even more firmly if clearer signs of a recovery are 
presented," said Uragami who heads the group which in effect 
combines the country's largest institutional investors. 
  Uragami noted that stock prices are now hovering around 
20,000 on the key Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, with 
buying led by foreign investors continuing on hopes of an 
economic upturn. 
  Long-term rates are unlikely to continue rising and put a 
damper on the economy, Uragami said. "Seen as a long-term rate, 
4 percent is not a level to worry about." 
  The yield on the benchmark government bond rose over the 
past 
two months to briefly touch the 4 percent level for the first 
time since the Bank of Japan last cut its discount rate in 
September. 
  Market dealers attributed the rise to hopes of an economic 
recovery and concerns over a market glut with the government 
boosting its bond issuance. 
  The bond yield recently gained stability to move below 4 
percent, but Japanese banks are to raise their long-term prime 
lending rates to more than 4 percent in April.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan's economy "appears 
to have stopped weakening" but the latest data do not confirm 
that a recovery is coming, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Friday 
[18 March]. 
  Some bright signs continue to emerge in consumption, and 
business confidence "has virtually stopped deteriorating," but 
the labor situation continues to worsen gradually and overall 
and "economic growth remains weak," the central bank said in its 
monthly economic review. 
  "While several economic indicators have recently improved, 
and the economy appears to have stopped weakening, this does not 
necessarily confirm that economic recovery is in the offing," 
the report says. 
  It cannot be ruled out that a recovery may be building, but 
statistics do not confirm such a movement, a BOJ told reporters. 
  Spending by manufacturers on plant and equipment continues 
to 
fall, and excess capital stock remains a drag on the economy, 
the report says. But such leading indicators as "machinery 
orders and construction starts appear to have stopped 
declining," it says. 
  "Personal consumption remains weak," the report says, with 
gains in sales of refrigerators and personal computers, as well 
as the number of Japanese travelers. 
  Large-scale retail and passenger car sales are down but the 
declines from year-earlier levels are slimming, it says. 
  Housing investment remains strong, while public works 
spending has slowed in the last year and a half, the report says. 
  Exports have picked up recently from a falling trend on 
stronger overseas demand and a fiscal year-end increase, it 
says, while ''imports, particularly consumer goods, have 
continued to increase.'' 
  It notes that the BOJ's closely watched ''tankan'' survey of 
business sentiment, taken in February, found corporations 
predicting profits will begin to rise in the coming fiscal year, 
even as they again lowered their profit estimates for the 
business year ending this month. 
  It cites a recent Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry report that industrial production rose in January from 
earlier large declines and is expected to swell in the following 
two months. 
  But the report calls the rise a ''temporary surge toward the 
fiscal year end,'' and the underlying trend remains flat, the 
official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan should include 
macroeconomic steps, including permanent tax cuts, in 
market-opening measures due this month, economic planning chief 
Manae Kubota said Friday [18 March]. 
  "The direction should be indicated as concretely as 
possible," Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning 
Agency (EPA), told a regular news conference after a morning 
cabinet meeting. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa urged ministers concerned 
to 
work harder in the macroeconomic field, she said. 
  Kubota said tax cuts, expansion of domestic demand and 
cutting the current account surplus need further discussion. 
  The coalition government has already vowed to enact 
permanent 
tax reform this year, which is expected to offset reductions of 
income tax and other taxes by hiking the consumption tax. 
  The reform is seen as answering U.S. complaints that this 
year's 6 trillion yen in income and resident's tax cuts are just 
one-time measures and will not give domestic demand the 
sustained boost needed to help cut Japan's trade surplus. 
  Suggestions have emerged in recent days to include such 
macroeconomic steps in the market-opening package due by month's 
end, which is to include deregulation, import promotion, 
stricter antitrust enforcement and improved government 
procurement practices.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The telecommunications 
minister Friday [18 March] sought the opinion of his advisory 
panel on licensing experimental broadcasting of the Japanese 
high-definition television (HDTV), hi-vision. 
  The blanket license to make test hi-vision broadcasting is 
currently granted to the Hi-Vision Promotion Association. The 
association is made up of 140 companies, including the Japan 
Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), commercial telecasting companies, 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), major trading 
companies, electrical manufacturing companies and banks. 
  The license is due to expire at the end of this year. 
  Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Takenori Kanzaki is 
considering taking that occasion to switch to individual 
licensing -- granting licenses to individual broadcasting 
companies. 
  Kanzaki asked the Radio Regulatory Council about his 
proposal, seeking a recommendation by about May. Kanzaki hopes 
to grant licenses to individual telecasting companies this 
summer. 
  Experimental broadcasting hours will be divided between or 
among the companies that have won licenses. 
  Kanzaki's proposal forms part of his ministry's policy of 
expanding and reinforcing hi-vision broadcasting. 
  That represents part of the ministry's preparations for the 
start of regular hi-vision broadcasting, using the first of 
next-phase broadcasting satellites to be launched in the summer 
of 1997. 
  Kanzaki's inquiry to the council drew applause from Mikio 
Kawaguchi, NHK president, who said, "I am very pleased by 
today's inquiry." 
  Kawaguchi said the ministry has clearly articulated its 
policy on hi-vision broadcasts, and its commitment to 
hi-vision's future.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- A government advisory 
panel Thursday [17 March] recommended that five new construction 
projects for electric power generation, including one nuclear 
power generator, be added to the current fiscal 1993 plan. 
  The five new facilities would have a combined power 
generation capacity of 1.57 million kilowatts, according to 
government officials. 
  Construction of the nuclear power generator would be the 
first such project allowed in six years. 
  The Electric Power Development Coordination Council 
presented 
the recommendations to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  With the recommendation, the government will initiate legal 
procedures to implement the five projects by the end of month, 
the officials said. 
  The newly planned nuclear power generator is to be the third 
at Tohoku Electric Power Co.'s Megawa Nuclear Power Plant in 
Miyagi Prefecture. 
  Construction of the nuclear generator, set to have an output 
capacity of 825,000 kilowatts, is expected to be completed in 
March 2002. 
  The other four facilities include one using heat recycled 
from an incinerator at Takahama Electric Power Plant in Gunma 
Prefecture, a hydroelectric power plant in Hyogo Prefecture, 
another hydroelectric plant in Tottori Prefecture, and a 
thermoelectric station on an island off Niigata Prefecture. 
  These latest projects bring the total implemented by Japan 
in 
fiscal 1993 to 19 new electric power facilities -- seven 
hydroelectric, 11 thermoelectric, and one nuclear generator. 
  The total generation capacity of the 19 facilities will come 
to 4.45 million kilowatts, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Toppan Printing Co., a 
leading printing company, has developed a computerized 
translation machine which is capable of learning, company 
officials said Friday [18 March]. 
  The English-Japanese, Japanese-English translator is the 
first embodiment of the example-based machine translation (EBMT) 
theory in Japan, the officials said. 
  Under EBMT, machines first memorize example sentences, then 
translate sentences given, using the stock of memories and the 
machines ability to make analogies, they said. 
  Conventional translation machines use the so-called transfer 
system, under which the machines, with a stock of memorized 
grammar and syntax, first break down the sentences given into 
parts, translate each, and recompose the sentences in the second 
language. 
  Toppan officials said the conventional translation method 
often produces unnatural sentences. 
  To make such translations more natural requires an 
additional 
input of new rules, which often confuses the machines, the 
officials said. 
  The officials also said machines with the new translation 
system, called Toptran, have the ability to learn the more 
frequently they are used because of the increased storage of 
memories. 
  The system, a fruit of four years of research and 
development 
and 200 million yen in investments, will be used only within the 
company and will not be put on the market for the time being, 
they said.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese, on 
page 5 of its 8 March, 9 March, 10 March, 11 March, and 12 March 
morning editions, carries a five-part series entitled "Is the 
Japanese Market Open?" with each article averaging approximately 
1,000 words. 
  The first article on 8 March, an unattributed piece 
subtitled 
"Automobile and Auto Parts -- Reasons American-Built Automobiles 
Are Not Sold In Japan and the Gap Between Japan and the United 
States," deals with Japan-U.S. friction over automobiles and 
auto parts. 
  Noting that the U.S. Government has decided to revive the 
Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, thus 
heightening Japan-U.S. trade frictions, the article states it 
has looked into the actual situation of the "closed Japanese 
market" pointed out by the United States. 
  The article cites remarks by Harold Poling, chairman of Ford 
Motor Company: "In the balance of trade between Japan and the 
United States, the ratio of automobile and auto parts is 
overwhelmingly great; it is necessary to take decisive and 
concrete action to address the imbalance in the trade of 
automobile and auto parts between the two countries." The 
article adds the "trade imbalance between Japan and the United 
States in the automobile and auto parts sector is certainly 
great." 
  Stating that last year Japan exported $23.77 billion worth 
of 
automobiles to the United States, accounting for 21.9 percent of 
its total exports to that country, while importing $1.125 
billion worth of American-built automobiles, the article points 
out that "Japan's imports of American-built cars in 1993 were 
merely 2.0 percent of the total imports from that country." 
  The article continues by saying that as examples of the 
closure of the Japanese market, the Big Three cite: "1) the 
clear existence of dealer keiretsu [interlocking corporate 
grouping] and traditionally exclusionist business practices; 2) 
Japan's peculiar stereotyped certification system; and 3) the 
imposition of various discriminatory taxes on large automobiles 
as well as the pervasiveness of closed deals, with the 
importance placed on keiretsu." The article adds "Japanese auto 
manufacturers also complain about the complexity of Japan's 
standard for certification." 
  The article states that Japanese auto manufacturers refute 
their complaints, claiming: "In Japan, they can freely obtain 
their dealership in principle; it is good if they organize their 
own sales networks in Japan as we have done in other nations. 
The standard for certification and the tax system are common in 
Japan, the United States, and Europe. The share of 
European-built cars is about 4 percent in Japan and the United 
States, and that percentage has not changed greatly. This is 
evidence there is no difference between the openness of the 
Japanese and American auto markets." 
  As reasons why American-built automobiles are not sold in 
Japan, the article cites the following: "1) Approximately 80 
percent of automobiles are sold for less than 3 million yen on 
the Japanese market. They are small automobiles with an engine 
displacement of less than 2,000CC [cubic centimeters], while 
most American-built cars are highly-priced large automobiles 
with an engine displacement of 3,000CC; 2) Most European-built 
automobiles are right-hand drive, but only a few American-built 
automobiles are right-hand drive; and 3) European auto 
manufacturers have spent heavily on the construction of their 
own car inspection centers before exporting their automobiles, 
but American auto manufacturers have made little efforts to that 
end." The article also points out: "While the defective rate 
of Japanese-made auto parts is three or five in one million, 
that of American-made auto parts is 250 in one million. American 
auto-parts manufacturers have failed to meet the supply date on 
many occasions." 
  Noting that efforts on both sides have little by little 
generated the effect of addressing the imbalance, and that it is 
certain the imbalance has begun addressing itself, the article 
states: "Both Japan and the United States are urged to 
accumulate sober efforts instead of being locked in emotional 
confrontations." 
  The second article on 9 March, an unattributed piece 
subtitled "Telecommunications Equipment -- The U.S. Demands 
Guaranteed Results," discusses Japan-U.S. friction over 
telecommunications equipment. 
  Stating that final negotiations on the issue of opening the 
Japanese mobile phone market are being held between Japan and 
the United States, the article notes the wide differences 
between the two countries over the interpretation of the term 
"equal market access" which is incorporated into the preamble of 
the 1989 Japan-U.S. Telecommunications Agreement. 
  Discussing the differences, the article says while the U.S. 
trade representative claims "the Motorola-type mobile phone 
operation is not given the same market access to relay stations 
as the NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation]-type 
mobile phone operation enjoys, the Post and Telecommunications 
Ministry [PTM] contends `equal market access' refers only to a 
general theory. The Japan Mobile Communications Corporation 
[known as IDO] has assigned frequencies to the Motorola-type 
mobile phone operation. What remains to be done regards the 
question of business, and the government cannot intervene in 
business." The article also notes that the construction of 
relay stations for the Motorola-type mobile phone operation lags 
behind that of relay stations for the NTT-type mobile phone 
operation. While the NTT-type mobile phone operation have 
310,000 subscribers, the Motorola-type mobile phone operation 
has a little over 10,000 subscribers, triggering fresh friction 
between Japan and the United States over the share of the 
Motorola-type mobile phone operation in the Japanese mobile 
phone market. 
  The article states that in bilateral negotiations on 
government procurement under the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks, the United States asked Japan to make NTT subject to the 
accord on the government procurement, with the "apparent aim of 
opening the way for a result-based orientation which is aimed at 
raising the share of foreign goods on the Japanese market to the 
level of foreign goods in the rest of the G-7 markets." 
  A senior PTM official states: "Moves by the United States 
are aimed at expanding its access to the Japanese market in the 
high-tech sector--in which it has the upper hand--by driving a 
wedge in the Japan telecommunications market which is expected 
to rapidly grow in the multimedia age." 
  The article adds: "Japan is denying U.S. charges that the 
Japanese market is closed, citing the growing number of 
telecommunications companies in which foreign firms hold more 
than 20 percent of their capital." It goes on to concede: 
"There are many regulations in the Japanese telecommunications 
market, and this makes it hard to freely engage in the 
telecommunications business in Japan. Japanese manufacturers 
also are complaining about the situation." A major commercial 
electric appliance manufacturer is quoted as saying: "It is 
urgent for Japan to relax these regulations in order to avert 
trade friction with its trade partners and to bolster Japan's 
international competitiveness." 
  Stressing that if Japan fails to keep its regulations from 
hindering the development of telecommunications technology, it 
will be criticized for keeping its telecommunications market 
closed and for crippling Japan's future high technology. 
  The third article on 10 March, an unattributed piece 
subtitled "The Government Procurement of Supercomputers -- The 
United States Still Distrusts Japan's Reform of Tender System," 
views Japan-U.S. friction over government procurements. 
  After a review by the Information Center at Tsukuba 
University on the disputes between Japan and the United States 
over the bidding for supercomputers, the article states: "The 
Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers has become a 
symbol of high-tech friction between Japan and the United 
States." 
  Stating that the government has already decided in this 
year's supplementary budget to procure 11 supercomputers--six 
American-built and five Japanese-built supercomputers--through 
biddings, the article notes that "so far 80 percent of the 
government's procurement of supercomputers has been 
Japanese-built." By the government procuring six American-built 
supercomputers, the United States feels that "given our 
technological power, it is a matter of course for the Japanese 
Government to procure our supercomputers." 
  Discussing the dispute between Japan and the United States 
over the Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers, 
the article states: "While the United States thinks the 
Japanese Government attaches importance to prices in its 
procurement of supercomputers and gives Japanese firms 
information on biddings, Japan contends that American 
supercomputer manufacturers are unable to gain access to Japan's 
supercomputer market because of the high competitiveness held by 
Japanese supercomputer manufacturers." It adds that American 
supercomputer manufacturers, who control more than 60 percent of 
the world market, have complained about their inability to 
display their competitiveness in the Japanese supercomputer 
market. Michiro Naruto, assistant director of Fujitsu Ltd, is 
quoted as saying: "Foreign-built supercomputers have been kept 
out of the U.S. Government procurement market for security 
reasons. Not a single Japanese-built supercomputer has been 
sold on the market." 
  The article further states that despite Japan's amendment of 
procedures for government procurement of supercomputers, as well 
as its adoption of a comprehensive appraisal system, the United 
States still complains about the way the Japanese Government 
procures supercomputers. Pointing out that in testimony before 
Congress on 8 March, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor cited 
supercomputers as an item indicative of the closure of the 
Japanese market, hinting at the possibility of the United States 
applying the Super 301 provision to supercomputers, the article 
responds by saying the United States points to the 
incompleteness of Japanese reform regarding the way the 
government procures supercomputers; dumping by Japanese 
supercomputer manufacturers still remains unchanged. It says: 
"Japanese supercomputer manufacturers acknowledge dumping." 
  Also stressed is the fact that the "Japan-U.S. friction over 
the Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers stems 
not from the lack of transparency of the tender system, but from 
the differences between Japanese and American management style." 
It notes that "it has become difficult for the two countries to 
find clues to defusing their friction." 
  The fourth article on 11 March, an unattributed piece 
subtitled "Plate Glass Products -- After-Contract Discount 
Abolished," deals with the friction between Japan and the United 
States over plate glass products. 
  Noting that "three major Japanese glass manufacturers--Asahi 
Glass Company, Nippon Sheet Glass Company, and Central Glass 
Company--control about 90 percent of the Japanese glass market, 
and that the ratio of imported glass on the market is less than 
10 percent," the article says the United States has continued to 
criticize Japan, claiming that "special agents, the pervasive 
keiretsu in distribution channels, and the lack of transparency 
of business practices in Japan have kept foreign-made glass out 
of the Japan's glass market." 
  Reporting that the three major Japanese glass manufacturers 
have announced plans not to comply with any demands from 
construction firms for after-contract discounts [a business 
practice under which glass manufacturers comply with demands 
from construction firms for discounting glass prices from their 
purchase contracts after they complete the construction of their 
buildings] in a bid to increase the lack of transparency of 
glass prices, the article stresses that the "three major 
Japanese glass manufacturers have abolished after-contract 
discounts so American firms can easily understand competition in 
Japan." Yasuhiko Furukawa, assistant director of Asahi Glass 
Company, is quoted as saying: "Japanese glass manufacturers 
have done what is necessary to open the Japanese glass market. 
What remains to be done is for American firms to make the 
effort." 
  A survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
shows "three-fourth of glass wholesalers that do not deal in 
imported glass have never received offers from foreign glass 
makers." 
  The article adds: "It is true that in Japan importance is 
placed on long-term, stable deals." 
  Touching on Japan-U.S. friction over paper products, Toru 
Yoshino, managing director of Shinoshi Paper Company, is quoted 
as saying: "American corporations have failed to properly deal 
with port strikes, and poorly respond to the Japanese market as 
regards aspects of supply." The article notes: "It would be 
very difficult for both Japan and the United States to find 
areas of agreement to settle their friction over paper products." 
  The fifth and final article on 12 March, an unattributed 
piece subtitled "Insurance -- Japan Is In the Red," details 
Japan-U.S. friction over insurance. 
  Noting that insurance is a sector in which Japan runs a 
large 
deficit with the United States, the article cites 1990 U.S. 
statistics showing that while Japan paid the United States $583 
million in insurance transactions, the United States paid Japan 
$156 million. The question is raised of why the insurance 
sector became a priority sector for discussion in the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. 
  An unnamed official in an insurance firm is quoted as 
saying: 
"A major American insurance group, which has a close 
relationship with President Clinton, has lobbied the U.S. 
Government. The American Insurance Group is the only American 
insurance corporation unhappy with the Japanese Government." 
  The article notes that in his testimony before Congress, 
Josef Molay [name as published], representative of the U.S. 
Insurance Association, touched on the closure of the Japanese 
insurance market, stressing: "The American financial service 
sector is the fastest growing sector. It maintains 77 percent 
of its workers on the job, and creates 90 percent of new jobs, 
while generating 70 percent of the gross domestic production 
(GDP). The sector also accounts for one-third of U.S. exports." 
  Against the backdrop of its competitiveness, the United 
States stuck to the last to its demand for holding negotiations 
on the financial service sector in the Uruguay Round. 
  Pointing out that the United States has highly appraised 
Japan for working for an amendment to the Insurance Business Law 
and for relaxing regulations, the article states: "It is true 
the government's full protection and use of keiretsu by Japanese 
insurance companies for their insurance transactions are major 
barriers for foreign-affiliated insurance companies in Japan." 
  A government source is quoted as saying: "With the exception 
of the numerical targets issue, the two nations can strike a 
deal in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." The article 
adds: "The United States views the Japanese market as closed 
and not transparent. This is one of reasons for the United 
States' sticking to its demand for numerical targets." The 
article concludes by saying Japan is reacting against the U.S. 
view, asserting that "the Japanese insurance market is open, and 
there are many problems with the U.S. insurance market."

<F P=106> [Article by Aoyama Gakuin University Professor Kenichi Ito: </F>
"Mature Relationship Between Japan and the United States"] 
  [Text] It is correct to say that the relationship between 
Japan and the United States has entered a new era following the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, which was a common threat to Japan 
and the United States, as well as following a change in the 
power relationship between the two countries. Japan should not 
take an action to appease its own people under pressure from 
foreign countries as it has done so far, but it should adopt a 
policy of voluntarily and independently doing what it has to do. 
  However, after the Japanese-U.S. summit talks were broken 
off, Japan stated with composure: "With the breakdown, the 
relationship between the two nations has matured." This 
justification is based on a quite incorrect understanding. 
  It is too optimistic a view that economic issues can be 
separated from political and security issues. If Japan holds 
such a view, its national interests may be hampered. 
  Japan has not seriously realized that there are great 
differences in views as well as in national interests between 
Japan and the United States. There is a possibility that Japan 
will in the future become aware that Japanese-U.S. relations 
will have worsened irreparably. Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa should take the initiative voluntarily in preventing 
the Japanese-U.S. relationship from deteriorating further. 
  The Clinton administration also has its problems. The leader 
that should bear responsibility for the world is unable to make 
a decision from a broad viewpoint and is instead adopting a 
policy of emphasizing domestic affairs. The United States can 
be described as a daimyo who holds a fief which yields 1 million 
koku [1 koku equals 180 liters] of rice but who acts as if he is 
daimyo with a fief which yields only 100,000 koku of rice. That 
country should clearly define the place of the Japanese-U.S. 
relationship in the world order. 
  There is a concern that Japan revisionists [nihon ishitsu 
ronsha], who express dissatisfaction with Japan through business 
dealings with Japan, are at the center of the Clinton 
administration and that they surround the President. 
  The economic framework talks, which have been at an impasse 
as the Japanese-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks 
were before, look like salesmen's negotiations as would be found 
in the private sector. Because deregulation and the expansion 
of domestic demand are issues that concern Japan itself, while 
at the same time they are of benefit to the entire world, Japan 
needs to take a drastic approach to them. 
  Now that GATT's international trade rules have changed, 
Japan 
should at first propose a new Japanese-U.S. structure which 
includes political and security issues and which takes the new 
world order into account. To that end, it is appropriate for 
not only government officials but also learned men who represent 
the two countries to hold thorough discussions without time 
limits being set for these.

  [Text] Bangkok, March 17 (AFP) -- Police on Thursday 
discovered a dead body and the "most powerful explosive device 
ever found in Thailand" when they searched a truck that had been 
in a minor accident near several foreign embassies last week. 
Police explosive experts defused the device without incident. 
  National police chief Prathin Santiprapop said Thursday 
night 
on television that the bomb "clearly was the work of foreigners 
and was targetted at foreigners in Thailand." He said the body, 
which was found in the same large, rectangular metal tank as the 
explosive device, was that of the original driver of the truck. 
The dead man was a foreigner and at first was thought to have 
fled the scene following the accident, Pratin said. He did not 
give further information on the victim's identity. 
  Another police officer, who was not identified, said on 
television that the bomb was "the most powerful explosive device 
ever found in Thailand," and was similar in composition to bombs 
frequently used in Northern Ireland. The device included a large 
amount of ammonium nitrate, a quantity of flammable liquid and a 
car battery. 
  The six-wheel truck, which had been rented with a driver 
March 9, was involved in a minor accident with a motorcycle two 
days later in the vicinity of the Israeli, British and US 
embassies, police said earlier. A foreigner who spoke almost no 
Thai was driving at the time, police said. 
  When the owner appeared at the police pound Thursday to 
claim 
his vehicle, a police search turned up the metal container with 
the body and the home-made explosive device.

<F P=106> [Press statement issued by a spokesman for the DPRK Atomic </F>
Energy General Bureau in Pyongyang on 18 March -- first 
paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] In connection with the fact that the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat has unjustifiably 
assessed [pudanghage pyongga] the results of its inspections of 
our nuclear facilities [haeksisol], a spokesman for the DPRK 
Atomic Energy General Bureau has released the following press 
statement [tamhwa]: 
  Press statement by a spokesman for the DPRK Atomic Energy 
General Bureau 
  According to the 25 February letter of agreement at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, we received inspections from the 
IAEA for ensuring the continuity of safeguards on 1-15 March. 
  The recent inspections were designed to purely ensure the 
continuity of safeguards [sunsu tamboui yonsoksongul 
pojanghanunde] in conformity with the special status [tuksuhan 
chiwi] in which our country had temporarily suspended the 
effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
  In the negotiations in Vienna with us on 15 February, the 
agency's Secretariat admitted that the inspections were for 
ensuring the continuity of safeguards and agreed on the scope of 
such inspections. 
  Therefore, throughout the period after we received the 
inspection team, out of a desire to sincerely implement the 
DPRK-U.S. agreement and the agreement between us and the IAEA, 
we allowed all activities necessary to ensure the continuity of 
safeguards and positively cooperated with the inspection team's 
work. As a result, the agency's inspection team was able to 
satisfactory carry out all activities pointed out in the 15 
February Vienna agreement, including replacing and maintaining 
[chongbi] sealing and surveillance devices [pongswae mit 
kamsisudan], examining inventories [chaegoryang], examining 
[komto] various documents, verifying design information [solgye 
tongbo], and obtaining and measuring samples [siryo chaechwi mit 
chukchong]. 
  Nevertheless, during the period of the recent inspections, 
the agency's Secretariat and the inspection team unilaterally 
insisted that the inspections were not inspections for ensuring 
the continuity of safeguards but inspections under the 
safeguards accord. And, quite contrary to the 15 February 
Vienna agreement, they put forth an uncourteous request for 
inspections almost tantamount to regular and irregular 
inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi]. 
  Not keeping with the Vienna agreement, the IAEA Secretariat 
gave directions [chiryong] to the inspection team, and taking 
the inspection team's incorrect report [kuruttoen pogo] as an 
established fact, it insisted on unfair demands, including the 
issues of extracting samples from places where seals, which are 
locking devices, remained untouched; gamma measuring of all 
parts, not selected spots; and checking of the cooling system, 
which was not even mentioned in the Vienna negotiations. 
  The IAEA Secretariat continued to intimidate us by sending 
three telex messages saying if its demands were not fulfilled, 
it would report to the Board of Governors that it could not 
confirm nuclear materials were not used for other purposes. 
  On the other hand, when the members of the inspection team 
in 
our country could not make any more objections to the 
administrators' logical explanation regarding the extraction of 
samples from places where seals were maintained, they made an 
excuse that they had no choice but to carry out the task 
[extracting samples] because it was assigned by the IAEA 
Secretariat. Even after personally confirming that the seals 
they put themselves in August 1993 remained untouched, they made 
an absurd assertion that they could not trust the seals because 
they were over a year old. 
  The IAEA Secretariat's unfair demands, including the sample 
extraction from the inlet measurement tank [ipku kyeryang tank] 
locked by IAEA's seals, have nothing to do with the objective 
and nature of the inspection--which was to check that no nuclear 
activities had been carried out--but are a grave violation 
[omjunghan wiban] of the agreement reached in Vienna on 15 
February. 
  We have even shown a good intention by flexibly carrying 
out the IAEA's unreasonable [murihan] demands, including the 
issues of extracting samples from some places where sealing 
devices are installed and measuring gamma from all necessary 
places. Since it is so, the recent nuclear inspection 
activities carried out by a IAEA inspection team are sufficient 
to confirm that nuclear materials from our nuclear facilities 
are not used for other purposes and to firmly ensure the 
continuity of safeguards. 
  In fact, these facilities were blocked doubly and triply as 
the gate of the radiochemical laboratory and major processes 
[kongjong] were frozen [tonggyol] with numerous seals, 
surveillance cameras, and marks of the IAEA. 
  Nonetheless, the IAEA Secretariat, even before analyzing the 
results of the inspections, made an unjust assessment that it 
cannot guarantee that nuclear materials were not used for other 
purpose at these facilities because some inspection activities 
were restricted at the radiochemical laboratory, even though 
many inspection activities were carried out in accordance with 
the Vienna agreement. In connection with this, the IAEA is 
causing a stir that it will convene a meeting of the IAEA Board 
of Governors. 
  This is an utterly unjust act of openly turning over the 
agreement reached with the United States and with the IAEA on 
ensuring the continuity of safeguards, and can never be 
justified under any circumstances. 
  All these facts prove that the IAEA Secretariat attempts to 
widen the scope of unjustness and, under the U.S. manipulation, 
invariably pursues sinister political aims to crush [apsal] us. 
  If the IAEA Secretariat truly hopes for a fair solution of 
our nuclear problem, it should withdraw its unjust hasty 
assessment on the results of the recent inspections 
  We will watch the attitude the IAEA Secretariat will assume 
at the upcoming Board of Governors meeting. Based on this, we 
will judge whether it intends to resolve our nuclear issue 
fairly or attempts to use this for political aims. 
  If the IAEA Secretariat again tries to agitate the unjust 
pressure commotions against us by finding faults with us, we 
will have no choice but to respond to this with a resolute 
measure [manil kukchewonjaryokkiku sogigugi urirul 
kolgodulmyonso ttodasi uriege pudanghan amnyoksodongul polliryo

<F P=106> ["We Will Wait and See the Attitude of the IAEA Secretariat </F>
" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- "We will wait and see 
what attitude the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
Secretariat will take at the forthcoming meeting of the board of 
governors, and on the basis of its attitude, we will judge 
whether the Secretariat intends to seek a fair resolution of our 
`nuclear issue' or the Secretariat intends to continue using the 
issue for its political purposes. If the IAEA Secretariat, 
provoking us, tries to put another pressure upon the DPRK, we 
will have no other alternative but to respond to it with a 
resolute step." 
  The spokesman for the General Department of Atomic Energy of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea served this warning in 
a statement today. 
  Recalling that the DPRK accepted an inspection of the IAEA 
necessary for the continuity of safeguards from March 1 to 15, 
the spokesman says: 
  This inspection was aimed exclusively to maintain the 
continuity of safeguards, proper for the unique status of the 
DPRK characterized by the temporary suspension of its declared 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. 
  Therefore, on the basis of our desire to implement in good 
faith both the DPRK-USA agreed conclusions and the DPRK-IAEA 
agreement in the whole period of the presence of the inspection 
team, we permitted all the inspection activities within the 
scope needed for maintaining the continuity of safeguards and 
provided the inspection team with our unreserved cooperation for 
its work. 
  Consequently, the agency's inspection team was able to carry 
out satisfactorily all the activities in the DPRK's nuclear 
facilities as specified in the Vienna agreement of February 15, 
including the reloading and servicing of containment and 
surveillance devices, the verification of the physical 
inventories, the examination of a number of records and 
documents, verification of the design information, samplings and 
measurements. 
  While the inspection was proceeding, however, the agency 
Secretariat and the inspection team unilaterally claimed that 
their inspection was a safeguards agreement-bound inspection, 
not an inspection necessary for providing the continuity of 
safeguards and pressed their inordinate demands that would make 
their inspection equivalent to routine and ad hoc inspections, a 
wanton violation of what was agreed in the Vienna agreement of 
February 15. 
  The agency Secretariat gave the inspection team instructions 
inconsistent with the Vienna agreement and made the inaccurate 
report from the inspection team a fait accompli, taking it at 
its face value, and insisted on unreasonable demands for 
samplings from locations where seals as the means of containment 
remain unbroken, gamma mapping at most of the points, instead of 
a few selected points, and even verification of the cooling 
systems, which the Vienna consultations had never dealt with. 
  In addition, the agency Secretariat went the length of 
threatening us with its telex messages addressed to us three 
times, saying that it "will have to report to the board of 
governors that the agency is not in a position to verify 
non-diversion of nuclear material," unless its demands are met. 
  On the other hand, the inspection team members during their 
stay in our country found themselves helpless when the operators 
gave them logically reasonable explanations with regard to the 
requested samplings from locations where seals remain unbroken, 
and excused themselves for their demands, saying "it cannot be 
helped because this is the task from the agency Secretariat." 
Moreover, even after they confirmed firsthand the maintenance of 
the original seals they placed last August, they illogically 
made out their case, saying that "we cannot believe the 
integrity of the one-year-old seals." 
  The unjust demands of the agency Secretariat including 
request for sampling from the input accountability tank 
contained by the agency's seals have no relevance at all to the 
aim and character of the recent inspection designed to verify 
the absence of nuclear activities, and constitute a flagrant 
violation of the Vienna agreement of February 15. 
  During its inspection we have shown flexibility as an 
expression of our good will by agreeing to the impertinent 
demands from the IAEA Secretariat, including samplings at some 
locations where containment devices remain intact, and the gamma 
mapping at all the necessary points. 
  Therefore, the recent inspection activities performed by the 
IAEA inspection team are sufficient to enable the agency to 
fully verify non-diversion of nuclear material at our nuclear 
facilities and definitely ensure the continuity of safeguards as 
well. 
  In fact, the receiving stage and major processes at the 
radiochemical laboratory remain controlled by dozens of IAEA 
seals, surveillance cameras and IAEA's tracer chemicals, so 
that the facility is a placed under the agency's double and 
triple containment control. 
  Notwithstanding this fact, before the analysis of the 
inspection results was available, the IAEA Secretariat announced 
its unjust conclusion that "although many of the agreed 
inspection measures were carried out as envisaged, some other 
activities were restricted at the radiochemical laboratory," and 
that "the agency was not in a position to verify that there had 
been no diversion of nuclear material, at the facility." And the 
Secretariat is making a dustup by scheduling a meeting of the 
IAEA Board of Governors on this matter. 
  This is an utterly unjustifiable action of openly revoking 
the DPRK-USA agreed conclusions and the DPRK-IAEA agreement with 
respect to the continuity of safeguards, and there can be no 
justification for this action in any case. 
  All the facts demonstrate that the agency Secretariat has 
been further widening its partiality and still continues 
pursuing its ill-disposed political purposes under the United 
States' manipulation in an attempt to strangle the DPRK. 
  If the IAEA Secretariat sincerely wants a fair resolution of 
our "nuclear issue," it must rescind the unreasonable assessment 
it had rushed to with regard to the result of the recent 
inspection.

  [Text] In an emergency telephone conversation, Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher 
shared the view [insigul kachihada] that the efforts of the two 
countries to solve the North Korean nuclear issue have reached 
an important stage. They discussed measures to take henceforth. 
  Minister Han and Secretary Christopher agreed that the 
nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] was not satisfactory [sunjoropchi mottaha] and no 
progress was made in the issue of exchanging North-South special 
envoys. As the result, a third round of U.S.-North Korea talks 
is undecided. 
  The foreign ministers of the two countries shared the view 
that the two countries will make last-ditch efforts for dialogue 
to persuade North Korea but will seek new measures -- 
omni-directional -- if the efforts for dialogue are not 
successful. 
  The ministers of the two countries agreed that it is 
important for the two countries to implement consistent measures 
at this point under close mutual consultations. 
  In the conversation, Minister Han revealed that during 
President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China beginning 26 March, the 
North Korean nuclear issue will be discussed at a ROK-PRC summit 
and in other occasions of consultation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam voiced concern Thursday that international 
sanctions against North Korea could be inevitable due to the 
current nuclear row. 
  "It's a serious problem for the international community and 
truly unfortunate that the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) inspection in North Korea was incomplete, and that it was 
unable to inspect two important sites," Kim said in an interview 
with NHK-TV broadcast here on the evening news. 
  "It's now heading toward a situation where international 
sanctions cannot but be imposed on North Korea," he said. 
  The comments by South Korea's top executive came just hours 
after the IAEA announced in Vienna that its inspectors, during 
their two-week stay in North Korea, were denied access to 
important sites that could determine whether the Stalinist state 
diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. 
  Kim's interview came a week before he heads to Tokyo on his 
first outing this year. It was only last year that the Seoul 
Government closed the book on the dark past with Tokyo from the 
1910-45 colonial years. 
  On opening his country to Japanese cultural imports, Kim 
said 
the important thing is to open up naturally and gradually 
through exchanges between the two peoples and their governments. 
  "The opening will have to wait until such time comes," he 
said, predicting that this would occur during the remaining four 
years of his presidency. 
  He also thought a visit to Korea by Japanese Emperor Akihito 
was possible during the next four years, a step officials here 
say is the last emotional door to close on the two countries' 
past relations. 
  But it's important to create an atmosphere where the people 
of both countries can sincerely welcome such a visit, he said.

  [Text] HANOI, March 17 (AFP) -- Pope John Paul II is to 
assign a controversial Vietnamese bishop to a job in the Vatican 
instead of lining him up to take over as archbishop of Ho Chi 
Minh City, a government official said here Thursday. 
  Bishop Nguyen Van Thuan, a nephew of former South Vietnamese 
president Ngo Dinh Diem, is to be assigned to a Vatican post 
instead of being appointed deputy to the ailing archbishop in 
the southern city, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan said. 
  If confirmed by the Vatican, the agreement with Hanoi would 
mark a backing down by the Roman Catholic Church over its 
freedom to appoint senior church officials in Vietnam, by 
granting the government here a veto over the selection of clergy. 
  During talks here last week between Vietnamese officials and 
Monsignor Claudio Celli, the Vatican's deputy secretary of 
state, the Holy See agreed to consult Hanoi over the selection 
of clergy, a source of tension between the church and Vietnam 
for some time. 
  The Vatican has so far refused to comment on statements by 
the Vietnamese government, saying it was waiting for Celli's 
return to Rome. 
  "As far as the case of Bishop Nguyen Van Thuan is concerned 
we were informed that the Holy Father will assign Bishop Thuan 
to a post in the Vatican and the Vietnamese side agreed to that 
arrangement," Lan told a news briefing. 
  The spokeswoman said they had agreed "that the Holy See will 
keep the government informed of all matters concerning the 
Vietnamese Catholic Church and will not make any decision in 
this connection unless the Vietnamese government gives its 
approval." 
  Thuan was originally appointed deputy archbishop before the 
communists took over the then Saigon in 1975. He was not allowed 
to take up the post and has been in exile in Rome since 1992. 
  Vietnamese authorities have been trying to engineer the 
appointment of Huynh Van Nghi, recently described by Vietnamese 
Premier Vo Van Kiet as having "a positive attitude," as deputy 
to Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, who is over 80 years old and in 
poor health. 
  The Vatican had appointed Nghi as a "supervising bishop" in 
Ho Chi Minh City but this was rejected by government authorities 
here, who said it was part of a "plot" to sideline the bishop 
and eventually appoint Thuan as archbishop. 
  The church's development here under French colonial rule and 
the strong connections between Catholicism and the former South 
Vietnamese regime have fueled government suspicions of 
Catholics, who number around seven million people, or 10 percent 
of the population. 
  Vatican officials have accused Vietnam of trying to turn 
Asia's second largest Catholic community after the Philippines 
into a state-sponsored church outside of the control of the 
normal religious hierachy. 
  At a meeting in August with Vietnamese living in the United 
States, the pope called on the congregation "not to forget your 
brothers and sisters ... in the difficult situation of their 
country." 
  Kiet told a Catholic newspaper earlier this month that as 
the 
issue was one of "national sovereignty," Vietnam had ruled out a 
compromise on who had the right to control religious activities. 
  Tensions have eased in recent years with visits here by 
Vatican envoys but the dispute over appointments has left 
several top posts unfilled, including the head of the 
archdiocese of Hanoi.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Friday he has no plans to discuss trade issues when 
he meets U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in Hawaii. 
  Ruling out any plans to seek resumption of the stalled 
bilateral trade talks, Fujii stressed that a meeting with 
Bentsen is not yet set but if it takes place in Hawaii it will 
be to discuss Asia-Pacific affairs. "It all depends when the 
talks are actually held," Fujii said, expressing uncertainty 
over what Bentsen may want to discuss. 
  Fujii will leave for Hawaii on Friday evening to attend a 
two-day meeting of finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Noting that APEC nations are highly interested in Japan's 
economic trends, Fujii said he would explain the latest 15.25 
trillion yen stimulus package that includes "extremely big" tax 
cuts worth some 6 trillion yen. 
  He said the single-year tax cuts would have sufficient 
effects to put the economy into a "full-fledged recovery phase 
in fiscal 1994." 
  Asked what measures will be taken in and after fiscal 1995 
to 
attain the "stable growth" aimed for by the government, Fujii 
said the Finance Ministry will stay "neutral." 
  He declined to elaborate but said the ruling coalition 
parties are now discussing how they can decide on a permanent 
tax reform by the end of the year. 
  Fujii remained cautious over the ministry's quarterly survey 
released Thursday that showed signs that corporate earnings may 
have bottomed out in the October-December period. 
  "Some figures turned upward but the overall figures remained 
sluggish," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa by </F>
Korea Broadcasting System reporter Choe Tong-ho held in the 
Japanese prime minister's residence in Tokyo on 11 March -- 
recorded; Choe asks questions in Korean, and Prime Minister 
Hosokawa answers in Japanese with a simultaneous translation 
into Korean] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Choe Tong-ho] During the 
recent Japan-U.S. or U.S.-Japan talks, you, Mr. Prime Minister, 
said no to the United States with confidence. A photograph of 
the summit talks in the White House shows President Clinton and 
you turning your faces away from each other. The United States 
is now threatening to revive the Super 301 provision. 
Nevertheless, a global trend is that the center of the global 
economy is now moving from Europe and the United States to the 
Asia-Pacific region. What will be Japan's role in the 
Asia-Pacific economic sphere? 
  [Hosokawa] Regrettably, no agreement was reached on the 
comprehensive economic consultations during my talks with 
President Clinton. However, Japan-U.S. relations cover not only 
automobiles, financing, and the insurance markets but politics, 
security, and international cooperation. 
  It is very regrettable that no agreement was reached on 
economic issues. However, President Clinton and I have 
continued our dialogue to ensure that this does not adversely 
affect overall bilateral relations and that the two countries 
handle this issue cool-headedly. 
  The report that President Clinton and I turned our faces 
away 
from each other is not true. The two of us left the meeting 
room shoulder to shoulder. The photograph recently carried in 
newspapers was taken when President Clinton looked back a little 
bit earlier than I did. 
  Frankly, it is regrettable that no agreement was reached. 
However, President Clinton and I agreed to continue 
consultations. I have continued phone consultations ever since. 
  Concerning the Super 301 provision, I expect that the United 
States will make a sensible judgment and action. It is 
unthinkable the notion that Japan will make no effort just 
because no agreement was reached on comprehensive consultations. 
Japan will make positive, substantial efforts in the future. 
We are hurriedly making efforts at cabinet meetings and on 
other occasions to map out meaningful measures before the end of 
March. [passage omitted] 
  [Choe] The North Korean nuclear issue is a matter of concern 
not only in the ROK, Japan, and the United States, but also in 
the world. In particular, by using the nuclear card, North 
Korea is trying to hold negotiations with the United States and 
Japan to establish diplomatic relations with them. How do you, 
Mr. Prime Minister, think the North Korean nuclear issue should 
be handled? And, what do you think are the prospects for 
reunification on the Korean peninsula? 
  [Hosokawa] I have serious concerns over the North Korean 
nuclear suspicions. I hope the nuclear inspections which 
started on 1 March will make smooth progress and bring clear 
results. I think the ROK, the United States, and Japan must 
cooperate among themselves, pay attention to North Korea's 
violent nature [nanpokham], and take a countermeasure [taeung] 
against it. I think it is necessary for China to positively 
have a hand in this matter. I will soon visit China. At every 
opportunity, I have expressed this hope of mine to the Chinese 
leaders and proposed that China show positive action to ensure 
that North Korea choose good approaches. 
  I think resolving the North Korean nuclear suspicions is the 
most important prerequisite for North-South reunification. If 
the North Korean nuclear issue is not resolved, I think, no 
discussion on the normalization of relations between Japan and 
North Korea can take place, and the North-South reunification 
issue cannot be resolved smoothly. Therefore, I think the 
nuclear issue, a prerequisite for reunification, must be 
resolved first of all. 
  [Choe] There is a dominant view that, after the end of the 
Cold War, the United States appeared as the sole big power in 
the Far East region. I would like to know the Japanese 
Government's stance to the newly mapped out security order in 
the Far East region. In addition, what is your opinion on voices 
expressing concerns over the revival of Japan's militarism? 
  [Hosokawa] Japan would like to make contributions to the 
peace and stability of the international community within the 
possible range on the basis of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. 
This is the basic stance of the Japanese Government toward this 
region's security. 
  Regarding the voices worrying about the revival of Japan's 
nuclear armament, I want to assure you that Japan will never 
change its attitude of only concentrating on self-defense under 
the present peace Constitution, considering the Japanese 
people's sentiment. 
  The Japanese people, who have horrible nuclear bomb 
experiences, are highly allergic to nuclear weapons. In this 
connection, the three principles on denuclearization -- not 
possessing nuclear weapons, not manufacturing nuclear weapons, 
and not bringing in nuclear weapons from overseas--have been 
passed at the Diet. Under such conditions, it is impossible for 
Japan to have nuclear weapons or become a major nuclear power. 
  [Choe] The United States is assuming a high-handed attitude 
by bringing forth the Super 301 provision. The trade war 
between the United States and Japan is also expected to have a 
great effect on the ROK. What is Japan's strategy regarding a 
countermeasure in the Japan-U.S. trade war? 
  [Hosokawa] As I have mentioned earlier, it is necessary for 
Japan and the United States to make a sensible, calm judgment 
and act upon the trade issue. I think Japan should put more 
efforts into easing regulations; further accelerate the policies 
of mutual cooperation; and promote market opening. 
  We are trying to arrive at a conclusion within March. 
However, regarding macroeconomic policies, we will probably 
need more time. But since the comprehensive economic 
consultations between Japan and the United States, which started 
last July, are made on a one-year basis, we are trying to put 
more efforts into solving various pending issues between the 
United States and Japan until the G-7 summit talks are held in 
Naples next July. Fortunately, nothing has yet been concluded 
and the issue on mobile telecommunications involving Motorola is 
entering into a phase of reaching an agreement. 
  Small problems can be solved one by one. Regarding the trade 
imbalance between Japan and the United States, Japan will make 
efforts to reduce trade surpluses sector by sector. [passage

<F P=106> [From the "Perspectives" column: "It Ain't Funny..."] </F>
  [Text] In one of these columns is a story that provides a 
quote concerning human frailty and how you might look at it. It 
is about a probe of a scandal that seems to have dominated the 
domestic media and had overflowed externally. Coming out of 
testimony, the person remarked being really encouraged to have 
participated in something where the finding of fact is 
important, as opposed to innuendo and rumor-mongering and gossip 
and sensationalism. 
  In whatever is done on a personal or other level, there has 
to be a fairly healthy respect for others even if there should 
be emotions played up to get persons embroiled. When too much 
risk is raked up, or when there is reason to believe there could 
be undue muck-raking, there is good reason to speak up. 
  In this paper yesterday, there was a piece of news that 
reflected badly on the intent behind a disclosure that the 
United States Senate had passed a bill authorizing the 
establishment of "Radio Free Asia", a broadcasting service to 
target the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, Cambodia, Myanmar [Burma], Laos, and Vietnam. 
  Concerned that such an act might harm friendly relations, 
the 
director general [D-G] of the Political Department of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs had invited the Charge d'affaires of 
the U.S. Embassy to the ministry and conveyed Myanmar's deep 
regret that such a decision had been taken. 
  The D-G pointed out that the creation of the surrogate 
broadcasting service was unjustifiable as there already existed 
a plethora of radio stations in the Asian region, even pointing 
out that our listeners are adequately served by foreign sources 
even including the Voice of America. 
  The D-G made it plain that if "Radio Free Asia" should 
become 
operational and Myanmar is targeted, it could in no way be 
considered constructive or promoting the development of good 
relations between Myanmar and the United States. 
  We would venture to add that should that radio station 
materialize and should Myanmar be targeted, we might have to 
borrow one of the American jingles and say "It ain't funny, but 
sure is corny". Let us hope we do not have to do that. We are 
equally opposed to innuendo and rumor-mongering and gossip and 
sensationalism.

  [Text] Honolulu, March 18 KYODO -- Japan's Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii on Friday [18 March] called for a cautious and 
balanced approach in liberalizing financial markets in the 
Asia-Pacific region. "Too much impatience won't be good," Fujii 
said as he arrived in Honolulu for the finance ministers meeting 
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Fujii said open financial markets are important for the 
region but policy-makers should take economic realities into 
consideration in opening up their markets. "We have to take 
into account the matter of soundness. We should proceed in a 
balanced manner," Fujii told reporters on arrival in Honolulu. 
  Fujii said he plans to talk about "the Japanese experience" 
during the two-day APEC meeting and underscore the importance of 
cooperation in the regional group. The meeting, which opens 
with an informal reception Friday evening, is expected to focus 
on ways to promote economic growth and foster the flow of 
capital in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Fujii has a series of separate meetings planned with his 
APEC 
counterparts Friday afternoon, including a bilateral session 
with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Japanese officials 
said. 
  Fujii is also scheduled to meet with Chinese Finance 
Minister 
Liu Zhongli, Australian Finance Minister Ralph Willis and 
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Ibrahim 
Anwar.

  [Text] Honolulu, March 18 KYODO -- Pacific Rim finance 
ministers kicked off a two-day conference in Hawaii on Friday 
[18 March] to look for ways to maintain the dynamic pace of 
economic growth in the region through more enlightened financial 
policies. 
  The meeting, hosted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen, marked the first attempt by the fledgling Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to tackle high finance and 
other banking issues as a backstop to economic growth. 
  U.S. Officials said the APEC ministers will stay clear of 
trade-related issues such as removing barriers to financial 
markets in Japan and other Asia-Pacific countries. "This is not 
a forum for discussing financial services issues," U.S. 
Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers said. 
  Finance ministers also appeared eager not to oversell their 
mission as they assembled at a scenic beachfront hotel for a 
series of multilateral meetings and bilateral consultations. 
Professed cooperation and friendly dialogue, rather than 
confrontation and tough rhetoric, appeared to be the order of 
the day. 
  "I don't plan to go in and twist arms and bully people 
around," Bentsen said during a stopover in Los Angeles en route 
to Honolulu. 
  Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii appeared equally 
emphatic on the need for consensus-building among the fast 
growing but diverse economies in the Asia-Pacific region. 
"Cooperation is the single most important thing for the 
economies in this region," Fujii told reporters on arrival in 
Honolulu. 
  Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said the APEC 
countries were not in Hawaii to look for specific solutions. 
  "This is the first time that we meet. We are here to 
exchange our views on economic achievements and problems and 
issues," Tsang said. 
  The issues on the agenda, Tsang and other APEC ministers 
said, center on ways to smooth capital investments and financial 
flows within the region. "We all have very different regimes on 
these matters, so it would not be a bad idea for us to share 
with others our respective strengths and weaknesses," Tsang said. 
  Prior to a daylong multilateral session among the APEC 
ministers Saturday, the ministers held an informal, 
getting-acquainted reception Friday evening that marked the 
opening of the two-day meeting. 
  The APEC ministers also took the occasion to hold a series 
of 
bilateral meetings, including a brief meeting Friday afternoon 
between Fujii and Bentsen. Fujii and Bentsen dealt mostly on 
ways to promote "a spirit of cooperation" in the APEC process, 
which Fujii presented as an example of how the two countries 
should handle their bilateral trade disputes, Japanese officials 
said. 
  APEC -- which brings together 17 member countries in the 
Asia-Pacific region -- represents the world's fastest growing 
economic region, with some economies such as China's expanding 
at close to two-digit growth rates. 
  The market potential of the region, which accounts for 50 
percent of the global output and 40 percent of worldwide trade, 
is underscored by estimates that APEC member nations will spend 
1 trillion dollars in infrastructure alone over the next 10 
years. "They need phone lines, power plants, ports, water 
treatment facilities, airports and highways," Bentsen said in 
Los Angeles in urging American businesses to "look West" -- to 
the growing markets in Asia. 
  APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, 
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua-New 
Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, 
Thailand and the United States. Chile, due to join APEC this 
fall, was also invited to the finance ministers' meeting.

  [From Hardev Kaur] 
  [Text] Honolulu, Sat.-- Japan and China said the Asia 
Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers meeting should not 
be institutionalised, a sentiment which falls in line with the 
feeling of their counterpart from ASEAN. 
  They said there was no requirement whatsoever to 
institutionalise the meeting. Their feeling on this was 
conveyed to Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister 
Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim during their bilateral discussions here 
yesterday. 
  Anwar had meetings with Chinese Finance Minister Liu 
Zhongli, 
Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury 
secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Anwar also had an informal meeting 
with his Taiwanese counterpart Chen-kuo Lin. They are all here 
to attend the APEC Finance Ministers meeting which begins today. 
  ASEAN Finance Ministers had already met on Thursday where 
they reached consensus on the matter. 
  Thursday's meeting was hosted by Thai Finance Minister Aran 
Thammano. The common ASEAN position will be presented to the 
APEC Finance Ministers today. 
  The consensus is that the APEC Finance Ministers meeting 
should not be institutionalised and that they can meet and 
discuss relevant issues during the meetings such as the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Asian 
Development Bank annual meetings. 
  They also felt that there was no need for a joint statement 
at the end of the day-long meeting and that a statement from 
Bentsen as chairman of the meeting would suffice. 
  Anwar told the Malaysian Press after his bilateral meetings 
that response to ASEAN's common position from the three 
Ministers was "positive". 
  On his discussion with Bentsen, Anwar said they also touched 
on other issues to be raised at today's meeting. Anwar said he 
was very pleased that Bentsen had asked Malaysia to take the 
lead in discussions on capital flows and capital markets, 
including the positive developments and achievements made by 
Malaysia thus far. 
  They discussed the APEC Finance Ministers' meeting and said 
that it should remain an informal meeting. If there is a need 
for a meeting next year, it could be tied to some meeting that 
"we are all already due to attend". 
  The issue of the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) was also 
raised. Anwar told Bentsen that just as Malaysia was supportive 
of some of the meetings that had been held within the context of 
APEC, an informal caucus within the East Asian context and in 
the same spirit were also desirable. 
  Anwar described Bentsen's response as being positive 
following the explanation, adding that "if it can happen in an 
informal framework within the APEC context, I see no reason why 
it cannot be supported within the EAEC context". 
  Meanwhile, Anwar said Liu was keen to exchange views on 
Malaysia's development experience. Liu suggested that a special 
session be held in China to enable an exchange of views with the 
Chinese leaders and economic planners in terms of macro planning 
and strategies for growth with low inflation when Anwar visits 
China. 
  Other issues raised included the possibility of joint 
investments between Chinese companies or subsidiaries of 
government controlled companies and some Malaysian private 
sector ventures in Malaysia and in China. 
  The Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) project was 
also discussed when Anwar met Fujii. Anwar assured him that the 
project would continue as scheduled. 
  Fujii, on his part, gave an assurance of continued support, 
including soft loan for the project and the possibility of 
continued assistance in manpower planning and expertise. 
  He also said experts for some of Malaysia's development and 
educational projects and programmes could also be made available 
if and when needed. 
  Asked about increased capital flows and arguments that these 
could complicate issues and thus the need for an institution to 
regulate these flows, Anwar said he did not think increased 
capital flows would complicate matters "but it certainly will 
boost economic growth" 
  It requires effective cooperation with other countries and 
authorities. "That is why in principle, we support the need for 
an indepth study on issues relating to capital inflows and to 
seek ways and means to effectively coordinate or cooperate even 
though it is essentially a private sector initiative," he said. 
  On whether APEC could step in for this purpose, Anwar 
pointed 
out that "it was never the intention of APEC to be a regulatory 
body and each country has its own effective regulatory framework 
for coordination with the relevant authorities".

  [Text] Honolulu, March 18 KYODO -- Malaysian Deputy Prime 
Minister Anwar Ibrahim blasted the United States Friday [18 
March] over its human rights policy toward China, accusing 
Washington of forcing its values "down the throat" of other 
countries. "To assume that we have the sole monopoly in our 
understanding of democracy and human rights constitutes a form 
of arrogance," Anwar said. 
  Anwar, who was in Honolulu for an Asia-Pacific finance 
ministers meeting, said he raised Malaysia's concern of the U.S. 
human rights policy in a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen. Anwar was particularly critical of the U.S. 
policy of linking China's human rights record to its most 
favored nation trading status in the United States. 
  Linking trade issues with human rights amounts to "forc(ing) 
down the throat of other countries to see your point of view," 
Anwar said. 
  Anwar, who serves as Malaysia's finance minister, said the 
United States should "listen a bit more" on political realities 
in other countries. When it comes to human rights, "you must 
show a lot of tolerance and understanding," Anwar said.

  [Text] Honolulu -- Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin 
provoked a dilemma of Thailand's policy planning by citing the 
needs to sustain high capital inflow and channel it to efficient 
uses, while avoiding the adverse impact of the large capital 
inflow on economic stability. 
  He was speaking last week at the unprecedented gathering of 
the finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(Apec) in Honolulu, where macroeconomic strategies, capital 
inflow and capital market development were the dominant theme 
for informal consultations. 
  Tharin indicated that stable macroeconomic environment, 
coupled with proper planning, implementation of infrastructure 
projects and resources development projects, is the most 
important factor attracting foreign capital, aside from making 
it easier to obtain external financing and assuring efficient 
uses of the fund. 
  "Encouragement of long-term over short-term funds will yield 
a more stable pattern of capital flow. 
  Sound development of domestic capital market will help 
prevent destabilizing portfolio investment," he said. 
  But Tharin warned that large capital inflows could affect 
economic stability and lead to financial volatility. 
  "In our case, these issues have not hitherto been a serious 
problem due to satisfactory macro-economic performance and 
appropriate monitoring. 
  "Our fiscal surplus has helped to reduce the impact of large 
capital inflows on monetary expansions," he noted. 
  "Meanwhile, we maintain our policy options to uphold 
stability. The authorities can choose among combinations of 
foreign exchange policy, interest rate policy, sterilization 
measures. 
  "The choice and timing depend on the prevailing 
circumstances. The ultimate goal, however, is to induce capital 
inflows." 
  Tharin also drew up Thailand's growth strategy, which has 
been based on a reliance on private sector initiatives, an 
outward looking policy and a strong emphasis on macroeconomic 
stability. 
  "Throughout our modern history, Thailand has always 
encouraged private sector investment based on market mechanism. 
Broad incentives were granted through the Board of Investment," 
he said. 
  "Although these incentives were selective in nature, they 
did 
not represent a real sectoral emphasis. 
  "Foreign direct investments have always been welcomed and 
indeed have played an important role in the industrialization 
process. 
  "Price control was a rare incident, reflecting the 
government's belief in the function of market forces," he added.

  [Text] Honolulu, March 19 KYODO -- U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen and Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii set 
aside bilateral bickerings on trade Saturday and focused their 
attention on regional issues of high finance instead. 
  The two ministers shared the same roof for two days in a 
beachside Honolulu hotel but spent most of the time conferring 
with their counterparts from the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum. No bilateral issues were taken up, 
Japanese and U.S. officials said. 
  Bentsen and Fujii met one-on-one Friday but chose to skip 
issues on bilateral trade. "We came here for the APEC meeting," 
Fujii explained. 
  Yet the shadow of trade disputes loomed every time Bentsen 
and Fujii faced reporters. 
  How would frictions in U.S.-Japan relations affect the two 
countries' efforts to build a bridge with other nations in the 
Asia-Pacific region? That was the first question Bentsen faced 
at a joint news conference after the APEC conference was over. 
  Bentsen put up an air of optimism, not only on U.S. 
frictions 
with Japan but also with China. "I am optimistic that we're 
going to work these types of concerns out," Bentsen said. 
  On Japan, Bentsen said the United States is working to see 
what can be done. 
  "We're hopeful that will work out. I think that will be for 
the betterment of all of us," Bentsen said. 
  Fujii, who stood alongside 16 APEC ministers behind Bentsen 
at the joint news conference, took no initiative to offer his 
own views on the subject. When pressed on that point at a 
separate news conference later on, Fujii again offered no fresh 
insight. 
  Fujii reiterated that the meeting in Hawaii was about APEC, 
and not on U.S.-Japan frictions. "We would like to settle 
Japan-U.S. issues in a cooperative spirit," Fujii said.

  [Text] Honolulu, March 19 KYODO -- Japan on Saturday urged 
Pacific Rim countries to put more of their income into savings, 
build up the private sector, and step up the development of 
human resources, saying this is the secret of its rapid economic 
development since World War II. 
  Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii offered the 
triple-dose prescription for economic growth at the first 
finance ministers' meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Honolulu. "With a sound 
macroeconomic policy, it is important to strengthen domestic 
savings, strengthen the private sector and improve human 
resources," Fujii told his APEC colleagues. 
  Fujii also promised Japan's financial support, both through 
bilateral and multilateral channels, to help the developing 
nations in the APEC group. 
  Japanese officials said there was strong interest among APEC 
ministers in the Japanese model of economic development. "We 
are pleased that we got this kind of attention from our APEC 
partners," one Japanese official said. 
  Fujii said Japan's high rate of capital formation has been 
backed by a high rate of savings among the Japanese people. 
Research and development done by the private sector has also 
contributed to the success of product development among Japanese 
firms, he said.

  [Text] Honolulu, March 19 KYODO -- Japanese Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii stressed Saturday [19 March] the 
importance of developing capital markets in the nations of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Fujii, speaking at a press conference after a two-day 
meeting 
of APEC finance ministers here, gave high credits to the 
gathering but reserved his comments on making it a regular one. 
"It is first necessary to create an environment that 
facilitates flow of private funds in the APEC nations which has 
become a world growth center," Fujii said. 
  In a joint statement issued at the end of the conference, 
the 
17 APEC ministers agreed to develop their capital markets and 
improve capital flows as their principles of policy formation in 
the region. Praising the first-ever gathering of the APEC 
finance ministers, Fujii said, "we were able to learn together 
with (other APEC) nations that are continuing to stage diverse 
(economic) growth." 
  Fujii confirmed that the ministers agreed to meet again next 
year in Indonesia but he showed a negative stance on holding it 
regularly. "It moves under the atmosphere at that time." 
  Meanwhile, Japanese officials quoted Fujii as saying at the 
meeting that the APEC nations must pursue "sound macroeconomic 
policy primarily to raise domestic savings to maintain high 
economic growth." They also said Fujii offered financial 
support both bilaterally and multilaterally to other APEC 
nations. 
  APEC groups the United States, Japan, Canada, China, Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, 
Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Mexico 
and Papua New Guinea. Chile was also represented at the Hawaii 
meeting as it is due to join the APEC forum this fall.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Honolulu, March 19 KYODO -- Pacific Rim finance 
ministers huddled Saturday [19 March] in Honolulu to discuss 
ways of maintaining dynamic economic growth in the region by 
removing bottlenecks of capital flows. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, host of the first 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers 
meeting, promised there will be no "arm twisting" from 
Washington. "APEC is pioneering a model of consensus-building 
which I believe we can adopt here," Bentsen said in opening 
remarks to the group's first of two closed-door discussion 
sessions Saturday. 
  The APEC ministers sat down to swap experiences of how their 
countries are promoting economic growth. The discussion came 
after spending Friday getting to know each through informal 
bilateral and multilateral contacts. 
  "Overall, there were no sharp disagreements during the 
course 
of discussion," U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers 
told reporters. Summers said there was a general consensus 
among APEC ministers of the importance of "market forces" in 
promoting economic growth and the flow of capital to developing 
countries in the region. 
  The APEC ministers were scheduled to wind up the two-day 
event with a joint press appearance Saturday afternoon where 
Bentsen was to release a "chair's summary" of their 
behind-the-door deliberations. 
  APEC, a loosely organized group set up in 1989, groups 
Japan, 
the United States, Canada and Mexico along with some of the 
world's fastest growing economies in East Asia. The 17 APEC 
members, rising to 18 with the addition of Chile this fall, 
account for half of the world's economic output and generate 1 
trillion dollars in trade among them. 
  The United States, which proposed the finance ministers 
meeting at the APEC summit held last November in Seattle, has 
sought to ease the flows of capital investment and promote more 
open financial markets in the region. 
  The fast-growing countries in the region acknowledge that 
they need a bigger inflow of foreign capital to develop their 
economic infrastructure, but are wary of pressure to open their 
financial markets at a pace they see as too fast. 
  "There is no question that we must encourage the flows of 
international capital into our countries," Indonesian Finance 
Minister Mari'e Muhammad said in a paper describing Indonesia's 
policies to promote private capital inflows. 
  Developing countries "need a temporary breathing space" to 
build their own financial service sectors, Malaysian Finance 
Minister Ibrahim Anwar told reporters. 
  There was persistent concern within among Southeast Asian 
members of the APEC group that they might be forced to conform 
against their wishes in the search for common APEC financial 
policies. "Given the diversity of our cultures, political 
systems, and economic backgrounds, we can only (accomplish APEC 
goals) through open and honest dialogue," Muhammad told his APEC 
colleagues Saturday. 
  Hong Kong, a freewheeling haven in east Asia, however, 
believes that the road to prosperity lies in less government 
intervention. "Free enterprise offers the best means of 
ensuring allocation of resources to the most efficient and 
profitable business ventures," Hong Kong's Treasury Secretary 
Donald Tsang said. 
  Tsang argued that a noninterventionist policy does not mean 
the government "just sits back and does nothing." 
  "The government must create and maintain a socioeconomic 
environment that is conducive to business growth," he said. 
  Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said financial 
markets should be open but advised his APEC colleagues that 
market opening measures should be carried out in a "balanced 
manner." "Too much impatience won't be good," Fujii said.

  [Text] Honolulu -- The 17-nation Asia-Pacific Economic 
Co-operation (APEC) forum took a major step toward increasing 
its influence over the region's economic growth yesterday, 
calling on regional finance-sector leaders to identify capital 
market development issues and set up a permanent alliance. 
  Finance ministers meeting in Honolulu agreed on four 
non-binding action plans to help mobilize needed capital for 
infrastructure development in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and China were the most vocal 
in stressing their need for private financing in infrastructure 
development. 
  The ministers also agreed to meet again next year in 
Indonesia. Their meetings will be preceded by separate meetings 
of senior finance officials, central bankers and stock market 
regulatory authorities. 
  They are to identify macro-economic and capital flow issues 
that can help sustain growth in the region. 
  The moves were announced in a joint statement issued at the 
conclusion of the precedent-setting one day meeting, which was 
lauded as a diplomatic triumph by US Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen. 
  Apec was "pioneering a model of consensus-building", he 
announced. 
  The US, the host of the Honolulu meeting, set the tone by 
agreeing at the onset not to raise the thorny issue of financial 
services market access -- an issue Asean does not want to 
discuss under the Apec forum. 
  Thai Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin expressed 
satisfaction with the outcome of the meeting, which he said is 
part of the Apec process of finding its own future. 
  Asean does not favour the institutionalization of Apec as 
proposed by the US. 
  The ministers who attended the meeting were from Australia, 
Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, 
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the US and Chile, 
which will be admitted as a full member at the end of the year. 
  In order to mobilize financing to the region, the joint 
statement said the International Monetary Fund (IMF), working 
with existing databases with the World Bank, the International 
Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will 
be asked to prepared a cross-border [as published] portfolio 
flow into and within the region. 
  ADB will be asked to host a symposium on issues and problems 
in infrastructure financing, with an emphasis on the role of the 
private sector. Apec will also encourage more contact between 
regional regulatory authorities to discuss supervisory and 
regulatory issues of common interest. 
  The finance ministers called on private finance sector 
leaders to meet to identify issues related to capital market 
development and to consider establishing a more permanent 
private sector structure. 
  Tharin said bankers and financiers of each country will be 
invited by Indonesia and the United States to meet and submit 
recommendations in 1995. 
  This private sector involvement was initiated by the US.

  [Text] Honolulu, March 19 KYODO -- The following is a joint 
statement of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum, obtained by KYODO News Service. 
  For the first time, APEC finance ministers have met to 
discuss some of the fundamental economic challenges facing the 
Asia-Pacific region: sustaining growth with low inflation, 
financing investment and infrastructure development, and 
promoting capital market development. This meeting was convened 
at the request of the APEC leaders at their Seattle meeting in 
November 1993. 
  We recognize the growing significance of overall regional 
economic performance to each member's economic well-being and to 
the health of the global economy. Ours is a region increasingly 
bound together by growing trade and investment ties. We agree 
that the following principles should guide our policy formation 
as we move toward the next century: 
  -- Sound macroeconomic policies and stability should remain 
a 
pillar of sustained, low-inflation growth in the region. 
  -- Increasing cross-border flows of goods, services and 
investment should be another pillar for strong economic 
performance in the region. 
  -- The private/business sector should continue to be the 
primary engine of growth. 
  -- Further development and integration of capital markets 
is needed for effective mobilization and allocation of 
private/business capital. 
  -- Improving the capacity to finance infrastructure 
development is necessary to address current shortages and 
inefficiencies. 
<H5>  The Financial Challenge </H5>
  Mobilizing the capital needed to finance high levels of 
private investment and infrastructure development presents a 
formidable challenge for the region. Large and growing inflows 
from external sources have been, and will continue to be, 
crucial. Capital inflows augment domestic savings, help 
diversify sources of financing, reduce the cost of capital, and 
assist in capital market development. 
  -- We will pursue policies which promote ongoing large and 
diversified inflows of foreign direct investment. Such flows 
have already made a significant contribution to accelerating 
growth. 
  -- We agree to work on increasing the contribution that 
portfolio inflows can make to regional investment, building on 
recent increases in cross-border equity and bond flows. 
  -- We shall consult on the kinds of strategies which can 
sustain capital inflows in a manner which fosters both growth 
and macroeconomic stability. 
  It will be critical to improve our capacity for mobilizing 
domestic capital to meet financing needs. 
  -- We will consult on efforts to develop and deepen banking 
sectors and domestic securities markets, including through 
effective supervision and regulation. 
  -- We will work together to promote further development of 
domestic bond markets as a key source of financing, particularly 
for large, long-term infrastructure projects. 
  -- We welcome the ongoing efforts by the International 
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the International Finance 
Corporation [IFC], and the Asian Development Bank [ADB] to 
assist development of financial markets. We urge that these 
programs be adapted and expanded as appropriate to meeting the 
changing and diverse needs of Asia-Pacific economies. 
  -- We also encourage these institutions to examine and 
disseminate successful strategies for promoting public and 
private financing of small and medium enterprises. 
  -- We recognize the need for public resources to provide for 
funding for sustainable development projects where private 
funding is not available. We therefore look forward to the 
imminent conclusion of negotiations for a general capital 
increase of the Asian Development Bank, that will embody a 
forward looking vision for the bank and make available more than 
20 billion dollars for the region. 
<H5>  Future Meetings and Consultations </H5>
  We believe that our discussions today have promoted greater 
understanding of key economic challenges facing the region. We 
are therefore looking forward to meeting again next year to 
consult on regional economic developments, economic growth 
strategies, other macroeconomic objectives, regional capital 
flows, and financial sector developments and policies. We ask 
our deputies to undertake preparations for this meeting. 
  We also ask our deputies and their central bank counterparts 
to meet jointly in late 1994 or early 1995 to discuss 
macroeconomic developments and in particular issues relating to 
the sustainability and management of the capital flows that are 
important for growth. To support that joint meeting, an ad hoc 
group of senior financial officials will meet to identify key 
factors and developments which the deputies and their central 
bank counterparts should address. 
  We believe that improvements in information flows, 
availability, and exchanges can contribute importantly to 
efforts to mobilize financing and develop capital markets. We 
therefore call for the cooperation of key players in these 
efforts in undertaking the work and consultations proposed below. 
  -- Study of regional portfolio flows: We ask the IMF, 
working with existing databases in cooperation with the World 
Bank, IFC and ADB, to prepare a study of cross-border portfolio 
flows into and within the region, providing quantitative 
measurements of the sources and destinations, as well as the 
contribution of external flows to total capital mobilized in 
securities markets. The study should be completed by the time 
of the meeting of APEC finance ministers' deputies and their 
central bank counterparts. 
  -- ADB symposium on financing infrastructure development: We 
call upon the ADB to host a symposium on issues and problems in 
infrastructure financing, with emphasis on the role of the 
private sector. Such a symposium should bring together private 
sector officials involved in finance, construction and other 
aspects of infrastructure development, with government officials 
and officials from the international financial institutions. 
  -- Regional consultations on banking sector and securities 
market supervision and regulation: We welcome and encourage 
growing contacts between regulatory authorities in member 
economies to discuss supervisory and regulatory issues of common 
interest. 
  -- Asia-Pacific financiers: We call on private financial 
sector leaders in the region to convene a meeting to identify 
issues regarding capital market development, to explore ways to 
strengthen private sector contacts, and to explore the 
possibility of establishing a more permanent private sector 
structure.

  [Excerpt] Honolulu, March 19 KYODO -- Finance ministers 
from the Asia-Pacific region Saturday [19 March] concluded a 
two-day conference with a pledge to work toward freer capital 
flow in the region. The ministers from the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum also agreed to review progress 
of their work in another joint APEC conference to be held next 
year in Indonesia. 
  "I have made numerous new friends this weekend (and) we have 
established new relationships that each of us can build on," 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in announcing the 
conclusion of the first APEC finance ministers conference. 
Bentsen, who hosted the two-day event, sounded upbeat about 
what he called a "congenial" meeting of the minds among the 18 
Pacific Rim ministers who attended the conference at a scenic 
beachside hotel on this resort island. 
  Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii also echoed 
Bentsen's 
sentiment. It is most gratifying that we are able to conclude 
the meeting in this manner, Fujii told reporters. 
  Growing tension in the U.S. trade relations with China and 
Japan did not appear to dilute the jovial, informal atmosphere 
of an outdoor joint news conference. 
  "I am optimistic to work this type of concern out," Bentsen 
said when asked about China's threatened "most-favored-nation" 
(MFN) trade status with the United States. Bentsen also said 
the U.S. is likewise "hopeful" of working out its trade disputes 
with Japan. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In view of the results so far achieved on the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's nuclear inspections of 
North Korea's facilities, North Korea is learned to have carried 
out extension work [poganggongsa] on the facilities inside the 
radiochemical laboratory since February, while replacing some 
nuclear fuel rods in the 5-megawatt reactor. 
  Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: 
  [Begin recording] According to a report to be submitted to a 
special Board of Governors' meeting on the result of the North's 
nuclear facilities inspections, it has been revealed for the 
first time that the IAEA conducted a non-destructive analysis, 
involving neutron and gamma measurement to grasp the substance 
and replacement timing of the spent fuel rods of the 5-megawatt 
reactor's spent fuel storage. 
  Regarding this, nuclear experts analyzed that when things 
are 
taken together from the recent inspection results, North Korea 
has replaced some nuclear fuel rods since last February. North 
Korea had maintained that it has not replaced the 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor's fuel rods. They said the result of the 
analysis of the nuclear fuel rod counter [kyesugi] which watches 
the movement of the spent nuclear fuel will prove this. 
  The report stressed that the continuity of the inspection 
can 
be maintained only when inspections of the 5-megawatt nuclear 
reactor are resumed after six weeks. 
  The report also revealed that an IAEA inspection team was 
restricted from making inspections -- such as extracting samples 
and wastes of nuclear materials, and measuring radioactivity -- 
from the six major facilities -- including a plutonium refinery 
facility inside the radiochemical laboratory, a nuclear waste 
storage, a reprocessing facility, and a radioactivity gas 
filtering device [kicheyogwasisol], thus hinting that North 
Korea has supplemented the indoor facilities of the reprocessing 
facility for the last year. [end recording]

  [Text] The government issues a statement in the name of 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho regarding the referral of 
the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] special Board of 
Governors meeting. It highly assessed [nopke pyongga] the 
referral, saying this reflected the international community's 
intent. 
  The government urged North Korea to dissolve the 
international community's concerns [kukche sahoeui uryorul 
pulsik sikigo] and to implement its duties by allowing nuclear 
inspections as soon as possible. 
  The government also urged that North Korea join the trend of 
the international community represented by reconciliation and 
cooperation by fulfilling its duty as a signatory of the Nuclear 
Safeguards Accord and by taking steps for easing tensions on the 
Korean peninsula and for building up trust.

  [Text] The inter-Korean working contact held in Panmunjom 
today ruptured in about 50 minutes from the start of the talks. 
  The inter-Korean working contact for the exchange of special 
envoys ruptured at 1055 [0155 GMT], less than one hour after the 
contact began. The two sides did not even set the date for the 
next contact. 
  The eighth working contact for the inter-Korean exchange of 
special envoys began with acute conflict of positions between 
the two sides. Our side, in a keynote statement, urged the 
North side to come to the working contact for envoy exchange and 
to agree on the written agreement for envoy exchange at an early 
date, and warned that the South side cannot be held responsible 
for the development of the situation henceforth due to the North 
side's rejection of nuclear inspections. Our side also strongly 
demanded that the North side immediately stop the slander and 
vilification against the person in our highest authority and 
cease antigovernment agitations. 
  At this, the North side attributed the failure to realize 
the 
envoy exchange to the South side's attitude and claimed that the 
four demands the North side has put forward are completely 
justified in view of the prevailing situation. The North side 
said that it cannot but gravely regard the South side's leading 
the inter-Korean relations to a phase of confrontation, and 
threatened that conflict arising therefrom will lead to war. 
  The North side said that it will respond to dialogue with 
dialogue and to war with war and that it is prepared to take all 
necessary steps, and declared that if the South side wishes to 
part from the North, the South side should clearly say so.

  [Text] Seoul, March 19 KYODO -- The eighth round of 
working- level talks to discuss procedures for an inter-Korean 
exchange of special envoys between Seoul and Pyongyang broke 
down Saturday [19 March], government officials said. 
  The 55-minute meeting at the truce border village of 
Panmunjom ended without setting a date for the next round of 
talks. The talks collapsed with North Korean negotiators 
walking away from the dialogue table, the officials said. 
  The South Korean side urged North Korea to drop 
"unreasonable" demands and show sincerity in its attitude to 
make improvements in working through differences over procedural 
matters, they said. 
  Song Chung-tae, the chief South Korean delegate to the 
inter-Korean dialogue, sounded out a tough warning that the 
nuclear issue is entering a critical phase, with the 
international community considering punitive actions at some 
point. 
  "Time is quickly running out and it is hard to tell what 
ominous consequences North Korea's recalcitrance on the nuclear 
issue will bring about," Song said. 
  In response to Song's remarks, his northern counterpart Pak 
Yong-su raised his country's earlier demands and accused South 
Korea of using the inter-Korean contact as a way to scuttle 
high-level talks between the United States and North Korea. 
  Pak blamed South Korean's uncooperative acts for failing to 
make significant progress in the inter-Korean dialogue for an 
exchange of special envoys.

  [Text] Panmunjom, South Korea, March 19 (YONHAP) -- 
Inter-Korean talks on exchanging special envoys broke down in 
the truce village on Saturday after the North Korean delegation 
walked out of the meeting room. 
  In the eighth round of inter-Korean dialogue, which opened 
in 
the Southern side's peace house at 10 AM, the South urged the 
North to agree to an immediate exchange of special envoys, 
noting that the envoy negotiations are merely marking time 
because of Pyongyang's "insincere attitude toward the contacts." 
  In response, the North Korean delegation abruptly walked out 
55 minutes after the meeting opened, leaving a cloud of 
uncertainty hanging over possible meetings in the near future. 
  Chief South Korean delegate Song Yong-tae, accusing the 
North 
of hampering the envoy exchange by making four "unjustified" 
demands since the contacts started last October, requested that 
Pyongyang focus on procedural matters related to the exchange 
and discard all unrelated issues. 
  North Korea's refusal to allow full inspection of a key 
radiochemical laboratory, believed to be a nuclear fuel 
reprocessing facility in violation of an agreement with the 
United States made in February, has aggravated the situation, he 
noted. "We've not much time left for negotiations and we can't 
say what will happen if the nuclear issue is not resolved 
immediately." 
  Song then urged his North Korean counterpart Pak Yong-su to 
agree to a proposal on procedures for an envoy exchange made by 
the South at a previous meeting. 
  Pak, saying recent developments have justified the four 
demands made at previous meetings, claimed the South is using 
inter-Korean dialogue to impede the third round of North 
Korea-U.S. talks. 
  "We can't help taking serious note of the South's attempt to 
break this working-level contact and hinder an envoy exchange 
while creating a new North-South confrontation," North Korea's 
chief delegate said. 
  "This confrontation will eventually lead to a collision and 
further to a war. We're fully prepared to meet any challenge, a 
word with a word and a weapon with a weapon." 
  Song then demanded that the North immediately stop 
slandering 
President Kim Yong-sam and instigating the South Korean people 
to struggle against the government, while expressing Seoul's 
determination to realize the proposed envoy exchange to resolve 
the nuclear issue.

fire should be controlled by fire. We do not want war but will 
never shun your side's insisting on a war. We are also ready to 
react [taehang]. However, Mr. Song, your side has to deeply 
consider the dear price of the war. Seoul is not far from here. 
If a war breaks out, it will be a sea of fire. Mr. Song, it 
will probably be difficult for you to survive. 
  [Song Yong-tae] What are you talking about? 
  [Pak] Wait, therefore... 
  [Song] Then, do you think we will just sit back? 
  [Pak] Regarding this, you have to deeply consider things. 
  [Song] Are you declaring a war? 
  [Pak] I am telling you that your side declared a war. Are 
you listening? Did you take a nap? 
  [Song] What? Respond to war with war? 
  [Pak] That's right. Clearly. 
  [Song] Why do you talk about war at the place of talks? 
  [Pak] Because your side declared a war. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report on 19 Mar interview with Song Yong-tae, vice </F>
minister of the National Unification Board, NUB, and head of the 
ROK delegation to the North-South working-level contacts, by an 
unidentified reporter--place not given] 
  [Text] Song Yong-tae, NUB vice minister and senior 
delegate of the South side to North-South working-level contact, 
on 19 March stressed that "the three-point demands presented by 
the South side during the recent contact, including the 
discontinuation of slander and defamation of the person in the 
highest authority in the ROK, were the expression of a resolute 
position showing that the South side's perseverance with unjust 
demands that the North side put forward during the past contacts 
has reached its limit." 
  Vice Minister Song said that as long as North Korea fails to 
show its clear attitude toward our three-point demands, the 
South side will not go to dialogue. 
  [Reporter] What were the results of today's talks? 
  [Song Yong-tae] In a keynote speech, our side expressed 
regret for the fact that North Korea refused to allow the 
inspection of the radiochemical laboratory, which has been 
suspected of being a nuclear reprocessing facility, not keeping 
its pledge made with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA], and that the international situation surrounding the 
North Korean nuclear issue has reached a serious phase. 
  To this, the North Korean side again raised its four-point 
demands, and even demanded that our side clearly express its 
attitude regarding these demands. Moreover, the North Korean 
side demanded that we admit the fact that we used the 
working-level contact for rupturing North Korea-U.S. talks and 
that we apologize for this. Besides, the North side said that 
it regards as grave the the South side's act of leading 
North-South relations to a phase of confrontation, and 
unhesitatingly made radical remarks that it is ready to respond 
to dialogue with dialogue and to war with war. 
  Our side strongly called on the North side to take practical 
steps to respond to our three-point demands, including immediate 
discontinuation of slander and defamation of our side's person 
in highest authority, in order to smoothly realize the exchange 
of special envoys and to improve North-South relations. 
  A very vehement debate took place between us in the contact 
over our side's three-point demands and the North side's 
four-point demands, and the talk was finally ruptured. 
Moreover, the North side refused to agree on the date of next 
contact, and simply walked out of the room without shaking hands 
with us. 
  [Reporter] Do you think that the exchange of the special 
envoy is completely nullified? 
  [Song] There is no change in our basic position that we 
resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. We will keep the 
door open for dialogue. However, we will come to the table of 
dialogue with firm principles and with a dignified attitude, not 
in haste. We will watch the special meeting of the IAEA Board 
of Governors. We believe that our efforts for the international 
cooperative system are more important than ever before. 
  [Reporter] What are the countermeasures of the government at 
present? 
  [Song] The government is reviewing all possible, many-sided 
measures to cope with all predictable situations. 
  [Reporter] We heard that the North side made remarks about 
war and so forth during the talks. 
  [Song] When the issue of international sanctions was put 
forward, the North side unhesitatingly made such provocative and 
radical remarks as "Seoul is not far from here," "Seoul will 
become a sea of fire," and so forth. We need to prepare 
ourselves for any situation that may possibly occur before us in 
the future. 
  [Reporter] What was the North side's reaction to the 
proposal for designating the date of next contact? 
  [Song] The North side claimed that if their demands are not 
met, the talks are unnecessary. 
  [Reporter] Would the view that the talks will not be held 
for a considerable period of time be right? 
  [Song] As the situation changes every day, we will watch the 
developments for the time being. 
  [Reporter] What do you think the true intention of the North 
side in rupturing the talks is? 
  [Song] It is not appropriate for me, a delegate to the 
talks, to comment on this. What I can say at this point is that 
when the nuclear inspection is incomplete, the North side seems 
to barely expect that a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks 
will be held, and that under the situation in which the 
effectiveness of its nuclear card, which is related to the 
survival of its system, is being gradually weakened, North Korea 
is trying to prevent such a situation.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea warned North 
Korea on Monday that if it chooses a road other than dialogue, 
the South will react with full strength. 
  Song Yong-tae, the South's chief delegate to the 
just-suspended inter-Korean working-level talks, said in a 
statement that Seoul remains committed to resolving the North 
Korean nuclear dispute peacefully. 
  "The door to dialogue remains open. We strongly urge the 
North to return to a sincere and rightful posture and respond 
favorably to efforts to resume South-North dialogue, aware of 
the internal and external conditions that exist," Song said. 
  He said North Korea was amply demonstrating its bellicosity 
by resorting to Cold-War-type actions that fan confusion in the 
South, trying to subvert the South's system by slandering its 
top leader and agitating South Koreans to struggle against their 
government. 
  Song said that if Pyongyang is truly interested in holding 
talks with the United States, it should be more sincere in 
respecting international order and realizing the proposed 
exchange of special envoys. 
  He noted that the South had time and again shown its 
willingness to help the North improve relations with Seoul's 
allies if Pyongyang worked to resolve the nuclear issue. 
  North Korea is trying to blame the South for the recent 
breakdown of working-level talks in an attempt to escape 
international suspicions about its nuclear program, Song said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang has sharply 
criticized Seoul for the rupture of inter-Korean talks on 
exchanging special envoys, saying the South would face "a curse 
and collapse for driving the state of affairs into a war 
situation." 
  In a statement issued Monday [21 March] on the breakdown of 
the eighth round of working-level talks at the weekend, the 
North Korean delegation said it had done everything possible to 
ensure the negotiations' success since offering to exchange 
special envoys last may, radio Pyongyang reported. 
  But the South hindered the cross-visits by erecting 
artificial barriers and the proposed exchange "now faces a grave 
crisis," the report quoted the statement as saying. 
  "While the dialogue was under way, the South took reckless 
actions threatening its dialogue partner, such as the 
maintenance of international cooperation (in dealing with the 
North Korean nuclear issue), war games including the Team Spirit 
military exercise with the United States and an attempt to 
deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles." 
  On the hard-line measures being considered by Seoul after 
the 
breakdown of inter-Korean dialogue, the statement called them 
"de facto declarations on destroying and renouncing the special 
envoy exchange and on an all-out confrontation." 
  It went on to say, "the measures have revealed the South's 
hidden schemes to make use of the inter-Korean dialogue in 
applying a brake to the North Korea-U.S. talks and to cease 
relations with the North, while driving the North-South 
relationship into a situation of confrontation and war." 
  "We will take note of the chief South Korean delegate's 
public statement that the South will no longer talk with the 
North," it added.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea announced 
Monday that it has no choice but to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) should the United States resume 
the Team Spirit military exercise, and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) further distort the results of inspections 
of North Korean nuclear sites and thus expand its "impartiality." 
  A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement monitored by 
NAEWOE 
press here said Pyongyang would not send a delegation to the 
third high-level meeting with the United States slated for 
Monday (Washington time). 
  "North Korea would find no other way but to translate into 
action the measures which were pronounced in its statement on 
March 12 (on withdrawal from the NPT) in order to defend the 
nation's right to independence and the security of the country" 
should the United States avoid high-level talks and resume Team 
Spirit, and the IAEA distort inspection results and expand 
impartiality, thereby stepping up its high-handedness and 
pressure on Pyongyang, NAEWOE, South Korea's observer of North 
Korean affairs, quoted the statement as saying. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, aired by the 
North Korean Central Broadcasting station and Radio Pyongyang, 
said North Korea would no longer feel obligated to guarantee the 
continuity of nuclear safeguards.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has started 
working on measures to be taken against North Korea on a 
step-by- step basis in view of the need to overhaul its North 
Korea policy in the wake of Pyongyang's refusal to undergo full 
international inspections of its nuclear facilities and the 
rupture of inter-Korean talks. 
  Under the measures, the government will consult with 
Washington about when the conditionally-suspended "Team Spirit" 
military exercise with the United States should resume, while 
strengthening cooperation with Washington in pressing 
continuously for full International Atomic energy agency (IAEA) 
inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities. 
  On Monday, President Kim Yong-sam called a meeting of 
security- related ministers to discuss measures against North 
Korea's open threat of war and examine the defense system in the 
face of the North's provocation of war. 
  Regarding the North's threat to pull out of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the government decided to 
cooperate [as received] the United States and other friendly 
nations, as well as with the IAEA, in taking countermeasures for 
such a threat, seeing the need for hardline measures against the 
North. 
  It was also decided that during his state visits to Japan 
and 
China in the last week of March, President Kim should explain to 
the Japanese and Chinese leaders about the need for gradual 
steps of action against North Korea, such as re-asking North 
Korea to accept additional IAEA inspections, warning of UN 
sactions and imposing the sactions, and ask for their 
cooperation in this action. 
  President Kim, noting the North Korean nuclear issue has 
reached a critical point of its development attracting the 
attention of not only the Korean people but also of many nations 
of the world, said he had called the meeting to have an in-depth 
discussion of the matter. 
  National Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok said the 
government 
would keep the door of dialogue open to the North, while waiting 
for change in the North's position on inter-Korean dialogue with 
a firm principle and policy in dealing with the North. 
  He thus suggested the government would suspend inter-Korean 
dialogue until the North changes its position. 
  Also attending the meeting were Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Agency for National 
Security Planning Director Kim Tok. 
  It was decided at the meeting to strengthen the defense 
posture, including strengthening the early warning network, 
during Kim's visits to Japan and China. 
  The policy of continuing diplomatic efforts to solve the 
North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue until the United 
Nations takes sanctions against North Korea was confirmed at the 
meeting.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang on Monday urged relevant government offices to check 
again their policies toward North Korea and try to strengthen 
the nation's security preparedness flawlessly. 
  "The administration should try to establish a total security 
posture by working out new steps to enhance the people's 
security senses which have somewhat been loosened due to the 
dialogue in the past," Yi said. 
  Yi's press secretary Kang Hyong-sok said the prime minister 
made the remarks while presiding over a cabinet session. 
  Kang quoted the premier as saying that the recent North 
Korean utterances that "we will not hesitate to come to war...," 
serve as an occasion for the South to re-establish the direction 
of its stand toward the South-North dialogue and the nuclear 
issue. 
  Premier Yi also called for detailed plans to ensure 
uninterrupted function of public facilities in emergency. 
  "The prime minister asked the defense and public peace 
authorities to be fully vigilant so that there will be no 
contingency especially during President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming 
visits to Japan and China," Kang said.

  [Text] Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and minister of 
the National Unification Board, released a statement to the 
North this afternoon in connection with the breakup [kyollyol] 
of the eighth North-South working-level contact. In the 
statement, he said that North Korea's unilateral breakup of the 
working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys is an 
act of turning a blind eye to our efforts for dialogue for the 
resolution of the nuclear issue and the international efforts 
toward that end and that it is unacceptable and cannot be 
justified with any excuse. 
  In today's statement, Deputy Prime Minister Yi also said 
that 
contrary to our patient efforts, North Korea had consistently 
maintained an attitude of delaying or avoiding the adoption of 
the agreement for the exchange of special envoys and gone, 
finally, so far as to reject the contact itself, stating that it 
does not hesitate to wage a war. He also said that North Korea 
had been leading the situation to a serious phase. 
  He added that our position to peacefully resolve the nuclear 
issue remained unchanged and that the government would explore 
all means possible, while maintaining close international 
cooperation to resolve the nuclear issue. 
  He also urged North Korea to be keenly aware of the 
situation 
facing it at home and abroad at present and assume a correct 
attitude at an early date to resume the dialogue to resolve the 
nuclear issue.

  [Text] Seoul, March 19 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States agreed to push forward additional International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and inter-Korean 
exchange of special envoys, but refer the nuclear issue to the 
United Nations Security Council and hold the 1994 bilateral 
military exercise, "Team Spirit", if North Korea refuses to meet 
any of the two prerequisites, ruling Democratic Party (DP) chief 
policymaker Yi Se-ki said Saturday. 
  Yi said he was told by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu over 
the 
telephone that Han and his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher 
coordinated their position over the phone a day earlier. 
  If Pyongyang refuses any either of additional IAEA 
inspection 
or inter-Korean envoy exchange, the third-round high-level talks 
with Washington cannot take place and Team Spirit will be held 
this year, Han was quoted as saying. 
  Under such circumstance, North Korean nuclear problem will 
be 
inevitably referred to the Security Council, which likely will 
create tension in the Korean peninsula, Han told Yi. But Seoul 
and Washington will make efforts to persuade Pyongyang in 
agreeing to extra IAEA inspections and continue inter-Korean 
dialogue to realize envoy exchange, Han said. "It now looks like 
the (North Korean nuclear) problem has returned to the starting 
point and all channels blocked, but in the long run, there is 
room for hope if we continue dialogue," Han was quoted as saying. 
  Through dialogue efforts in the past year, North Korea has 
lost sympathy from the international community and Seoul and 
Washington have obtained sufficient grounds to persuade China to 
follow their steps in regards to possible decision by the 
Security Council, he said. 
  The government and DLP [Democratic Liberal Party] will meet 
next week to discuss the North Korean nuclear problem.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- "If war breaks out, 
Seoul will turn into a sea of fire!" 
  These vicious words spat out by the chief North Korean 
delegate to the inter-Korean working-level contact last Saturday 
stunned even those South Koreans who have become inured to 
violent language from the North. 
  As the full weight of North Korea's statement and other 
harsh 
remarks sank in, Seoul government officials and politicians 
scurried in search of countermeasures. 
  Both the ruling and opposition parties held official 
meetings 
Monday to condemn North Korea's statement and urge Pyongyang 
once again to continue inter-Korean dialogue. 
  At a meeting of Democratic Liberal Party postholders, almost 
everybody took up the "sea-of-fire" remark and pressed the 
government to map out and pursue a consistent North Korea policy. 
  DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil said, "The North Korean nuclear 
problem is indeed very serious, but it appears many South 
Koreans appear to be little concerned." 
  "There are still people in the South who insist on holding 
behind-the-scenes talks with the North," Kim Chong-pil said. 
"However, we will have to wake up from such illusion and prepare 
to meet the situation quietly but strongly with firm resolution." 
  Rep. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP Policy Committee, noted 
past criticism that the Seoul government has been too optimistic 
about the North Korean nuclear issue and too dependent on the 
United States. 
  "There has also been criticism that the government lacks a 
consistent North Korea policy," Yi said. 
  The ruling party, he added, has been reviewing the 
government 
policy on North Korea and urging President Kim Yong-sam's 
administration to deal squarely with the latest developments. 
  Rep. Yi Han-tong, DLP floor leader at the National Assembly, 
said he plans to confer with the party leadership on a move to 
convene the foreign affairs and national unification committee 
to work out measures on the parliamentary level. 
  Rep. So Su-chong called on the military to take urgent steps 
in order to dispel the anxiety felt by ordinary citizens. 
  DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong said in a statement that the 
remark 
about "the sea of fire, which is practically a declaration of 
war, debased the dignity of South Koreans." 
  "We condemn North Korea for making such violent remarks, 
threatening war and inciting riots in South Korea," ha said. 
"The North Korean remarks are anti-Korean people and an 
anti-unification action." 
  Seoul should keep open a dialogue channel with Pyongyang, 
but 
it will have to maintain a firm and resolute position in its 
negotiations with the North, Ha said. 
  The main opposition Democratic Party reacted strongly to the 
North Korean threat, while at the same time urging the Seoul and 
Washington governments to continue serious efforts to engage in 
dialogue. 
  The DP held a supreme council meeting Monday morning and 
decided to demand an emergency meeting of the foreign affairs 
and national unification committee to hear a government report 
on the issue. 
  In a special statement, adopted at Monday's meeting, the 
party declared that "there should be no war under any 
circumstances." It expressed regret over the North Korean threat 
of warfare which, it said, had shocked peace-loving South 
Koreans as well as all other people in the world. 
  "North Korea has to accept IAEA inspections of its nuclear 
facilities," the statement said. 
  "It also is not proper for the United States to make a hasty 
decision on the resumption of the Team Spirit military exercise 
and a possible deployment of Patriot anti-missile missiles," the 
DP statement said. 
  It asserted that the oppostion party opposes any 
confrontation or heightening of tension on the Korean peninsula. 
Instead, South and North Korea and the United States must 
continue to talk in order to break the nuclear impasse. 
  The minor opposition United People's Party said it strongly 
condemns North Korea for rupturing inter-Korean dialogue and 
threatening to turn Seoul into a sea of fire. 
  In a statement read by spokesman Kim Su-il, the party called 
on North Korea to go with the changing current in the world.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton sent a personal letter to South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam Monday, reaffirming the United States' commitment to 
defending South Korea as the North Korean nuclear dispute took a 
turn for the worse, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. 
  Kim received the letter from U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James 
Laney, who visited the president at Chongwadae [presidential 
offices] Monday morning shortly before Kim convened a meeting of 
security-related ministers, Chu said. 
  In his letter, Clinton told Kim that the United States has 
the will and determination to honor its commitment to defend 
South Korea against any aggression or provocation. 
  In order to do so, America will strengthen the joint 
U.S.-South Korean defense posture, Clinton said. 
  Clinton also reaffirmed that the United States will carry 
out 
the security agreement reached with President Kim when the two 
leaders met in Washington last November. 
  Since North Korea has not been sincere in allowing outside 
inspection of its nuclear facilities and in its dialogue with 
the South, the Korean peninsula and the world have reached the 
point where peace and stability are seriously threatened, 
Clinton said. 
  The U.S. President proposed that Washington and Seoul 
continue strengthening close consultation between the two sides 
while maintaining their basic position calling for a peaceful 
resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, Chu said. 
  In spite of North Korea's attempts to drive a wedge between 
Seoul and Washington, the United States will never allow any 
such maneuvering to harm its relationship with South Korea, 
Clinton noted. 
  The United States will deal firmly with any North Korean 
moves, Clinton said, and will honor its pledge to defend South 
Korea under any circumstances.

<F P=106> [Article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Chong-yon: </F>
"U.S. View on North Korea"] 
  [Text] Since the working-level contact between the North 
and South Korea held in Panmunjom on 19 March for the exchange 
of special envoys was ruptured due to the North Korean side's 
rejection of negotiations, the call for hardline measures 
against North Korea which prevailed within the United States 
after the nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] has become more fierce. Since the assessment was 
put forward last week noting that the result of the IAEA's 
nuclear inspection of North Korea is not satisfactory, an 
alarming [simsangchi anta] and heated atmosphere began to take 
place within the United States. 
  In particular, as the IAEA notified the United States that 
it 
is going to convene a special meeting of its Board of Governors 
on 21 March to deal with the inspection of North Korean nuclear 
facilities by its inspection team, the United States, through a 
statement by the Department of State, revealed the possibility 
of the postponement or cancellation of the third round of North 
Korea-U.S. high-level talks slated for 21 March. 
  The U.S. Department of Defense also announced that it will 
discuss the issue of immediately resuming the ROK-U.S. joint 
military exercise by pointing out that the preconditions for the 
suspension of Team Spirit are the nuclear inspection and 
North-South high-level talks. 
  Realizing the seriousness of the situation, the White House 
reportedly plans to hold an emergency high-level meeting soon 
with participation by secretaries of state and defense, as well 
as assistants for security affairs. Meanwhile, President 
Clinton said that if North Korea does not accept complete 
nuclear inspection promptly, resumption of the ROK-U.S. joint 
military exercise and deployment of Patriot missiles to U.S. 
Forces Korea would be the means of choice. 
  Thus, a hardline trend against North Korea has been created 
within the United States since it was confirmed that the 
inspection activities of the IAEA inspection team were 
restricted by the North Korean authorities. 
  In particular, an unprecedentedly strong hardline air 
regarding North Korean problems is prevailing in the U.S. 
Congress. At present, the hawk faction regarding policy toward 
North Korea constitutes the main force both in the U.S. House of 
Representatives and the Senate. 
  It is a reality that the hardline stance against North Korea 
is becoming more fierce not only within the U.S. Congress but 
also in the Department of Defense whose hardline conservative 
nature has been traditionally strong. 
  In addition, the U.S. CIA is supplying various hawk faction 
members with intelligence materials that serve as the basis of 
the hardline stance against North Korea. 
  As a result of a hardline stance becoming superior, the 
position of the U.S. Department of State, which is the only 
organization within the Clinton administration calling for a 
solution of problems pertaining to North Korea through dialogue, 
has been weakened to a considerable extent. Up until 18 March, 
U.S. Secretary of State Christopher stressed that "nothing has 
been decided regarding the resumption of the Team Spirit 
exercise and a channel should be open for dialogue with North 
Korea even while working out measures for sanctions against it." 
  However, under the present situation in which the 
much-expected exchange of special envoys between the North and 
the South has clearly gone across the river, such an allegation 
for diplomatic solution by the State Department is being melted 
away [pichul ilta]. Therefore, it can be said that the North 
Korean nuclear issue is at a turning point from the U.S. 
argument between hardline and moderate factions into the phase 
of international sanctions.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 20 
March ROK vernacular newspapers comments on the breakup of the 
19 March North-South contact of working-level delegates for the 
exchange of special envoys. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries a 1,000-word article on 
page 3 by reporter Pak Tu-sik entitled "Prospects of North-South 
Relations." The article first says that the "breakup of the 
contact was predicted from the beginning" and that North Korea's 
assertion that it would "respond to war with war" will result in 
"fierce confrontation" between the North and South in the 
international arena. 
  The article goes on to say that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency will "definitely" refer the North Korean nuclear 
issue to the UN Security Council, adding that this means that 
the conflict over the North Korean nuclear issue is now 
"entering into a `phase of sanctions' from a `phase of 
dialogue.'" 
  The article states that there is a "very slim possibility" 
that North Korea will change its attitude. It adds: "The 
hibernation of North-South relations or North-South 
confrontation can be indefinitely prolonged beyond our 
imagination." 
  CHOSON ILBO also carries a 1,000-word editorial on page 3 
entitled "Policy Toward North Korea Must Be Fundamentally 
Reexamined." The editorial first says that the breakup of the 
contact again proved that North Korea's view on South Korea has 
not changed, and it adds: "It is time we map out a new policy 
toward North Korea based on a `correct view on North Korea.' We 
must no longer cling to the exchange of special envoys or summit 
talks. Rather, until North Korea requests an exchange of special 
envoys and summit talks both in name and reality, we must beef 
up our capabilities to handle domestic and foreign problems and 
build a generally acknowledged legitimate political system on 
the Korean peninsula. This is a shortcut to reunification." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries a 1,000-word editorial 
entitled "North Korea Acts Recklessly." The editorial first 
expresses its regret over North Korea's breakup of the contact 
and says that the "principle is that the North Korean nuclear 
issue must be referred to the UN Security Council to make North 
Korea fulfill its obligations under international law." The 
editorial goes on to say: "If the North Korean nuclear issue is 
referred to the UN Security Council, this means the issue will 
be a matter to be decided by the United Nations. And, then, not 
only we but the United States will have no choice but to follow 
any decision of the international organization. If we step back 
and hesitate at such a time, the international alliance 
[kukchejogin kongjocheje] will break up. We must further 
consolidate the international alliance." 
  The editorial also says: "We must strengthen ROK-U.S. 
relations and renew relations of close cooperation between our 
two countries. We hope the United States will again stress 
President Clinton's commitment that any aggression against the 
ROK will be considered to be an aggression against the United 
States." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries a 1,000-word 
editorial 
entitled "Threatening To `Turn Seoul Into a Sea of Fire.'" 
  The editorial says that "it is time the government boldly 
revise its policy toward North Korea," And it adds: "It is 
necessary to further strengthen the international alliance to 
ensure that North Korea receives another round of inspection." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries an 800-word 
editorial 
entitled "Like a Thief Turning on the Victim." 
  The editorial first says that North Korea must know it "will 
not be safe either, and will meet its end if it provokes a war." 
The editorial then asks the ROK Government to "revise its 
policy toward North Korea," "resume the Team Spirit exercise," 
and "positively examine the deployment of Patriot missiles" 
because the contact for the exchange of special envoys broke up. 
The editorial concludes by saying that the "North Korean 
authorities must know that unless the nuclear issue is resolved, 
not only its economy but also its system will collapse." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 1,200-word 
article 
by reporter Kang Tae-ho entitled "Prospects of Relations Between 
North and South Korea, Which Parted With Each Other With No 
Promise To Meet Again." The article first says that the breakup 
of the North- South contact for the exchange of special envoys 
means the "loss of the only remaining channel of dialogue." 
After describing in detail the remarks by North and South Korea 
at the contact, the article says that it will be difficult for 
the time being to find an "way out" from the North-South 
deadlock and that North and South Korea will "go separate ways." 
That is, South Korea will resume the Team Spirit exercise and 
North Korea will reject another round of inspection.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 19 March 
carry editorials commenting on how the ROK Government should 
deal with North Korea regarding the nuclear issue in the wake of 
the announcement by the International Atomic Energy Agency that 
its inspection team was unable to satisfactorily inspect the 
North Korean nuclear facilities between 3 and 14 March because 
of North Korea's uncooperative attitude. The editorials note 
the little progress made in the inter-Korean working delegates' 
contact for the exchange of special envoys, and the possible 
cancellation of the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level 
talks. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "The Policy Toward the North Should Be 
Reviewed." The editorial begins, "It is undeniable that there 
have been two positions, dovish and hawkish, over the ways to 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. This was the case in 
the ROK as well as in the United States. Both the ROK and the 
U.S. Governments have so far maintained the dovish position 
exploring a solution through dialogue and diplomatic efforts. 
We admit that this dovish line has attained a degree of 
success." The editorial then notes, "However, the doves 
overlooked an important fact. It resulted from their distorted 
view that dealing with the issue in a hawkish manner was like 
not hesitating to wage a war. They should have admitted earlier 
that the hawkish position is aimed at the same objective, 
namely, a peaceful settlement. To preserve peace, we must make 
clear our firm position of resolutely dealing with any threat of 
war. This is all the more so especially when we deal with North 
Korea." The editorial notes, "The ROK even took a negative 
position as to the plan to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK on 
the grounds that it could hurt the dialogue atmosphere, thus 
suffering an estrangement in ROK-U.S. relations. Now it is time 
to make a change," and concludes, "It seems that we have no more 
carrot to give. It is up to North Korea to make a choice." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "It Is Time To Reestablish Policy Toward the 
North." The editorial notes, "The time has reached a point 
where we can no longer tolerate the North Korean attitude of 
breaking promises, its delaying and avoiding tactics. We should 
now reconfirm clear principles and reestablish our position. In 
case North Korea rejects full nuclear inspection and the envoy 
exchange, we should make clear our position as to the 
consideration of resumption of the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles, and sanctions 
on North Korea. We should also consider the suspension of 
inter-Korean economic cooperation, including the ongoing 
unofficial inter-Korean trade." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a 
900-word 
editorial entitled "The Nuclear Inspection of North Korean 
Facilities and the Government's Measures." The editorial says, 
"The government should maintain a firm policy and continue to 
persuade North Korea since the situation is expected to worsen 
if the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security 
Council. North Korea, for its part, should now review its 
strategy of negotiation with the United States and South Korea. 
Irrespective of North Korea's basic strategy, the North Korean 
attitude is narrowing the gap for negotiation of the dialogue 
advocates in South Korea and the United States and is 
encouraging the voice of those who oppose dialogue."

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Hyon-ik] </F>
  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam on 21 March called an urgent 
meeting of security-related ministers and discussed the crisis 
situation on the Korean peninsula created by the North Korean 
threat of war and its rejection of nuclear inspection, and 
decided an early deployment of Patriot missiles and the 
resumption of the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise. 
  The meeting discussed the analyses of the present situation 
by the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], the National 
Unification Board [NUB], the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry 
of National Defense [MND], and discussed measures to cope with 
the situation. The meeting analyzed that there is little 
likelihood of North Korea making actual armed provocation, but 
decided to formulate preparatory measures for all the potential 
developments, including the North Korean armed provocation 
against the South. 
  At the meeting President Kim stressed that the ROK should 
defend peace on the Korean peninsula and that the ROK is capable 
of doing it, and requested the participants in the meeting to 
take all necessary measures to establish the posture to cope 
with any contingency. 
  The meeting assessed that North Korea will keep up even 
steeper tensions on the Korean peninsula in the short run, and 
decided to have an unidentified number of Patriot missiles 
deployed soon and get the Team Spirit joint military exercise 
resumed in April. The meeting also extensively discussed ways 
to build up the ROK-U.S. combined defense capability. 
  Initially the meeting was supposed to decide the timing of 
the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise watching North 
Korea's attitude, but since "even tougher steps," such as the 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and 
replacing fuel rods, can be taken by North Korea, the meeting 
concluded that the Team Spirit exercise has to be conducted in 
April. 
  The meeting concluded that in view of the North Korean 
side's 
attitude of rupturing the envoy exchange on 19 March, the inter- 
Korean dialogue will have to be suspended for the time being, 
and confirmed the principle that the ROK will intensify 
international alliances by such means as participating in 
international sanctions by the IAEA and the UN Security Council. 
  The meeting decided that the ROK will closely cooperate with 
Japan and China to this end and that President Kim will take the 
matter up intensively during his visit to Japan and China. 
  The meeting decided that the ROK will explain to 
China--which 
is persistently advocating its principled position that the 
North Korean nuclear issue should be resolved peacefully--that 
international sanctions are unavoidable for peace and security 
in Northeast Asia. The meeting decided to request China to 
persuade North Korea in this connection. 
  The meeting also agreed that international sanctions will be 
reconsidered if North Korea admits its mistake, completely 
permits the IAEA inspections, thereby ensuring the nuclear 
transparency, and sincerely comes to the inter-Korean dialogue 
for envoy exchange, before the UN Security Council decides 
sanctions. 
  The meeting, however, on the basis of its reflection that 
the 
appeasement policy toward the North brought about the North 
Korean insincerity and misjudgment, decided that the ROK will 
maintain a resolute position. 
  President Kim noted that North Korea intends to take 
advantage of the crisis atmosphere inspired by its raving about 
not hesitating a war despite the extreme economic difficulty it 
is suffering, and instructed the participants in the meeting to 
establish a military posture of countermeasures and to intensify 
public information activity for the people to prevent the people 
from turning restless. 
  Participating in the security-related ministers meeting held 
for the second time at Chongwadae [presidential residence] this 
year were Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang; Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime 
minister and minister of the NUB; Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu; 
Minister of Home Affairs Choe Hyong-u; Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae; NSP Director Kim Tok; Chon Yong-taek, director of 
contingency plans; Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff; Pak Kwan-yong, secretary general of the Presidential 
Secretariat; Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for 
foreign and national security affairs; and Chu Ton-sik, 
presidential spokesman.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States plan to deploy Patriot missiles at American 
military bases in April, a well-placed source said Monday. 
  The two countries, while emphasizing that they can hold the 
annual joint military drill "Team Spirit" anytime, will wait a 
while before making a final decision on whether and when to 
resume it, the source said. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam told his national 
security aides that the Patriots are purely defensive in nature 
and ordered them to start negotiations with U.S. officials on 
deployment as soon as possible. 
  Gary Luck, commander of UN Forces in South Korea, earlier 
asked President Clinton for the Patriots to beef up his defenses. 
  The Seoul government persuaded the Clinton administration 
against deploying the missiles, however, concerned that it might 
provoke North Korea in the middle of negotiations on Pyongyang's 
nuclear program. 
  Seoul's stance on the Patriots "irritated" Washington at the 
time, the source said on condition of anonymity. 
  As to whether and when Team Spirit would be resumed this 
year, the source said the two sides had not made a final 
decision. 
  "Although the principle is to go ahead with the military 
drill, there are those who think it is an overreaction," said 
the source. 
  Seoul and Washington announced on March 3 that they would 
suspend the drill this year, timed with the arrival of 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors in 
Pyongyang.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea seems 
determined not to give up their nuclear efforts unless they are 
assured of ultimate diplomatic normalization with the United 
States and lift of the U.S.'s trade embargo on them, a Western 
source here who maintains close ties with Pyongyang said on 
Monday. 
  The source is one of the rare Western figures who have free 
access to Pyongyang and maintain close friendship with the 
Pyongyang leadership. 
  "At a recent high-level meeting presided over personally by 
Kim Il-song, North Korea reaffirmed their policy that they 
cannot abandon their nuclear efforts unless there are clear 
assurances from the United States for improved U.S.-North Korea 
relations with the ultimate recognition of North Korea by the 
United States, lift of the existing trade embargo and for 
economic support," the source said. 
  The source, whose latest visit to Pyongyang was timed with 
IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspectors' arrival in 
Pyongyang early this month, said he obtained the information 
from a ranking Pyongyang official with whom he has been on 
friendly terms. 
  "It is feared therefore that unless these basic conditions 
are met, tension could build up between South and North Korea 
over the nuclear issue," the source said. 
  He said that the United States in effect applies a rigid 
economic sanction against North Korea by limiting the amount of 
dollars carried by Korean-resident visitors to North Korea and 
banning trade with Pyongyang. 
  The source observed that it appears North Korea has turned 
more intransigent as the international community's call for 
thorough nuclear inspection had threatened to diminish chances 
for the effective use of their "nuclear card." 
  Until a while ago, North Korea planned to announce a limited 
opening if only there were a substantial progress in U.S.-North 
Korea relations such as the exchange of liaison offices, he 
added.

  [Text] Seoul, March 19 (YONHAP) -- China will not agree to 
UN sanctions or any other stringent action against North Korea 
despite the current nuclear row, Chinese Ambassador to Seoul 
Zhang Tingyan said Saturday. 
  The envoy's comments come a week before South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam goes to China, where seeking Beijing's 
support for any decision the international community makes, 
including sanctions, is a top priority. 
  Beijing supports North Korea-U.S. diplomatic normalization 
because it would enhance peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula, just as China-South Korea relations did, he said. 
  "It's an international rule now to solve all issues through 
dialogue," Zhang said in an exclusive interview with YONHAP News 
Agency. "Why should the North Korean nuclear problem be an 
exception?" 
  Some countries are demanding hard-line action instead of 
dialogue, hurrying to take the matter to the UN Security Council 
and impose sanctions, he said. 
  "The security council, the sanctions or any other stringent 
measures, China cannot agree to," he told YONHAP. 
  "Such measures are not only ineffective, they would only 
complicate matters, aggravate the situation," Zhang said. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN 
nuclear 
watchdog, resumed inspections in North Korea early this month 
after a one-year break. But the agency announced this week that 
North Korea denied its inspectors access to critical sites, and 
thus they could not verify whether the Stalinist state had 
diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes. 
  Seoul and Washington's reaction was immediate and strong, 
with both saying they are becoming more convinced that dialogue 
may not be the right solution. 
  The 35-member IAEA Board of Governors convenes on March 21, 
and its final verdict on the inspection results will decide 
whether the matter goes to the Security Council. 
  "But one cannot say that the inspections were useless," the 
Chinese envoy said. "The fact that the IAEA inspectors went to 
North Korea was progress: Inspection itself was progress." 
  He strongly implied that this was the message President 
Jiang 
Zemin will deliver to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, 
saying, "I don't know what President Jiang will say. But he is 
certain to make Beijing's position sufficiently clear." 
  Zhang emphasized dialogue among the parties directly 
involved, namely South and North Korea and Pyongyang and 
Washington. 
  He went further to state that Beijing wants to see Pyongyang 
and Washington normalize relations. "North Korea-U.S. diplomatic 
normalization will contribute to peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula. China-South Korea diplomatic normalization 
did," he said. 
  Zhang called President Kim's visit timely because Seoul and 
Beijing are at a juncture where they must discuss elevating 
their relations to a new level. 
  "People-to-people exchanges are important, but the most 
important thing is for heads of state to meet directly. In this 
sense, the summit opens at a most crucial time," he said. 
  He foresaw no chance of Chinese leader Jiang making 
simultaneous visits to Seoul and Pyongyang as was recently 
reported in the press. 
  As to Jiang's South Korean visit, he said the agenda will be 
settled at the summit with President Kim. 
  Beijing is ready to discuss regional and global political 
developments with Seoul and engage in multilateral security 
dialogue within the framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC), the envoy said. 
  On bilateral military cooperation, Zhang said such links may 
well begin when Chinese military attaches arrive in Seoul 
sometime in mid-April.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China's Role and Responsibility"] </F>
  [Text] The East Asian countries and the rest of the world 
are focusing attention on China's role regarding the North Korea 
nuclear issue following the sudden aggravation of North-South 
relations with the rupture of the North-South working-level 
contact. Having signed a friendly and cooperative agreement, 
China is in a position to greatly influence North Korea. 
  It has been learned that while he was in Beijing, Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met with Chinese state leaders, 
including PRC President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, and 
asked them to persuade North Korea to fully accept international 
nuclear inspections. 
  Prior to the Japanese prime minister's Beijing visit, U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Beijing last week 
and agreed with the Chinese side to jointly cooperate on 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. Now, the countries 
concerned have formed an international cooperation system to 
check North Korean nuclear development. 
  As noted by Qiao Zonghuai, PRC Ambassador to the ROK, it is 
the Chinese official position to oppose the international 
community's strong steps against North Korea, including UN 
Security Council sanctions. We would like to stress a point, 
however, that the North Korean nuclear issue will have a serious 
impact not only on the Korean peninsula, but also on all East 
Asian countries, including countries surrounding the Korean 
peninsula. Japan -- which shows the most sensitive reaction to 
the North Korean nuclear issue -- has said on many occasions 
that it cannot but develop nuclear weapons if North Korea's 
nuclear development is not checked. Also, it is showing signs 
of strengthening its military capacity, such as by forming a 
regional security network, to deal with North Korea's 
development of long-range missiles. If the North Korean nuclear 
issue remains a factor of unrest in this area, regional economic 
cooperation -- including Japanese-PRC economic cooperation, 
which is to be announced following Japanese Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's visit in China, and ROK-PRC economic cooperation -- 
will be seriously affected and this will adversely affect 
China's reform and opening policy that it is now actively 
carrying out. 
  We would like to stress the role and responsibility of 
China, 
which is one of the leading countries throughout the world, 
rather than the regional economic cooperation in East Asia, 
including the support for China's openness. As a permanent 
member state of the UN Security Council, which is aimed at 
global peace, China should assume international responsibility 
for the North Korean nuclear issue. If the North Korean nuclear 
issue is referred to the UN Security Council and, as a result, 
the international community imposes sanctions on North Korea, 
China -- which opposes international sanctions against North 
Korea -- will be placed in a difficult situation. Therefore, it 
is better for China to persuade North Korea to meet the demands 
of the international community. This will also meet the demands 
of China for the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue 
through peaceful methods and dialogue. 
  China will not use "the North Korean nuclear issue card" 
multi-laterally to improve relations with foreign countries, we 
urge it to persuade North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. 
This is because we are concerned that the North Korean nuclear 
issue may cause constant unrest in peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula, as well as East Asia, including China. To 
avoid such unrest, it is imperative for China to participate in

United States, and Japan and to carry out its responsibility and

  [Text] James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence 
Agency, warned that North Korea's nuclear development and new 
long- range ballistic missile development greatly threaten world 
stability. 
  In an academic seminar held under the auspices of the 
Central 
Intelligence Agency on the evening of 18 March, Director Woolsey 
said that the United States worries greatly over North Korea's 
nuclear weapons development, as well as its development of long- 
range missiles. 
  In particular, Director Woolsey confirmed some reports that 
North Korea is developing new additional missiles with ranges 
greater than that of the Nodong missile, and said: If these two 
missiles are developed and tested, they could put at risk all of 
Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Also, if they 
are exported to the Middle East, they could threaten Europe as 
well.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Yong-won] </F>
  [Text] To what extent will North Korea's ground-to-ground 
missile be developed? The status quo of North Korea's missile 
development is gaining much interest after foreign news reported 
that North Korea is developing new ground-to-ground missiles 
tentatively named "Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2" with ranges from 
2,000 to 3,500 km. 
  In connection with this, a government intelligence source 
said, "It is true that North Korea is developing new missiles 
with a range of 2,000 to 3,500 km. ROK and U.S. intelligence 
authorities are closely tracking this." With North Korea's 
development of new missiles, the first thing of concern is the 
relationship between the already known Nodong Nos. 1 and 2, and 
Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2. 
  North Korea began developing the Nodong No. 1 in 1989 and 
successfully test-launched it for the first time in May 1993. 
It has a range of 1,000 km which covers Tokyo, Japan but has 
not been deployed to an actual fighting position. The existence 
of the Nodong No. 2 was first known in last year's U.S. Senate 
report, but its specifications have not yet been confirmed. Its 
range is estimated to be 1,500 to 2,000 km and a prototype is 
expected to be introduced next year. 
  The Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 are the newest missiles 
discovered 
at a missile research center in Sanum-tong, Pyongyang by a U.S. 
spy satellite in February 1994 . That was the first time the 
U.S. spy satellite discovered the missiles stacked in the open 
air with improved Scud B missiles and Nodong No. 1's. Judging 
from the size of the propellants, Taepodong No. 1 is estimated 
to have a range of 2,000 km, and Taepodong No. 2 approximately 
3,500 km. 
  Considering that the range of the Taepodong No. 1 is 
estimated to be 2,000 km, ROK and U.S. intelligence officials 
are reportedly closely analyzing the possibility of this being 
the Nodong No. 2. 
  Specialists are focusing their attention on the background 
of 
the fact that North Korea developed various types of new 
missiles in only one year and keeps expanding the ranges of 
missiles. 
  Usually, it takes several years to develop just one type of 
missile and it is also questionable that North Korea keeps 
expanding the ranges, although only 1,000 km would cover the 
Korean peninsula and major regions of Japan. 
  Specialists believe that, as in the case of Nodong Nos. 1 
and 
2, the new missiles are being developed at the order of Middle 
Eastern countries, including Iran, for exports to the region, or 
are aimed to cover major U.S. bases in the Pacific, including 
Guam. 
  Others also point out that these may be false prototypes 
considering that North Korea displayed them in the open air 
knowing that they were under the surveillance of U.S. spy 
satellites. 
  Specialists analyze that even if North Korea develops and 
deploys Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 in actual fighting, these will be 
of less threat to South Korea than Scud B or improved Scub B's 
because, like Nodong Nos. 1 and 2, Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 also 
use a Scud B as the main body but reduce the weight of warheads 
to expand the range, and thus their accuracy and destructive 
power are inferior to those of the Scud B. 
  However, ROK and U.S. authorities believe that if North 
Korea's missile development continues with this trend, it may be 
able to develop strategic mid-range ballistic missiles with a 
4,000 to 5,000-km range in the near future and create 
missile-phobia in Northeast Asia. The authorities are seeking 
various countermeasures while closely watching North Korea's 
missile development trend.

  [Text] In a dispatch from Seoul, SANKEI SHIMBUN reported 
today that a missile plant exploded in November 1991 in Kanggye 
city in the northern area of Chagang Province, North Korea, in 
which military plants are concentrated. The paper reported that 
approximately 200 workers were killed and a great number of 
homes were destroyed in the explosion. The paper also reported 
that Mr. Ko Chon-song, 32, who defected to the ROK from North 
Korea in June last year, said this in an interview with SANKEI 
SHIMBUN. 
  Mr. Ko Chon-song said that the explosion took place at the 
Kanggye No. 26 General Plant, the largest underground facility 
in North Korea, which was built after tunneling into the 
mountain. He said that the explosion took place at 2130 on 30 
November 1991 and that the plant had produced missiles and other 
various kinds of weapons, including rocket bombs, bombs, mines, 
and torpedoes. He added that it had produced Hwasong-1 
surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles with a range of 200 km.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korean cargo was 
recently transported to North Korea by sea and then to the 
northeastern part of China by North Korean railroad, the 
Maritime and Port Administration (MAPA) said on Monday. 
  The freighter Yanlong No. 4 departed from Pusan carrying 30 
containers on March 14 and arrived in Chongjin, a northeastern 
port in North Korea, on March 16. The containers were unloaded 
there and then transported to Yanbian, in the northeast of 
China, by North Korean railroad. 
  The Yanlong No. 4 belongs to Yanbian Shipping Co., Ltd. 
  Rice was transported from Pusan to Nampo, North Korea, in 
1990, marking the first time that a ship had sailed directly 
from South to North Korea without making a detour. The Yanlong 
No. 4 was thus the second vessel to sail directly from South 
Korea to the North. 
  Moreover, this was the first time that containers have been 
transported from South Korea to China via North Korean railroad. 
  "It is unusual that North Korea allowed the containers to 
move from South Korea to China on its soil, which Pyongyong had 
previously rejected. I think it does not mean that Pyongyang 
has changed its policy, but rather it is an exceptional measure 
considering the strong ties between North Korea and China," a 
MAPA official said. 
  On March 25, Yanbian Shipping Company plans to transport 
products from Yanbian to Pusan that were manufactured by South 
Korean businesses' locally incorporated companies there, and it 
also intends to operate a ship between Pusan and Chongjin once a 
week in June. 
  The MAPA will consult with the National Unification Board 
this week to discuss opening a sea route between South and North 
Korea.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (YONHAP) -- With South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming visit to Beijing supplying the 
momentum, efforts to create a Northeast Asian economic 
cooperation system will take concrete shape, Korean Ambassador 
to China Hwang Pyong-tae said Friday. 
  In an interview with South Korean correspondents posted in 
Beijing, Hwang said that during the president's visit beginning 
March 26, South Korea and China will sign a number of agreements 
to solidify bilateral cooperation -- especially in the economic 
arena. 
  "The creation of a close cooperative system between South 
Korea and China would lead ultimately to singularizing the two 
countries' markets," he said. 
  The ambassador said this would eventually prompt Japan to 
join the single market, making it a base for a Northeast Asian 
economic system geared toward non-tariffication in the region. 
  According to Hwang, the Korean-Chinese agreements to be 
signed include the creation of a joint industrial cooperation 
committee and memoranda on the promotion of joint ventures in 
electronic switchboards, airplanes, automobiles and 
high-definition television. 
  A source said a memorandum of understanding on bilateral 
cooperation in communications equipment would include provisions 
governing the joint development of next-generation 
communications equipment and China's approval of a 
Korea-developed TDX electronic switchboard model being produced 
by a Korean firm active in Shandong Province. 
  The memorandum will likely be signed during President Kim's 
visit by Communications Minister Yun Tong-yun and his Chinese 
counterpart, Posts and Communications Minister Wu Jichuan. 
  "The approval of the TDX model paves the way for possible 
adoption of the Korean model in all areas of China," the source 
said. 
  "Besides, China is expected to formally adopt the TDX 
switchboards in modernizing telephone facilities in the two 
Provinces of Shandong and Hunan." 
  In an airplane project, the two countries would jointly 
develop a prototype of a 100-seat passenger plane for sale to 
third countries, the source said. 
  A memorandum on automobile cooperation would call for Korean 
firms' advancement into China via "production of auto parts 
first and joint development and production of auto models later." 
  Daewoo Motor is already doing business in China through a 
tie-up with a Chinese firm following the same pattern. Daewoo's 
joint-venture company produces parts for about 300,000 vehicles 
a year. 
  By 1998 the firm plans to build an assembly plant capable of 
turning out about 150,000 units a year. 
  In addition, the two countries are planning to cooperate in 
such high-tech areas as high-definition television, atomic 
energy, rockets and satellites, the source said.

  [Text] Korea failed to get its farm-market opening 
schedule endorsed at the GATT's multilateral meeting held in 
Geneva Thursday as the United States and other concerned 
countries raised strong objection to it, the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced yesterday. 
  Consequently, Korea will have a second meeting in Geneva 
today to get the schedule endorsed. To narrow differences in 
positions, Korea yesterday had a series of informal bilateral 
meetings with the United States, Australia, New Zealand and 
Canada, the countries which vented particular displeasure with 
the schedule. 
  A ministry official said Korea may have to revise its 
agricultural country schedule in such a direction as to expand 
the opening of its agricultural market if it fails to win 
concessions from the U.S. and other major farm exporting 
countries. 
  In Thursday's meeting, the U.S. accused Korea of having 
presented a country schedule that doesn't correspond to the 
final draft presented on Dec. 15 last year when even-year 
Uruguay Round of trade liberalization talks was concluded. 
  The most thorny issue in Thursday's meeting was Seoul's plan 
to levy mark-ups, a term referring to levies which are 
equivalent to the difference between import and sales prices, on 
a number of imported agricultural products. 
  Korea seeks to levy mark-ups on 118 agricultural products in 
the form of state-administered trade, saying the broadbased 
application of mark-ups is needed to protect its farm industry. 
  On the contrary, the U.S. and other major farm exporting 
countries took issue with the mark-up scheme, noting that Korea 
listed only 10-odd items in its final draft presented last 
December. 
  They also accused Korea of trying to levy what they claim 
are 
excessive amounts of mark-ups to have its farm industry nestled 
under the umbrella of government protection. 
  Washington was also unhappy with Seoul's plan to keep tariff 
rates on agricultural imports at high levels, ministry officials 
said. In its country schedule, Korea offered to trim tariffs on 
agricultural imports by an average 24 percent over 10 years from 
1995, insisting that it be regarded as a developing country. 
  But the U.S. expressed dissatisfaction with Seoul's tariff 
reduction plan which it said was too conservative given its 
current economic status. 
  Washington also clarified its objection to Seoul's plan to 
slap tariffs on 97 agricultural imports on the basis of amounts. 
  Korea came under criticism for trying to curb farm imports 
by 
introducing a new tariff system, ministry officials said. 
  In Thursday's meeting, however, the U.S. didn't raise an 
objection to how much rice Korea will have to import next year 
and what years it proposes to base market access quota and 
subsidy cuts on, the officials said. 
  Complaining about Korea's plan to import 51,000 tons of rice 
next year, 1 percent of domestic consumption, the U.S. has been 
urging the quota be increased to 56,000 tons, saying the quota 
is limited to consumed volume and leaves out rice for seed and 
processing. 
  On the contrary, Seoul argues that the quota be fixed at 
51,000 tons, saying seed volume is just statistics and not part 
of the actual harvest and that the volume for processing is not 
categorized separately. 
  As Korea failed to get its agricultural country schedule 
endorsed Thursday, farm economists say it may have no other 
alternative but to revise the schedule. 
  An official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries said Korea is waging an uphill battle, hinting at a 
revision of its country schedule. 
  So far, of 118 member countries, some 80 have their final 
farm schedules endorsed at the GATT. Korea is one of the few 
countries whose schedule failed to pass the screening process. 
According to GATT regulations, the screening process is due to 
be completed by March 21.

  [Text] Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association [JAMA] 
Chairman Yutaka Kume (concurrently chairman of Nissan Motor 
Corp.) stressed his position of not to completely follow the 
government's market opening package to be released later this 
month. At a news conference on 17 March, he referred to 
automakers' efforts to work out voluntary plans for expanding 
purchase of foreign-made auto and auto parts, and said: "Our 
import expansion plans are being discussed as voluntary efforts 
of the private sector. We want no comments from the 
government." His statement was made to check government 
officials' attempt to incorporate the purchase plan into their 
market opening package. At the same time, he severely 
criticized U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor's 
demand for the Japanese Government's guarantee for fulfilling 
parts purchasing targets, stressing the Kantor remark is "an 
attempt to ruin our efforts." 
  Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Nissan, are 
individually mapping out plans for purchasing foreign-made auto 
parts. Chairman Kume said the JAMA is "planning business talks 
with auto and auto parts manufacturers not only of the United 
States, but also of Europe and other countries." To demonstrate 
"the industrial circles' initiative," the automakers' import 
expansion plan is expected to be released before the 
government's package. 
  However, Chairman Kume noted "our plan is intended to assist 
foreign manufacturers, and it is not the JAMA's numerical 
target." Touching particularly on USTR Kantor's demand for the 
Japanese Government's guarantee for the amount of auto parts 
imports, Kume said: "That is a very improper remark which may 
ruin automakers' initiative to better the Japan-U.S. relations." 
  Expansion of Japanese automakers' purchase of foreign-made 
autos and auto parts is the focal point of the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. In connection with this, some 
quarters in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] say "automakers' voluntary efforts should be added to our 
offer to the United States." MITI Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano 
hinted on 17 March at possibilities of merging the JAMA's parts 
purchase plan into the government's market opening package, 
saying: "I do not know contents of the private sector's plan, 
but we are considering (if it should be incorporated in the 
government's package)." 
  Under such circumstances, the automakers are wary of their 
voluntary efforts becoming "the government's formal pledge." A 
top official of a major automaker expressed his deep-rooted 
concern, saying: "At last, figures will go out of our control, 
and the private sector will have to suffer from them." 
  Chairman Kume showed discord between the public and private 
sectors on this issue, stressing: "Since this is a voluntary 
effort of the industrial circles, the government's intervention 
would become an obstacle."

  [Text] Next week at a regular meeting in Hawaii on 
semiconductors, if the United States formally asks Japan to 
present a new action plan aimed at ensuring a 20-percent share 
for foreign-made semiconductors on the Japanese market, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] will reject 
it, saying "the industries of both countries are making efforts 
for cooperation under the current agreement, and there is no 
need for a new plan" (according to Vice MITI Minister Hideaki 
Kumano). The ministry is wary lest the United States should 
choose--in applying the model of resolving the recent cellular 
phone issue--to demand that the Japanese Government guarantee 
the enforcement of private sector agreements in the auto and 
auto parts sector, as well as the semiconductor sector, which 
would amount to a de facto setting of "numerical targets." 
  MITI appreciates the fact that foreign semiconductor 
products' share of the Japanese market exceeded 20 percent in 
the October-December quarter of 1993 according to the 
calculations of both Japan and the United States, and its 
Machinery and Information Industries Bureau declared, "This is 
proof that the cooperative relations between the Japanese and 
U.S. industries are working well." 
  The United States, however, is unhappy that the overall 
market share for 1993 fell short of 20 percent and is said to be 
contemplating asking Japan to present a new action plan. MITI 
reacts to this by saying: "We have stuck to the position of 
rejecting numerical targets throughout the economic framework 
talks. We will not agree to the idea of setting share targets in 
the semiconductor market and then having these guaranteed by the 
government." The ministry will point out that the number of 
projects involving U.S. manufacturers and Japanese users 
cooperating from the developmental design-in stage exceeded 
3,000 in 1993, having grown six-fold over the past seven-year 
period. It wants to solicit the understanding of the United 
States by emphasizing that the industry-level cooperation is 
proceeding smoothly.

  [Text] Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic 
Planning Agency [EPA], in a news conference following a formal 
cabinet meeting on 18 March, revealed that Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura in an informal cabinet meeting 
earlier in the day had asked the agency to make "special 
efforts" to study including macroeconomic plans in the 
government's market-opening measures to be finalized by the end 
of March. Director General Kubota indicated that she was 
thinking in a forward-looking manner about the study on 
including macroeconomic plans, telling reporters, "We are now at 
a stage where we must come up with all possible alternatives." 
  Kubota did not speak plainly about the contents of the 
possible macroeconomic plans, but she noted, "the need for tax 
cuts and the expansion of domestic demand have been pointed out; 
of course, then there is the problem of the current-accounts 
surplus." Adding "I think we should discuss these things in a 
little more orderly manner," she indicated the likelihood that 
these issues will be considered as the plans.

  [Text] The government has decided on new measures--plus 
topics for further study--to be included in the overall foreign 
economic measures which will be finalized by the end of March. 
Key points of the new measures are seeking to assist expanded 
imports of foreign-made automobiles and auto parts, to promote 
market access by increasing the investigative staff of the Fair 
Trade Commission, for instance; and to strengthen competition. 
  Macroeconomic topics which will be given further study 
include the issue of whether to continue tax cuts into 1995 and 
thereafter, as well as the possibility of revising the public 
investment basic plan. Specific measures on these matters will 
not be finalized until June. The government wants to break the 
ice in relations with the United States before the 
industrialized nations summit in July (Naples summit) by coming 
up with a series of measures. 
  The overall foreign economic policies are composed of: 1) 
macroeconomic measures; 2) voluntary liberalization plans having 
four points: deregulation, import and investment promotion, 
strengthening competition, and expanded government procurement; 
and 3) market-opening measures in the priority areas of the 
Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks such as government 
procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment; 
insurance, and expanded imports of automobiles and auto parts. 
As for those points which cannot be finalized by the end of 
March, the government will inform the United States that it will 
continue to study them and will work to finalize them by June, 
before the Naples summit. 
  In a new measure with respect to expanded imports of 
automobiles and auto parts, Japan is to provide information on 
auto registrations (individual registration data) -- the 
information under the control of the Transportation Ministry -- 
for a fee to foreign auto manufacturers through the Japan 
Automobile Imports Association. Using the information on sales 
activities per se will be prohibited from the perspective of 
protecting privacy, but the information is believed to be useful 
in carrying out surveys and analyzing the Japanese market. As a 
way of helping expand the imports of auto parts, an office for 
consultations on foreign-made parts will be created at the Japan 
Automobile Maintenance Companies Association, which is the 
industrial organization representing auto servicing companies. 
In addition, the government will sponsor receptions and 
business meetings of foreign auto manufacturers' missions to 
promote the exports of their products to Japan, as well as 
seminars on Japan's service parts market. The government will 
also issue instructions to the auto service industry asking it 
not to discriminate against foreign-made parts. 
  Because auto companies plan to announce starting from this 
week their own plans, aside from the government's measures, on 
expanded purchases of foreign-made auto parts, the government is 
thinking about referring to these private sector plans in its 
measures as well. In the area of strengthening competition -- 
the area in which the United States is interested -- the 
government wants to announce an increase in investigative 
personnel at the Fair Trade Commission to help improve 
capabilities for uncovering instances, such as bid rigging, of 
violating the Antimonopoly Law. Another measure requires 
guidelines on public works bidding to specifically warn against 
violations of the Antimonopoly Law.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan-U.S. Accord on Mobile Phone Not </F>
Complete"] 
  [Text] Japan-U.S. negotiations on the mobile phone issue 
have concluded. As in past negotiations, Japan made concessions 
while the United States took a hard-line attitude, and the 
results of the negotiations are difficult to assess. 
  Facing a U.S. deadline on the imposition of sanctions and 
amid growing distrust, the two governments eventually came to an 
agreement on opening Japan's mobile phone market. We wonder 
what the result would have been if negotiations had ended in 
failure. The United States would have announced a list of trade 
items subject to sanctions. Japan would have appealed to the 
GATT. The result would have been a further deterioration in 
relations between the two countries. 
  We welcome the results of the negotiations because a further 
deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States 
would not only be unprofitable for the two countries, but would 
have a negative impact on the international community. 
  Analyzing the details of the agreement, however, we cannot 
say "there is no problem" with it. In particular, the Japanese 
Government adopted a questionable line during the negotiations. 
  One reason is the impression left that the "conventional 
settlement method"--in which Japan yields to U.S. Government 
pressure--was applied to the negotiations. 
  The Japanese Government originally stressed that the U.S. 
position ran counter to previous agreements between the two 
countries. There is no doubt that Motorola's contention was 
partly unreasonable. Motorola made much of the fact its market 
share in Japan had not increased and that the responsibility for 
this lay on the Japanese side. We think that position is a bit 
farfetched. 
  But the Japanese Government finally went into reverse. 
Immediately after the United States hinted it would take 
sanctions measures, the Japanese Government made concessions 
which contradicted its original position. 
  We are not saying making concessions is wrong. The 
government said that "there is no pressure behind Japan's 
compromise" and discounted the view that Japan had yielded to 
threats by the United States. However, judging from the 
negotiating process, we get impression that Japan yielded to 
U.S. pressure. And contrary to Japan's wishes, there is the 
possibility that U.S. distrust of Japan will grow. For this 
reason, Japan should bid farewell to its conventional method of 
settling issues. 
  Another reason is that the agreement on increasing ground 
radio stations and assigned frequencies for Motorola-type mobile 
phone--a focal point in the issue of opening the mobile phone 
market--is vague, and may provide ammunition for future 
discussions. 
  The two governments are already at cross-purposes about how 
to interpret a statement that "the Government of Japan will take 
all available measures to ensure compliance with the private 
sector's commitments." The Japanese Government says it cannot 
guarantee a private contract. However, the U.S. Government 
interprets Japan's agreement to increase relay stations for the 
Motorola-formula cellular phone service as a "objective 
criterion," saying the Japanese Government has guaranteed the 
fulfillment of the agreement. 
  It is possible the United States will apply pressure to 
Japan 
by saying "you must carry out your promise." We believe the 
major aim of the recent failed economic framework talks was to 
confirm Japan's rejection of U.S. pressure. We do not want see 
the government continuing to make "vague" agreements any more. 
Shelving important issues will only worsen the situation and 
increase U.S. distrust. 
  From the point of view of consumers, the government should 
create a more open, transparent market by deregulation. This is 
what the government must do and this is the way to win the 
international support. 
  The government is scheduled to come up with new market 
opening measures this month aimed at resuming the economic 
framework talks. This time, the government has to hammer out 
persuasive, substantial measures which will bring profit to the 
consumers and lead to the promotion of reform of the industrial 
structure. 
  Taking advantage of this opportunity, we want to say that 
U.S. economic policy will lose international support if it 
continues its "results-oriented" steamroller attitude which 
ignores the economic environment. The United States needs to 
take a calm attitude on economic issues.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Undercurrent" column article: "Danger Signal </F>
for Japan-U.S. Aviation Friction"] 
  [Text] Just before its inauguration, the United States 
notified Japan that it would postpone approval for a regular 
Sendai-Honolulu flight by Japan Airlines [JAL]. It was also 
disclosed that the term approved for several routes operated by 
Japanese airlines had been shortened. On 18 March, the Ministry 
of Transport [MOT] decided to take countermeasures by shortening 
the approved term of operation for U.S. airlines. These are 
clear signs that "aviation friction" between Japan and the 
United States is intensifying. At the moment these moves seem 
to be part of the jockeying for advantage as the prelude to the 
next round of aviation talks. However, the MOT has said that 
"if the U.S. is not perceived to be acting sincerely in the 
measures it takes, further countermeasures will be considered." 
There is, therefore, a clear danger that the confrontation will 
be intensified. 
  What underlies the tough attitude being taken by the United 
States is the difference in view between Washington and Tokyo 
over the issue of beyond rights -- such rights would allow U.S. 
airlines to extend their routes beyond Japan to third countries. 
Current beyond rights are based on the Aviation Agreement 
signed in 1952. Based on this, U.S. airlines have extended 
flights beyond Japan to 10 places, including Singapore. For 
flights to Kansai International Airport [in Osaka], which is 
scheduled to open in September, the United States is demanding 
that its airlines be granted unlimited rights to extend flights 
beyond the new airport. 
  In response, the MOT says that "the Aviation Agreement 
indicates that efforts be centered on promoting flights between 
Japan and the United States," and that "attempts to expand 
beyond rights are tantamount to an abuse of such rights." 
  Japanese airlines have only one beyond-rights flight from 
Narita to San Paulo via Los Angeles (operated by JAL). This is 
an obvious inequality and the MOT, therefore, will not change 
its position on the exercise of beyond rights. 
  It is very important for American companies to secure beyond 
rights that give them advantages on Pacific flights, a market 
that is currently growing. United Airlines and other airlines 
are strongly dissatisfied that their requests to start new 
flights through the exercise of beyond rights have been denied. 
And the recent announcement of the shortening of the approved 
operating period for certain flights can be taken as "the U.S. 
making clear its dissatisfaction over the beyond rights issue." 
  A Foreign Ministry source said: "Friction in the field of 
aviation is one thing, but a deterioration in Japan-U.S. 
relations caused by the trade surplus is quite another." 
  However, Japan now faces another problem in addition to the 
dispute over the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
Bargaining is expected to continued until the resumption of 
Japan-U.S. aviation talks. 
  In the meantime, it has been said that "the point at issue 
now is how far can Japan stick to its hardline position while it 
is being pressured to improve its relationship with the United 
States." 
  It is highly likely that the MOT will have difficulties 
tackling this problem.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan and China Should Mature Relations </F>
Through a Straightforward Dialogue"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is to make a 
three-day visit to China starting 19 March. During his visit, 
he is scheduled to meet with President (and CPC General 
Secretary) Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other Chinese 
leaders. 
  In his talks with Li, Hosokawa is expected to reaffirm 
"future-oriented" relations between Japan and China. The two 
leaders will also deal with "bilateral ties that contribute to 
the international community," in talks on security in the Asia 
region, the Korean peninsula, disarmament, nuclear 
nonproliferation, weapons export control, the role of the United 
Nations, and environmental and drug-related issues. 
  Needless to say, the two countries rely heavily on each 
other 
and relations with China are very important for Japan. 
Development of good and stable relations between Japan, China, 
and the United States is indispensable for the security and 
prosperity of the Asia- Pacific region, and for the rest of the 
world. 
  Hosokawa should use his visit as an opportunity to frankly 
exchange opinions with Chinese leaders based on a global 
viewpoint to deepen and mature bilateral relations. 
  One of the pressing issues to be discussed in Beijing will 
be 
how to cope with the suspected nuclear weapon development by the 
DPRK. 
  The Japanese Government has urged China to use its influence 
over the DPRK to persuade that country to accept nuclear 
inspections. 
  Jiang has said: "Our unchanging position is that the Korean 
peninsula should be nuclear free." China has promised to lend 
its support, saying: "We will wield our influence for a 
positive purpose." 
  However, recently the DPRK again refused to open its 
undeclared nuclear sites to inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA has said in its report 
that "it has not been proved that Pyongyang has not been 
developing nuclear weapons," thus the nuclear suspicion has not 
yet been dispelled. 
  We hope that Hosokawa will again urge China to persuade the 
DPRK during his visit. 
  Meanwhile, Asian nations are becoming increasingly concerned 
about China's growing defense outlays. In China's fiscal 1994 
budget plan, 22.4 percent are allocated to defense expenses. 
  The Chinese Government has repeatedly told Japan that it has 
no intention of strengthening its military power. However, 
Beijing should realize that the fact that the defense program of 
superpower China is not transparent has caused concern among 
neighboring countries. 
  During his visit, Hosokawa should question China's true 
intentions in expanding its military forces, and convey to 
Chinese leaders the strong concerns held by neighboring nations. 
He should also urge Beijing to make its defense program clearer 
by issuing "defense white papers." 
  China is currently under pressure from the United States to 
improve its human rights record so that it can maintain its 
most- favored-nation trade status. Based on the understanding 
that respect for basic human rights is a universal value, 
Hosokawa should encourage China to show other countries specific 
measures to improve its human rights record. 
  In recent years, trade between Japan and China has greatly 
increased. The trade volume reached about $38 billion last 
year. Japan has now become China's largest trade partner in the 
region, surpassing Hong Kong. Japanese investment in China has 
also increased. 
  China, which is making a rapid transition to a market 
economy, is beset by various problems. Therefore, it has high 
expectations from Japan. 
  During his visit, Hosokawa is expected to pledge Japan's 
support for China's reform and open-door policies. He is also 
expected to unveil a new aid program for China that includes the 
fourth yen loan plan. 
  We hope that the prime minister will have a productive 
dialogue with Chinese leaders.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Kazuhiko Sasaki] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar -- The main purpose of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's recent talks with Chinese leaders 
was to confirm that Japan and China will take unified actions in 
dealing with the suspected nuclear weapons development (by the 
DPRK). During his talks with Premier Li Peng, the two agreed 
that the DPRK should open all its nuclear sites to inspections 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). However, 
there was apparent discord between them -- Hosokawa, with a 
sense of crisis, urged China to persuade the DPRK to accept the 
nuclear inspections while Li called for exercising prudence in 
dealing with the issue. The DPRK issue is expected to be a main 
topic in Japanese-South Korean and Sino-South Korean summits 
scheduled for this weekend. Because it has become apparent that 
China is taking a cautious approach, Tokyo will have to review 
its plan for "Japan, the United States, China, and the ROK to 
work in closer cooperation" in dealing with the DPRK issue. 
  Hosokawa repeatedly touched on the suspected nuclear weapons 
development by the DPRK during his talks with President Jiang 
Zemin and Premier Li on 20 March. He said: "It (what the DPRK 
is doing) is delaying tactics," and "the international 
community's patience has been running out and it is possible 
that attempts to resolve this nuclear issue through dialogue 
might end in failure." Compared with Tokyo's traditional stand, 
his remarks were a little harsher to Pyongyang in response to 
the DPRK's recent attitude. Behind his remarks lie growing 
arguments in Japan, the United States, and the ROK that "if 
these nations try to resolve the issue only through dialogue, 
they will fall into the DPRK's tactics" (according to a 
government source). 
  The DPRK nuclear issue has direct influence on security in 
Japan and other northeast Asian nations. In recent summits, 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton shared the same view on 
this grave problem and agreed to work in closer cooperation in 
dealing with it. In view of current relations between Washington 
and Beijing, Japan is the only nation that can make requests to 
China. It is certain that being aware of this, Hosokawa visited 
Beijing. 
  However, Beijing did not fully accept Japan's requests. 
Because there are about 2 million Koreans living along the 
China-DPRK border, any actions that provoke the DPRK might also 
create commotion in China. Moreover, it is rumored that DPRK 
President Kim Il-song will visit Beijing in the near future. In 
such a situation, it is a matter of course for China to think it 
is best to exercise prudence. Another reason for China 
rejecting Japan's requests might be that it tried to indirectly 
check the United States from carrying out a hard-line policy 
against the DPRK. 
  Because China's cautious attitude has become apparent 
through 
the recent Japanese-Sino summit, some people have begun to think 
that even if the DPRK nuclear issue is sent from the IAEA to the 
UN Security Council [UNSC], it is uncertain whether the UNSC 
will be able to adopt a resolution calling for sanctions against 
the DPRK because if China, a permanent UNSC member, should 
exercise its veto power, the resolution will be killed. 
  A government source said: "Tokyo will consider strengthening 
its persuasion on China." Nevertheless, China's cautious 
approach might affect future cooperation between "Japan, the 
United States, China, and the ROK." During his talks with South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam scheduled for 24 March, Hosokawa 
is to discuss with the president cooperation between Japan and 
South Korea in dealing with the DPRK. After visiting Japan, 
President Kim is to visit China to meet with Chinese leaders. 
The DPRK issue occupies a major position in a series of summits 
between Japan and China, Japan and the ROK, and China and the 
ROK. It can be said that in the recent Japanese-Sino talks, the 
first in a series of summits, Tokyo was forced to review its 
plan for "Japan, the United States, China, and South Korea to 
work in closer cooperation" in dealing with the DPRK.

  [Text] To assist bilateral cooperation in the auto 
industry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] and the Chinese Government will sponsor the "Conference 
for Cooperation Between Japanese, Chinese Auto Parts Industries" 
(tentative name) around June. The conference is designed for 
exchanging information on Japanese auto parts makers hoping 
business in China and on Chinese products and factories which 
may interest Japanese companies. Some Western automakers, 
including Volkswagen of Germany and Chrysler of the United 
States, are taking part in Chinese national projects on 
automobile development but Japanese companies are far behind in 
this field. Under such circumstances, MITI decided to pave the 
way for Japanese companies' advance into the growing Chinese 
market. 
  MITI has already started listing domestic parts 
manufacturers 
that want to set up production strongpoints in China, aiming at 
promotion of joint ventures in the auto industry. 
  The conference will be organized by officials of the Japan 
Auto Parts Industries Association and Chinese auto and auto 
parts makers. They will meet periodically to accelerate 
bilateral cooperation through exchanging information on definite 
plans for business tie-ups. The formal accord is expected to be 
concluded in May, when Chinese State Planning Commission 
officials visit Japan. 
  China's automobile production counted 1.4 million units in 
1993, and production has doubled in the last three years. Some 
estimates say the figure will reach 3 million in 2000. While 
Japan's Daihatsu and Suzuki are participating in China's 
national automobile projects, no major Japanese automakers are 
involved in. In general, Japanese automakers' ties with China 
is weaker than those of Western automakers. 
  The Chinese Government is attaching importance to developing 
its own auto parts industries, and it called for Japan's 
assistance to the national policy when a Japanese automakers' 
mission visited Beijing in the fall of 1993. In response, 
Nissan's affiliated Kinugawa Rubber Industrial Co. Ltd. 
established a joint venture company in Tianjin. Also, Yazaki 
Corporation and Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd. have subsidy 
companies in Tianjin and Shanghai, respectively. 
  Some auto parts makers are conducting feasibility studies on 
operations in China, and the "cooperation conference" is 
expected to accelerate moves toward technological assistance and 
joint ventures. 
  About 4,000 auto parts factories are reportedly conducting 
business in China, but only 20 are subsidies of Japanese auto 
parts makers. In the ninth Five-Year Economic Plan starting in 
1996, China intends to improve productivity of auto parts makers 
through mergers and large-scale management.

  [Text] As of 19 March, the government has decided to give 
its positive support to the ROK for its candidacy to become a 
nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC] in 1995. 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to tell this to ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam, who is scheduled to visit Japan 
beginning 24 March. 
  Japan is not a nonpermanent member of the UNSC at present, 
but it will become eligible for membership in 1995. However, 
with regard to being a nonpermanent member, which strongly 
implies being a regional representative, the government has 
decided to turn over the right to represent Asia to the ROK and 
to concentrate on winning permanent membership for itself. 
  There are 10 nonpermanent member states of the UNSC. They 
differ from the five permanent member states (the United States, 
Great Britain, France, Russia, and China) in that they do not 
possess veto rights, but they can always participate in the UNSC 
deliberations. 
  The term for nonpermanent members is two years, and half of 
the members are elected every year. Together with Pakistan, 
Japan served as the representative of Asia until last December. 
  It has so far been said within the government that "at a 
time 
when Japan is intending to apply for permanent membership, this 
will be a serious blow because Japan will not be able to obtain 
sufficient information" (as stated by a Foreign Ministry 
source). Based on this viewpoint, it has been said that to 
maintain contacts with the UNSC, Japan should try to remain on 
the UNSC as a nonpermanent member for as long as possible and 
until a definite decision has been made on its becoming a 
permanent member. 
  On the other hand, it has also been said that because Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at last year's UN General Assembly 
session "indicated Japan's intention to become a permanent 
member rather than insisting for some reasons [not further 
specified] on serving as a nonpermanent member, Japan should 
concentrate its efforts on seeking permanent membership" (as 
stated by a Foreign Ministry source). 
  Under such circumstances, when ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu visited Japan last September, he disclosed the ROK's 
intention to apply for nonpermanent membership on the UNSC and 
and sought Japan's support in this. 
  In this connection, the decision has been made based on the 
assessment that it would be better to win Asian nations' 
understanding, which is indispensable to Japan's winning 
permanent membership, by supporting the ROK's position.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 March Evening Edition] </F>
  [Text] In an interview given to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
reporter in Tokyo, Algerian Economic Minister Mourad Benachenhou 
commented on negotiations for deferring the repayment of debts 
worth $30 billion, which is his objective in his visit to Japan, 
saying: "Japan showed a favorable attitude at the talks." 
However, Benachenhou pointed out that the Algerian economy will 
be faced with difficulties in the future due to sluggish sales 
of crude oil, and stressed again: "I would like to ask for 
understanding from Japan, to which our country owes the second 
largest amount of debts, next to France." 
  He pointed out that prospects are not optimistic for the 
debt 
issue. He said that Algeria's debt service ratio (ratio of 
foreign debt repayment to exports) reached 86 percent in fiscal 
1993, and predicted that "in 1994, the debt service ratio will 
be 90 percent or more." 
  With regard to the reasons for this, he said: "The oil 
market, (in which oil producing countries are hesitating to 
cooperate with each other in cutting oil production), is now 
falling into disorder. We cannot take an optimistic view either 
on the short-term or the long-term situation." 
  Benachenhou further stated: "I would like to invite European 
and Japanese companies to take part in the development of 
abundant deposits of LNG (liquefied natural gas) in Algeria."

  [Text] Honolulu, 18 Mar -- On the afternoon of 18 March 
(19 March, Japanese time), Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
successively met with Chinese, Australian, Taiwanese, and 
Malaysian counterparts -- Liu Zhongli, Ralph Willis, Lin 
Chen-kuo, and Ibrahim Anwal. 
  Touching on Japan's prolonged economic recession, Chinese 
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli expressed his hope for an early 
economic recovery of Japan, saying: "Recovery of the Japanese 
economy is important for the Asia-Pacific region. I hope the 
Japanese Government is successful in implementing its economic 
policies." Australian Finance Minister Ralph Willis also showed 
deep interest in Japanese economic trends. 
  Liu stressed: "Japan has achieved constant economic growth, 
even overcoming the 1973 and 1979 oil crises and the Black 
Monday stock market plunge. I am very confident about Japan's 
economic policies." He noted that the Japanese economy had 
great influence on economic trends in the Asian-Pacific region, 
saying: "Japan's large-scale economy has great influence even 
when the growth rate is only 2 percent." 
  In reply, Fujii said "we hammered out a pump-priming package 
of more than 15 trillion yen in February, and we hope for an 
economic upturn in fiscal year 1994." 
  In his meeting with Taiwanese Finance Minister Lin, Fujii 
said: "It is important to deepen dialogue among finance 
ministers in the region. I would like to promote the spirit of 
harmony and cooperation, informally discussing each other's 
experiences of economic growth and current problems." The 
meeting was the first contact between the finance ministers of 
Japan and Taiwan as the two nations do not currently share 
diplomatic relations; however, their trade ministers have met 
three times at the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Ministers' 
conference (APEC). 
  As far as Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir's 
boycotting of APEC summit in November 1993 is concerned, Deputy 
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Ibrahim Anwal stressed "we 
support APEC, as you know, from the fact that we came here." He 
then asked for Japanese yen-based loans for the New Kuala Lumpur 
International Airport project.

  [Text] Yoshio Hatano, ambassador to the United Nations, in 
a speech before a working group on UN Security Council [UNSC] 
reform held at the UN Headquarters on 16 March, talked about the 
question of Japan becoming a permanent member of the Security 
Council, and announced, "I would like to reaffirm the firm 
resolve of our country." The expression was one going a step 
forward from the earlier government view expressed in the 
statement of July last year and elsewhere, but Prime Minister 
Hosokawa told reporters, "I have heard nothing about it." A 
senior official of Komeito, which is one of the coalition 
parties, spoke on the speech, saying, "It should have been 
consulted with appropriate offices of the ruling parties; this 
was too sudden." It can be said that the charge that government 
"policy is absent" in important issues that have to do with 
Japan's future has once again been proven correct. 
  Ambassador Hatano's speech is different from government's 
past expressions on the issue. The government issued a 
statement [last July] stating Japan is "willing to do what it 
can to fulfill its responsibilities in the UN Security Council." 
In a speech to the United Nations in last September, the prime 
minister said Japan is "willing to do what it can to fulfill its 
responsibilities in the reformed United Nations." In 
testimonies before the Diet the prime minister has used such 
expressions as "we will go a natural way" and "our position is 
that we will become one if recommended [by other countries]." 
Hatano's speech was different from all this, and expressed 
Japan's desire to become a permanent member of the council in a 
direct manner. 
  A top official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 
explaining this, said, "Many nations have pointed out that the 
expressions of the past made `it impossible to tell whether 
Japan wanted to become one or not.'" Another MOFA official 
explained to reporters, "An expression like `will become one if 
recommended' is not passable in the international community, and 
the ambassador's expression did not go beyond what was said in 
the statement [of last July]." MOFA officials are said to have 
visited the prime minister's office to explain the speech as 
well. 
  But the prime minister's office was confused. The prime 
minister initially said he has "heard nothing about it," but 
then changed his position to saying "it is the same as the 
statement of last year." Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura in a news conference did not try to hide his 
embarrassment, admitting: "I have not heard the explanation on 
the speech. What I heard was an explanation about the general 
things about the United Nations and the Security Council. I 
have not seen the full text of the speech yet." 
  The fact of the matter is that the coalition government does 
not want to tackle the matter squarely from the front. Since 
the matter concerns the basic policies of the coalition parties, 
and thus can become an issue that causes adverse effects on the 
unity of the coalition, the government appears to be facing the 
problem of having to be very, very careful in dealing with this 
question.

  [Text] The Defense Agency [DA], which has studied ways to 
improve its capability of collecting military information, has 
begun to examine specific ways to purchase sophisticated photos 
taken by highly efficient satellites developed by American firms 
for military reconnaissance through commercial deals to use them 
to analyze the military situation in Japan's neighboring 
nations. In the United States, government organizations were 
provided access to the photos taken by the military 
reconnaissance satellites in the past, but the Clinton 
administration recently decided to allow civilian corporations 
to launch them for commercial purposes. In response to the U.S. 
administration's decision, the DA has begun to examine specific 
ways to purchase the sophisticated satellite photos. It plans to 
use those sophisticated satellite photos to "enhance its 
capability of collecting military information" as its priority 
task when it shapes a new guideline for the buildup of Japan's 
defense capabilities. Other Asian nations are also interested in 
using the sophisticated photos taken by those satellites to 
collect military information, and the use of those sophisticated 
photos will be noted as a new proliferation of military 
technology. 
  In addition to photos obtained from the U.S. Government, the 
DA has been purchasing those taken by such commercial 
observatory satellites as "Landsat" of the United States and 
"Spot" of France, and using them to analyze the military 
situation in areas neighboring Japan. While U.S. military 
reconnaissance satellites are said to be capable of 
distinguishing an object of a radius of at least 30 centimeters 
on the earth, the remote-sensing satellites are only capable of 
distinguishing an object measuring about 10 meters. Photos taken 
by the remote-sensing satellites are said to help in analyzing 
the movements of ground troops and the deployment of airplanes. 
  For this reason, the Defense Agency has studied how to 
resolve technical and legal problems involving the purchase of 
sophisticated satellite photos while studying the possibility of 
launching its own military reconnaissance satellites. 
  In the past, the United States has kept the technology of 
military satellites classified. In response to Russia moving to 
sell satellite photos to other nations following the end of the 
Cold War, the U.S. Government recently changed its conventional 
policy and decided to allow private corporations to launch 
highly efficient satellites to capture the market. It is said 
that the U.S. Government will allow private corporations to sell 
only satellite photos that can distinguish an object measuring 
one meter. A DA official says if the DA uses those satellite 
photos, it can distinguish the type of aircraft on the ground. 
  According to an official concerned, Lockheed and other 
American firms are informally sounding out the DA and some Asian 
nations about purchasing their satellite photos. There are 
various ways to purchase those photos, including the simple 
purchase of individual satellite photos and the establishment of 
ground receiving stations. It is said that the monopolistic use 
of satellite photos on specific areas and the right to ask for 
an orbit change of satellite are negotiable. 
  There is a possibility that the DA's use of the 
sophisticated 
photos taken by the military reconnaissance satellites runs 
counter to a Diet resolution calling for a ban on using the 
space for military purposes. For this reason, the government 
has been cautious about using the photos taken by military 
reconnaissance satellites. The use of photos taken by 
multipurpose commercial satellites, however, has been 
interpreted as not violating the Diet resolution. The DA 
maintains that the photos taken by the multipurpose commercial 
satellites are the same as the sophisticated photos taken by the 
military reconnaissance satellites. The use of sophisticated 
photos taken by the military reconnaissance satellites may run 
counter to the Diet resolution depending on contract terms 
including the monopolistic use. The DA's use of sophisticated 
photos taken by military reconnaissance satellites is expected 
to have a subtle impact on the present military balance in 
Japan's neighboring nations. 
  The DA plans to speed up the study of contract terms offered 
by the American firms and appropriate survey expenses in the 
fiscal 1995 budget, at the earliest.

  [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], had dinner with Hirotaro Yamazaki, chairman of 
the Japan New Party [JNP] general conference of Diet members of 
both houses, and seven other JNP Diet members at a hotel in 
Tokyo on the evening of 15 March. He exchanged views with them 
on the realignment of the political world. 
  According to a participant in the gathering, Ozawa said: 
"Prime Minister Hosokawa is a great man who knows his 
priorities. The JNP should also be confident in its support of 
the administration." 
  Also present at this meeting were Diet members Toshio 
Yamaguchi and Naoto Kitamura. Ozawa had also met with other JNP 
Diet members on 7 and 10 March. 
  On the other hand, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura 
(head of Sakigake [Harbinger]) attended a study group of 
Sakigake and JNP members on information and communications on 
the morning of 15 March. He said in his speech, "While I will 
not attend the general meeting of Sakigake Diet members, I 
intend to deal actively with party affairs," thus impressing his 
listeners with his enthusiasm for party affairs. 
  Because Ozawa has been actively approaching JNP Diet 
members, 
Takemura apparently feels that it is not enough for him to 
"concentrate on administrative affairs." The tug-of-war between 
the two men to form an alliance with the JNP is expected to grow 
in intensity.

  [Text] The Japan Trade Union Confederation [Rengo], at its 
senior executives meeting on 15 March, decided to soon establish 
the "Rengo political forum" (tentative name), the policy 
consultative organ composed of Diet members from various parties 
including conservatives. Among those parties are the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party 
[DSP], Sakigake [Harbinger], and the Japan New Party. 
  Within Rengo, moves toward the political realignment have 
been observed. For example, the All-Japan Prefectural and 
Municipal Workers Union, the Japan Teachers Union, the Japan 
Electric Communications Union [as published], and the Japan 
Postal Workers Union have agreed to provide financial assistance 
and electoral cooperation so as to unite the SDPJ, the DSP, and 
liberal forces. The purpose of this organ is to create grounds 
for unifying a new force by engaging in policy coordination 
between various parties. 
  At Rengo's Central Committee session scheduled for 17 March, 
Chairman Akira Yamagishi will officially propose the 
establishment of the organ. Then, members of both the SDPJ and 
the DSP and some intellectuals will form a preparatory team in 
early April to work on establishing the new organ.

  [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New 
Party [JNP], and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] met on 17 
March to exchange views on political realignment. Shinseito 
representative Ichiro Ozawa and DSP General Secretary Takashi 
Yonezawa attended the meeting, and the parties agreed that "the 
coalition parties should endeavour to form a new party, rather 
than try to rely on electoral cooperation of existing parties, 
to fight in the general election conducted under the new 
electoral system." 
  Even though they are said to have not discussed specific 
steps to form the new party, this development shows that Ozawa's 
work of forming a new party -- which comes in the wake of the 
idea of Shinseito and the JNP forming an alliance -- is 
continuing, and this move is likely to send ripples to the new 
Sakigake [Harbinger] Party and the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ]. 
  The meeting, which took place in a restaurant in Tokyo, was 
called by Shinseito and the JNP to discuss the issue of forming 
an alliance of all parties in the coalition and Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's idea on forming a policy study commission. Present 
at the meeting from the DSP were, in addition to Yonezawa, five 
lower house members and five upper house members, including 
floor whip Atsushi Kanda and Hiroshi Nakai, chairman of the 
party Election Strategy Committee. Among those from the JNP was 
Dietman Hiroyuki Nagahama. From Shinseito, Ozawa and Dietman 
Naoto Kitamura were present. An independent Diet member, Toshio 
Yamaguchi, was also there. 
  According to Yonezawa, the meeting that the SDPJ's position 
of wanting to fight the next general election, retaining the 
existing parties but cooperating in the election, "has 
limitations in fighting the Liberal Democratic Party" and that 
"the only way to maintain the government is to form a new party 
and campaign with new platforms." 
  But there were also opinions that "it might be difficult for 
all ruling parties to merge into one party in one big sweep" and 
also those saying, "We should be cautious about this matter 
since this idea of forming a new party or a new unified alliance 
can create a big stir."

<F P=106> [Interview with Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister and head of </F>
Shinseito, by unidentified TOKYO SHIMBUN reporter; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
and the Japan New Party [JNP] have agreed to form a 
parliamentary group. Like this, moves toward the realignment of 
political parties have been accelerated. 
  [Hata] The enactment of the political reform law has 
provided an opportunity to create new politics. So far, we have 
argued "what ideal politics is." From now on, we should take 
action to achieve "ideal politics." For this, it is an urgent 
necessary to establish a two-party system. To tackle many 
difficult issues, (the ruling parties) need to become a unified 
force as soon as possible. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is this basically aimed at preventing the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] from regaining power? 
  [Hata] The LDP had been in power for 38 years and this 
caused the problems we are facing now. Unless we establish a 
stable political force capable of taking the reins of government 
in place of the LDP, Japanese politics will go backward and lose 
its vitality. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you mean it is necessary to form a 
parliamentary group to deal with difficult problems? 
  [Hata] That is right. The government has to carry out such 
tasks as tax reform, decentralization of political power, 
deregulation, and electoral reform for the House of Councillors. 
In particular, deregulation is a difficult issue. Although the 
ruling parties agreed on deregulation measures at a 
representatives meeting, each has argued for and against the 
measures. This is not good. In this manner, we will never be 
able to carry out deregulation. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is an idea within the ruling parties 
of establishing a tripolar political system in which politics is 
pursued by three forces -- "the LDP," "Shinseito-Komeito 
alliance," and "the alliance of social democrats and liberals." 
What do you think of this? 
  [Hata] Under the current medium-sized constituency system, 
the ruling parties are obliged to compete with each other. I 
wonder if this will change (under a single-seat constituency 
system). The ruling parties will never cooperate in elections 
unless they run as a single party. Therefore, it is best for 
them to merge and form a new party. I intend to discuss this 
with other parties. If the ruling parties do not unite, the 
people will get confused. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Does Shinseito plan to form a parliamentary 
group with the JNP first as a step toward a large group? 
  [Hata] If I say yes, Diet business will come to a halt. We 
still do not know when the budget bill will be passed. In such 
a situation, if we discuss such matters as that this party and 
that party will be unified first, (the ruling coalition) will 
fall apart. We do not set an order to form a parliamentary 
group. All the ruling parties should merge in one parliamentary 
group at one time. It will take about five or six months to 
determine the allocation of electoral seats under a single-seat 
constituency system. Immediately after it is determined, 
political parties will begin the selection (of candidates). 
Before that, the ruling parties have to establish a 
relationship of mutual trust. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What is Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
opinion? 
  [Hata] I gave my opinion to him and he gave his opinion to 
me. We discussed many things. He has agreed that if the ruling 
parties do not take the course (toward forming a large 
parliamentary group), it will be difficult for them to win in 
the general election conducted under a single-seat constituency 
system. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] You mean your view and the prime minister's 
are the same? 
  [Hata] Almost the same. He himself has begun to think that 
it is not easy to stabilize politics when there are so many 
political parties, and that it is necessary to consolidate (the 
ruling parties). 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] But Sakigake [Harbinger] party is opposed to 
forming a large parliamentary group. 
  [Hata] I think Sakigake will also join in the group. We are 
serious about the idea of forming a parliamentary group. Each 
party should think what it should do to better Japanese 
politics. For example, although Shinseito and the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] once took totally different 
political stances, the two have now cooperated in tiding over 
many difficulties. If we take a lot of time to explain the idea 
to Sakigake and the SDPJ, I am sure they will understand.

<F P=106> [Interview with SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama by SANKEI </F>
SHIMBUN political editor Nobuaki Hanaoka; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Hanaoka] The central political world is being 
sliced open by a corruption scandal involving politicians and 
construction companies. In the past, when something like this 
happened, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] launched 
fierce attacks against the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Your 
party is so quiet this time. 
  [Murayama] Would that make any difference? Anyway, the 
SDPJ's stand of wanting to root out corruption has not changed a 
bit. Diet members receive so many requests from organizations 
and individuals to help them, but they must by all means avoid 
getting involved in money matters. 
  [Hanaoka] What will your party do to delve into the scandal? 
  [Murayama] I think that the recent construction corruption 
scandal has deep roots. The Diet should look into the truth of 
the matter to see whether people higher up are involved. On the 
other hand, the Diet also needs to pass the 1994 budget. We 
should do this so as to not allow the matter to impede the 
Diet's deliberations nf the budget bill. 
  [Hanaoka] The SDPJ played a major role in the recent soap 
opera of a cabinet reshuffle. But don't you think it would be 
embarrassing if a prime minister and his chief cabinet secretary 
said different things? 
  [Murayama] Having a prime minister and his chief cabinet 
secretary not be able to speak frankly is not desirable. But 
you know the proverb, "After rain comes fair weather." 
  [Hanaoka] People say that the bipolarization of power within 
the coalition has become clear following intraparty clashes over 
the cabinet reshuffle and the national welfare tax. Do you 
think that this bipolar structure will become fixed? 
  [Murayama] That is not what happened. It was coincidence 
that the views of the SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist Party 
[DSP], and Sakigake [Harbinger] came to agree. No, there will 
not be two polarized forces confronting each other within the 
coalition. 
  [Hanaoka] Is it correct that your party will not accept 
increasing the consumption tax rate under any circumstance? 
  [Murayama] We have not said that the consumption tax can 
never be increased under any circumstance. What must happen 
first is for the government to present a clear vision on welfare 
to the people. If the vision is acceptable to the people and if 
the tax is to be made a specific tax for the purpose of funding 
pensions, we will accept the increase. When that is done, it 
will also be necessary to revise some unfair conditions in the 
existing tax system. We are not objecting to everything. 
  [Hanaoka] How do you visualize the upcoming realignment of 
the political world? 
  [Murayama] We need to view the matter from three angles: 
maintaining the coalition government, cooperation in the 
elections, and the political world's reorganization. The basic 
condition is that we must not allow the LDP to return to power. 
Having different political ideals is no reason for the 
coalition parties to be unable to cooperate. All electoral 
districts will require flexible yet bold cooperation by the 
parties based on this basic guideline. First of all, we would 
like to form a structure wherein the coalition parties can 
cooperate in the elections. 
  [Hanaoka] What is the possibility of the coalition parties 
developing into a new, new party? 
  [Murayama] When political ideals differ, it is difficult to 
expect that. Besides, there is the possibility that the 
framework of the coalition government will change as a result of 
the next election. 
  [Hanaoka] Within the SDPJ, there are the left-wing group, 
which opposed the political reform bills, as well as the 
right-wing group, which supported them. The party appears to 
have the explosive possibility of breaking up at any time. 
  [Murayama] I regret that act of going against the party's 
agreement and voting against the political reform bills. The 
principle is that decisions which are reached after proper 
intraparty discussions should be respected. But the people who 
do not respect the decisions cannot be helped. There is now a 
general agreement in thinking that the liberals of the SDPJ and 
of the DSP should come together under one umbrella. 
  [Hanaoka] The words -- the liberals of the SDPJ and the DSP 
-- sound good, but isn't liberalism a concept of emphasizing 
protection of the weak and having big government? 
  [Murayama] No, you should not put it that way. Helping the 
weak is not something only the central government can do. That 
can be done by transferring more power to the local governments 
and having them do it. Anyway, one role of the SDPJ and DSP 
liberals is to secure social justice, which will enable the weak 
and the strong to coexist. 
  [Hanaoka] What course will the SDPJ and DSP liberals take to 
become unified? 
  [Murayama] First, the SDPJ must escape the old shell of the 
1955 regime of Japanese politics. We will have to see in which 
direction the party will change. In the course of changing, it 
is possible that the party will turn into a new party. I think 
that the political world will change several times while 
undergoing the simultaneous upper house and local government 
elections and the general elections. Forming a new party to 
contest the next general election would be one choice, even 
though I cannot imagine the possibility of the SDPJ getting 
together with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] or the LDP. 
  [Hanaoka] Within the LDP, there are some who hope that the 
next general election will be held under the current medium-size 
electoral district system. Is it not what the SDPJ wants 
really, too? 
  [Murayama] No political vacuum must be allowed to occur. If 
a situation arises wherein the prime minister is convinced that 
the only way left for him is to dissolve the Diet and hold a 
general election, then that will be unavoidable. 
  [Hanaoka] You have recently appeared on several television 
variety programs. You must be a popular man. 
  [Murayama] I don't have much more time in which to be in 
politics. What I have to is to help the party overcome this 
difficult time, create a new foundation, and then pass the baton 
to new people.

  [Text] The Japan Opinion Survey Institute, of which TOKYO 
SHIMBUN is a member, has conducted a nationwide opinion poll to 
survey the popularity of the seven-month-old Hosokawa cabinet 
and various political parties. The survey was carried out by 
interviewing respondents on 12 and 13 March. 
  The poll found that the support rate for the Hosokawa 
cabinet 
stood at 61.5 percent, only 1.3 points lower than in the last 
survey in December. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been 
often criticized for his indecisiveness -- as seen, for example, 
in announcing and then scrapping a "national welfare tax" plan, 
and in giving up a planned cabinet reshuffle. But, his cabinet 
still maintains a support rate of around 60 percent. This is 
the fifth- highest rate found for a cabinet (since the Sato 
cabinet) in opinion polls which include three carried out on the 
Hosokawa cabinet since last summer. 
  However, the proportion of respondents who did not support 
the Hosokawa cabinet increased by 7.5 points to 31.9 percent, 
the worst such rate for the Hosokawa cabinet. The respondents 
who cited "Hosokawa's lack of leadership" as their reason for 
disapproving of the cabinet almost tripled to 31 percent 
compared to the last poll. The number can be a sign that the 
popularity of the highly popular Hosokawa cabinet may be falling. 
  As for political parties, the rate of support for the 
Liberal 
Democratic Party dropped slightly compared to the last poll, 
apparently because of the arrest of former Construction Minister 
Kishiro Nakamura concerning a corruption scandal involving a 
general contractor. Meanwhile, the support rate for Sakigake 
[Harbinger], which fought the removal of Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura from the cabinet, rose substantially to 7.2 
percent. When asked their reasons for supporting the present 
cabinet, 31.9 percent (32.6 percent in the previous poll) of 
those who supported the cabinet replied "there is no other 
appropriate person to head the government," and 23.9 percent 
(20.9 percent in the last poll) said "we trust the prime 
minister."

  [Text] According to results of JIJI PRESS AGENCY's monthly 
poll revealed on 18 March, the support rate for the Hosokawa 
cabinet dropped to 49.7 percent, an 8.9-point decline compared 
with the previous survey held in February. This is the first 
time that the Hosokawa cabinet's support rate dropped below 50 
percent. The most common reason given by those interviewed in a 
survey conducted last August, when the Hosokawa administration 
was inaugurated, was that "we trust the prime minister." In the 
recent poll, however, the number of respondents who cited the 
same reason declined to 11.9 percent, showing decreasing public 
trust in the Hosokawa cabinet. 
  This is a serious situation for Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, who has been relying on the high support rate most for 
dealing with the political situation. The drop may also 
negatively affect the stalled Diet session. 
  As for political parties, support rate for the three 
coalition parties -- including the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ], which opposed the cabinet reshuffle and insisted 
on joining "the SDPJ, Democratic Socialist Pary, and liberal 
forces" -- grew. 
  The poll was conducted from 10 to 13 March by interviewing 
2,000 men and women and 68.9 percent of them responded.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Mar -- Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
held a meeting in Beijing with reporters traveling with him on 
his China trip on the evening of 19 March. Touching on the 
first drop in the cabinet's support rate below 50 percent as 
indicated in the two opinion polls conducted by the JNN [Japan 
News Network] data bank, composed of such agencies as the TBS 
[Tokyo Broadcasting System] and by the JIJI News Agency, 
Hosokawa said: "It must have been affected by such troubles as 
the National Welfare Tax and the cabinet reshuffle. Also, the 
rice issue (concerning the shortage of rice at stores). Various 
factors are involved." Then, he continued to say: "I have no 
other choice but to carry on without paying much attention to 
this. I believe what I am supposed to do is to pay attention to 
what I am doing now."

<F P=106> [Article by Akira Washio, political commentator: "Picture of </F>
Chaos"] 
  [Text] It is said that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has 
begun to keep a diary. 
  Being an ex-newspaper reporter, Mr. Hosokawa is said to have 
polished the words of apology for "the past" on the airplane 
while he was on the way to the Japan-South Korea heads of state 
conference. Writing is probably his forte. 
  His grandfather, Fumimaro Konoe, also left the "Konoe 
diary." 
  "Since the battle off the Mariana Islands centering on 
Saipan, the government and the people have been overcome with 
sorrow by the adverse tide of the war. In particular, the pain 
and anxiety regarding countermeasures for this has not been an 
easy matter for senior statesmen, not to mention the Imperial 
Palace. I intend to leave an account summarizing the actions 
related to this for future reference." 
  With the opening lines of "At Ogi villa on 5 July 1944," the 
diary thus kept spelled out the politics Konoe observed from 21 
June to 24 July 1944. It is a record about one year before the 
unconditional surrender of Japan. 
  Saying that "All my ancestors have kept diaries and 
therefore, I must at least do it verbally," Konoe seems to have 
stated verbally the exchanges with visitors that were written in 
the House of Peers memos. However, at that time, Konoe was 
promoting a scheme to overthrow the Tojo regime to contrive an 
early peace and secretly kept a diary while under surveillance 
by the military police. According to his close associates, the 
"Hosokawa diary" is preparation for writing memoirs. 
  That is why it is inviting speculation that Hosokawa has 
made 
up his mind to resign when he has done all he can. 
  Hosokawa himself spoke of these aspirations directly after 
his appointment as prime minister. 
  "I intend to embrace political reform under my right arm, 
economic reform under my left arm, and jump down from the castle 
tower." 
  The enthusiasm is strongly felt that if he can cut a way for 
political reform and economic reform which no one has been able 
to accomplish, his value as a statesman will remain even if his 
term is short. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam told Hosokawa at the 
heads of state conference in the old capital of Kyongju that 
"the mass media of South Korea are calling my reforms a 
revolution." 
  Hosokawa, who had stated at a meeting with Mayor Chirac of 
Paris that "I feel that expectations for me are not the 
expectations for a politician; they are the expectations for a 
revolutionary," gave a big nod as if he heartily agreed. 
  It is said that since Kim Yong-sam has changed the meals at 
government and ruling party leaders conferences to the frugal 
fare of three dishes of kimchi, some of the ruling party leaders 
eat lunch in their car on the way there or back. Hosokawa also 
dislikes using Japanese restaurants and scolded the deputy chief 
cabinet secretary for having made arrangements at a Japanese 
restaurant for the noon meeting of members of the political 
secretaries group. His temperament probably is already that of 
a "revolutionary." 
<H5>  Kajiyama Astounded by Ozawa </H5>
  "In the future, I want to be active as a politician." 
  On 15 November [1993], the "100th day" since the fateful day 
(6 August) when Hosokawa was chosen prime minister, Seiroku 
Kajiyama, former secretary general of the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], who had crushed political reform, was branded a 
class-A war criminal who caused the LDP to lose political power, 
and had been confined in seclusion, gathered with friendly Diet 
members like Kanezo Muraoka and Koichi Kato and proclaimed "the 
end of mourning." 
  For the LDP, which has lost its hold on political power and 
is under the complete control of Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general 
of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], who is taking advantage of 
the LDP's despondency, Kajiyama's comeback must be like the 
return of its strong arm. It is probably like the return to the 
battleline of a leading soccer player who had been red-carded 
and ejected from the game. 
  Kajiyama seems to have analyzed Ozawa's methods intently. He 
is amazed by Ozawa's quick attack, saying, "At any rate, he is 
extremely fast. He anticipates necessary measures a step ahead 
of time." 
  Kajiyama's return to the battleline also means that the 
Obuchi faction that seemed to have been emasculated and was 
degraded to a small faction has jumped out to the front of the 
political situation. That will no doubt complicate the rumors of 
political reorganization that have been swirling around 
Nagata-cho. 
  Political reform has sucked the life's blood of many, such 
as 
Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  A political reform-related bill that answered the prayers of 
Hosokawa has passed the House of Representatives, but still is 
awaiting "the wolf at the back door," the House of Councillors. 
  The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has the power in 
the House of Councillors. Even if the House of Representatives 
has removed the LDP "1955 rule," the House of Councillors can be 
still under the LDP "1955 rule." If 10 people from the SDPJ in 
the House of Councillors turn to opposition, the bill will be 
killed. 
  There is another big hurdle. 
  It is "district division." 
  If the political reform-related bill is approved and an 
advisory council to demarcate district division is established, 
there is a view that "district division" will be carried out 
smoothly because this council is a third party organ; however, 
since there is an obligation under the Constitution that 
"district division," upon which the life or death of Diet 
members depend, be determined by law, they must once more be put 
before the Diet. 
  Thus, there is a great possibility that political 
reorganization will occur surrounding "district division." 
Whether political reform is realized or collapsed, there will be 
price whichever way it turns. 
  If Morihiro Hosokawa risks his own political life, it will 
be 
the crucial moment for the LDP of whether or not the party 
itself can survive. The SDPJ also is right in the middle of a 
battle risking its existence. 
  There probably no longer is a way for the LDP to get back 
political power independently as before. Thus, there are not 
many ways for the LDP to survive. 
  Unless it would be satisfiedtobe the strongest opposition 
party forever, reorganization will probably be the only way. It 
needs to create a "new LDP" with the LDP as an axis and come 
back to the seat of political power to recapture the power. 
This road is further divided into two paths. It is the choice of 
creating a regime that has booted out the detested Ichiro Ozawa 
and Komeito, or uniting with Ozawa. 
  The bloodshot eyes of the LDP are being directed toward 
political reorganization, but there have been actions in the 
coalition ruling party that are in sympathy with this as well. 
<H5>  Takemura Acts Fiercely </H5>
  Among them, the actions of Sakigake [Harbinger] Party 
representative, Masayoshi Takemura (chief cabinet secretary) 
have been intense. 
  Takemura has met secretly with former Deputy Prime Minister 
Masaharu Gotoda whom he reveres as a mentor. 
  When Takemura joined the Ministry of Home Affairs, Gotoda, 
who was the director of the Local Tax Bureau, was the examiner. 
His friendship is implied in the words "I probably am an 
unworthy disciple." 
  Incidentally, the one who interviewed him was Yosoji 
Kobayashi, administrative vice minister of the Home Affairs 
Ministry. Takemura recollects that Kobayashi teased Takemura, 
who was already married, asking him, "Did you study for the test 
in bed with your wife?" 
  There is no doubt about such a mentor-disciple relationship, 
but the talks between Takemura and Gotoda really smell fishy. 
  "What does Ichiro Ozawa think? Where will he take Japan 
after 
he has completed political reform?" 
  The concerns of the two are concentrated on an analysis of 
the intentions and aims of Ozawa who now is the linchpin of the 
coalition regime. 
  After the July [1993] general election when the LDP lost its 
majority, Takemura was intent on having "Gotoda" as the standard 
bearer. Now it seems that he is endeavoring to enlist the help 
of Gotoda to complete political reform. 
  When this Masayoshi Takemura proposed a compromise of "275" 
in the authorized number of single-seat constituencies between 
the "250" of the government's bill and the "300" proposed by the 
LDP, no one doubted that the Hosokawa cabinet was resolved to 
settle political reform by any means. 
  However, the concealed aim of what should be called the risk 
of political reorganization is hidden in Takemura's "275." 
  "If it is 275, 150 will follow along from the LDP." 
  It is said that Takemura frequently met with boss Hiroshi 
Mitsuzuka and Masajuro Shiokawa of the former faction to which 
he was affiliated, and in addition, Toshiki Kaifu and others. 
  He has also been meeting secretly with Yoshiaki Kibe, who is 
a close associate of Yasuhiro Nakasone and is serving as 
chairman of the General Council, and with Yoshitaka Yotsumoto, 
president of Sanko Construction Industries, who has become a 
supporter of Hosokawa and Takemura. 
<H5>  Break With Ozawa and Ichikawa </H5>
  Takemura's concept of reorganization is said to be as 
follows: 
  "Break off relations with Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, 
secretary general of Komeito, add the Constitution safeguard 
group of the LDP and the liberal group of the SDPJ, and take up 
political power again." 
  In numbers, it will exceed a majority if a total of 150 from 
the LDP follow along, the liberals of the SDPJ, the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP], and then if Japan New Party and Sakigake 
are added. 
  A force that would still support Hosokawa, or Kaifu, or 
Gotoda, defend the Constitution, and create a rather stable 
Japan would take political power. 
  The aim is to distance themselves from Shinseito and Komeito 
and exhaust themselves in reorganizing political power. 
  If they kick out Hosokawa, it will be a coup d'etat, but 
since the Japan New Party becomes an indispensable element in 
this concept, a correct interpretation probably would be a 
"rearrangement" of the coalition regime. 
  It was indeed during that time SANKEI SHIMBUN wrote in its 
article titled, "A Matter of LDP Leaders," that Ichiro Ozawa, 
Shinseito representative secretary general, sounded out Noda 
(Takeshi Noda, LDP chief director of House of Representatives Ad 
Hoc Committee on Political Reform) about "275." 
  Ozawa was angry. 
  Saying that "It is incorrect to use facts that are different 
from my own opinion to dilute it," Ozawa shut out the SANKEI 
SHIMBUN from the press conference along with NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN which had written on the rice problem that Ozawa was 
aware of the government bill which would conditionally permit 
tariffication without exception. 
  The expression, "dilute," has been a part that cannot be 
explained from the context. 
  However, Ozawa's feelings become clear if one reads it as 
"to 
dilute the fact that it is an (LDP) scheme." 
  Gotoda himself paid no heed, saying, "I too am a politician. 
If I were younger, I might do it (be prime minister), but the 
future will be the age for the generation born since 1935." He 
probably means that he is no longer interested in participating 
in the scheme. 
  However, it was just a half year ago, that Ichiro Ozawa, who 
was still in the LDP, encouraged "Gotoda." 
  It was during the long weekend at the end of April that 
Sadao 
Hirano, a House of Councillors Diet member who is Ozawa's 
right-hand man, had a talk with Sadao Yamahana, chairman of the 
SDPJ. 
  [Hirano] We are thinking of going with Gotoda. We would like 
your kind regards. 
  [Yamahana] Really? 
  Hirano immediately met Ichiro Ozawa and reported, "I 
conveyed 
to him that we are going with Gotoda." Opening wide his narrow 
eyes, Ozawa muttered, "You said something really drastic." 
  There cannot be any conflict of interest between Ozawa and 
Hirano. 
  Ozawa met secretly with Gotoda without delay. There is no 
way 
to know what they discussed, but from the circumstances at the 
time, the following conversation was probably exchanged. 
  [Ichiro Ozawa] We must realize political reform. I am not 
one 
who fears disorder, but neigher am I one who particularly 
desires disorder. If you accept, we will act together. 
  [Masaharu Gotoda] I appreciate your feelings, Ozawa. 
However, 
I have a health problem. Let me think about it. 
  Gotoda later sounded out Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama 
and others. 
  Kajiyama read that Gotoda had a secret understanding with 
Ozawa and others and bared his hostility, saying, "Gotoda is 
ambitious. I will knock him down." 
  Ultimately, Gotoda's heart ailment worsened and he gave it 
up. 
  Ozawa and others revealed the impression that "After all 
Gotoda is also a bureaucrat." In the end, he became firm in his 
resolve to fight, even if it meant spliting the LDP. 
  When the Takeshita cabinet fell and it appeared that 
Masayoshi Ito would be entrusted as the successor, Ito, although 
he was interested, bowed to the entreaties of his wife who was 
worried about his health and sacrificed the premiership. He was 
criticized as a very stubborn man of Aizu, "the fellow who gave 
the boot to the premiership," but there was also strong 
criticism that if he were a politician, he should have accepted 
it, even if he risked his life for it. 
  There probably was the thought that like Ito, Gotoda was 
fleeing from the most momentous hour. 
<H5>  Nervous Hosokawa </H5>
  It is natural that Ozawa would try to confine the actions of 
Takemura, but it is said that Hosokawa also was nervous about 
those actions. 
  Political reform is approaching the crucial moment and 
problems have been surging up like "tsunami" with the opening of 
the rice market, recovery of the economy, and raise in the 
consumption tax rate, but those are issues which must be 
surmounted whoever takes political power. The collapse of the 
LDP is welcomed, but the coalition regime must not collapse 
along with it. 
  Hosokawa and Ozawa are keeping in perfect time with each 
other. It is said that the two talk with each other on the 
telephone twice a day. 
  Ozawa's close associate says, "Hosokawa listens to whatever 
Ozawa says." Meanwhile, reports of a falling out between 
Hosokawa and Takemura are running around political circles. 
Takemura does not deny the rumor either; he says, "The Prime 
Minister does not tell me everything he discusses with Ozawa." 
  Because the chief cabinet secretary has the role of a wife 
to 
the prime minister, one is apt to think that they are on good 
terms, but in reality that is not always true. But Hosokawa and 
Takemura are very friendly. They have lunch together and come 
face to face with each other several times a day. 
  There probably is no breach between them, but since Hosokawa 
"has the habit of changing the people upon whom he depends" 
(those around the prime minister), the rumor seems to be uttered 
with some credibility. 
  The fact that Hosokawa has doggedly excluded the Takemura 
route of groping for a compromise with the LDP is being 
mentioned as proof of the switch to Ozawa. 
<H5>  Watanabe Draws Close to Ozawa </H5>
  It was a shocking event that Michio Watanabe, former deputy 
prime minister, tried to participate as a nonpartisan in the 
"General Economic Policy Research Committee" (Takeo Nishioka, 
chairman) planned by Tetsuo Yamaguchi, who is close to 
Shinseito. 
  Ultimately, Watanabe decided not to participate due to 
opposition in the faction, but a picture linking Ozawa and 
Watanabe by an underground channel has been brought into relief. 
  When Watanabe fought with Kiichi Miyazawa and Hiroshi 
Mitsuzuka for the post-Kaifu spot, he felt a debt of gratitude 
to him, saying, "Ozawa was the only one who recommended me." 
  Nakasone, who hates Ozawa, is enraged by the sudden 
closeness 
of the two and has warned him: "If you want to become prime 
minister, break it off with Ozawa." Nakasone once approved 
recommending him in the LDP presidential election on the 
condition that Watanabe dissociate himself from Ozawa. 
  Such being the case, Watanabe is suspected of having "an 
alliance" with Ozawa one of these days, and there is a view that 
if Watanabe should be routed out of the LDP, the spark of life 
in the LDP will go out. Some say that is exactly the Ozawa 
strategy. 
  However, it is also said that the unprecedented strategy of 
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was behind Watanabe's 
decision to participate in the research committee. 
  The story has been whispered with plausibility that Nakasone 
revealed, "I joined the Sato cabinet as minister of transport, 
leaping to a spot within sword's distance. Now, I think that I 
will try leaping to the bosom of Ozawa." 
  It is not certain whether Nakasone was "serious," or that 
Nakasone, whom Ozawa regards as a "bitter enemy," will be 
accepted, but there is former Prime Minister Takeshita who never 
criticizes Ozawa, saying,"We never know when we may join hands 
again." 
  The LDP, which is being beaten about in the throes of death, 
continues to spew every possible measure for survival. 
  How will this "picture of chaos" be depicted in the 
"Hosokawa 
diary"?

<F P=106> ["Discussion" between Shigezo Hayasaka, political </F>
commentator, and Shoichi Watanabe, Sophia University professor; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Watanabe] When I think about Hosokawa, it isn't 
his abilities or his intelligence that come to mind, but his 
lineage. Half of his ancestors were court nobles, and the other 
half, feudal lords. The fact that he's descended from court 
nobles means that he's the type of person who has no sense of 
obligation. If court nobles had had a sense of obligation, they 
would have suffered the same fate as Masashige Kusunoki 
[1294-1336] and Yoshisada Nitta [1301-1338] [feudal lords whose 
loyalty to the emperor shortened their lives]. He is happy to 
join forces with anyone who is willing to back him, even Ozawa. 
But when the second Hosokawa cabinet is formed, if there's 
someone around who can set the stage, Hosokawa might be 
perfectly willing to join forces with the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP]. 
  [Hayasaka] Yes, you're right. When I take a good, long look 
at Hosokawa the politician, I'm amazed at his toughness. This 
has nothing at all to do with intelligence, experience in 
politics, or leadership ability. He is, basically, a mediocre 
man who is ambitious, who is an opportunist, and who likes to 
perform, but he has strength that you won't find in an ordinary 
person. In the first place, he is a total amateur, as far as 
running a nation is concerned. Amateurs are fearless. If the 
media, women, and children urge them on, they'll pick up a 
red-hot poker without a moment's hesitation. And they won't feel 
the heat. That's the kind of strength I'm talking about, and 
Hosokawa has it. 
  In the second place, there's his lineage. He was a lord even 
before he was born. And the blood of court nobles is flowing 
through his veins, too. So, when he's riding in his palanquin 
when a freezing wind is blowing, it doesn't even occur to him to 
think about his bearers, about how they are suffering. He 
doesn't give a thought to the farmers, on the verge of 
starvation, their fingers bleeding, who weave the straw sandals 
his bearers wear. To him, that is the natural order of things. 
He doesn't feel any gratitude or obligation. He feels no 
compassion toward people who have worked hard for him. When they 
have outlived their usefulness, he casts them aside. He doesn't 
feel guilty about that. He doesn't care. That's where his 
strength lies. 
  [Watanabe] There aren't many Japanese capable of such 
behavior now. Well, we can give him points for being a rarity 
(laughter). 
  [Hayasaka] For instance, during the election, his necktie 
got 
worn out, so he went into a shop to buy a new one. The salesgirl 
showed him dozens of neckties, but he said he didn't like any of 
them, and nonchalantly walked out of the shop. His secretary, 
who was nearby, jumped up and ran after Lord Hosokawa, grabbing 
his sleeve as he was about to get into his car. 
  When the secretary told him, "Even if you don't like them, 
don't you think you should buy two or three? This is election 
time, you know." Hosokawa replied, "I don't care," and got into 
the car. He's not concerned about what people think of him. 
  [Watanabe] And it's his lineage that allows him to get away 
with that kind of behavior. If he weren't Lord Hosokawa, nobody 
would lionize him. 
  [Hayasaka] That's right. Even today, the Japanese are easily 
swayed by a lord. 
  [Watanabe] In other words, the support he has now is based 
on 
totally different standards than the support he received in the 
past. Until the time of Tadaoki Hosokawa [1563-1645], the 
Hosokawas fought side-by-side with their soldiers, and they had 
compassion. That's why, when they entered Kiyomasa Kato's 
[1562-1611] domain in Higo [present-day Kumamoto], and learned 
how much affection the people of Higo had for Kiyomasa, the 
first thing they did was to erect a statue of Kiyomasa. Once 
upon a time, the Hosokawas were that thoughtful. Then, after 
about 10 or so generations, they settled into true "lord mode." 
Furthermore, half of Hosokawa's ancestors were members of the 
highest ranking of the five regent families, so entirely 
different principles are at work here. 
  [Hayasaka] He bears a striking similarity to Kiichi 
Miyazawa, 
you know. They are both emotionless, a characteristic rare among 
the Japanese. Neither of them will go out of his way to help 
someone else. They don't get their hands dirty. They don't look 
after their relatives. I'm running out of negatives (laughter). 
  [Watanabe] But at least Miyazawa was able to produce a 
polite 
smile. Hosokawa doesn't smile if he doesn't want to. 
  [Hayasaka] This is the first time in the postwar era that 
we've had a leader like him. The Japanese people don't know what 
to make of him, either. 
  [Watanabe] I think that Ozawa's biggest worry now is that, 
if 
he lets his guard down, Hosokawa may just team up with the LDP. 
  [Hayasaka] That's why Ozawa is now acting as an 
intermediary, 
trying to muster support for Hosokawa, so that the foolish bird 
won't go to roost elsewhere. That is probably the basis for the 
"Hosokawa-Ozawa honeymoon" rumor. Ozawa is fully aware of 
Hosokawa's true colors. Once Ozawa has served his purpose, 
Hosokawa could team up with the LDP at any time. But nobody's 
going to buy that (laughter). 
  [Watanabe] And Hosokawa can do that without any pangs of 
conscience. It's important to remember that. 
  [Hayasaka] But the paradox here is that that kind of 
behavior 
gives strength to a leader. It's a feat that very few people 
could accomplish. 
  [Watanabe] It's a real advantage. If an ordinary person 
could 
get into that frame of mind, he'd be a genius (laughter). 
  [Hayasaka] Ozawa was in a real bind. He backed Hosokawa 
because there simply wasn't anyone else he could back. The 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] lost half of its seats 
in the 1993 election, so Ozawa had to embrace the Japan New 
Party to save himself from ruin. Otherwise, there would have 
been no coalition government. He couldn't back Tsutomu Hata. 
Why? Because the idiots, the leftwingers (actually, the 
conservatives) in the SDPJ, declared that they couldn't stomach 
a leader of the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. So, who would 
head the coalition government? The only choice was Lord 
Hosokawa. That's how it was. An air pocket formed in the 
greatest political turbulence since World War II, and Hosokawa 
fell right into it. The inevitability of fate. Hosokawa is 
blessed with amazingly good luck. 
  [Watanabe] The odds are overwhelmingly against any given 
person's becoming prime minister (laughter). 
  [Hayasaka] As the saying goes, it takes 1,000 days to train 
a 
soldier, but he is used only for half a day. In the past, that's 
the way the bosses of LDP factions operated, more or less, in 
their quests for power. They intoned the ancient proverb, 
"heaven-sent opportunities are less valuable than natural 
advantages; natural advantages are less valuable than the unity 
of men," and vied with each other. Hosokawa hasn't done any of 
that. He came in on a tail wind, backed by his media 
cheerleaders and the gloomy national mood. They say that you 
make your own luck, but it's impossible to compete with anyone 
that lucky. The gods are capricious, aren't they. 
  [Watanabe] Hosokawa has a big advantage in diplomacy, 
because 
he announced that Japan waged a war of aggression. The Americans 
don't really believe that Japan waged a war of aggression. Even 
MacArthur said, "that was not a war of aggression," when he 
returned to the United States. Even if he hadn't said that, the 
United States would still be regretting having dropped the 
atomic bombs and having conducted indiscriminate bombing raids. 
Then, when an idiot comes along, saying, "that was a war of 
aggression," anyone would find it easy to feel sympathetic 
toward him. That's one consideration. 
  The other is that foreigners are drawn toward people with 
noble backgrounds, believe it or not, just as the Japanese are 
fascinated by British royalty. Even if that royalty is not 
particularly beloved in the home country. In Great Britain, 
there are many people who despise class distinctions. But the 
Americans like royalty, and they have nothing to lose by doing 
so. 
  Hirobumi Ito [1841-1909], who was well aware of that 
inclination, instituted a peerage system to replace the 
daimyo [feudal lords] system, which had been 
abolished by the Meiji government. The Japanese diplomats who 
suddenly appeared were not well received by the world's more 
advanced nations at first. But when they announced themselves as 
Count or Prince So-and-So, then they were received properly. 
It's likely that other countries have data showing that Hosokawa 
is a descendant of the oldest daimyo family in Japan, 
and that his mother's side is of noble lineage, and that the 
word has gotten around. Anyone with a distinguished family 
background can rest assured that he will be treated well abroad. 
  [Hayasaka] But when you observe Hosokawa, you notice that 
there's no one around him, no supporter-advisers. He's really 
the emperor with no clothes. For instance, Hayato Ikeda 
[1899-1965, prime minister from 1960-64] boasted staunch 
support, mainly from Shigesaburo Maeo [1899-1981], with whom he 
had toiled at the Tax Bureau [Finance Ministry], and also from 
Yasumi Kurogane [1910-1986], Masayoshi Ohira, Kiichi Miyazawa, 
Zenko Suzuki, and Masaya Ito. In the business world, he had the 
support of the "four financial kings" of the times, Ataru 
Kobayashi [1899-1981] of Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance, Takeshi 
Sakurada [1904-85] of Nisshinbo, Shigeo Nagano [1900-84] of 
Nippon Steel, Shigeo Mizuno [1899-1972] of Sankei, Tsuneo 
Okumura [1903-72] of Nomura Securities, and Yasuzaemon Matsunaga 
[1875-1971] (the electric power demon). Scholars like Osamu 
Shimomura [1910-89], Seiichi Tobata [1899-1983], and Hiromi 
Arisawa [1896-1988] came forth to support Ikeda, because they 
felt that his awkwardness and forthrightness might get him into 
trouble. That was an unprecedented, brilliant array of 
supporters. 
  Kakuei Tanaka also surrounded himself with a group of 
seasoned "generals," headed by his "treasurer," Eiichi Nishimura 
[1904-71], a stubborn old geezer, and including Kiichi Aichi 
[1907-73], Tomisaburo Hashimoto [1901-90], and Susumu Nikaido. 
But if you look at Hosokawa, you see that there isn't anyone 
around him. He is truly an emperor with no clothes. 
  [Watanabe] Only Yuriko Koike (laughter). 
  [Hayasaka] Well, isn't he through with her (laughter)? 
Tetsuhisa Matsuzaki [a political commentator], who was betrayed 
by Hosokawa, said that, in the 1993 election, even a monkey 
could have gotten elected running on the Japan New Party slate. 
I don't think he said that out of spite. That's really the way 
the Japan New Party is. There are only two representatives who 
have insight and a proven track record -- Kunitaro Takeda, who 
is a specialist on agriculture problems, and Yoshio Terasawa, 
the former head of Nomura Securities U.S. operations, who knows 
about money. All you can say about the others is they are 
bursting with happiness and emotion at their good fortune, and 
they smile sweetly. That's about it. The Japan New Party is an 
elite collection of people with zero achievements. 
  [Watanabe] If I had to force myself to find something good 
to 
say about Hosokawa, the collapse of the Soviet Union threw Japan 
into confusion, as though the world had been turned upside down. 
If we look at the Meiji Restoration as a past event of the same 
magnitude, we recall that the elder statesmen of that time 
didn't have any experience, either. But the Restoration 
government continued, because the current carried it forward. If 
I had to come up with a defense for Hosokawa, that's what I 
would say. 
  [Hayasaka] If the wind blows the right way, the Hosokawa 
government will continue. That's a brilliant conclusion. Until 
now, Japan has been a sticky, cohesive nation -- a "village" 
society, a society of relatives, a union of tightly knit 
circles. It had bosses who knew what was what, and who had 
chalked up a lot of experience. So dependable. The bosses had 
experienced both the bitterness and the sweetness of life. 
Everything revolved around them. But that system has now been 
destroyed, and has fallen down with a crash. 
  [Watanabe] The most readily understood example would be 
food-supply security. Japan was determined not to import even 
one grain of foreign rice, but now we've been forced to import 
more than a million tons. All the arguments for protecting 
agriculture have flown out the window. In other words, the idea 
of food-supply security has become meaningless. 
  [Hayasaka] The Japanese people have changed, too. They no 
longer obey when the boss orders them, "Just do what I tell you. 
Vote for the candidates I tell you to vote for." That's what 
happens in a highly educated society. Members of the generation 
born under the new Constitution have come to the forefront in 
huge numbers. People born in the Meiji, Taisho, and early Showa 
eras wield much less influence now. Women have been a major 
force behind change. Many women want justice in its simplest 
sense. But they can see only one kilometer ahead of them, at the 
most, and many of them are easily fooled by the mass media, 
which subsist on form rather than substance, and on hypocrisy. 
  [Watanabe] They think that they're getting an education by 
watching Hiroshi Kume [a popular newscaster who interprets 
current events]. 
  [Hayasaka] Yes. When election time comes around, more women 
than men go to the polls. Now the "female culture" is upon us 
with a vengeance. Politicians and political parties will be in 
trouble if they offend women, and alienate them. 
  [Watanabe] To give a more concrete example, when you, Mr. 
Hayasaka, were Kakuei Tanaka's secretary, you probably couldn't 
have envisioned a female LDP representative in the lower house. 
  [Hayasaka] That's right. Except for the upper house, the 
entrance of a woman into the struggle for control of the manor, 
the lower house, would have been unthinkable. 
  [Watanabe] But it happened. 
  [Hayasaka] My theory about Hosokawa is that the emergence of 
a prime minister like him is a sign of the times. Somehow, he 
makes a good showing. In Seattle, standing with the leaders of 
other nations, wearing his daughter's muffler, he seemed taller 
than they. His wild hair makes a better impression than it would 
if it were plastered down with hair tonic. Or at least there are 
more women now who think so. When you see this sort of thing 
happening, you realize that democracy is the rule of the 
ignorant multitudes. 
  [Watanabe] Even in England, in the days when decisions made 
by Parliament stood out for their excellence, the electorate 
consisted solely of members of the gentry (land owners and all 
those of higher status). At that time, the British Parliament 
made the best political decisions by far. After World War II, it 
ceased to be remarkable. It became just average. The same is 
true for every nation. 
  Another point is that when the Constitution changed, and the 
primogeniture system was thrown out, the problem of providing 
for the elderly emerged. Once upon a time, even in the Tohoku 
countryside, even in the poorest household, parents didn't need 
to worry about their old age if they had even one son. 
  [Hayasaka] The introduction of the equal division of 
inheritance was the source of many evils. It simply uprooted 
Japan's fine, time-honored tradition which had families helping 
each other, and caring for parents in their old age, with the 
eldest son at the center. 
  [Watanabe] Everybody's business is nobody's business. 
Collective responsibility is irresponsibility. 
  [Hayasaka] Precisely. This may seem outrageous, but Japan is 
on the verge of becoming a "sand society" like the United 
States. The United States is a society of drifters. Without 
self-assertion, it would collapse. Everything has to be sharply 
defined. All the young Cinderellas and their male counterparts 
are dreaming of success. That trend is swiftly encroaching on 
Japan. The mass media have become a huge monster, and they have 
the masses right where they want them: blowing a tiny trumpet of 
justice. 
  I have no intention of condemning Hosokawa, but compared 
with 
Japan's traditional leaders, he is an unlikely one. When that 
opportunist senses danger, it is entirely possible that, led by 
Mumin Papa [a character from a Finnish cartoon book about 
trolls, whom Takemura is said to resemble], Masayoshi Takemura, 
Hosokawa will jump on the LDP bandwagon. 
  [Watanabe] Looking back, I think that the LDP erred in not 
creating a television news program to combat the Tetsuya 
Chikushi [a journalist turned newscaster] and Hiroshi Kume 
programs, one with a completely different outlook. For instance, 
why hasn't there been even one program run by you, Mr. Hayasaka, 
or someone like you? Clearly, the party was overconfident. The 
informal discussion programs they used to have on Sunday have 
suddenly disappeared. The news bureaus say they don't want them, 
because they don't agree with the ideas that are presented. They 
say that in no uncertain terms. When the LDP was governing, 
Chikushi's program was on, Kume's program was on. The LDP had 
enough power to insist that there be a Hayasaka program, or a 
Kotaro Tawara [a newscaster who specializes in politics] program. 
  [Hayasaka] Never mind about me, but that was probably the 
overconfidence that stems from being in power for such a long 
time. 
  [Watanabe] The LDP was too optimistic. 
  [Hayasaka] Behind arrogance there is always weakness. And 
they're regretting it now. Isn't that the story? When they woke 
up, the Communist Party had taken control of the Japan 
Federation of Commercial Broadcast Workers' Unions. 
  [Watanabe] The LDP just sat by while anti-Kume and 
anti-Chikushi programs disappeared. 
  [Hayasaka] That's right. But, without question, this is the 
first time that we've had a leader with such a weak party base, 
a leader who seems to be floating around in a state of 
weightlessness. 
  [Watanabe] Japan is the sort of nation that can make 
strengths out of "emptiness" and "hollowness." That's why 
Hosokawa was able to summon up the nerve to talk about opening 
up the rice market. He has no power base to lose, and no past 
obligations, so he can say anything he wants. And then came the 
"divine wind," if you will, which produced a situation which 
prompted the emergency importation of foreign rice. That enabled 
Hosokawa to broach a subject, rice, that no postwar politician 
ever dared to before him. 
  [Hayasaka] Luck was with him once again. The worst harvest 
in 
Aomori and Hokkaido since the Tenmei famine [1782-87] has given 
Hosokawa a prominent place in the annals of history. 
  [Watanabe] And it happened just in time for the Uruguay 
Round 
negotiations. Looking at the situation in the long term, one 
might think that gods sent Prime Minister Hosokawa to Japan from 
heaven. 
  [Hayasaka] So it would seem. 
  [Watanabe] "Emptiness" and "hollowness" are viewed as 
strengths in Japan. In a normal nation, "emptiness" means 
"nothingness." 
  [Hayasaka] And that is what's right there in front of our 
eyes. 
  [Watanabe] That's right.

<F P=106> ["Discussion" between Seiichiro Saito, professor at Rikkyo </F>
University, and Takanori Mizuno Takanori Mizuno, international 
finance critic; place and date not given: "No Time To Spare for 
Banks on Verge of Crisis"] 
  [Excerpts] Viewed from the standpoint of bad-debt 
ratio, Japan's banks have already crossed the critical line. It 
is even conceivable that some large banks could go bankrupt 
during 1994. The question is, what specific ideas should be 
formulated for the process of dealing with these bad loans, a 
process that can no longer afford a moment's delay? 
<H5>  Is a Banking Crisis Already in Progress? </H5>
  [Saito] I believe that the biggest hurdle for the Japanese 
economy to overcome in the next two years--1994 and 1995--is the 
task of normalizing its financial system. What is important in 
this connection is to make a sharp distinction between 
"normalization" and "stabilization." The Ministry of Finance 
[MOF], judging from its known position, would inevitably try to 
stabilize the financial system at any cost, but my point is that 
the proper order dictates normalization first, followed by 
stabilization. 
  Land prices will probably continue to decline even further 
in 
the days ahead, and surely there will be some bank failures. To 
date, the bankruptcy cases involving Kamaishi Credit 
Association, Toyo Credit Association, and Toho Sogo Bank have 
had to be dealt with already, but I suspect that there will be 
several bankruptcy cases involving much larger financial 
institutions. If that should happen, any mistake in handling 
would lead to dire consequences; this is why I say that the 
ground rules and methodology for the handling of such an 
eventuality must be clearly established now before it is too 
late. Yet both the Bank of Japan [BOJ] and MOF are doing no 
such thing; they are simply hoping for the best. 
  Some financial institutions are gradually beginning to think 
about the question of how to ensure their survival through their 
own efforts, but I think they are still a small minority. 
  [Mizuno] I, for one, believe that the present situation 
essentially is a banking crisis. 
  [Saito] On a par in scale with the previous one known as the 
"Showa Depression"? 
  [Mizuno] I do not intend to make such a comparison in that 
the previous one occurred when the financial system as well as 
the entire economic system were far less mature than they are 
today; I do believe, however, that our current crisis is at 
least as bad as, if not more serious than, the banking crisis 
the United States had in the second half of the 1980's and 
through 1991. I also believe that our current crisis is totally 
beyond remedy. 
  [Saito] For sure the situation is deteriorating. 
  [Mizuno] The 4 January [1994] issue of the YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
reported the bad-debt ratios, figured in percentage of total 
outstanding loans, of 11 city banks. If this report is 
accurate, the ratios are as follows: 15.5 percent for Hokkaido 
Takushoku Bank, 9.2 percent for Daiwa Bank, 8.0 percent for 
Sakura Bank, 6.7 percent for Fuji Bank, and 6.3 percent for 
Tokai Bank. The average for the 11 banks is 5.9 percent. Five 
of the 11 banks have ratios higher than 6 percent. 
  [Saito] Anything over 6 percent is dangerous. 
  [Mizuno] At the height of bad-debt ratios among 10 major 
banks during the banking crisis in the United States, Citibank 
recorded the highest ratio of 5.72 percent in 1990. At that 
time, the U.S. banking authorities became nervous about the 
possibility of Citibank going bankrupt. 
  Meanwhile, in the case of Japan, the amount of bad debts 
Mitsubishi Bank reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission [SEC] was 1.7 times the amount made public in Japan 
in accordance with domestic standards. So, if the total amount 
of bad debts being carried by 21 major Japanese banks was 
estimated by taking into account the unpublicized portions, the 
figure could reach 40 trillion yen. 
  [Saito] I, too, estimate the figure to be around 40 trillion 
yen. If so, it will push the bad-debt ratio up to 10 percent. 
  [Mizuno] That figure is extremely high when compared to 
Citibank's 5.72 percent. In terms of actual amounts, the total 
value of bad assets held by all of U.S. banks as of June 1993 
was less than 11 trillion yen. 
  [Saito] Which means that Japanese banks are stuck with 
nearly 
four times as much bad assets as those held by U.S. banks -- 
eight times as much if the difference in scale of the two 
countries' economies is factored in. 
  [Mizuno] Even that fact alone is reason enough to warrant 
much more serious attention to the current problem of bad assets 
being held by Japan's banks. 
  [Saito] But in the case of Japanese banks, they have a 
mind-set that counts on "the authorities" as the last resort. 
It is the mentality of believing that the BOJ will come to 
their rescue when the chips are down. This belief, which sets 
the BOJ apart from the FRB [Federal Reserve Bank] and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC] of the United 
States, gives them a sense of security. 
  [Mizuno] In the United States, the disposition of banks' bad 
assets is subject to very strict conditions demanded by the 
banking authorities. 
  [Saito] Looking at the current state of Japanese banks, one 
finds that the second regional banks (formerly known as "sogo 
banks" or "mutual loan and savings banks") in urban areas -- 
especially in the Tokyo metropolitan area, the Kinki region, and 
the Chukyo region -- have purchased a lot of land at high 
prices. It was in the final phase of the bubble economy that 
they invested heavily in land speculation projects. In 
contrast, credit associations have escaped with relatively fewer 
bad loans of this kind. Then there is another problem created 
by agricultural sector financial intitutions through their 
excessive lending to housing developers. 
  But there is a slight difference in perception between you, 
Mr. Mizuno, and me: that is, my view is that the present 
condition is still in the polypoid stage. If left unattended, 
however, it will develop into an active cancer, which could very 
well spread from second regional banks and agricultural 
financial institutions to the three main sectors of banking -- 
the city bank, the long-term credit bank, and the trust bank. 
  An incision must be performed quickly before it is too late, 
but neither the MOF nor the BOJ has had the experience of 
performing major surgical operations in the postwar era. What 
they have been doing is limited to minor, inconsequential 
procedures. Even that sort of treatment requires complicated 
operations. Given their meager surgical skills, however, they 
are now lost as to what to do about the case on hand. If 
nothing is done about it, I think a cancer is bound to develop. 
  [Mizuno] I believe a cancer has already developed. 
<H5>  The American Experience </H5>
  [Saito] In any event, the time for an incision is nearing. 
It had better be done within the next one to two years; I 
believe a radical treatment is absolutely necessary within the 
next two years at the latest. 
  [Mizuno] But the steps now being contemplated by everyone 
concerned in Japan -- the MOF, the banks, and the real estate 
industry -- are essentially based on a PKO [ price-keeping 
operation] concept, it seems. They are not trying to root out 
the ills of asset deflation; rather, their idea is to halt the 
progress of asset deflation by means of a PKO measure or to 
generate a mini-bubble. I think this is a fundamentally wrong 
approach. 
  A PKO measure was tried for fear of falling stock prices, 
but 
when it became clear that such a measure was absolutely futile 
in the market place, it was called off. In the handling of the 
problem of land, too, the Real Estate Resolution Corporation 
(RERC), which is already in place, and the idea of using 
government funds, which is currently under study, are basically 
"land PKO" measures. With this kind of measures, however, the 
problem of bad assets cannot be resolved. The situation will 
continue on as it is now 
  In the United States, a similar situation was dealt with by 
the following measures: first, the market functions were fully 
utilized; second, the administrative authorities wasted no time 
in pressuring bank managers to dispose of their bad assets. 
  With respect to the market functions, the banks in the 
United 
States sold off their bad assets even at a loss due to 
significant decline in real estate prices. In contrast, right 
now the banks and the authorities in Japan are afraid of the 
falling land prices; as long as such fear rules, they will never 
be able to dispose of their land holdings. [passage omitted] 
  Real estate holdings cannot be made liquid if market 
functions are ignored. This is why I believe that the policy 
designed to restore land's liquidity currently under 
consideration in Japan will never work. 
  [Saito] The problem requires more than taxation schemes such 
as the lowering of the so-called land transfer tax and the 
abolishment of the land value tax. The first requisite is to 
bring land prices down. But this point is not understood. 
Obviously everybody is afraid of losing money. 
  [Mizuno] I think so, too. In the United States, newspapers 
such as THE WALL STREET JOURNAL carry public notices on items 
put up for sale by the RTC [Resolution Trust Corp.]. The 
notices give a detailed listing of the items for sale as well as 
contact instructions. The would-be buyers are also told that if 
they do not hear from the RTC within so many days there would be 
no deal. This shows how aggressively and undaunted by falling 
prices the RTC, despite being a government agency, pushed the 
sale of these properties under their receivership. The RTC also 
took over the banks that are either bankrupt or carrying 
excessive debt, and proceeded to liquidate such banks by selling 
off their bad assets. 
  Another thing is that, in the United States, securities 
firms 
are playing a share of the role in the liquidation of bank 
properties. Incidentally, securities firms are involved in 
nearly all aspects of the bank's activity -- product 
development, for example. 
  No one had expected that banks in the United States could 
recover so quickly. To tell you the truth, I too had failed in 
my writings to predict it; likewise, in the United States, 
neither the financial authorities, the private-sector bank 
managers, nor even the Wall Street analysts had thought such a 
quick recovery was likely. 
  Unless those in Japan proceed by emulating the U.S. thinking 
and approach, nothing will be accomplished except that the 
ownership of bad assets will merely change from one hand to 
another and to yet another. 
<H5>  Avoiding Losses Leads to No Movement </H5>
  [Saito] The point is, a move to dispose of bad assets and 
thereby to improve the contents of assets holdings necessitates 
a cost. Should the fear of this cost make the banks unwilling 
to either junk their bad assets or dispose of them at a loss, 
there will be no movement. 
  As you, Mr. Mizuno, just pointed out, in the United States 
bad assets were thoroughly written off. As to why Japanese 
banks are unable to write off their bad assets, it is because 
they are under a variety of regulatory constraints that make 
even taxable write-offs, let alone tax-exempt write-offs, 
difficult. 
  Of course from the MOF's standpoint, banks' settlements of 
accounts showing red-ink figures would pose problems such as 
diminishing national tax revenues; more fundamentally, however, 
there is the MOF's realization that allowing the less-troubled 
banks to take as much taxable write-offs as they like would 
widen the gaps, and thereby upset the horizontal balance, 
betweent them and those other banks that are saddled with larger 
amounts of bad debts and therefore unable to do the same. 
Should this happen, the MOF fears that the latter category of 
banks might face credit insecurity. This is what the MOF wants 
to avoid. Hence the regulatory constraints that allow all banks 
to take only limited amounts of write-offs. Consequently, the 
banks are unable to restructure their operations. 
  My view is that the entire write-off system ought to be 
revised in the direction of giving the banks basically a free 
hand in writing off their bad assets as long as individual banks 
are willing to treat such write-offs as a matter of their own 
responsibility and to pay taxes on them. 
  If the system is so revised, some banks that cannot afford 
taxable write-offs are bound to fall into a precarious 
situation. Such banks should be dealt with in one of two ways: 
either provide them with "withdrawal funds" through some sort of 
public agency or devise a mechanism whereby they can be closed 
down; in any event, the handling of these banks should be based 
primarily on market forces. 
  These are the kinds of steps implemented in the United 
States. There, property -- bad assets -- was sold off 
aggressively and was written off; at the same time, personnel 
cuts were made and nonperforming divisions and branches were 
eliminated. In Japan, however, these things are not being done. 
  It boils down to this: No pain, no results. It was painful 
in the United States, but the very pain was what generated so 
much financial funds. 
  In the United States, 200 commercial banks went bankrupt in 
1989; the number of such bankruptcies fell all the way to 42 in 
1993. Behind the recovery of such magnitude were the banks' own 
efforts to help themselves and government's willingness to take 
care of the residual problems arising from the banks' efforts. 
  [Mizuno] For example, on New Year's Day 1991 in the state of 
Rhode Island, the governor ordered the closure of 45 financial 
institutions. A few days later, the FDIC took over the Bank of 
New England. At that time, as might be expected, there was a 
run on the banks of Long Island, among others. 
  Even so, American depositors were basically calm. They were 
calm because of the deposit insurance that protected their 
deposit up to $100,000. In Japan, however, the total amount of 
funds at the disposal of deposit insurance is only about 600 
billion yen. 
  [Saito] Which means that the funds will not be enough even 
to 
cover the depositors of just one insolvent second regional bank. 
There is another thing: In the United States, the power of 
state governments talks. 
  Be that as it may, in Japan, too, I wonder whether we really 
need to worry about a run on deposits. Back in the days of the 
Showa financial crisis, the lack of accurate information gave 
rumors free rein. Today, however, given the abundance of 
information, I am inclined to think any run on deposits will be 
nothing more than a temporary thing. 
  [Mizuno] As soon as people get wind of rumors about their 
bank possibly facing a crisis, they transfer their deposits to a 
better banks or to postal savings. There is a perception in the 
United States that the poor state of Japanese banks is the 
reason for the flow of deposits into postal savings. 
  [Saito] The same perception exists in Japan as well. Office 
ladies and the like are frightened and saying they are going to 
move their money into postal savings. Of course interest rates, 
too, have something to do with their choice. 
<H5>  Information Disclosure Needed First </H5>
  [Saito] Still, what is needed before making such an incision 
is the "karte" [the patient's chart] containing accurate data. 
Without it, the surgeon would not know where to make the 
incision. 
  I am a member of an expert committee on the question of 
disclosure. The disclosure criteria being discussed at this 
committee cover only debts that are either unrecoverable or in 
arrears for more than six months; interest payments either 
reduced or forgiven are not included. To include even those 
items in the criteria is not welcomed especially by regional and 
smaller financial institutions. Also not included in the 
criteria are loans in arrears for less than six months. 
  In its reports filed with the SEC, Mitsubishi Bank includes 
not only the arrears for longer than 90 days, but also interest 
payments either reduced, exempted, or suspended. Properly 
speaking, this ought to be the standard to follow for all 
disclosures. 
  Unless the "karte" is maintained with clear, accurate data, 
anxiety about the patient's conditions could be fanned 
unnecessarily: Is it possibly a cancer? Is the cancer terminal? 
Whereas if the charts clearly reflected patient's conditions, 
separating sound banks from those beyond cure, I think everyone 
will calm down. Furthermore, doing so will clarify the bank's 
responsibility toward its shareholders and also identify 
potential problems vis-a-vis depositors. 
  Information disclosure is a matter of course. The Japanese 
practice of ignoring it is hard to believe. 
  [Mizuno] Citicorp, for example, divides the United States 
into eight districts for its annual reports, and the annual 
report contains a detailed disclosure of the loans it has issued 
in each of these districts: the exact amounts of loans and their 
intended purposes are classified into office building, 
residential building, retail business, hotel, land, 
international business, etc. Also included in the disclosure is 
the degree of risk assessed for each of these loans in terms of 
recovery prospects. 
  [Saito] In the case of Japan, granted the administrative 
agencies and financial institutions themselves are at fault, but 
the blame must be shared by depositors, investors, and 
shareholders for being soft and less than resolute in their 
dealings with banks. They ought to expres their view; they 
should say, "Not disclosing information is strange; we will not 
put our money in any bank that fails to disclose." I think the 
consumer sovereignty is weak. Getting back to the question of 
disclosure, in comparison with the three main sectors of banks, 
the regional banks and those of lesser categories have become 
superficial in the handling of information disclosure. City 
banks are disclosing two things: the identity of their loan 
customers who have gone bankrupt and their loans in arrears for 
more than six months. But regional banks are disclosing only 
the identity of their bankrupt loan customers. They both belong 
to the same stock market, yet there is unevenness in what 
information they disclose. 
  In dealing with this reality, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, for 
example, ought to clearly point out the absurdity of such 
unevenness between the two groups, both of whom are financial 
institutions of the same ilk. I find it also lamentable that 
investors are not complaining about this unevenness. 
  [Mizuno] A problem of that kind can be corrected even 
tomorrow. All it takes would be for the MOF to say, "Do it!" 
  A review of annual reports by U.S. banks shows that since 
about 1983, when the Basel Committee on Banking Supports of the 
Bank for International Settlements began studying the idea of 
regulating the banks' net worth ratio, U.S. banks have been 
using uniform standards for disclosing their primary capital and 
total capital. The FRB was behind the adoption of this practice. 
  When the cumulative debts of the Third World countries 
became 
a serious problem making investors and depositors uneasy, U.S. 
banks were ordered to disclose their loans to those countries. 
More recently, when real estate became a problem, U.S. banks 
were ordered to disclose the details of their property-related 
loans. These are matters that do not even warrant discussions 
by any deliberative council. 
  [Saito] But in Japan they become the subjects of rancorous 
debate. Although the recent revision of commercial law has made 
it easier for a representative of shareholders to file a 
group-action suit, because investors, shareholders, and 
depositors lack the awareness as the user of the banking 
service, the banks, in collusion with the authorities, tend to 
take the "keep them coming but do not keep them informed" 
attitude toward their customers. 
  In this regard, there is room for self-reflection by the 
consumer as well. In the United States, it is because 
investors, shareholders, and depositors have sharp eyes that the 
FRB and the financial authorities inevitably become scrupulous 
in righting the wrongs of the banking industry. 
  [Mizuno] Yet the situation has turned so critical.... 
  [Saito] The thing is, the most difficult problem in 
information disclosure is for each financial institution to 
figure out the amount of its excessive debts. In the case of 
Japan, because there is hardly any movement involving land, it 
is quite difficult for a financial institution to figure out the 
latent losses posed by its land holdings. 
  To make such calculation possible, if for nothing else, the 
first thing to do is to liberalize taxable write-offs. When 
this is done, confident and aggressive banks are likely to move 
rapidly to take taxable write-offs. This in turn will give land 
the liquidity. Choice pieces of land that are easily sellable 
will move first, leading gradually to the formation of land 
prices. 
  Of course there will be some pieces of land which simply 
cannot be disposed of. In that event, sooner or later the 
government will have to buy them up using financial funds, with 
strict conditions attached, and will just have to hold onto them 
for a long time. 
  [Mizuno] In the United States, even bad pieces of property 
are being sold. 
  [Saito] In the United States, there is a high-risk, 
high-return market to deal with things like junk bonds. 
  At any rate, once the steps I have outlined have been taken, 
some neutral public agency should make an orderly, accurate 
survey of excessive debts being carried by all the banks to be 
followed by a decision as to what kind of a surgical operation 
is needed. 
  [Mizuno] I am all for it. In the United States, banks are 
clearly ranked on the basis of their net worth ratios. And 
those banks excessively in debt are taken over by the 
government. I think these steps ought to be taken in Japan, too. 
  The market reacts on the basis of these findings and 
happenings. That's why the price of Citicorp's shares fell all 
the way to $7.00 per share when the company was having the worst 
times. But it has rallied since then to the more than $30 at 
the present. The price of Bank of New England's shares had 
plummeted to as low as $1.00 per share just prior to its 
bankruptcy. 
<H5>  The Easygoing Management of Japan's Banks </H5>
  [Mizuno] I believe the managers of Japan's banks lack vigor. 
And it is due to nondisclosure of information regarding their 
bank's performance. 
  [Saito] Not only do managers lack vigor, but bank employees 
also lack it.. Banks provide great in-house welfare benefits to 
employees, but are not eliminating surplus workers. Banks are 
not closing down their non-profitable branches; bonuses paid to 
bank employees last year were more generous than those paid by 
other industries. 
  [Mizuno] Ignorance about the actual condition of their bank 
makes the employees themselves easygoing. This is why I believe 
that one of the values of information disclosure lies in the 
fact that it tends to make the manager more serious about 
managing. It makes the manager serious about the disposition of 
bad assets. 
  In the case of the banks in the United States, Citicorp, for 
example, successfully carried out a restructuring plan called 
the "Five-Point Plan" in 1991-1992. Meanwhile, Chase Manhattan 
Bank announced at the beginning of 1993 a plan to reduce its bad 
assets by $2 billion and began selling off its property 
holdings. The market reacted very favorably to these moves. 
  [Saito] Those were bold decisions by the managers. 
  [Mizuno] In the United States, managers incapable of making 
such decisions will lose their jobs. In Japan, however, if you 
look at city bank operations from the standpoint of how their 
branch offices are doing in attracting deposits, you will find 
that many of their branches are not making profits. As a matter 
of fact, among those city banks with main offices in the 
provinces, there are some that maintain branches in the Tokyo 
metropolitan area that are unbelievably unprofitable. Think 
about these cases seriously, then the obvious conclusion is that 
perhaps it is time for these banks to give up the idea of being 
"city" banks. I think they should aggressively sell off their 
real estate holdings in the city of Tokyo. 
  [Saito] City banks are holding many choice pieces of land; 
if 
they try to sell such land holdings there will be buyers. But 
the pieces of land which these banks are now trying to turn over 
to the CCPC [Central Committee on Privatization and 
Commercialization] are all so odd -- either crooked or inflated 
in price -- that no one would be interested in buying them. The 
banks are holding onto the better pieces. 
  But I like to advise these banks to sell the better ones of 
their land holdings first instead of holding onto them. Good 
pieces of land would be sold if offered at a discount of between 
20 percent and 30 percent. Banks are not doing this; instead, 
they are asking the government to use public funds to buy their 
unsellable pieces of land. Even if the government bought them 
using public funds, they would still be useless. My advice 
would be, "Don't spend public funds in a strange way." 
  [Mizuno] Bringing in public funds to subsidize land 
purchases 
and to rescue banks, even if tried, would not solve either of 
the two problems. I am absolutely opposed to the idea of using 
public funds to finance the CCPC or to buy up bad assets. It 
will not resolve the problem. 
  [Saito] First of all, a manager must make the hard decision 
to restructure his financial institution itself. Next, people 
within the institution must become aware of the critical 
situation. Information must be disclosed in order to generate 
the crisis awareness. Then the government must liberalize 
taxable write-offs. 
  Unless such a restructuring plan based on self-help efforts 
is formulated and implemented, eventually the management team 
will have to step down. I think everyone who attends the board 
meeting ought to resign. 
<H5>  A Land Holdings Liquidation Corporation Needed </H5>
  [Saito] The question is, what should be the next move after 
such self-help efforts? The problem is that bank's bad debts 
are not only enormous but also an entaglement of all kinds of 
mortgages. In order to untangle them and make them liquid, I am 
afraid some sort of "bad assets shelving agency" in the form of 
the National Railways' "liquidation corporation" may have to be 
created. 
  As for the funds to finance such an agency, if money from 
postal savings, the treasury investment and loan account, or 
pension funds were used, it would create a perception that 
banks' management failures are being rescued at the people's 
expense; I don't think this is a good idea. Instead, the 
government should issue a special bond explicitly for this 
purpose. 
  Instread of the interest on the principal so financed, the 
banks ought to pay it in proportion to the amounts of their bad 
assets that have been set aside. Or, if in the future the 
shelving agency can sell off the land it holds and make some 
profit, the profit may be used to redeem the government bond. 
So, to play this kind of role, I am inclined to think that some 
sort of "land holdings liquidation corporation" will have to be 
created. 
  Even then, there will be some banks which, having fallen 
excessively into debt, cannot write off their bad assets. For 
them, a government agency can underwrite preferred stocks in the 
manner of the "reconstruction finance corporation" used in the 
United States during the 1930's. In other words, to generate 
underwriting capital, a "financial stabilization agency" or a 
"stabilization corporation" can be created to issue a so-called 
government guaranteed bond. The BOJ will buy the bond. In 
effect, it will be an indirect, special financing by the BOJ. 
  The bright side of such financing is that the preferred 
stocks underwritten will yield dividends. Such dividends plus 
any profit generated will be required to be put aside in a 
reserve as redemption funds to be so used later. 
  I am afraid that, unless tackled with such a two-phased 
scheme, these pieces of land that constitute bad assets cannot 
be disposed of. The first phase will require banks' self-help 
efforts. It is in the second phase that a "land holdings 
liquidation corporation" and a "financial stabilization agency" 
backed by a form of special financing through the BOJ are to be 
created. If the framework of such scheme is spelled out, I tend 
to think that the situation will calm down little by little. 
  [Mizuno] What is the timing for the creation of these 
agencies? 
  [Saito] Sometime during 1994-1995. And the whole scheme 
should be financed with a special government bond for the relief 
of the financial system. The United States is spending some 
$400 billion for the relief of its S&amp;L industy; the revenue 
source for this undertaking is treasury bonds. 
  [Mizuno] I think the scheme you outlined will not make 
headway in turning these pieces of land liquid. The National 
Railways' liquidation corporation currently holds long-term 
debts worth 2-6 trillion yen; included in such debts are many 
pieces of land that cannot be sold even at a discount. 
  [Saito] They will have to lower prices even further. That's 
why I think that the land holdings liquidation corporation in my 
scheme will be obliged to hold onto land assets for about 10 
years. 
  [Mizuno] In that event, land assets will not become liquid. 
  [Saito] But banks have land assets at choice locations. They 
ought to sell their branch offices athletic fields and company 
houses occupying choice pieces of land, and then have new 
buildings built there by contractors. Banks can either rent 
parts of such buildings, or they can lease back. 
  [Mizuno] If you are talking about financing by means of 
government bond for a period which is to be expected to last 
about 10 years, ultimately the people will end up bearing the 
cost. 
  [Saito] That cannot be helped. Unless such a scheme is 
implemented, financial institutions cannot be normalized. 
  As a price, the beneficiaries of the scheme will be strictly 
held to a variety of terms. For instance, the financing may be 
through a 10-year government bond, the principal and interest of 
which may be payable at the end of the term; however, the 
interest will be borne by those financial institutions whose bad 
assets have been bought off by the liquidation agency. It may 
be decided to schedule the final liquidation for 10 years or 
five years into the future, and the loss resulting from the 
liquidation will have to be made up for by the financial 
institutions, the beneficiaries of the scheme, out of their 
profits. As an alternative, the Federation of Bankers 
Associations of Japan may bear such losses collectively. 
  [Mizuno] Under this scheme, will the financial institutions 
be the ones to invest in it? 
  [Saito] Correct. 
  [Mizuno] It won't work unless provisions are made to allow 
general public to invest in it. 
  [Saito] In Japan, there is no such market in place yet. 
Perhaps one may come into being, say, three years hence. Until 
then, holding on for a long term is the only answer. We are 
talking about a long-term holding agency. 
  [Mizuno] That will not lead to a solution of the problem. At 
present, land cannot be sold even at 50 percent of the purchase 
price. Some pieces of land cannot be sold at 40 percent, at 30 
percent, or even at 20 percent of the prices paid. But, just 
possibly, they may be sold if offered at 10 percent of the 
purchase price. 
  [Saito] You are painting a crash! 
  [Mizuno] That's what everyone in Japan -- the industrial 
sector and fiancial circles alike -- is scared of. 
<H5>  "Amakudari" Hampering Bank Reforms </H5>
  [Saito] Mr. Mizuno, your views amount to a kind of 
"stabilization crisis" theory. It is an argument that 
capitalism revives only at the point of a crash. 
  It is one approach, but if that approach is taken now, the 
Japanese economy will fall apart. Right now, the economy has no 
stamina due to a long-term recession. The government, too, is 
just dawdling, and there is not a chance that the next 
administration will prove to be much stronger. A ship without a 
helmsman will sink in a bad storm. This is why I think it is 
dangerous to try your approach at this time. 
  Also I see problems with the idea being floated by some 
economists of using public funds to make preemptive acquisition 
of land for later public use. My question is, what are they 
going to do with pieces of land that are completely useless? 
Rather than doing such foolish things, the best thing to do is 
simply and unequivocally putting them away for a long haul. 
  [Mizuno] But among the banks' land holdings there are some 
that are of considerable utility value. 
  [Saito] My advice is, sell them! 
  [Mizuno] But even for them prices will have to be lowered. 
  [Saito] Lower prices will attract buyers. I should think 
that, once write-offs are liberalized, banks will gradually 
attempt to sell their land holdings. It is to such banks that, 
I say, a helping hand should be extended, enabling them to gain 
sufficient funds by means of preferred stocks. I think Sumitomo 
Bank, for example, will move promptly to do just that. 
  [Mizuno] The shape of things as you have outlined will 
eventually lead to a definitive idea, I believe. If I am to 
find a point of some agreement between us, it is that all the 
ideas surfaced in our discussion up to this point should be 
molded into something that can work organically.... 
  [Saito] The first step toward that end as a matter of policy 
is to have some banks implement these ideas. Jonan Credit 
Association, for example, is doing very well in this regard even 
now. Take the matter of information disclosure for starters: 
Acting on their own and using the procedure which they call 
"Jonan formula," they are disclosing everything. Further, they 
are even marketing a high-interest deposit product that can 
compete against the postal savings. Given that even such a 
small financial institution is doing these things, I only hope 
bigger banks will follow suit. 
  There is also another problem in the current situation, and 
that is the practice by the MOF and the BOJ of placing their 
officials in financial institutions. 
  [Mizuno] In the United States, the administrative 
authorities 
make the managers put their signatures on restructuring plans 
for their financial institutions. It happened to Bank of 
America and to Bank of Boston. After that, if the restructuring 
plans are not brought to fruition, the authorities fire the 
managers responsible. Never do the authorities resort to the 
practice of "amakudari" ["descending from heaven"; placing 
former government officials in positions of responsibility at 
private companies] in order to keep the pipelines open between 
them and the financial institutions. 
  [Saito] Even under the Japanese Banking Law, the minister of 
finance can order suspension of a bank's operation or revocation 
of its license. But, because MOF officials have shamelessly 
descended on some of the banks where they are holding the 
positions of director or president, the minister cannot very 
well draw his sword against these banks. The situation facing 
the minister is tantamount to the banks having taken former MOF 
officials as hostages. 
  [Mizuno] I wish they would stop it. 
  [Saito] Another thing: The deposit insurance system is being 
abused. Recently funds in that system were used to make a loan 
to the troubled Toyo Credit Association and to make a low 
interest loan to Iyo Bank. But of course the deposit insurance 
is intended to protect deposits. If low-interest loans must be 
made to some of these banks, a separate arrangement will have to 
be devised. This distinction is being fudged.

  The chairman of the Mongolian National Democratic Party D. 
Ganbold also earlier, holding the post of the first vice prime

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 18 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The spring 
session of the State Great Hural (SGH), which started its work 
three days ago, is sitting without participation of the 
representatives of the opposition. Six members of the 
Parliament, representing the coalition of the Mongolian National 
Democratic Party and the Mongolian Social Democratic Party, have 
stopped participating in work of the spring session of the State 
Great Hural. On Wednesday [16 March] they announced that they 
would not participate in the session till the Parliament 
discusses the initiatives of the president of Mongolia, which he 
has put forward in his speech at the opening of the SGH session, 
and adopts a corresponding decision on them. 
  The State Great Hural Standing Committee on Hurals and 
Administration has considered as expedient to submit for 
consideration to the present session of the Parliament the 
president's proposal on elaboration of the draft law on 
elections to the State Great Hural, on making amendments and 
additions in the Law on State Great Hural in a new fashion. But 
the Parliament has not accepted the president's draft resolution 
concerning ensuring the guarantees of work on propaganda of 
activity of the State Great Hural through the state mass media.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 18 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Today on 
the square "Erh Choloo" ("Freedom") of the Mongolian capital a 
mass rally was organized by the Mongolian Democratic Union 
(MDU). At the meeting present were the leader of the Mongolian

Secretary of the Mongolian National Democratic Party E. Bat-uul, 
one of the leaders of the Mongolian Democratic Union T. 
Enhtubshin, the Chairman of the Union of Mongolian Students B. 
Erdenetsogt, the representatives of the MDU in province. 
Thousands of people gathered at the meeting. In their hands 
there were posters "democracy is not anarchy", "down with the 
government", "mafia of functionaries is dividing the country". 
They were blaming the government, the Parliament and its 
leaders for corruption, abuse of power, blockading freedom of 
press, the issuing of laws not meeting the requirements of the 
people and were demanding the present government to resign. 
  As the General Secretary of the Mongolian National 
Democratic 
Party E. Bat-uul announced, if the government and the Parliament 
do not meet the demands of the opposition and the president, so 
it will recall its members from the Parliament, and will

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 18 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Five 
representatives of the oppositional parties of the country have 
decided to resume their participation in the activities of the 
Great State Hural if proposals forwarded by the president of the 
country at the opening ceremony of the autumn session of the 
Parliament would be accepted by the Parliament. 
  Such a statement was made at the press conference by a 
member 
of the Great State Hural R. Gonchigdorj. He noted that the 
opposition in the Great State Hural are fighting not for power 
but in the interests of particular strata of the Mongolian 
public. According to him, the opposition parties would not 
abandon their democratic principles standing for the creation of 
a state structure to be acting in the interests of the whole 
people of Mongolia.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that the President of Mongolia 
Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces P. Ochirbat, the chairman 
of the State Great Hural (SGH) N. Bagabandi and the Prime 
Minister P. Jasray have laid wreaths to the monument of D. 
Suhbaatar on the occasion of the 73rd anniversary of the Armed 
Forces of Mongolia. The newspaper informs that at the cultural 
educational center of the Ministry of Defence the grand meeting 
has been held on the occasion of the jubilee. 
  As the newspaper informs, the Prime Minister P. Jasray had a 
meeting with leadership of aymag and city police organs and the 
personnel of the Ulaanbaatar police. The prime minister in his 
speech at the meeting has pointed out to consolidation of police 
organs and reinforcement of struggle against violation of law. 
  The newspaper informs that at the spring session of the 
State 
Great Hural consideration of the draft law on currency in the 
second reading has begun. 
  In an interview with the newspaper correspondent, the chief 
of the central tax departments, S. Tserendorj notes that a 
check-up work carried out by the department, has revealed that 
different establishments were collecting different kinds of 
ungrounded taxes. Such extortions have been collected from 
citizens on the pretext of realization of the law on stamp 
duties. S. Tserendorj advises citizens to refuse from payment 
of ungrounded taxes established by concrete establishments. 
  The newspaper informs that at the government last sitting 
discussed was the draft law on examination and solution of cases 
connected with ungrounded repressions on political charges. It 
was decided to submit the draft law to the State Great Hural for 
consideration after amendments and additions in it are made. At 
present 27 thousand people subjected to the ungrounded 
repressions are rehabilitated. 8 thousand cases are left. The 
government discussed an information of the Vice Premier L. 
Enebish about preparation for introduction of the traditional 
Mongolian script in official clerical work. From 1990 in cities 
and rural regions more than 60 percent of citizens of the age 
from 16 up to 49 have been taught the Mongolian script, teaching 
of the script is introduced in primary forms of general 
educational schools, the necessary textbooks, dictionaries and 
literature for reading are published. The government noted that, 
despite definite progress, preparation for introduction of the 
Mongolian script in carrying out clerical work has not yet 
reached a proper level and recognized expedient to intensify 
this work. At the sitting a proposal of the Mong Cross Society 
about effective use of humanitarian assistance coming to the 
country was seconded. The government got acquainted with an 
information about economic situation and financial state in the 
first two months of the current year. 
  The government newspaper "DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEUEE" publishes 
a 
full text of the report of the Prime Minister P. Jasray about 
the government measures and tasks on stabilization of economy of 
the country. The report has been presented for consideration to 
the State Great Hural session, which started its work. 
  In the report it is pointed out to reduction of increase of 
prices and inflation level in the last months, and to the 
tendencies for stabilization of economy [sentence as received]. 
The prime minister has submitted the government proposals for 
consideration to the SGH session. These proposals are directed 
to consolidation of the progress and restoration of economic 
potential of the country, activation of production. 
  The newspaper informs about the meeting of the joint working 
group of the Ministry for External Relations, the Ministry of 
Nature and Environment of Mongolia and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Ministry of Water Economy of the PRC in Beijing. 
At the meeting discussed was the draft agreement on protection 
and use of water resources in [ordinal number indistinct] 
frontier region. It is supposed that the signing of the 
bilateral agreement will be held in June. 
  Professor M. Tumurjav writes in the newspaper about the 
increase of cases of cattle stealing in the frontier 
northwestern regions of the country. He notes that cases of 
cattle stealing and even robbery on the part of the Tuvinian 
(Russia) side are particularly increasing in the last [number 
indistinct] years. In this connection M. Tumurjav reminds about 
necessity of reinforcement of the state frontier posts, training 
of frontier guards to guarantee tranquillity of population of 
the frontier regions. 
  The newspaper publishes the regulations of the state 
registration of medicines and biopreparations. The regulations 
were put in force from March 1 and should be observed in 
production, import and use of medicine and biopreparations on 
the country's territory.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 19 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The 
Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) has called on its British 
counterpart TUC [Trade Union Congress] to put pressure on the 
British press first before MTUC could help bring about normalcy 
in British-Malaysian relations. 
  MTUC President Zainal Rampak said: As a matter of priority, 
the MTUC has called upon the TUC, through its affiliates, 
supporters and union members, to use its sphere of influence and 
put pressure on the British press to retract its defamatory 
allegations against Malaysian leaders and tender its apologies. 
  This would eventually pave way for British-Malaysian 
relations to return to normalcy. 
  Zainal said in a statement that MTUC made clear that it was 
the TUC which would have to take the first step to normalise 
reletions between the two countries and MTUC would extend its 
cooperation and assistance as a follow-up measure. 
  The MTUC received a letter from the TUC dated March 11 
which, 
among other things, requested MTUC to play a role to bring about 
a speedy restoration of bilateral relations betweeen the two 
countries in the light of the Malaysian ban on awarding public 
works contracts to British companies, he added. 
  In reply, MTUC stated clearly that though it sympathized 
with 
the plight of British workers who faced the imminent possibility 
of losing their jobs, we cannot, as a matter of principle, 
condone the activities of any institution, including the press 
aimed at tarnishing the image of Malaysia as an independent, 
sovereign nation. 
  He also made it clear that the present state of affairs had 
been spurred by adverse British media reports on Malaysian 
political leaders. 
  Following the series of allegations of corruption against 
Malaysian leaders by the British press, the Malaysian Government 
imposed the ban on the awarding of contracts of government 
projects to British companies on Feb. 25. 
  While the ban does not cover private sector ventures, the 
two 
governments said the policy did not affect their normal 
bilateral relations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Way But Up for Sabahans"] </F>
  [Text] The people of Sabah have now received by unorthodox 
means what they failed to obtain with their votes four weeks 
ago: a right to a more promising future. This has to be the 
most positive outcome of the week's bewildering rash of 
decamping, betrayal, party-hatching, and the rise and demise of 
personalities that was remarkable even for a state known for 
political abandon. When Parti Bersatu Sabah [PBS or Sabah 
United Party] won last month's election a fourth time with a 
small majority, we wrote that only by improving its bad 
relations with Kuala Lumpur could Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan's 
government set about doing something about the state's economy. 
At stake was a better life for the 1.8 million Sabahans whose 
lot has been about the least attractive among the states of the 
Malaysian Federation. Datuk Kitingan did apparently try to come 
to some accommodation with the centre, but the National Front's 
operatives were past talking. They calculated correctly that 
the PBS would fall in short order over the Achilles heel of East 
Malaysian governments -- the revolving-door loyalty of elected 
representatives. The front was only two seats shy of PBS's 
25-23 majority before Datuk Kitingan padded the numbers with six 
appointees to make it 31-23. 
  Now the front is unshakeable: from 23-31 down, it had at 
last 
count (the switching and party-go-round have not subsided) 49 
seats against PBS's five, a solid enough guarantee that Sabah 
could begin to emerge from the wilderness. The 49 seats include 
18 held by three PBS breakaway parties which have received 
assurances that their applications to join the national ruling 
coalition would be accepted. Since PBS could not bring progress 
to Sabah after nine years in power, its passing would be little 
mourned even as the manner of its having been done in by mass 
desertions, including that of Datuk Kitingan's brother, Jeffrey, 
must give power-seekers pause. But Datuk Kitingan knew that was 
the nature of the game. Note that his resignation remarks had 
been free of rancour. 
  Can Sabahans now look with hope to a new beginning? For 
almost 30 years, a new generation of Sabahans has come of age 
that has not known how a hot economic streak could change their 
lives as it has in the peninsula in 15 short years. Sabah's per 
capita GDP [gross domestic product] is M [Malaysian] $3,600, a 
lifetime's work away from the national average of M $12,500. 
That was largely because of an antagonistic relationship with 
the federal government. Except for Datuk Harris Salleh's 
Berjaya Party tenure from 1976 to 1985, the two previous 
governments of Tun Mustapha Harun's USNO [United Sabah National 
Organization] party (1967-1976) and Datuk Kitingan (1985-1994) 
had had stormy relations with Kuala Lumpur. Now that the front 
is in undisputed control, it has no cause to be deflected from 
its campaign promise of development funds and jobs. Pumping M 
$700 million into low-cost housing over the next seven years as 
promised will begin to fix a serious social problem. A 
university and television station, which PBS could not deliver, 
seem at hand. For the masses, public works such as roads, 
schools, and health clinics will mean more. 
  The front can expect to camp itself in Sabah for a long 
while 
if it is mindful of two facts. The first is the 40-40-20 race 
division of Malays, Kadazans and minority groups, and the 
Chinese. The parties that are coalescing around UMNO [United 
Malays National Organization] -- the Chinese-based parties and 
the Kadazan-dominant ones of Datuk Bernard Dompok and Dr. 
Jeffrey Kitingan -- show the clear ethnic division. Unless the 
front is even-handed in its treatment of constituent races, it 
would be sorrow anew for Sabah and probably another round of 
floor crossings. What brought down PBS can happen to any 
sitting government. The other factor is that residual 
anti-Kuala Lumpur feelings could recede only upon proof produced 
that the Front means what it says about helping the people. 
That, fortunately, is also the party's guarantee of longevity. 
It just has to produce results.

Khmer Royal Armed Forces; dated 19 March -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Since its inception, and despite the difficult 
preliminary stage of organizing and building them, all units of 
the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF], like all levels of our 
administratiive structures, have united and worked to overcome 
all kinds of obstacles to carry out their duties of defending 
peace, national unity, territorial integrity, and the people's 
security and stability. They have contributed immensely to the 
restoration and development of the country and nation toward 
peace and prosperity under the clear-sighted initiative of His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, our highly revered king. 
  Over the past few months, many KRAF officers and troops and 
all levels of administrative officials have made great 
sacrifices and achieved a lot in carrying out their duties, both 
in the country and in remote areas along the common border in 
the Phnum Chhat, Anlung Veng, and Palin regions. 
  As heads of the royal government and KRAF co-commanders, I, 
Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, and 
Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, would like to express 
sincere and warmest admiration for the patriotic spirit and the 
brilliant achievements the officers and men of all KRAF units 
and all levels of our administrative officials have made to 
overcome and achieve in this noble cause. The royal government 
and the KRAF co- commanders consider that the great sacrifices 
recently made by the KRAF and our officials are a precious 
contribution to the cause of peace, national unity, national 
unification, and creating conditions for the restoration and 
development of our country and nation and to end the disaster of 
innocent people throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  We would like to bow and pay respect to the souls of 
officers 
and men who have courageously sacrificed their lives in carrying 
out this noble duty and would like to express and share sad and 
most regretful condolences with their families. We would also 
like to affirm that your noble (?sacrifice) will be engraved in 
the golden book of the nation's history. 
  We wish those who are hospitalized a quick recovery so that 
they can return to their families and units. 
  Please accept the five Buddhist blessings of longevity, 
social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment.

  [Text] Here is a communique of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces 
[KRAF] General Staff on the preliminary results of the Pailin 
area's capture: 
  After days of appealing to the officers and troops of the 
Democratic Kampuchea group [DKG] urging them to return to the 
national community and join the royal government and because the 
DKG remained stubborn in refusing to take part in national 
reconciliation, the KRAF decided to enter and occupy the Pailin 
area. 
  During the total seizure of Pailin at 1800 on 19 March, the 
KRAF met with a stiff resistance and were counterattacked by the 
recalcitrant DKG. As a result of the battle to protect the Bar 
Ya Kha village, the KRAF killed 22 DKG troops on the spot. In 
particular, at Sala Krau the KRAF seized two 76.2-mm guns, a 
122-mm K-38 cannon, 30 RPK's, a DK-75 gun, a DK-82 gun, two 
37-mm antiaircraft guns, 10 AK-47's, two SKS's, two SKT's, an 
RCL, seven B-40's, an 82-mm mortar, a 107-mm rocket stand, two 
105-mm rifles, more than 10 tonnes of assorted ammunition, more 
than 50 automobiles, and hundreds of motorcycles. 
  These are only preliminary results. The General Staff will 
inform the public of subsequent results in the future.

  [Text] Phnom Penh--The Khmer Rouge on Thursday said it's 
time for Cambodia to enter a "new political era" since time has 
passed and things have changed. 
  "Fighting would do no good to anyone. What we [the Khmer 
Rouge] want is to build up our country and return it to 
normalcy," a Khmer Rouge representative in Phnom Penh told The 
Nation. 
  He reiterated the Maoist faction's commitment to pursue King 
Norodom Sihanouk's five-point guideline aimed at national 
reconciliation and accused the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of 
opposing the plan. 
  Sihanouk's first three guidelines call for: an immediate and 
complete ceasefire throughout Cambodia; the immediate and 
unconditional transfer of the Preah Vihear temple, Pailin and 
other Khmer Rouge-controlled zones to the Cambodian govemment; 
and the dissolution of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
(NADK) and its partial absorption into the royal army. 
  "You see these first three points are what the DKP 
[Democratic Kampuchea Party or Khmer Rouge] must give to the 
other side," the representative said. 
  He said the other two guidelines require the Phnom Penh 
government to give the DKP the posts of coministers, co-vice 
ministers, co-secretaries of states and advisers; and the DKP 
and the government must hold talks to settle all these issues. 
  "Altogether the five points make national reconciliation 
possible. But the CPP have been concentrating on the first 
three points only and that means they are opposed to national 
reconciliation," he said. 
  The DKP representative referred to Cambodia's present 
government as a two-headed government, one head of which is 
Cambodian while the other -- and the whole body -- is Vietnamese. 
  He said a truly national government would not exclude any 
political party or political personnel. 
  "We will never be part of the puppet government. We don't 
want to be co-puppets," he said. 
  He said the future of the Phnom Penh coalition govemment 
would be totally compromised if it refused to implement the 
peace plan. 
  "How could they survive if they cannot solve the three main 
problems of this country?" he said, citing the influx of 
Vietnamese into Cambodia, corruption among government officials 
and people's fear for their lives and property. 
  The Khmer Rouge is aware that the Vietnamese are trying to 
swallow up Cambodia. After "closing Cambodia's western border 
and opening up its eastern border, they will move little by 
little into our land," he said. 
  However, without help from "some western countries", Hanoi 
would be unable to carry out its policy of Vietnamization, the 
representative said, without identifying the "colluding" Western 
countries. 
  Asked to clarify the situation in Anlong Veng, the 
representative denied that govemment troops have overwhelmed 
Khmer Rouge headquarters there. "What they [the govemment] 
claimed to be our base is not in fact our headquarters. That is 
somewhere else. We were able to seize a number of government 
tanks outside Anlong Veng," he said. 
  Though admitting the situation is tense in Pailin as 
fighting 
continues the Khmer Rouge representative dismissed reports that 
government forces were about to take the town. 
  "The nearest they've got to Pailin is Treng, about 50 km 
away," he said.

  [Text] Jakarta, Mar. 19 (ANTARA) - President Suharto 
assured the nation that there was no reason for anxiety about 
the country's presidential succession when he received 56 ulemas 
[Muslim scholars] for a post fasting get-together at Merdeka 
Palace Saturday. 
  Speaking without text, Suharto said there was no need for 
the 
public to be restless as the existing mechanism for national 
leadership change in a cycle of every five years through general 
elections followed by election of president and vice president 
by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) sitting a plenary 
session has been practiced without fail all this time. 
  He said the election of a president would move smoothly as 
long as the MPR sticks to the procedure of drawing up the state 
policy guideline (GBHN) first and choosing the MPR's mandatory 
or president (to execute the GBHN) second, and not the other way 
round. 
  He said: "There will be no problem for the MPR as long as it 
discharges its duty in accordance with the mechanism that has 
proven its effectiveness all this time." 
  The president counselled, however, that the public should 
not 
magnify whatever weaknesses the candidate for president might 
have in such a fashion as to brush aside the positive qualities 
that he may also be blessed with. For no person is faultless, 
including the future presidential candidate, he said. 
  But even if there is no perfect person, he added, someone 
has 
to be trusted to act as a mandatory of the MPR or president. 
"Someone just has to be trusted as leader," he said. 
  The ulemas hosted by the president represented Indonesia's 
major Islamic organizations such as the Council of Indonesian 
Ulemas (MUI), the Nahdlatul Ulema (NU) [Association of Muslim 
Scholars], the Indonesian Islamic Missionary Council (DDI), and 
Muhammadiyah. Among them were K.H. Hasan Basri, Anwar Haryono, 
Azhar Basir, Jakiah Drajat, Tuti Alawiyah, and Suryani Tahir.

  [Text] Jakarta, Mar 18 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas, speaking before 23 Portuguese of East Timorese descent 
said Indonesia did not need to "annex" another half of Timor 
Island in the 1970s because it had an abundance of natural 
resources and a vast territory. "We are not an impoverished 
country which needs part of another country," Alatas said here 
on Friday. 
  East Timor Province is geographically part of Timor Island, 
while another part of it belongs to East Nusa Tenggara Province. 
  In 1975, East Timorese issued a declaration, the so called 
Balibo Declaration to express their desire to integrate with the 
Indonesian nation. One year later, East Timor integrated with 
Indonesia, making it the country's 27th and youngest province. 
"It's impossible for a country which has 17 thousand islands to 
look for additional island," he said. 
  The 23 Portuguese arrived here on Thursday night for a 
one-month long visit in the country in what many saw as a family 
reunion. Upon their arrival at Sukarno-Hatta Airport, they were 
welcomed by Fransisco Xavier Lopez Da Cruz, a respected senior 
East Timorese politician and Indonesia's ambassador at large for 
East Timor affairs, and a number of activists of the 
Indonesia-Portugal Friendship Association (PPIP). 
  According to the plan, they will visit Yogyakarta and 
Salatiga, two cities in Central Java where many East Timorese 
youths study, on Saturday, afterwards they will proceed their 
trip to Denpasar, Kupang, and Dili. 
  Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, the daughter of President Suharto 
who chairs the PPIP said the visit was aimed at meeting with 
their relatives whom they had separated each other for tens of 
years. [sentence as received] She expressed the hope that the 
visit would help expedite the solution of East Timor question 
through a number of international fora under the auspice of the 
United Nations. It was the common people who would suffer the 
most if the East Timor question remained unsettled, she said. 
  The visit is a follow-up to the historic meeting in London 
between East Timorese leaders in East Timor and those living in 
exile last December. 
  Lopez said the participants at the London meeting agreed 
that 
goodwill should be promoted and this visit is a manifestation of 
the goal set at the meeting. The one-month long visit was 
merely socio-cultural in nature and there was not another motive 
behind it, Lopez said. 
  In the meantime, Alatas also expressed his hope that the 23 
Portuguese of East Timorese descent would be free to visit 
various places in Indonesia.

<F P=106> [Speech by National Asssembly Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket at a </F>
5 March banquet in Vientiane honoring the Cambodian delegation 
headed by National Assembly Chairman Samdech Chea Sim] 
  [Text] Respected Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National 
Assembly and acting head of state of the Kingdom of Cambodia; 
beloved ladies and gentlemen; honored guests: 
  On behalf of the National Assembly and the multiethnic 
people 
of Laos and in my own name, I am very proud to have the 
opportunity to welcome Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the 
National Assembly and acting head of state of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia, and his delegation. 
  We regard this visit as a good omen for the friendly 
relations between the peoples of Laos and Cambodia, especially 
between our two legislative institutions. At the same time, we 
are confident that the success of the talks between the two 
sides this afternoon in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual 
understanding will become an important milestone and process for 
bolstering and strengthening the time-honored fine traditional 
relations between Laos and Cambodia. 
  Respected Samdech, ladies and gentlemen, and beloved honored 
guests, Laos and Cambodia are adjacent countries, maintaining a 
close relationship of intimacy and neighborliness. We have 
rendered assistance and maintained a sense of profound 
affection, intimacy, and understanding toward each other. Our 
two peoples have shared similar traditions, customs, and 
characteristics as well as the same fate of having been 
colonized by the imperialists and neocolonialists in the past. 
We stood shoulder to shoulder together to fight for a common 
victory, as well as for national independence and freedom for 
each country. The histories of our two countries have been 
recorded with the ties of everlasting relations of glorious 
friendship between our two peoples forever. 
  The National Assembly and multiethnic people of Laos are 
sincerely overwhelmed with and have hailed the success of the 
elections held by the Cambodian National Assembly. We 
wholeheartedly congratulate Samdech Chea Sim for having been 
elected chairman of the National Assembly and appointed acting 
head of state of the Kingdom of Cambodia. To cement the 
relations between our two legislative organizations and all 
agreements signed by the two governments, let us mobilize the 
peoples of both countries to translate these feats into reality. 
As good neighbors, the National Assembly and multiethnic people 
of Laos always want to see Cambodia enjoy lasting independence, 
peace, stability, and prosperity and become a friend of all 
countries. 
  On this auspicious occasion, on behalf of the National 
Assembly and multiethnic people of Laos, I wish that the 
Cambodian people attain greater achievements in carrying out the 
tasks of national reconstruction and making their beloved 
country prosperous forever. 
  I would like to invite Samdech Chea Sim and all 
distinguished 
personalities to join me in toasting the health of His Majesty 
King Norodom Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia and Queen 
Monique; to the health of His Excellency Nouhak Phoumsavan, 
president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and his wife; 
to the success, health, and happiness of Samdech Chea Sim and 
the delegation; to the health of all ladies and gentlemen and 
distinguished guests at this reception; and to the friendship, 
solidarity, and cooperation between the two states and peoples 
of Laos and Cambodia.

National Assembly, at a banquet hosted by Saman Vi-gnaket, 
chairman of the Lao National Assembly, in Vientiane on 5 March] 
  [Text] Respected Excellency Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of 
the National Assembly of the Lao People's Democratic Republic 
[LPDR], beloved ladies and gentlemen: 
  Tonight, the delegation of the National Assembly of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia and I have the great honor to attend the 
banquet hosted by His Excellency Saman Vi-gnaket. On this 
auspicious occasion, I would like to thank you, Your Excellency, 
for the kind words filled with a sense of profound and intimate 
friendship, courtesy, and affection in your speech. Those 
profoundly meaningful words serve to ensure the further 
development of the relations of friendship, cooperation, and 
mutual assistance between the peoples and legislative 
organizations of the two countries. At the same time, we are 
extremely impressed by the warm welcome extended to our 
delegation during our official friendship visit to the LPDR, 
especially the arrangement of facilities and itinerary for our 
visit, thus making our first visit to Laos a brilliant success. 
On this occasion, I would like to express our profound thanks to 
Your Excellency and the National Assembly for your hospitality 
and to extend our wholehearted welcome to you for your future 
friendship visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  As neighbors sharing a long border, Cambodia and Laos have 
maintained the fine relations of friendship and cooperation 
since ancient times. Our two peoples have shared not only water 
from the Mekong River but similar languages, traditions, 
customs, and Buddhist principles. Our characteristics are also 
very alike. All this has become a factor serving to further 
strengthen our mutual friendship, affection, understanding, and 
cooperation. 
  Lao and Cambodian peoples always share a common aspiration, 
that is to live in peace and happiness with beloved and 
respected friends. Such an aspiration has become a basis for our 
people to maintain close relationship in all periods of our 
histories. In particular, in the new period when Cambodia and 
Laos are in the stage of development, the consolidation and 
enhancement of the relations of friendship and mutual 
cooperation have become even more important. 
  The exchange of visits by delegations from the two sides, 
such as the friendship visit to the LPDR by Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively, first and second 
prime ministers of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the recent visit 
to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Lao Prime Minister His Excellency 
Khamtai Siphandon, has opened new pages in the history of 
friendship and cooperation in all fields between Cambodia and 
Laos for the common interests of the states and peoples of the 
two countries. 
  Aside from instituting a chapter of cooperation between our 
two legislative organizations by paying this friendship visit to 
the LPDR, our delegation has also brought with us the goodwill 
and fine friendship of the Cambodian people to the Lao National 
Assembly, government, and people, thereby reaffirming the 
solidarity and sincerity of the Cambodian people toward our Lao 
friends. I would like to express my confidence here that in the 
future, this spirit of friendship will be further strengthened 
and multiplied with every passing day. 
  Respected Mr. Chairman and beloved ladies and gentlemen, 
having suffered a bitter destiny for more than 20 years, 
Cambodia has encountered numerous unprecedentedly serious 
dangers. At present, the Cambodian people are entering a new 
period of peace and national reconciliation under the 
clear-sighted and talented leadership of His Majesty King 
Norodom Sihanouk. This is an important turning point for the 
Cambodian people, who will cooperate with one another in 
rebuilding our country and doing away with the bitter past. As a 
matter of fact, the Cambodian people will still be encountering 
certain difficulties and obstacles in the future in our efforts 
to rebuild public utilities and various other infrastructure 
facilities, to develop our human resources, and to enact and 
enforce many laws and regulations for the equitable management 
of our state, economy, and society in accordance with the 
democratic principles so as to ensure stable and lasting 
national development in the future. 
  Though encountering numerous monumental difficulties, we, 
the 
Cambodian people, are still very proud of and confident in our 
bright future. This is because we have strong determination, are 
confident in our unity, cohesion, and unification, and receive 
support and assistance from various international organizations 
for the reconstruction of our country. 
  The new Cambodia will strive to develop the relations of 
friendship and cooperation wilh all countries regardless of the 
differences in our poltiical systems and on the basis of respect 
for each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial 
integrity, and noninterference, especially with the neighboring 
countries and countries in this region. We pledge to further 
strengthen our relations of friendship, solidarity, and 
cooperation with these countries in the interest of peace, 
stability, and development in the region. That is why we are 
confident that the relations of friendship between Cambodia and 
Laos will become exemplary in the development of ties serving 
the invaluable interests not only of Cambodian and Lao peoples 
but also of other peoples in this region. This development will 
become an encouragement for the countries in this region to 
further broaden regional cooperation. 
  In conclusion, I would like to extend wholeheartedly my best 
wishes to the Lao National Assembly, government, and people. We 
wish you greater victories in building the LPDR.

  [Text] Malacanang [Presidential Office] has allowed three 
new domestic service airlines to operate this year as part of 
its move to liberalize the aviation industry in the country. 
  President Ramos directed yesterday the Civil Aeronautics 
Board to formulate its recommendations to open up the aviation 
industry, removing policies protecting the monopoly held by 
Philippine Airlines [PAL] for domestic airline services. 
  Two of the airlines are expected to compete with PAL, 
servicing the Cebu-Davao route, while a third is working for a 
congressional franchise to operate an international and domestic 
passenger and cargo services. 
  One of the new domestic service airlines, the Araneta-led 
Silangan Airways Inc., is planning to lease at least six 
120-seat passenger jets to service the Cebu-Davao routes. 
  Its owners are reportedly looking at Russian-made aircraft 
to 
serve as its fleet. 
  The other airline, Star Asia Airways Corp. will field at 
least two Boeing 737-200s to service other Visayas and Mindanao 
routes from Manila. 
  The third airline, the All-Asia Airlines Corp., led by 
businessman Eduardo Cojuangco, has still to obtain its franchise 
from Congress to operate an international and domestic service 
airline. 
  The move to open the local aviation industry to more 
airlines 
is consistent with the Ramos administration's policy of 
providing equal opportunity to other Filipino-operated airlines 
to cater to increasing demands in domestic flight services.

  [Excerpt] President Ramos has approved a comprehensive 
development plan for Central Luzon involving the setting up of 
industrial sites and the preservation of highly protected 
farmlands in order to spur economic recovery and alleviate the 
plight of the people displaced as a result of the eruption of 
Mt. Pinatubo. 
  The president directed the members of Cabinet Cluster A and 
all the local chief executives in the provinces of Bulacan, 
Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, and Zambales to 
immediately meet and draw up a land use plan which will identify 
areas suitable for industrial, residential, and agricultural 
purposes. 
  Secretary Ernesto Garilao of the Department of Agrarian 
Reform (DAR) reported yesterday that in a meeting of the Cabinet 
Cluster A last Tuesday, it was initially decided that the new 
program would be similar to the development plan for the 
Calabarzon Provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and 
Quezon in Southern Tagalog. 
  President Ramos, Garilao said, wants to convert Central 
Luzon 
into another economic zone capable of providing adequate food 
supply, job opportunities, and decent and affordable dwelling 
units. 
  Garilao said under the proposed land use plan, concerned 
local government units (LGUs) can promptly cite areas where 
development projects such as low cost housing and industrial 
centers can be established. 
  Likewise, it would also guide the LGUs in effectively 
preserving prime agricultural lands mostly planted to rice, 
corn, vegetables, and fruits. 
  He said the zoning plan aims principally to prevent the 
failures on effective land use earlier encountered in Calabarzon 
and involving mostly cases of unauthorized land conversion. 
  While problems cropped up in Calarbarzon because of 
non-availability of a rationale and sustainable land use plan, 
Garilao said, the development efforts, nonetheless, were proven 
a big success as reflected in the total investments poured in 
the area amounting to P [Philippine pesos] 140 billion from 1986 
to 1993. 
  During the same period the total amount of investments 
injected in Central Luzon reached only P30 billion, he said. 
  The Department of Trade and Industry has received 
commitments 
from both foreign and local capitalists to invest in Central 
Luzon, he said. 
  Garilao said Tarlac, Pampanga, and parts of Zambales and 
Bataan are among the areas where industrial sites can be set up 
while Nueva Ecija and Bulacan could very well be tapped for 
agricultural production. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["A Statement of North Side Delegation to Working Contact </F>
for Exchange of Presidential Envoys"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities must know that they can never evade their 
responsibility for the collapse of the working contact for the 
exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South, 
said the North side delegation to the working contact for the 
exchange of presidential envoys in a statement released Monday 
regarding the foiled working contact. 
  Recalling that eight rounds of working contact have been 
held 
between the sides since the North side proposed the exchange of 
presidential envoys in may last year, the statement says: 
  The North side made reasonable proposals on the rank and 
duty 
of the special envoys and procedures of their exchange and 
showed sincerity by holding working contacts year by year in 
real earnest to reach an agreement at an early date. 
  The South side, however, refused even to accept our proposal 
for the exchange of special envoys without any justifiable 
reason from the very beginning and refused the working contact 
itself, delaying it for five months. Even after it came out to 
the contact under the pressure of public opinion at home and 
abroad, the South side hampered the exchange of special envoys 
by repeatedly creating artificial obstacles and difficulties in 
the way of the contact. 
  What must not be overlooked is that the South Korean ruling 
quarters have repeatedly resorted to such insidious intrigues as 
abusing the working-level contact to impede and put the brakes 
on the DPRK-USA talks. 
  The DPRK-USA talks and the inter-Korean exchange of special 
envoys are, by nature, different matters. It was an act of 
flunkeyist treachery against the nation that the South Korean 
ruling quarters abused the exchange of special envoys to hinder 
the DPRK-USA talks. 
  We have approached the working contact with sincerity, 
patiently urging dialogue and negotiation and not abandoning our 
will for the exchange of special envoys even when the South 
Korean authorities broke off the working-level contact, 
antagonizing the fellow countrymen from an anti-national 
position and resorting to malicious moves to do harm to us in 
conspiracy with outside forces. 
  At the sixth round of working contact, our side proposed to 
dispel the apprehensions of all the fellow countrymen for the 
exchange of special envoys by announcing in a joint communique 
that the sides confirmed again each other's intention to 
exchange special envoys and agreed on their early exchange, and 
thus took a broad-minded attitude with regard to its just 
four-point demand that all large-scale nuclear war manoeuvres 
against the dialogue partner be discontinued, the "international 
cooperation system" be abandoned, the planned introduction of 
Patriot missiles be rescinded and the remarks that they "cannot 
shake hands with a party possesed of nuclear weapons" be 
withdrawn. 
  Even at that time, however, the South side blindly took 
exception to the North side's constructive proposal and, outside 
of conference hall, cried that "the exchange of special envoys 
is a precondition for the third round of DPRK-USA talks" and 
decided on a "policy of tough reaction" toward the North at "a 
high-level strategic meeting of officials concerned". The South 
side freely addressed itself to such extremely insolent acts as 
calling for the resumption of "Team Spirit" nuclear war 
exercises, promotion of the planned introduction of Patriot 
missiles and "international sanctions" against the North. 
  Such abrupt provocative acts of the South Korean rulers were 
virtually a declaration of breaking off the working-level 
contact, a declaration of abandoning the exchange of special 
envoys and a declaration of all-out confrontation with us. 
  By thus provoking the dialogue partner and declaring a 
unilateral breakoff of the North-South working contact at a time 
when the third round of DPRK-USA talks were five to six days 
away, the South Korean rulers committed an unpardonable criminal 
act of deliberately putting the brakes on the DPRK-USA talks. 
  We strongly condemn the South Korean authorities for finally 
breaking up the working contact between the North and the South 
by consistently using the exchange of special envoys for their 
sinister political purpose, revealing their ulterior intention 
to part with us. 
  The developments in South Korea today show that, 
loud-mouthed 
as it is about "civilian government," the Kim Yong-sam group is 
aggravating the North-South relations more maliciously than 
former military dictators, leading them to a phase of 
confrontation and war. 
  Those who run amok with the sword between their clenched 
teeth, while advertising "civilian" rule, cannot be treated 
otherwise. 
  Criminals are destined to face punishment. 
  Those who cannot defend independence, the life and soul of 
the nation, but foment antagonism and confrontation within the 
nation and lead the situation to a phase of war by following 
outside forces, will get nothing but curses of the nation and 
destruction. 
  No dictators who had turned their back on the fellow 
countrymen and engaged in anti-national moves in league with 
outside forces ever lived their days, and such sycophant 
traitors met a miserable end without exception. 
  The North side delegation to the working contact will follow 
the development after the declaration of the chief delegate of 
the South side that they "would not hold talks with the North 
side any further".

  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued 
the following statement in connection with the U.S. treacherous 
act [paesin haengwi] of totally overturning [chonmyon 
tujiboomnun] the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New York contact 
dated 25 February. 
  The statement of the spokesman for the DPRK Foreign 
Ministry: 
  The United States has committed a treacherous act of totally 
overturning the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New York contact 
dated 25 February. As has been known, the DPRK and the United 
States in the 25 February New York contact agreed on the present 
four simultaneous action measures [tangmyonhan negaji tongsi 
haengdong chochidul] for a package solution of the nuclear 
issue, namely, suspending the Team Spirit-94 joint military 
exercise, resuming the working delegates contact for the 
exchange of the special envoys of the North and the South, 
conducting inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], and holding the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks in Geneva on 21 March. 
  This agreement on the simultaneous action measures was an 
important turning point that would enable the process for 
peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue which had been deviated 
[talson toeottun] to be on the right track again. 
  From the serious desire to resolve the nuclear issue through 
dialogue, we have faithfully implemented our obligations noted 
in the agreement. We accepted the IAEA inspection team at the 
scheduled date and have sincerely provided them all the 
conditions so that they could conduct inspection activities of a 
sufficient scope on the seven declared sites for ensuring the 
continuity of safeguards. 
  Even in the abnormal circumstance where the IAEA side 
unreasonably demanded taking samples and measurements [siryo 
chaechwiwa chukchong] far exceeding the scope of ensuring the 
continuity of safeguards agreed with us [uriwa habuihan tamboui 
yonsoksong pojang pomwirul hwolsin chowol hanun], we showed the 
utmost good will of acceding to [suyonghaejunun] the IAEA demand 
as best as possible. 
  We have also made all the efforts we can, such as holding 
the 
North-South working delegates contacts several times and 
proposing specific ways and proper measures to realize the 
exchange of the special envoys of the North and the South. 
  However, since the announcement of the 25 February New York 
agreement, the U.S. side made only empty talk [pinmal]. It did 
not implement even one of its duties. Even though the United 
States announced the suspension of the Team Spirit-94 joint 
military exercise and the date for the second round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks, it put forth an unreasonable precondition by saying that 
it will implement these when the IAEA's inspection is carried 
out satisfactorily and the exchange of special envoys of the 
North and South is realized. This is a violation of the New 
York agreement which regards simultaneous movement [tongsi 
umjigiungot] as a principle. 
  The United States is instead making false charges by saying 
that the IAEA's inspection we received is unsatisfactory and 
that the exchange of special envoys of the North and South was 
not realized. Thus, it moved toward the road of overturning the 
New York agreement in which it decided to take simultaneous 
action measures. 
  If we do not allow the IAEA's reinspection and do not 
realize 
the exchange of special envoys of the North and South, the 
United States is saying that it will resume the Team Spirit-94 
joint military exercise, suspend the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks, and hand our issue over to the UN Security Council. 
  At the same time, the IAEA Secretariat is launching the game 
to adopt a resolution to oppose us by convening the Board of 
Governor's meeting. At a decisive important period when the 
resolution of the nuclear issue is right before our eyes, the 
United States overturned the New York agreement openly and 
completely destroyed [homuloborida] the basis of the third round 
of talks. Thus, the United States prevented the prospects for 
resolving the nuclear issue. This stems from the unchanged 
hostile policy toward the North by the United States. 
  The fact that the United States put forth an unreasonable 
precondition which is not even written in the New York agreement 
itself clearly shows that their intention from the beginning was 
not to resolve the nuclear issue through the DPRK-U.S. talks, 
but instead that this precondition was pursued under a political 
goal to crush [apsal] our Republic. 
  The United States is distorting as if its unjustifiable 
preconditions were those which were agreed with us. However, 
these unjustifiable preconditions were rejected by our just 
assertion when the New York agreement was discussed. 
  Nevertheless, after announcing the agreement, persistently 
insisting on the unilateral preconditions which were rejected by 
us cannot but be interpreted as an intentional scheme to 
overturn the New York agreement and, thus, to create a situation 
of confrontation. 
  In reality, using the issue of the IAEA inspections and the 
North-South exchange of special envoys as the pretexts, the 
United States openly has laid bare its attempt to persistently 
wage the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise and to impose 
sanctions against us at the UN Security Council and, thus, is 
leading the international anti-Republic pressure commotion. 
  All facts have clearly proven that the United States has no 
intent to hold talks any longer nor has it the will to solve the 
nuclear issue and that it is attempting to isolate and crush us 
by taking advantage [konggan] of the nuclear issue and the 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Because of such a breach of faith by the United States, a 
grave situation which may drive the entire nation into an aspect 
of confrontation and war is coming to the Korean peninsula today. 
  Because the United States is leading the situation to an 
extreme [kuktan] by overturning the New York agreement and 
breaking up the DPRK-U.S. talks, it has become impossible for us 
to unilaterally implement any longer our duty related to the 
simultaneous action measures. Proceeding from this we has 
decided not to send our delegation to the third round of the 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Now that the United States and the IAEA are deliberately 
distorting the results of the current inspections held to ensure 
the continuity of safeguards and, thus, are abusing them as the 
pretext of their anti-Republic pressure we will no longer 
consider it to be our duty to guarantee the continuity of the 
safeguards of the agency. 
  This step of ours is taken pursuant to the principle of the 
New York agreement dated on 25 February that stipulates that the 
execution of the agreed-upon four simultaneous actions is needed 
for the overall implementation of the agreement. 
  As long as the United States overturns the promise made with 
us, we will not be bound by our promise made with the United 
States. This position of ours is firm and consistent. 
  In the 12 March 1993 statement issued by the Government of 
our Republic, we note that the basic reason for our declaration 
of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] 
was the U.S. policy of nuclear threat and of crushing us, 
including the Team Spirit joint military exercise and the IAEA's 
partiality. 
  In the DPRK-U.S. joint statement issued in New York on 11 
February 1993, we made it clear that we would unilaterally and 
tentatively suspend the effectuation of the withdrawal from the 
NPT on the premise that the DPRK and United States would 
continue talks to settle the nuclear issue. 
  If the United States persistently avoids the DPRK-U.S. talks 
and resumes the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise, thus 
increasing the nuclear threat against us, and if the IAEA 
further expands its unfairness by distorting the result of its 
inspection of us and takes forcible measures and pressures, we 
will have to take the direction of putting into practice the 
measures declared in the Republic Government's statement dated 
12 March of last year in order to defend the nation's 
sovereignty and the country's security. 
  We are not in a hurry at all even if the DPRK-U.S. talks are 
not held, thus causing the settlement of the nuclear issue to be 
delayed. The United States should ponder about the seriousness 
of the present situation created and see it squarely. 
  21 March 1994, Pyongyang

<F P=106> ["Statement of DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on U.S. </F>
Perfidy"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement today clarifying the 
position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea toward the 
United States' perfidious act of reversing the agreed 
conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. 
  The statement reads: 
  The United States has committed a perfidious act by totally 
reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. 
contact on February 25 in New York. 
  As is known, the DPRK and the United States at the New York 
contact on February 25 agreed upon four immediate steps of 
simultaneous action for a package solution to the nuclear issue 
-- suspension of the Team Spirit 94 joint military maneuvers, 
resumption of the working-level contact for the exchange of 
presidential envoys between the North and South, acceptance of 
an inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
for maintaining the continuity of safeguards holding of the 
third round of the DPRK-USA talks in Geneva on March 21. 
  The agreement on these steps of simultaneous actions marked 
an important occasion in bringing back to its track the 
detracted process of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. 
  Out of our sincere desire to achieve a negotiated solution 
to 
the nuclear issue at any cost, we have honestly fulfilled our 
obligations pursuant to the agreed conclusions. 
  We accepted the IAEA inspectors' group at the designated 
date 
and sincerely provided them with all conditions so that they 
could conduct inspection activities of enough scope for 
maintaining the continuity of safeguards at the seven declared 
facilities. 
  Even when the IAEA side rudely requested sampling and 
measurement that go far beyond the agreed scope for the 
continuity of safeguards, we met its demand as much as possible, 
showing our utmost good will. 
  We have held several rounds of working-level contact with 
the 
South side and made every effort possible for an early exchange 
of special envoys between the North and South, proposing 
detailed ways and reasonable measures. The U.S. side, however, 
has fulfilled none of its obligations, making empty talk since 
the publication of the New York agreement of February 25. 
  Although the United States announced suspension of the Team 
Spirit 94 joint military exercises and the date of the opening 
of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, it unreasonably made them 
conditional, saying that it would keep that promise only after 
the inspection by the IAEA had been made satisfactorily and the 
special envoys exchanged between the North and South. 
  This was a violation of the New York agreement based on the 
principle of simultaneous action. 
  The United States has gone so far as to break the New York 
agreement on the steps of simultaneous action, alleging that the 
IAEA's inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities was not 
satisfactory and the exchange of presidential envoys between the 
North and South has not been realised. 
  The United States threatens that if the DPRK does not allow 
inspection by the IAEA and does not realise the exchange of 
special envoys between the North and South, it will resume the 
Team Spirit joint military exercises in 1994, will not have the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and will transfer the problem of 
the DPRK to the United Nations Security Council. 
  In the meantime, the secretariat of the IAEA is going to 
convene a meeting of the Board of Governors to adopt a 
"resolution" against the DPRK. 
  Thus, the United States has openly reversed the New York 
agreement and totally destroyed the foundation for the third 
round of talks, darkening the prospect of the settlement of the 
nuclear issue, at this crucial moment when its settlement is in 
sight. This is motivated by its consistent hostile policy 
toward the DPRK. 
  It is obvious that the United States set unreasonable 
preconditions which are not specified in the New York agreement 
because they sought from the beginning the political purpose of 
stifling the DPRK, not a solution to the nuclear issue through 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The United States is distorting the fact, claiming that 
their 
unreasonable preconditions were included in the agreement with 
the DPRK. But they had been refuted by the DPRK's reasonable 
argument at the time of the discussion of the New York agreement. 
  Even after the publication of the agreed conclusions, they 
are insisting on the unilateral preconditions rejected by the 
DPRK. This cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate 
scheme to break the New York agreement and create a phase of 
confrontation. 
  In actuality, the United States is playing first fiddle in 
an 
international campaign for putting pressure on the DPRK, openly 
revealing its intention to stage the team spirit 94 joint 
military maneuvers and let the U.N. Security Council take 
"sanctions" against the DPRK on the pretext of the problems in 
the IAEA's inspection and the exchange of special envoys between 
the North and South. 
  All the facts clearly prove that the United States has 
neither the intention to continue talks nor the will to solve 
the nuclear issue but only schemes to isolate and stifle the 
DPRK with the nuclear issue and the DPRK-U.S. talks as an 
expedient. 
  This perfidious act of the United States is creating a grave 
situation on the Korean peninsula, which may bring the Korean 
nation back to the phase of confrontation and war. 
  Now that the United States has broken the New York agreement 
and brought the DPRK-U.S. talks to a rupture, leading the 
situation to the extreme pitch of strain, we can no longer 
unilaterally fulfil our obligations concerning the steps of 
simultaneous action. 
  Therefore, we have decided not to send our delegation to 
the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Since the United States and the IAEA are deliberately 
distorting the results of the recent inspection for the 
continuity of safeguards and using it as a pretext for putting 
pressure on the DPRK, we will no longer deem it our obligation 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards. 
  This measure of ours accords with the principle of the New 
York agreement of February 25, which stipulates that the 
fulfilment of each simultaneous action agreed upon is necessary 
for the implementation of all the agreed conclusions. 
  Unshakable and consistent is our position that we are not 
bound by our promise with the United States once the latter 
breaks its promise with us. 
  The DPRK Government in its statement dated March 12 last 
year 
said that our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was caused mainly by the U.S. 
nuclear threat to the DPRK, including the Team Spirit joint 
military exercises, and its policy of stifling the DPRK and the 
partiality of the IAEA. 
  In the DPRK-U.S. joint statement of June 11, 1993 in New 
York, we made it clear that we would unilaterally and 
temporarily suspend the effectuation of our withdrawal from the 
NPT, on condition that the DPRK-U.S. talks for a solution to the 
nuclear issue continued. 
  If the United States avoids the DPRK-U.S. talks and 
increases 
nuclear threat to the DPRK, resuming the team spirit joint 
military exercises in 1994, and if the IAEA widens its 
partiality and resorts to strong-arm politics and pressure, 
distorting the results of the recent inspection of the DPRK 
nuclear facilities, we have no alternative but to carry into 
practice the measures declared in the DPRK Government's 
statement of March 12 last year in order to defend the 
sovereignty of the nation and the security of the state. 
  Even if the settlement of the nuclear issue is delayed 
because of the failure of the DPRK-U.S. talks, we are not in a 
hurry at all. 
  The United States must ponder over the prevailing situation, 
looking straight at its seriousness.

<F P=106> ["South Side Must Bear Responsibility for Stalled Working </F>
Contact" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 20 (KCNA) -- The working-level 
contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the 
North and the South which was held Saturday was foiled due to 
the South side's behavior. Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today says now the South Korean ruling quarters will be 
unable to duck their criminal responsibility for bringing the 
North-South relations again to an unpredictable phase of 
confrontation to attain their political aims. 
  The news analyst notes: 
  The whole course of the working-level contact tells that the 
South Korean authorities are, indeed, a group of heinous 
anti-national, anti-reunification separatists only seeking 
confrontation, division and war. 
  If the South side had really intended to exchange special 
envoys, it should have admitted and apologized for its criminal 
act in having abused the working contact to attain its political 
purpose and shown an affirmative response to the just proposal 
of the North side. 
  The South side, however, insulted the North side's proposal 
to take the stand and attitude of national independence as a 
"far-fetched redundancy". This is virtually a declaration that 
it has no intention to exchange special envoys. 
  At the negotiating table the South side let loose a string 
of 
provocative remarks getting on the nerve of the dialogue 
partner, and, behind the scene, made a virtual declaration of 
confrontation and war like "strong countermeasure". This was a 
deliberate and premeditated act to put the brakes on the 
DPRK-U.S. talks by foiling the working-level contact for the 
exchange of special envoys. 
  The South Korean people will never pardon the Kim Yong-sam 
group for foiling the working contact for the exchange of 
special envoys and bringing the North-South relations to a worst 
phase. 
  The South Korean authorities must admit and apologize to the 
nation for their criminal act in having abused the exchange of 
special envoys for their political stratagem to obstruct the 
DPRK-U.S. talks.

Japan-based pursuit-assault planes and VTOL assault planes 
belonging to the U.S. Marines flew to the air above Kapyong and 
Pochon north of Seoul on March 17 and staged a bombing exercise 
targeted against the northern half of Korea in coordination with 
the flying corps of the U.S. Seventh Air Force in South Korea, 
according to military sources. 
  Meanwhile, more than 300 fighter-bombers, assault planes, 
observation planes, helicopter gunships and reconnaissance 
planes belonging to the U.S. Air Force based in South Korea and 
the puppet air force staged an exercise in the air above 
Yongwol, Chungju, Yoju and Oeyon islet on the same day for the 
purpose of bombing, support for ground units and aerial warfare. 
  Synchronizing with the exercise, RC-135, RV-1, RC-12 and 
other tactical reconnaissance planes flew on the mission of 
aerial photographing and electronic espionage on the coastline, 
the forward and inland areas of the North. 
  The warplanes mobilized in the aerial exercises and 
espionage 
on the 17th totalled more than 600. 
  The U.S. imperialists' belligerent moves are getting more 
wanton with each passing day, screwing up the tension to a 
higher pitch on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> ["`Civilian' Regime Destroys Human Rights" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam loudly advertised "democratic politics" when he took 
the puppet presidential seat, but the present human rights 
situation in South Korea shows that the traitor's "commitment to 
democratic politics" was an empty phrasemongering and lie, says 
NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  The article goes on: 
  In South Korea the population are deprived of even their 
freedom to see, hear and speak as they please, to say nothing of 
the freedom of ideological choice and political activity, and 
not only their material and cultural life but their right to 
live are ruthlessly trampled upon. 
  What matters in the human rights situation in South Korea 
is, 
above all, that the repressive legal system and machines are not 
only maintained but further mal-revised [word as received] and 
supplemented. The Kim Yong-sam group not only has maintained 
the legal and institutional devices including the "National 
Security Law" which the preceding military fascist regimes had 
made the foundation of their existence, but also has expanded 
and strengthened the functions and role of such repressive tools 
as the "Security Planning Board" and "secret affairs command", 
the headquarters of evils, in a crafty way and drastically 
reinforced the puppet police to ruthlessly suppress the 
righteous struggle of the people at any time and in any place. 
  The human rights situation in South Korea offers a problem 
also because not only those who conduct patriotic, democratic 
activities but the workers, peasants and other labouring masses 
who champion their right to existence and even dissident 
democratic organizations are suppressed, branded as "leftist 
violent forces". 
  The fascist clique had arrested more than 200 students, 
intellectuals and others by invoking the "National Security Law" 
by October last year. This is 2.5 times the figure of those 
arrested in the initial corresponding period of the No Tae-u 
fascist clique's tenure. 
  What must not be overlooked is that the fascist clique is 
mercilessly cracking down on the workers and peasants who call 
for their right to live. 
  Grave human rights abuses by the Kim Yong-sam group are 
found 
in the fact that brutal tortures remain unabated, with a large 
number of patriots and guiltless people ruthlessly killed by 
tortures or punished on false "charges". Brutal tortures of all 
descriptions are inflicted on any detainees, whether they be 
aged and sick, women and even pregnant women, once they are 
arrested, in order to wrest false confessions. 
  Facts clearly show that the Kim Yong-sam regime is, indeed, 
a 
regime destroying human rights under the "civilian" veil. 
  The reality apparently confirms that the human rights 
problem 
in South Korea cannot be solved unless the Kim Yong-sam fascist 
regime is toppled.

<F P=106> ["Dangerous Arms Buildup"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Prime 
Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, openly declared a few days ago that 
"the reexamination of the general principles of the defence 
program is not aimed at slashing defence capabilities" and a 
liberal democratic dietman contended that "the self-defense 
forces cannot be reduced in view of the situation of the Korean 
peninsula which remains strained after the end of the Cold War". 
  Commening on this, a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN today 
says: 
  This proves that the Japanese authorities are trying to 
further legalize their schemes for overseas expansion and the 
conversion of Japan into a military power, throwing away even 
the mask of much-advertised "arms cut policy after the end of 
the Cold War." 
  The declaration of the Japanese reactionaries that the 
reexamination and revision of the "general principles of the 
defence program" is not aimed at reducing the "self-defense 
forces" is a malicious challenge to the aspiration of the world 
people and the demand of the time for the relaxation of tensions 
and peace. 
  Whenever an opportunity presents itself, the Japanese 
reactionaries do not forget to cry over the "nuclear threat" 
from the DPRK, distorting the fact as if it is rendering the 
situation unstable and thus presenting threat to Japan. This is 
a crafty ruse to brand the DPRK as the very one responsible for 
the aggravation of tension and gratify their wild desire for 
overseas expansion and conversion of Japan into a military power 
under this pretext. 
  By stating that it will build up arms because of the DPRK, 
Japan means to resort to an armed action against the DPRK. We 
cannot remain an overlooker to this. 
  As Japan intends to step up nuclear armament on a legal 
basis, ascribing it to us, we have no alternative but to 
reconsider our position toward the denuclearisation of the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The Japanese reactionaries had better look straight at the 
reality and stop running amuck.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- World public is 
denouncing Japan's nuclear armament that has reached a dangerous 
stage. 
  Alejandro Solorzano, chairman of the Diplomatic Committee of 
the National Assembly of Nicaragua, pointed out that Japan is 
shipping in a huge amount of plutonium. "The nuclear armament 
stepped up by Japan is a big stumbling-block in the way of the 
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula," he said. 
  He urged Japan to give up the foolish desire to become a 
nuclear power. 
  The Swedish paper SEVENSKA DAGBLADET said Japan is possessed 
of all that are needed for the production of nuclear weapons 
such as plutonium, electronic destructive device and technical 
personnel and has already manufactured nuclear warheads which 
only need appropriate amount of plutonium. 
  "Japan is not only capable of reprocessing plutonium but 
also 
has signed contracts with Britain and France for the purchase of 
plutonium. And it is possessed of space satellite technology 
with which it can establish a system of nuclear-tipped medium 
and long-range missiles, the paper said. 
  The Japanese magazine BUNGEI SHUNSHU said Japan has 
stockpiled 26 tons of plutonium far surpassing the amount needed 
for peaceful purposes. 
  The Tanzanian paper DAILY NEWS said the production capacity 
of the reprocessing plant of Japan is 800 tons topping the world 
list and Japan's nuclear armament has reached a danger line. 
  While stepping up its own nuclear armament, Japan is joining 
the United States and South Korea in crying over "nuclear 
suspicion" against North Korea, added the paper. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement said 
that Japan is feverishly promoting its nuclear armament, taking 
advantage of the situation that has got strained over the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of Korea, and called for an immediate 
halt to it.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- The Japan Defence 
Agency decided to convene a "forum" on the security of 
Asia-Pacific countries in Tokyo this fall and is now sounding 
out defence ministry officials of the United States, Russia, 
China, Southeast Asian countries and the South Korean puppets 
and extending invitations to them. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst today says the ulterior intention of 
Japan in hosting the "forum" is to divert elsewhere the cautious 
eyes of the international community against its nuclear armament 
and moves toward a military power and to give itself a boost, 
increase its say and exercise its influence in the security 
issue by dint of its economic potentials and take the leading 
position in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  Japan has grown into a dangerous aggression force in the 
Asia-Pacific region. Peace and security not only in northeast 
Asia but in the Asia-Pacific region is gravely threatened by 
Japan. 
  It is the height of folly for Japan to play host to a 
"forum" 
on security matters, a country which has defined a broad sphere 
of the Asia-Pacific region as its operational theatre with an 
aggressive design on the countries in this region. 
  It is a customary practice of the Japanese ruling quarters 
to 
satisfy their own interests by taking issue with others. 
  Japanese trigger-happy elements may call for "joint 
countermeasures" against somebody's "nuclear threat" when the 
"forum" is opened. 
  By so doing the Japanese reactionaries are intending to 
cover 
up their nuclear armament and moves toward a military power and 
step up their preparations for overseas aggression in real 
earnest behind the facade of "security". 
  The Japanese ruling quarters' talk about a "forum" on 
security in the Asia-Pacific region and the like is nothing but 
a petty trick to prettify their aggressive and dominationist 
nature.

<F P=106> ["International Justice Will Not Pardon Japan's Crime" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- If the Japanese 
Government authorities continue to resort to petty tricks to 
evade the responsibility for the criminal drafting of "comfort 
women for the Army", the world public will never pardon the 
crimes of Japan which gravely violated the international law and 
international morality, warns NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined 
article today. 
  It says: 
  Though the criminal drafting of "comfort women" was 
committed 
long ago, it is not a problem of the past but of today because 
the truth of the crime and its culprits have been confirmed in 
recent years. 
  Japan must honestly admit this crime, apologize for it and 
make compensations. 
  The Japanese authorities are evading the responsibility 
under 
the international law and ridiculously argue that the demand of 
the victims for compensations has already been settled through 
bilateral and multilateral agreements. 
  The international law defining war crimes and "crimes 
against 
humanity" demands compensations to the victims and punishment of 
those responsible. It is a crafty ruse to dodge punishment at 
any cost for Japan to persist in its attempt to evade the 
responsibility under the international law. 
  The Japanese Government has no legal right to rescind the 
human rights of an individual. The demand for a compensation is 
a right of the victims whose human rights were abused. 
  The Japanese authorities are nowadays even foolishly 
claiming 
it is impossible to verify that the victims demanding 
compensations were really "comfort women". This reveals their 
moral inferiority. They are lost to elementary human conscience 
and morality. If those responsible are not punished, Japan must 
be brought to the international court. 
  The Japanese authorities must admit at an earlier date the 
responsibility under the international law for the crime of 
Japan in drafting "comfort women for the Army" and seek its 
solution.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- World political and 
public circles are urging the United States to fully implement 
the agreed conclusions reached between the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea and the United States at a New York contact. 
  Fifteen political parties and organizations of Peru 
including 
the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the Communist Party and the 
National Association for the Study of the Chuche Idea of Peru 
released a joint statement on March 9 supporting the DPRK's just 
stand for a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The statement urged the United States to rescind the 
unreasonable preconditions and honestly implement the agreed 
steps of simultaneous action and denounced Japan and the South 
Korean authorities for stepping up their program of nuclear arms 
development, while balking the DPRK-U.S. talks for a solution to 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Communist Party of Colombia issued a statement on March 
8 
strongly demanding that the United States fully implement the 
just steps of simultaneous action which oblige both the DPRK and 
the United States to do what they should. 
  The Nigeria-DPRK Friendship Association in a statement March 
10 said that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was an 
offspring of the Korean policy of the U.S. for isolating and 
stifling the DPRK. It stressed that if the issue was to be 
solved, the DPRK and the United States must successfully hold 
the third round of the talks on the principle of equality, 
impartiality and respect for sovereignty. 
  The Nepalese paper CHALPAL March 6 said that no matter could 
be resolved by pressure and threat and that the basic way of 
solving the Korean question including the nuclear issue was 
dialogue and talks as insisted by the DPRK. 
  Chairman of the Guyanese National Committee for the Study of 
the Chuche Idea of Comrade Kim Il-song Robert Williams and 
former Chairman of the Nationalist Socialist Party of Syria in 
Lebanon David Baz released statements on March 8 urging the 
United States to promptly stop such despicable act as reversing 
its promise, setting preconditions again in the solution of the 
nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Great Leadership That Has Brought </F>
Up the Ever-Victorious, Invincible Army of the Party" -- 
passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: 
Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership has made a new advance in 
building the revolutionary armed forces. 
  Today our People's Army has grown up strong to be the 
party's 
ever-victorious, invincible Army, which firmly guarantees the 
chuche revolutionary cause, the socialist cause, with force of 
arms under the excellent and tested leadership of the supreme 
commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA] Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, a great commander. 
  With his deep insight into the significance and importance 
of 
the work of firmly preparing soldiers politically, 
ideologically, militarily, and technologically, our supreme 
commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has thoroughly mastered the 
great leader's [suryong] ideology and theory on army building 
and is constantly developing and enriching them, has extensively 
elucidated the theoretical and practical problems arising in 
fostering them into the party's fighters and wisely led them. 
  On 25 August, 1960 -- which is still fresh in our memory -- 
our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il visited a tank unit. 
That day, discovering the slogan "Let us defend with our lives 
the party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim Il-song" 
placed on the top of the gate of the soldiers' hall in the unit, 
Comrade Kim Chong-il said with emotion that this slogan is a 
good slogan reflecting the firm and invariable faith of our 
people and soldiers of the People's Army and that we should 
expedite the final victory of the Korean revolution by upholding 
this slogan in the future, too. 
  Two years later, one day in August 1962, our supreme 
commander Comrade Kim Chong-il visited a military camp. There, 
he made the significant remarks that the first, the second, and 
the third mission and duty of our fighters are to defend the 
leader [suryong] with our lives and stressed that the People's 
Army is the great leader's [suryong] Army and the Workers 
Party's Army. After that, he constantly made a tour of 
on-the-spot guidance to various units of different services and 
branches of the KPA and brilliantly elucidated and wisely led 
the direction and method that the People's Army should advance 
at every phase of the developing revolution. 
  In late April 1981, our supreme commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il personally called responsible functionaries of the 
People's Army. That day our supreme commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il scientifically analyzed the deviation as found in the 
international communist movement, and taught that we should 
inherit and consummate to the end the chuche revolutionary cause 
generation after generation under any difficult circumstances. 
He then said that to brilliantly inherit and consummate this 
cause, it is imperative to firmly guarantee the party's 
leadership. 
  At that moment, the functionaries were wrapped up in solemn 
emotion. The party's leadership--this is a fundamental source 
and lifeline of the might of our People's Army. Therefore, 
apart from the party's leadership, we cannot think about the 
existence of the People's Army itself and hope for victories in 
all activities. 
  What suddenly crossed the minds of the officials who are 
engraving his words was the days of the wise leadership of our 
supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il who exerted unremitting 
efforts to foster the People's Army into an invincible powerful 
Army as today that is endlessly loyal to the party. 
  It was a New Year's eve of a certain year when the whole 
country was stirring with the atmosphere of a holiday. Our 
supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il did not even rest on this 
New Year's day but called a functionary to give a teaching on 
the problems in the work of the People's Army. 
  On this day, as an Army of the great leader [suryong] and an 
Army of the party, the supreme comrade commander made a 
programmatic teaching, which will be a guideline in thoroughly 
being prepared with its party-type trait and in brilliantly 
realizing the cause of modeling the whole Army after the chuche 
idea. 
  Our supreme comrade commander said that the policy on 
further 
strengthening the People's Army politically and militarily is 
the leader's [suryong] program to strengthen the People's Army 
as a revolutionary force of the party and his determination, and 
also said that in the People's Army, it must be fully filled 
with the firm faith of entrusting everything to only the party 
and that it knows of no one else but the party. He said that 
this is the party-type trait which the People's Army must be 
prepared with. 
  He then warmly emphasized that this can be achieved only 
when the party's leadership system is thoroughly established 
within the People's Army. 
  It became late into the night in silence. Our Supreme 
Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il is embracing the programmatic 
guideline to further strengthen and develop the People's Army 
into the party's army. His efforts overflowing with enthusiasm 
continued endlessly. 
  The functionary who deeply bore in his heart the supreme 
comrade commander's teaching and who looked up to him, was 
infinitely pulsating with the pride and satisfaction of living 
and struggling by upholding the leader [yongdoja] of the 
revolutionary force who is such a brilliant and great person. 
  Truly, our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il elucidated 
the party's great military building program of the working 
class, and created a brilliant example in the party military 
building through outstanding military ideology, theory, and 
unremitting energetic activities. He is a military commander of 
the times. 
  It is not only this. To foster the People's Army into a 
party's army, which is possessed with a party-type trait, our 
Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il not only provided a 
programmatic guideline and fundamental principle in military 
building, but he also took an epoch-making measure to thoroughly 
implement it. He is also a refined leader [yongdoja] of the 
revolutionary force who led the People's Army step by step and 
hand in hand. 
  It was mid-March 1985. On this day, our Supreme Commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il talked with a responsible functionary of 
the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces through the telephone 
and made an epoch-making measure to further strengthen and 
develop the People's Army into a party's Army and embraced him 
with great faith. That functionary tried hard to repress his 
heart which was burning with passion, and stood for a long time 
with the receiver in his hand as if he was stuck. 
  The historical days when the supreme comrade commander 
endlessly exerted all his energy to thoroughly establish the 
party's leadership system within the People's Army was once 
again warmly rekindled in the mind of the functionary. 
  One day in late August 1977 our Supreme Commander Comrade 
Kim 
Chong-il called the functionary and gave a valuable teaching to 
him for a long time. Comrade supreme commander told him that the 
basic mission of the party organizations and political organs in 
the People's Army is to build our People's Army into a powerful 
party's Army by firmly establishing the party's unitary 
ideological system, that is, the party's leadership system, 
within the entire Army. He then stressed that soldiers should 
not forget historic lessons and should advance upholding the 
banner of modeling the entire Army after the chuche idea in the 
People's Army in order to be infinitely loyal to the party's 
leadership. 
  Looking at comrade supreme commander who was continuing the 
talk with strong passion the functionary seethed with burning 
emotion. The great commander Comrade Kim Chong-il who [word 
indistinct] the political [word indistinct] of the People's Army 
and who is setting the Army on a firm, immortal track today by 
personally leading the party's work in the Army! With what words 
can we explain the efforts he has devoted in fostering the 
People's Army into the party's army? When the functionary's 
heart was seething with such thought the Supreme Commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il told him that it is important to correctly 
grasp the principal line in the party's political work in the 
People's Army and that the principal line in the party's 
political work in the People's Army is to firmly establish the 
party's leadership system. 
  Indeed, our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
teaching 
on that day was precious words which make it possible for 
functionaries to clearly know the principal line and core 
element in the party's political work in the Army and to 
outstandingly perform their mission. The physical and mental 
efforts our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il has devoted 
to strengthen and develop the KPA into an ever-victorious, 
invincible party's Army are indeed boundless. 
  Comrade Kim Kyong-hwan, a KPA officer, says: "The Supreme 
Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who earlier elucidated the 
mission and duty of the revolutionary armed forces as a profound 
principle has thoroughly established the leadership system of 
the entire Army in conformity with the inherent nature and 
mission of the People's Army and is energetically leading the 
struggle to strengthen the People's Army politically and 
ideologically. Thanks to the wise leadership of the comrade 
supreme commander who set forth the slogan of loyalty, `Let us 
fight with life for the great leader [suryong]' and who has led 
soldiers not only to strengthen the education in loyalty to the 
party and the leader [suryong], but also to accelerate the 
revolution our People's Army has been able to firmly adhere to 
the revolutionary character as the leader's Army and as the 
party's Army and to constantly consummate the party's features 
in conformity with the demands of the developing revolution." 
  Yes, it is indeed so. Our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's wise leadership was the great (?bloodshot) and the 
boundless nourishment which has fostered the People's Army into 
an ever-victorious and invincible army which is infinitely loyal 
to the party. Thanks to these great (?bloodshot) and infinite 
nourishment today our People's Army has been able to grow up to 
be a genuine party's Army which is demonstrating its 
ever-victorious might. 
  These ranks of loyalty and ranks of singlehearted unity will 
trust and follow forever only our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, the great commander, as the party's army and will more 
vigorously fight under his leadership for the consummation and 
victory of the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style 
and for the country's reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, highly praised 
the feat of Hong Kyong-ae, a non-commissioned officer of the 
People's Army who died after saving her comrades while on her 
military duty, and recently took care that she was awarded the 
title of heroine of the Republic and her platoon was called 
"Hong Kyong-ae Platoon". 
  Last year, Comrade Kim Chong-il, upon hearing that Yu 
Kyong-nam, a soldier of the Korean People's Army, died after 
saving his comrades by covering a handgrenade on the point of 
explosion with his body, called him a "fine son of the country" 
and put him up as a hero of the Republic. 
  The self-sacrificing spirit of devoting oneself to the 
country and the people is highly displayed among KPA soldiers. 
In this course, many heroes and heroines have emerged. 
  In the 1990s when the Korean revolution has entered a new, 
higher stage of development, many heroes have been produced, 
including KPA officer Kim Kwang-chol and KPA soldiers Han 
Yong-chol and Yim Kwang-chol who laid down their youth for the 
country. 
  They stand like immortals under the deep loving care of 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Their busts were built at their alma maters and their 
schools, platoons and companies were named after them. 
  His loving care based on a high sense of obligation also 
reaches the heroic soldiers who passed away long ago. 
  Standing on the Chujak Peak of scenic Mt. Taesong in the 
suburbs of Pyongyang is a revolutionary martyrs cemetery with 
busts of anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners who devoted 
their whole lives to the liberation of the country and the 
happiness of the people. 
  Saying the anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs are all 
heroes 
and heroines, Comrade Kim Chong-il saw to it that the medal of 
the hero of the Republic was embossed in the centre of the 
wreath-laying stand of the cemetery, thus awarding them the 
title of hero which had not been conferred upon them in their 
lifetime. 
  Under such benevolence a patriotic martyrs cemetery was 
built 
in Sinmi-ri in the suburbs of Pyongyang to hand down to the 
posterity the exploits of the martyrs who devoted their whole 
lives to the cause of socialist construction and national 
reunification. 
  There are many places, industrial establishments, 
cooperative 
farms and schools bearing the names of heroes in different parts 
of the country, more than 100 units in all. They include Kim 
Chong-suk county (former Sinpa County) in Yanggang Province, a 
historical place associated with the revolutionary exploits of 
Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an indomitable communist revolutionary 
fighter, during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, Kim 
Chaek City (former Songjin City) in North Hamgyong Province, the 
hometown of Comrade Kim Chaek, an anti-Japanese revolutionary 
fighter, the Yi Su-pok Chemical College in Sunchon and the Cho 
Ok-hui Cooperative Farm.

Home" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- Working people in 
Pyongyang held a joint meeting to mark the first anniversary of 
the return of a former war correspondent of the Korean People's 
Army Yi In-mo, to the bosom of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  Put up at the meeting place was a board carrying the words 
of 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il: "Our party remembers 
Comrade Yi In-mo, an incarnation of faith and will". On display 
at the meeting place were silk banners, scrolls and gifts sent 
by people of all strata to Yi In-mo. 
  Kim Ki-nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea, in his speech at the meeting said that 
Yi In-mo's return to the socialist homeland with an unshakable 
faith and will for the party and the leader was a historical 
event which demonstrated the brilliant victory of Korean-style 
socialism centred on the popular masses over capitalism. 
  "Yi In-mo could fight resolutely with an unshakable faith in 
the party and the leader, unflinchingly defending the principle 
of a member of the Workers' Party of Korea, not yielding to the 
sufferings in prison for 34 years in South Korea, because he 
revered the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the mental pillars of the Korean 
people, the speaker said, and stressed: 
  "Through Yi's destiny, the Korean people have become more 
convinced and keenly felt that the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il is the destiny of our country and nation, the destiny 
of socialism and a great symbol of all our victory, glory and 
happiness". 
  Yi In-mo said that it is the dear leader who has brought him 
back to life from the jaw of death and extended warm thanks to 
the dear leader who has brought him the happiness today. He 
said he came to the meeting with a floral basket, wishing the 
great leader President Kim Il-song and general Kim Chong-il a 
long life in good health. 
  Yi Hyon-ok, daughter of Yi In-mo, referring to the loving 
care shown by the dear leader to her father, said that the dear 
leader is the destiny and a tender-hearted father of all our 
people. 
  Yi In-mo and his family sang a song overflowing with deepest 
reverence for the dear leader to the accompaniment of the piano 
sent by him. 
  Poems written by Yi In-mo in praise of the greatness of 
general Kim Chong-il were read at the meeting. 
  Anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and workers, farmers, 
youths and students of the new generation present at the meeting 
said that they would defend and glorify Korean-style socialism, 
loudly singing the song of faith that we would certainly win in 
any difficulty because we are guided by supreme commander 
general Kim Chong-il. 
  Gifts from people of all strata to Yi In-mo were conveyed at 
the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Great Love That Had Made Dead Tree Blossom" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- It is the day when Yi 
In-mo well known at home and abroad as the incarnation of faith 
and will came back to the socialist homeland a year ago. 
  His 365 days in the homeland were really impressive days 
embroidered with the noble love and obligation and the 
unbreakable bonds of kinship between the illustrious leader and 
an ordinary soldier. 
  The 43 years of Yi In-mo in a "hell on earth" and his one 
year in the earthly paradise make us picture to ourselves the 
incarnation of great human love that has made a dead tree 
blossom. 
  Yi In-mo served as a war correspondent in the period of the 
fatherland liberation war unleashed by the U.S. imperialists 40 
odd years ago. During the war, he got heavily wounded and was 
taken prisoner, leaving his fate unknown. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song awarded a certificate 
of the bereaved family of a revolutionary martyr to Yi In-mo's 
family in 1968 when his fate was not known, expressing 
unquestioned trust in the soldier. 
  After it was known that he was alive and he fought 
undauntedly for 34 years in prison, the great leader, very 
pleased that his trust in him was not in vain, decided to confer 
the title of the Hero of the Republic upon him, highly 
appreciating his patriotic faith and will. 
  Immeasurable are the efforts exerted by him to bring an old 
soldier on sickbed at a tip of South Korea back to Pyongyang 
where his wife and a daughter were waiting for him. 
  At the time he was sent back to the North, he was, indeed, a 
"dead man." His internal organs were all abnormal and he was 
suffering from serious malnutrition, pyothorax and general 
famine by medieval tortures for more than 12,400 days in prison. 
  Even officials concerned of the South wondered if he could 
reach Pyongyang alive. 
  Yi In-mo, however, expressed his admiration for the 
fascinating reality of the North three days after he was 
embraced by the Republic and began writing some 70 days after. 
It was some 100 days after he returned to the North that he 
left the sickbed and toured different places of the socialist 
homeland together with his family, seeing its imposing reality 
at first hand. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il have always shown deep loving care for his 
health and life over the last one year. More than 100 kinds of 
tonics and expensive medicine sent by them for his health and 
their precious teachings on more than 120 occasions and deep 
love on over 40 occasions have brought him to the culmination of 
happiness and glory. 
  Yi In-mo has visited time-honored Mangyongdae, Mt. Paektu, 
the ancestral mountain, the Tower of the Chuche Idea, the arch 
of triumph, Pabal-ri, his home town, and other places of the 
homeland. 
  Touring the homeland, he has keenly felt that the love and 
trust of the illustrious leader is not confined to him but 
reaches all of the people. 
  Therefore, he, out of the absolute worship to the 
illustrious 
leader, wrote poems "On My Fate," "Thought of Love" and "Song in 
Praise of Faith and Will" and words of the song "We Will Win 
Because You Are Leading Us" and other works singing of the noble 
love of the Workers' Party of Korea, and today contributed a 
full-length article titled "We Are Blessed With Sagacious 
Leader" to NODONG SINMUN. 
  This is not only what Yi In-mo said from the bottom of his 
heart but the unshakable faith of the entire Korean people.

<F P=106> ["`We Are Blessed With Sagacious Leader' -- article by Yi </F>
In-mo carried in NODONG SINMUN" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- Yi In-mo, a former war 
correspondent of the Korean People's Army and now widely known 
in the world as the incarnation of faith and will, contributed a 
lengthy article entitled "We Are Blessed With Sagacious Leader" 
to the editorial board of NODONG SINMUN upon the lapse of one 
year since he returned to the socialist homeland. 
  NODONG SINMUN today devotes one whole page to the article. 
  In the article Yi In-mo gives an emotion-charged description 
of the fact that the Korean people are blessed with a sagacious 
leader, on the basis of his life experience, saying he felt this 
most deeply among a lot of things he has felt and understood in 
the last one year since he found himself in the embrace of the 
socialist homeland after 43 years. 
  The article writes that it is a great fortune of the Korean 
people to be guided by such a peerless hero as our leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il who is possessed of both outstanding 
military qualities and brilliant literary accomplishments and 
with exceptional loyalty and filial piety to the great leader 
President Kim Il-song. "Our people are, indeed, blessed with a 
sagacious leader as others enviously say," it notes. 
  In the first part of the article "We Have the Greatest 
General of Generals" Yi In-mo tells about the greatness of the 
dear leader who overcomes ordeals and adversity. 
  Noting that the situation was so grave when he returned home 
that he looked attentively at the developments and the weather 
chart of world politics, but the homeland guided by Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, an unrivalled, most brilliant general in the world, 
was unwavering, the article says: 
  When the United States threatened us with "Team Spirit" 
joint 
military exercises in South Korea, it was the sagacious general 
who struck the provokers with terror with his strategy and grit 
befitting the famous general, with his dignified orders that 
they would not be allowed to touch even a single tree, a single 
blade of grass of our homeland. When they attempted to encroach 
on the supreme national interests of our Republic by raising a 
clamor for a "special nuclear inspection" in the international 
arena, it was also our general who defended the destiny of the 
homeland with his decisiveness and will as a brilliant commander 
through another statement that such brigandish logic or 
strongarm action cannot work on us and that no threat and 
blockade can frighten us. 
  It was our general who quelled the reckless frenzy with his 
iron will, determined to answer dialogue with dialogue, and a 
war with a war, when the United States goaded the foolish 
warmaniacs of the South on to confrontation and war, breaking 
its promise to our Republic. It was our General Kim Chong-il, 
the most famous general in the world, who brought a dramatic 
turnabout in the situation through the decisive declaration that 
not only big countries but we also have options, when they were 
again trying to opt the way of military pressure. 
  As the great leader President Kim Il-song said in praise of 
him, our Comrade Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a brilliant commander 
possessed of both literary and military accomplishments. Our 
dear leader is, in the real sense of the word, a great hero who 
wins with his ideology, his strategy and his grit. 
  Our dear leader is the most illustrious general of generals 
who moves the globe, placing it on his palm, and always emerges 
victorious. 
  In the second part of the article "We Have the Man of 
Noblest 
Human Qualities" Yi In-mo says he has felt the virtues and 
personality of the dear leader, a great man, from his sense of 
obligations. 
  Our dear leader is a benefactor who found out like spotting 
a 
gem in the sand me who was living with the support of farm 
family on the shore of the South sea after spending not a long 
period at a lonely home for the aged in the South, and took 
pains and gave instructions on hundreds of occasions for years 
to bring me back to the homeland, says Yi In-mo. 
  Referring to all solicitudes and deep loving care shown by 
the dear leader for him since his return to the homeland, Yi 
recalls that when Koreans residing in an alien land presented to 
him a rare quilt which they had prepared with utmost care 
wishing him good health, the tender-hearted dear leader thought 
of him first and sent it to him, warmly saying Yi In-mo must 
have slept with no quilt in prison in the South, so, not he, but 
Yi should have it. 
  To love human beings and hold the people dearest as the 
almighty beings is our dear leader's philosophy of love for the 
people, the article says, and stresses: 
  It is said from olden times that humbleness and modesty are 
good virtues. Our dear leader is, indeed, a "great commoner". 
That is why the people follow him. 
  The might of love and good virtues is great. It is natural 
that all the people come like clouds to be embraced by the dear 
leader who is possessed of such great love and noble virtues. 
  Indeed, dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is the man of noblest 
human 
qualities. And ours are a people who are blessed with a 
sagacious leader and guided by the man of noblest qualities. 
  In the third part of the article "I Make Up My Mind" Yi 
In-mo 
tells about his duty as a soldier to uphold the dear leader, 
saying the people who are blessed with a sagacious leader must 
uphold the leader with loyalty. 
  He notes that although he is now in the waning days of his 
life he is determined mentally to uphold the leader with loyalty 
and physically to become an impregnable castle wall in defence 
of the leader, and hardened his resolve to safeguard socialism 
at the cost of his life. 
  He says: 
  I think our minds must always be clean in upholding the 
leader and defending socialism. 
  So I am going to live, saying to myself like this every day 
and every moment: 
  -- When I wake up every morning, I'll think of the great 
leader and the dear leader first. 
  -- Whatever work I may do, I'll always do it with the 
great leader and the dear leader in my mind. 
  -- When I go to sleep, I'll first wish the great leader 
and the dear leader well. 
  -- Whenever I dream, I'll dream of the great leader and he 
dear leader. 
  -- We who are blessed with a sagacious leader must know to 
uphold the leader with loyalty and filial piety.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with a political essay entitled "Epic of Love and 
Faith" on the lapse of one year since a former war correspondent 
of the Korean People's Army, Yi In-mo, the incarnation of faith 
and will, was returned to the embrace of the socialist homeland 
on March 19, 1993. 
  The political essay says it is a miracle of miracles that Yi 
In-mo could return alive from South Korea where he had been 
detained for 43 years, undergoing all sorts of indescribable 
outrages and appeasement by fascist hangmen throughout his 34 
years in prison in particular. 
  He has been able to take the course of his life to a 
paradise 
from the "hell", overcoming innumerable trying difficulties 
because he has fought and won with his iron faith and will, says 
the essay. 
  When we say about his faith and will, we cannot but think of 
his mental support, the basic factor of it, the essay says, and 
goes on: 
  It was his belief that victory was sure to come as long as 
there a the great general, that the bosom of the general was a 
true cradle of life for all his soldiers and that a bright 
future of the revolution and the Reunification of the country 
and prosperity of the nation lay in following the road indicated 
by the general. 
  It was his unquestioned trust in the illustrious leader that 
enabled him to enjoy respect and love of all the people as the 
incarnation of faith and will, the highest honour ever granted 
to the revolutionaries in the world. 
  "Our party remembers Comrade Yi In-mo, the incarnation of 
faith and will" -- these words written in person by the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il before Yi In-mo returned to the 
bosom of the homeland reflect his trust in a soldier who was 
suffering in South Korea and contain his iron will and 
determination to bring him home to a paradise under whatever 
circumstances. 
  Our general Kim Chong-il did not forget even a moment about 
the fate of a soldier but took all steps for his repatriation, 
although he was busy leading the whole party, all the people and 
the army to victory, shoulding the burden of all important work 
decisive of the destiny of the whole nation and of world peace 
and security. 
  On March 19, ten days after a semi-war state was proclaimed, 
when a touch-and-go situation was created in which a war might 
break out any moment, an old soldier, a veteran party member who 
had already been sentenced to death by the enemy returned to the 
northern half of the country, all alone, making a breakthrough 
in the wall of division. 
  Indeed, in the mind of our general Kim Chong-il are all his 
soldiers, the whole nation, and he is in the minds of our 
people, our nation. For this close bonds of kinship the dear 
leader is regarded as the mental support of all his soldiers. 
  Referring to the highest honour and happiness Yi In-mo has 
experienced in the last one year since his return to the 
northern half of the country, the political essay goes on: 
  Comrade Yi In-mo was awarded "Order of Kim Il-song", the 
highest honour of the DPRK, and the medal of Hero of the 
Republic and even his bronze statue was erected at his hometown 
thanks to the broadminded benevolence of the great general Kim 
Chong-il. 
  The bosom of the great general Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a 
cradle of life without which all our soldiers cannot live even a 
moment, the bosom of the mother always dear to their hearts and 
a benevolent bosom which brings socialist life into full bloom. 
  The great general's benevolence gives the worth of life and 
pleasure not only to comrade Yi In-mo but to all the people of 
the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- Sowing of seed rice on 
cold-frame beds began on the cooperative fields of Korea as 
spring came. 
  The cooperative farmers throughout the country have made 
full 
preparations for rice-seedling cold beds with a goal of 
harvesting another bumper crops this year marking the 30th 
anniversary of the publication of the socialist rural theses 
(February 1964). 
  Doing farming on a scientific and technological basis on the 
principle of the right crop in the right time and the right crop 
on the right soil, they set down to the sowing of seed rice on 
cold-frame beds in good time. 
  In Yonbaek, Jaeryong, Yoltusamcholli and other plain areas, 
the granaries on the west coast of the country, the first day 
sowing quotas were overfulfilled with the help of various kinds 
of highly efficient machines including seed rice sowing and 
manuring machines. 
  The cooperative farms there have more than doubled their 
work speed daily by scrupulously organizing workforce according 
to different processes of the sowing. 
  The rural communities in North Phyongan and North Hwanghae 
Provinces chose fast-growing and high-yielding strains and are 
strictly meeting the technical requirements in sowing. 
  The sowing of seed rice on cold beds takes more than ten 
days. It is a very important farming process in Korea. 
  Meanwhile, the preparation of humus-potted maize seedlings 
is 
in full swing in rural communities throughout the country. 
  The work had been carried out at 57 percent nationwide as of 
March 18.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- March 21 is the 20th 
anniversary of the proclamation of the law on the abolition of 
taxation in Korea. With the enforcement of the law Korea became 
the first tax-free country in the world. 
  The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea that regard it as the 
supreme principle of their activities to promote the welfare of 
the people have paid deep attention to making the working people 
evenly well off and steadily improving their living. 
  Under the popular policies of the party and the state the 
predatory tax system, a leftover of the old society, was 
destroyed to give place to a popular tax system after the 
liberation of the country. More than fifty kinds of 
miscellaneous taxes were abolished and tax was unified. 
  Even in the difficult period after the war measures were 
adopted to systematically reduce the tax burden of the people. 
  In 1955 the income tax of the factory and office workers was 
cut by thirty percent and the tax burden of the handicraftsmen, 
entrepreneurs and traders slashed drastically. The rate of the 
agricultural tax in kind which accounted for 25 percent of the 
harvest dropped to 20.1 percent on an average in the same year 
and it again went down to 8.4 percent in 1959. 
  The agricultural tax in kind from which farmers had been 
partially exempted was completely abolished in 1966 so that all 
the farm produce could be turned entirely to the improvement of 
the living standards of the agricultural working people. 
  Later, even the negligible income tax levied upon the 
factory 
and office workers was completely repealed. 
  The word "tax" is gradually fading in the memory of the 
people. The younger generation does not know what it means. 
  The people enjoy the daily growing, enormous benefits from 
the state, far from paying taxes to the state. 
  The additional benefits rendered by the state under the 
social and cultural measures such as free education, free 
medical service, paid leave, free accommodation at sanatoria and 
holiday homes, old age pension and social security, exceed the 
wages of the working people.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tasty, Nutritious Bean-based </F>
Imitation Meat"] 
  [Text] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: 
By broadly accepting achievements in modern science and 
technology, the food industry should direct efforts to 
technological innovation in order to timely process various 
foodstuffs industrially and to produce and ensure clean, 
nutritious, and expedient processed foodstuffs at a low price. 
  Scientists in the light industry sector, who actively 
conducted scientific research activities by upholding the 
party's intent, finished developing the technology for the 
production of tasty and nutritious imitation meat made with 
beans, and put this technology into practice. 
  By deeply cherishing the lofty intent of the dear comrade 
leader to constantly upgrade the people's living standard, 
scientists in the Grain Engineering Research Institute and Food 
Machine Research Institute of the Academy of Science for Light 
Industry, dedicated their passion and study to developing a 
large quantity of good- quality foodstuffs suiting people's 
taste. They succeeded in producing a tasty, nutritious, and 
easy-to-process imitation meat by using bean residues from which 
soybean oil was extracted. 
  The imitation meat, which was recently researched and 
developed, is highly nutritious, and is easy to process and 
store. 
  In addition, its structure [chojik kujo] and the feel when 
it 
is chewed are nearly the same as meat. Thus, it has a good 
flavor. Besides, the process to manufacture it is simple and its 
cost is low. For this, it is regarded as a cheap foodstuffs 
product. 
  This has been proven by several papers presented by 
scientists after examination and analysis. 
  Various products were compared and showed that 100 grams of 
pork has 107 calories; meat 88, and bean curd made of bean 
residues has 82. However, the calorie value of this imitation 
meat was 134, showing 1.2 times more calories than pork, 1.5 
times more than meat, and 1.6 times more than bean curd made of 
bean residues. 
  An analysis shows that pork has 21 percent of protein; meat 
18.7 percent, and bean curd made of bean residues 9.6 percent. 
However, bean-based imitation meat showed 14.5 percent of 
protein. Thus, it has contains more protein than bean 
residues-made bean curd, although less than pork and meat. 
  Besides, 95 percent of the bean-based imitation meat protein 
is digestible. It has no harmful element to the health of people. 
  Bean-based imitation meat has also the advantage that it can 
be stored for a long time. This meat is easy to dry, and can be 
stored for about a month in the summer without packing, and 
about five months in the spring and autumn. The refrigerated and 
compressed bean-based imitation meat can be stored for as long 
as one year, and if well packaged, it can be stored for over a 
year. 
  Thus, the bean-based imitation meat, has a high nutritious 
value, is easy to process, and it is tasty. 
  Residents in many places who actually included this meat in 
their diet said its taste is similar to that of chicken when 
they mixed in various seasonings after soaking it in water for a 
few minutes. In particular, soup made with this meat mixed in 
with some real meat, pork or chicken, is very delicious, just as 
that made of real meat. 
  Since the cost of making bean-based imitation meat is very 
low, it is very cheap. 
  Bean residues from which soybean oil was extracted, some 
salt, and baking soda, are all the materials required for 
producing this imitation meat. 
  Electricity consumption is also very low. 
  Besides, its production process is simple, and setting up 
its 
production facilities is relatively easy. 
  The process is as follows: We cut bean residues, from which 
soybean oil is extracted, into pieces of a certain size and mix 
them in water with salt and baking soda. We then knead them, and 
put them in a two-axis screw compressor. They will then be 
turned into a form of fiber in the machine at a temperature of 
135 degrees Centigrade and at a three-megapascal pressure. 
Following this, they will pass through thin mechanical nozzle 
opening, and will spout out to the air instantaneously. This is 
how the imitation meat is produced. 
  As its production process is very simple, one can easily 
produce it anywhere if one has a two-axis screw compressor. 
  Functionaries and workers in the Yongbok general foodstuff 
plant in Pyongyang, in the Changgwang dried rice foodstuff 
plant, and in the rice mill of the Chunghwa cooperative farm in 
Chunghwa County, have gained experience in producing bean-based 
imitation meat in cooperation with scientists. Their experience 
shows that if we work with revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance, we can easily learn this production process. 
  In fact, engineering workshops in foodstuffs plants set up 
this production process with their own strength, and are using 
it to produce bean-based imitation meat. 
  The bean-based imitation meat, which was produced by the 
light industry scientists, who uphold lofty intention of dear 
comrade leader, will certainly contribute to enriching the 
people's dietary life in the future.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry is trying to trace the source 
of the ammonium nitrate which made up part of an extremely 
powerful suicide-bomb found in the back of a truck in Bangkok on 
Thursday. 
  Ammonium nitrate is a colorless, crystalline salt used 
chiefly in explosives and fertilizers. 
  Sources at the Defense Ministry said it is classified as a 
"military logistical item" and its distribution is restricted by 
law. All purchases and shipments of ammonium nitrate must be 
made through the ministry's Industry and Energy Center. 
  "The center is trying to trace the source of the one ton of 
the substance found as part of the explosive device in the 
foiled bombing attack believed directed at the Israeli 
diplomatic mission," one of the sources said. 
  The sources said the person who assembled the bomb must have 
bought the chemical from authorized users registered with the 
Industry and Energy Center. 
  Buyers of ammonium nitrate must prove they are in the 
rock-blasting business or produce fertilizers, as well as have a 
license to possess and use explosives from the Interior Ministry. 
  There are about 20 merchants licensed to sell the compound 
in 
Thailand, the sources said. 
  Under the law governing military supply, illegal possession 
and use of ammonium nitrate is punishable by a maximum prison 
term of five years and/or a fine of up to Bt50,000. Using the 
fertilizer to make an explosive device is liable to punishment 
under the law on firearms and explosives. 
  One of the sources said the explosive mixture found on the 
truck--C-4 explosive, diesel oil and ammonium nitrate, known as 
"witches' brew"--would not be very effective if detonated in the 
open. 
  "If detonated in an open space there would be very loud 
blast 
and not much else," the source said. "But the bomb would be 
devastating if set off in an enclosed area, inside a building."

  [Text] The foreign terrorists who assembled the truck-bomb 
discovered on Thursday probably had Thai allies, Interior 
Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut said yesterday. 
  His admission coincided with a police announcement that a 
warrant will be issued tomorrow for the arrest of a suspected 
international terrorist, and that other warrants may follow. 
  Police said at least four people collaborated in assembling 
the truckbomb. 
  It was likely Thais were involved since it was difficult for 
foreigners to buy all the components locally. 
  "I have learned that some Thais joined the gang. The 
crackdown must be made at their grassroots," Chavalit said. 
  Citing a police report, the minister said one of the 
suspected foreign terrorists is believed to be still hiding in 
Bangkok. Police are trying to locate the others. 
  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Chaisit 
Kanchanakit said police will on Monday issue a warrant for the 
arrest of a suspected international terrorist whose identity was 
already known. 
  Chaisit said he met Israeli embassy officials yesterday 
morning and they agreed to send anti-terrorism experts to 
support the police hunt for the masterminds. 
  Police discovered by sheer luck on Thursday a tonne of high 
explosive in a water tank on the back of a six-wheel truck 
earlier abandoned at the busy Ploenchit-Chitlom intersection on 
March 11 when the driver fled after hitting a taxi motorcycle. 
  The chance accident averted what could have been the most 
disastrous terrorist attack in Thailand. Police said the truck 
driver appeared to be on a suicide-mission to the Israeli 
embassy, which is less than one kilometre away. 
  The truck-bomb was composed of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, 
C-4 cxplosive and diesel oil with a detonating switch on the 
vehicle's dashboard. The formula is similar to "witches brew", 
the deadly mixture used to bomb the New York World Trade Centre 
last year and police are investigating a possible link between 
the two incidents. 
  A corpse also found in the tank was positively identified as 
the Thai driver who delivered the rented truck to the terrorists. 
  Police on Friday found 25 sacks of ammonium nitrate-based 
fertilizer and an empty water tank in an abandoned house in 
Bangkok's Bung Kum District. The landlord said she had rented 
the house to a group of Arab men. 
  Police yesterday produced a sketch of a second suspect in 
the 
sabotage attempt. An artist's sketch of the first suspect, 
drawn from details given by the owner of the motorcycle hit by 
the truck, had already been sent to all police stations. 
  Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen, Thawi 
Thippharat yesterday said the two suspects are from the Middle 
East, but he would not specify their nationality. 
  Chawalit yesterday said some foreign embassies have assigned 
officials to help the police investigation. 
  Commissioner Chaisit, meanwhile, said police are waiting for 
more information from the Israeli embassy to determine whether 
additional arrest warrants should also be issued. 
  He said police had lifted fingerprints from the Bung Kum 
house and they should be useful in identifying the terrorists 
and their organization. 
  The commissioner said he did not know whether any of the 
culprits were still in the country. 
  If the perpetrators were found to be hiding overseas, 
investigators could seek cooperation from local police through 
Interpol to arrest and extradite them to Bangkok for legal 
prosecution, he said. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said on his retum from Vietnam 
yesterday that he expected a detailed report on the case 
tomorrow. 
  He defended the government intelligence units against 
criticism that the planned terrorist attack almost succeeded 
because they lacked efficiency, saying they have been consistent 
with their monitoring of possible terrorist activity in Thailand. 
  "We should be fair to them. Some kinds of work are not 
easy," he said. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, a former secretary-general 
of the National Security Council, said he acknowledged that 
terrorist groups had tried to use Thailand as a base to launch 
their attacks. 
  He said the current efficiency level of Thai intelligence 
units is good, but it is impossible for them to know everything.

  [Excerpts] The Opposition yesterday cashed in on Thursday's 
abortive international terrorism plot in Bangkok, calling on 
Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut to show his 
responsibility over the incident. 
  Chat Thai Secretary-General Banhan Sinlapa-acha said Gen 
Chawalit must take responsibility because he had ordered the 
change of the Police Department director-general claiming the 
past police boss could not ensure internal peace. 
  The accidental discovery of the huge bomb in Bangkok only 
showed that the people were more vulnerable to danger than ever 
before, he said. 
  Mr Banhan said he admitted that it was beyond the 
authorities 
to prevent untoward incidents from happening. 
  However, he said Gen Chawalit must try to explain the 
situation to the people when such incidents occur and not just 
let them pass silently since that would only cause the public to 
panic. 
  Mr Banhan did not dismiss the possibility that the 
Opposition 
would use the incident as ammunition to censure Gen Chawalit in 
Parliament. 
  "We will discuss that in May," Mr Banhan said. Parliament 
will convene for an ordinary session in May after opening for an 
extra session from the end of this month to deliberate the Lower 
House members' constitutional amendment proposals. 
  The Suphan Buri MP said he did not want to say if Gen 
Chawalit should "show his political spirit" over the incident. 
  Chat Thai leader Praman Adireksan said it was not time yet 
for the Opposition to initiate a censure motion against Gen 
Chawalit but noted "we are thinking about it and will discuss it 
later." 
  Gen Chawalit, talking to reporters in Nakhon Phanom 
yesterday, said he would not be worried if the Opposition used 
the abortive terrorism plot in Bangkok as a ammunition to 
censure him. 
  He dismissed the suggestion that a spate of bombing 
incidents 
in the country during his term at the Interior Ministry 
indicated that the ministry has failed in its job to maintain 
peace and order for the people. 
  There are more than 60 million people in the country. The 
police should be commended for their ability to maintain peace, 
he said. 
  When asked if he believed that violent incidents would cease 
if he decided to step down as the Interior Minister Gen Chawalit 
quipped: 
  "You'd better find that out from a fortune teller." 
  Meanwhile, Army chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit urged all Thais to 
help keep vigil against possible international terrorist attacks 
in the country. 
  Returning from his visit to India, Gen Wimon said it was the 
duty of all Thais to serve as an eye and ear for the country. 
  "We must not allow anybody to use Thailand as a stage for 
terrorism as that will damage the image and economy," he said. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said it was too early for 
the authorities to conclude the nationality of the terrorists 
who assembled the home-made bomb. 
  However, he was confident that investigators would be able 
to 
obtain more information on the case soon. [passage omitted] 
  Police Department chief Pratin Santipraphop who led a team 
of 
top Metropolitan policemen to meet with American diplomats at 
the United States Embassy yesterday urged the media to exercise 
restraint in presenting news reports about the bomb. 
  He said the reports could hurt the good relations between 
Thailand and friendly countries. 
  In Nakhon Si Thammarat, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin 
Phitsuwan said that terrorist bombings had taken place before in 
several other countries, including those where there are tighter 
precautionary security measures. 
  What is important, he said, is when a bombing occurs, 
authorities concerned must cooperate with one another and also 
with foreign governments to adopt tighter measures to ensure 
that the incidents will not be repeated. 
  Mr Surin suggested officials and politicians be cautious in 
making comments, warning that careless remarks may cause 
misunderstanding and tarnish the country's image. 
  He said the foiled bomb plot against the Israeli Embassy was 
the work of international terrorists using Thai soil to stage 
terrorism. 
  Fourth Army Region commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya, 
meanwhile, said it was still too early to say for sure that 
there was a link between southern terrorist bandits and the 
terrorists who planned to attack the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok 
last week.

  [Editorial Report] On 19 March two Thai-language Bangkok 
dailies, KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT and SIAM RAT publish editorials on 
the accidental discovery by police on 17 March of a bomb left in 
a truck in front of a Bangkok police station. 
  The 800-word editorial on page 2 of KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT 
entitled "Do Not Launch Terrorist Acts in Thailand" says there 
has been great astonishment about the attempted terrorism, 
believed to be aimed at the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. The 
editorial says: "It took the police six days before knowing what 
was inside the truck -- not until the owner of the truck claimed 
the vehicle. After the search, it was learned that the sabotage 
attempt was planned by professional international terrorists." 
  The editorial takes the police to task for not examining the 
truck immediately after towing it to the police station. It 
also criticizes the National Intelligence Agency for poor 
performance: "It seems that the Special Branch Police knew 
nothing about the international terrorists being here and ready 
to carry out sabotage. The agency should, from now on, try to 
concentrate on its responsibility for national security instead 
of spying on opposition or non-governmental sectors in favor of 
certain politicians." 
  In conclusion, the editorial appeals to international 
terrorists to not use Thailand as a base for their activities. 
It says: "The Thai Government has never treated any of the 
quarreling parties with discrimination. Why do they have to 
involve Thailand by using the country as a base for their 
activities? They should go elsewhere if they want to carry out 
acts to avenge their enemies, but not in Thailand. Should 
anything serious happen, Thailand may have to ban suspicious 
people from entering the country, no matter which side they 
belong to." 
  The 800-word editorial on page 4 of SIAM RAT entitled "Here 
Comes the Real One" says that the government, people, and 
particularly the media must be awakened to the fact that 
international terrorism has arrived in Thailand. After 
reviewing background material on racial and religious conflicts 
worldwide, the editorial notes that as developed countries have 
improved their control and prevention structures, countries like 
Thailand which have inadequate intelligence and 
counter-terrorism apparatuses will be used by international 
terrorists as bases for their activities. 
  "Thailand has been a haven for illegal associations, mafia 
gangs, and terrorist rackets at the international level. 
Regardless if we admit it or not, this is a fact. We have 
always heard about police arrests of international drug 
trafficking rings, international sex trade rackets, 
international gangs forging all kinds of documents, from 
passports to credit cards, and illegal rackets smuggling 
refugees to third countries, especially to the United States. 
There are several such illegal rackets operating in Thailand, 
where police made the arrests," the editorial says. 
  "Real terrorism has begun. We must take heed and stop 
playing games. It is time for us to work together in order to 
improve law and order in our society for the sake of national 
security."

  [Editorial Report] Two Bangkok Chinese-language dailies -- 
ZHONG HUA RIBAO and XING XIAN RIBAO -- on 17 and 18 March carry 
editorials commenting on Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's visit to 
Vietnam. 
  ZHONG HUA RIBAO's 17 March editorial on page 1, entitled 
"the 
Significance of Prime Minister Chuan's Visit to Vietnam," says 
that "Prime Minister Chuan Likphai led a large delegation of 
government and private representatives to Vietnam on 16 March 
for a 4-day official visit. The Prime minister's trip is in 
line with Thailand's foreign policy of promoting relations with 
neighboring countries and is aimed at settling historic 
problems, discussing investment cooperation and development of 
economic relations, and exchanging views on Vietnam's plan to 
join ASEAN." Issues which have to be settled between the two 
nations include their territorial water boundary and the return 
of Vietnamese refugees who still remain in Thailand. Such 
complicated issues can not be tackled with a few words. The 
editorial believes that to further improve their bilateral 
relations, the two countries will have to show their sincerity 
and hold consultations to find ways of settling the problems. 
  The editorial says that after the U.S. decision to remove 
trade sanctions against Vietnam, Vietnam hopes to attract some 
U.S. $120 million to 150 million worth of foreign investment 
during the remaining six years of the century to improve its 
infrastructure and to develop its industry so that it can 
achieve an eight percent economic growth rate. Vietnam can 
achieve its target if it can eliminate the corruption problem 
while developing its economy. "ASEAN countries welcome the U.S. 
decision to lift its sanctions against Vietnam. Thailand can 
serve as a gateway for foreign companies and banks to Vietnam. 
However, we should note that Vietnam has lower labor costs 
while its productivity is high. This can be a threat to 
Thailand's agricultural and textile exports. However, Vietnam's 
participation in the competition can help boost economic growth 
in the Southeast Asian Region. ASEAN will become a big market 
with a combined population of 400 million if Vietnam, Laos, and 
Burma become full members of ASEAN. They can greatly benefit 
regional development. Hence, ASEAN will not only attract world 
attention for its economic strength, but will also increase its 
influence in the international political arena," the editorial 
says. 
  The editorial believes that the six ASEAN countries will not 
reject Vietnam's participation. Conflicts can be removed 
through increasing contacts and promotion of mutual 
understanding. Vietnam will get financial, technical, and 
expertise assistance from ASEAN countries to achieve its 
economic development target. However, it is important for 
Vietnam to nurture trust in it among ASEAN countries. 
  The editorial concludes by saying that "the visit to Vietnam 
by Prime Minister Chuan and his delegation of political and 
military leaders and businessmen is significant for 
strengthening bilateral cooperation, removing conflicts, and 
encouraging the joint development and prosperity of countries in 
Southeast Asia, as well as expanding ASEAN into a bigger 
political and economic grouping." 
  XING XIAN RIBAO's 18 March editorial, on page 2, is 
entitled: 
"Thailand and Vietnam Must Create Mutual Trust on the Basis of 
Mutual Benefit and Sincerity." It says that Thailand and 
Vietnam were formerly suspicious of each other. Hostility 
between the two nations reached its peak when the communists 
took over South Vietnam. Mutual distrust has not yet been 
eliminated, although the Vietnam war is over and the two 
countries have normalized their relations. "Following changes 
in the world situation, the Indochinese countries are trying to 
reconstruct their countries, revive their economies, and attract 
foreign investment. As a result, Vietnam has become a focal 
point for investment." Thailand remains as the 12th biggest 
investor in Vietnam despite its proximity to Vietnam. This 
shows that bilateral cooperation has not achieved enough 
progress. Mutual distrust is one of the reasons. 
  The editorial says that "Prime Minister Chuan should have a 
broad vision. He must realize that Thai-Vietnamese relations 
will be an important point in the development of Indochina. As 
a result, it is necessary for Prime Minister Chuan to show 
sincerity about cooperation so that Vietnam can realize that 
Thailand is willing to be a close element in Indochina's 
development." 
  A big entourage of businessmen is accompanying Prime 
Minister 
Chuan to Vietnam. They can observe Vietnam's economic 
situation. In particular, the investment seminar jointly held by 
Thailand's Board of Investment and Vietnam's State Committee for 
Cooperation and Investment will enable private businessmen of 
the two countries to hold consultations and seek cooperation 
opportunities. 
  In conclusion, the editorial reminds Thai businessmen to be 
sincere and take into account the national interests of both 
countries when investing in Vietnam. They should refrain from 
exploiting Vietnam as foreign countries once exploited Thailand.

<F P=106> [By Wilailak Kiratiphiphatphong in Ho Chi Minh City] </F>
  [Text] Thailand will allow Vietnam-registered companies to 
be listed on the Thai stock exchange, the first foreign firms 
permitted to do so, Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit Suphinit 
said. 
  Mr. Wichit said the policy to allow Vietnamese firms and 
Thai-Vietnamese joint-venture firms to be listed on the Stock 
Exchange of Thailand [SET] is part of assistance from Thailand 
for Vietnam to develop its own stock exchange, set to be 
established next year. 
  The Vietnamese companies seeking listing on the Thai bourse 
must meet SET and Securities and Exchange Commission 
requirements, while the investment size of each company must be 
substantial. 
  He said the policy to open the Thai stock exchange for 
listing of foreign firms is similar to that in Singapore and 
Malaysia. 
  "It is not only our intention to help Vietnam develop its 
own 
stock market, but it is also our plan to make our bourse a 
leader in the region," Mr. Wichit said. 
  The first request for Thailand to help Vietnam develop its 
stock market was made by the Vietnamese Secretary-General of the 
Communist Party during his official visit to Thailand last year, 
the central bank governor said. 
  After that, Vietnamese authorities had sent officials to 
Thailand to hold talks with Thai officials and study the 
development of the Thai exchange. 
  Mr. Wichit said it is likely that joint-venture firms 
between 
Thai and Vietnamese investors would be approved for listing 
first as their investment sizes would be relatively larger than 
those fully owned by Vietnamese. As well, their operation 
systems, particularly their accounting, are in line with SET 
requirements. 
  At the same time, Mr. Wichit said the Bank of Thailand has 
permitted Krung Thai Bank and the Export-Import Bank to extend 
loans through the central bank of Vietnam to support the 
development of the Vietnamese stock market. 
  The loans will be channeled through the Bangkok 
International 
Banking Facilities scheme. The final round of terms and 
conditions for the loans is scheduled for March 22. 
  Meanwhile, Thai ministers in an official delegation visiting 
Vietnam say talks with their Vietnamese counterparts on trade, 
finance and agriculture have produced good prospects for future 
bilateral cooperation as both sides managed to achieve some 
promising results. 
  Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsup told more than 50 
prominent Thai businessmen that he had discussed with Vietnam's 
Agriculture Minister possible cooperation and coordination to 
prevent their becoming competitors in the world rice market, 
which could affect their rice prices and export revenues. 
  Mr. Chaiyot said the Vietnamese minister had agreed to visit 
Bangkok next month for further talks with the Thai private 
sector on possible Thai-Vietnamese cooperation in rice 
production and marketing. 
  Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri, meanwhile, 
said he expected decisions to be made on two joint development 
projects when he leads a delegation to a meeting of finance 
ministers from six Mekong River Basin countries -- Burma, China, 
Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand -- in Hanoi from March 1922. 
  The projects are the construction of two transnational 
roads, 
one from Prachin Buri to Ho Chi Minh City and the other from 
Mukdahan to Danang via Savannakhet in Laos and Hue In Vietnam. 
  Mr. Trairong said the two are among 26 projects involving 
road construction and development of air and water 
transportation links to be sponsored by the Asian Development 
Bank. 
  A joint development project can materialize if at least 
three 
countries agree to work together, he said. 
  On long-running fishery disputes, Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri said Thailand and Vietnam have agreed to set up a joint 
committee to restructure joint fishery systems and manage 
benefits from marine catches. 
  The ministers and the businessmen are accompanying Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai on a four-day official visit to Hanoi 
from March 16-19.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters in Vietnam yesterday about the 
Finance Ministry's plan to give loans to the Indochinese 
countries for infrastructure development, Deputy Finance 
Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri said: 
  [Begin Trairong recording] Our foreign reserves now amount 
to 
over 600 billion baht. Singapore aside, we are the richest 
country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The 
amount exceeds the optimum [preceding word rendered in English] 
point. Under normal circumstances, the foreign reserve is 
maintained at a level just high enough for buying two or three 
months worth of imports. The present amount is sufficient for 
five or six months. This concerns us, because the money is just 
doing nothing at the national bank. For this reason, we want 
our business people to use this money to invest in other 
countries so that we can earn interest. We encourage our people 
to invest in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Wichit Suphinit, governor of the Bank of 
Thailand, 
said that Thailand's foreign reserves are excessively high and 
enough to cover as much as seven months worth of imports. The 
Bank of Thailand will use the money to provide loans to its 
neighboring countries in line with the Finance Ministry policy.

  [Text] Vice Admiral Manat Pinkunlabut, commander of the 
Chanthaburi-Trat Border Defense Task Force, disclosed that the 
Cambodian Government's troops last night launched offensive 
operations against the Khmer Rouge in Pailin. 
  As a result, over 1,000 Thai nationals and over 15,000 
Cambodians in Pailin and nearby areas fled into Thailand today 
through the villages of Phakkat and Khlong Yai in Pong Nam Ron 
District of Chanthaburi Province. More people are expected to 
cross the border. 
  He said that since the task force was unable to push such a 
huge number of refugees back into Cambodia, the Chanthaburi 
Marine Task Force has been instructed to separate the fleeing 
Thai nationals from the Cambodian refugees, who are now being 
detained at Phakkat pending repatriation after the situation 
returns to normal.

  [Text] Sydney, March 19 (AFP) -- Greek religious leaders 
held a special mass here Saturday after their orthodox church 
was set on fire amid ethnic tensions between Greek and 
Macedonian communities. 
  Firefighters were called late Friday to St Efimia's Greek 
Orthodox Church in the western Sydney suburb of Bankstown, 
within Prime Minister Paul Keating's constituency. 
  The front double doors were ablaze and police said a 
four-litre can which might have contained fuel was discovered 
outside. A police spokesman said it was too early to say 
whether it was linked to the Greek-Macedonian tensions. 
  Earlier this month, a Greek community centre and the offices 
of a state MP, Alex Andrianopoulos, were firebombed in Melbourne 
following Australia's recognition of the former Yugoslav 
republic of Macedonia on February 15. 
  Greece insists that the use of the term, "Macedonia", 
applies 
only to a northern Greek province of the same name and has 
accused authorities in the former Yugoslav republic of 
harbouring territorial designs on Greek territory. 
  Macedonians have also complained that the Australian 
government caved in to Greek lobbying when it decided on Monday 
to refer to them officially as Slav Macedonians. 
  There are about 700,000 Greek Australians--a large majority 
of whom live in Melbourne--with about 25,000 of them having 
roots in Macedonia.

  [Text] French and New Zealand marines have held their first 
ever joint naval exercise south of New Caledonia. 
  The exercise, code-named "Passex", involved two of New 
Zealand's four frigates as well as the French patrol-boat "La 
Moqueuse" and the frigate "Nivoise". 
  The New Zealand navy has said that the "Rainbow Warrior" 
affair, in which the French secret services sank a Greenpeace 
ship in 1985, has been "over for a long time now."

  [Text] Honaira, March 18 (AFP) -- Solomon Islands Tourism 
and Culture Minister Michael Maina has been charged with 28 
counts of misconduct in office, the Leadership Code Commission 
said Friday in a statement. 
  He is the first cabinet minister to face such charges, 
although a member of parliament has in the past. 
  It said he faces three counts of accepting bribes, six of 
using his office for personal benefit, two counts of failing to 
disclose personal interests when participating in meetings, 14 
counts of failing to declare his business interests to the 
commission and three of accepting benefits. 
  The charges were laid after the commission carried out a 
lengthy investigation into Maina's conduct when he was commerce, 
employment and trade minister under former Prime Minister 
Solomon Mamaloni. 
  The commission said its investigations showed prima facie 
evidence to lay the charges. 
  They have been submitted to the office of the Director of 
Public Prosecutions to commence proceedings in the High Court. 
  The statement said Maina's conduct was regrettable because 
it 
was damaging to himself and the government. It demeaned his 
office and allowed his integrity to be called into question. 
  It also endangered the respect and confidence in the 
integrity of the government which is contrary to the country's 
national constitution. 
  Maina, from the Temopu Province in the Eastern Solomons, was 
widely known to have a number of company directorships here.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa confirmed Monday [21 March] that he had told Chinese 
Premier Li Peng that "it is not sensible for Western countries 
to impose their own values of democracy upon other countries." 
  Hosokawa, talking with reporters on a flight back from 
China, 
said he only spoke generally about Japan's position. He denied 
any intention of criticizing the United States which links 
improvement of China's human rights record with the renewal in 
June of its most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status. 
  Japanese officials, briefing reporters about talks between 
the Japanese and Chinese leaders at a banquet in Beijing on 
Saturday, said Hosokawa urged China to improve its human rights 
record. The officials quoted Hosokawa as saying that the 
international community recognizes human rights as a universal 
value. 
  But China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin offered a 
different version of Hosokawa's comment, saying the Japanese 
leader "expressed his view that it is not sensible for Western 
countries to impose their own values of democracy upon other 
countries." 
  "He also pointed out that various countries in the world 
should make joint efforts to realize the principles and spirit 
enshrined in the Declaration (on Human Rights)," Wu quoted 
Hosokawa as saying.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 19 KYODO -- Japan and the European 
Union (EU) agreed on a 0.4% rise in Japanese car exports 
to the 
EU in 1994 from the previous year, Japanese officials said 
Saturday. 
  Japanese and European Commission trade officials set the 
level of Japanese auto exports to the trading bloc in 1994 at 
984,000 vehicles, up slightly from 980,000 for 1993, the 
officials said. The negotiations were based on a 1991 accord 
between the two sides to monitor Japanese car exports to the EU 
until the end of 1999, after which all EU restrictions on car 
imports will be lifted. 
  In the talks in late February, the European Commission 
forecast no growth in European demand for cars this year, while 
Japan is looking for a slight increase. 
  The levels set for 1993 had to be renegotiated in September 
after demand in the EU markets sank more than expected. The 
1993 target represents a drop of 18.5 0.000000rom the previous year.

  [Text] New York, March 16 KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to 
the United Nations Yoshio Hatano stressed anew Wednesday [16 
March] that Japan is prepared to become a permanent member of 
the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). During a closed 
door session of the UN working group on the reform of the 
Security Council, Hatano said he is taking "this opportunity to 
emphasize once again Japan's firm determination in this regard." 
  Japanese diplomatic sources said Japan expects to have veto 
power as a permanent security council member, although Hatano 
did not elaborate on the veto issue during the meeting. 
  Hatano also proposed an increase in the number of 
nonpermanent members of the Security Council from the current 
10. The five permanent members are Britain, China, France, 
Russia and the United States. 
  Britain has joined the United States in expressing support 
for permanent UN Security Council seats for Japan and Germany.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said Saturday [19 March] he is not 
contemplating general elections under the old electoral system 
for the powerful House of Representatives. 
  In a meeting with Japanese reporters traveling with him on 
his China trip, Hosokawa said he is not thinking of calling 
general elections until a new electoral system formally replaces 
the old electoral system under which the 511 members have been 
elected. The new system calls for electing 300 members via 
single-seat constituencies and 200 via proportional 
representation. 
  Hosokawa also said he has no plans to release further data 
or 
summon witnesses before a parliamentary session in connection 
with a 100 million yen loan from the now defunct Tokyo Sagawa 
Kyubin.

  [Text] Kanazawa, March 19 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe proposed Saturday [19 March] that Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa clear himself of allegations in a money 
scandal or dissolve the House of Representatives to hold general 
elections. "(The prime minister) should clear up the 
allegations and at the same time he should seek cooperation from 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on policies," 
Watanabe said. 
  If Hosokawa does not want to do so, he should dissolve the 
lower house and call for general elections, Watanabe added. 
  Watanabe, who was both deputy premier and foreign minister 
under the cabinet of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa from 
1991 to 1993, made the comments in Kanazawa while stumping for 
an LDP candidate in the Ishikawa gubernatorial race. 
  The lower house budget committee has been unable to begin 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget program for more than a 
week because of the controversy over Hosokawa's receipt of 100 
million yen from now-defunct Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a 
scandal-ridden parcel delivery trucking company and part of the 
Sagawa Kyubin group. The LDP has refused to agree to budget 
debate unless Hosokawa produces additional documents concerning 
the scandal. 
  Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the money from Tokyo 
Sagawa 
Kyubin in 1982 to repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and to 
buy a condominium in Tokyo. He said he fully repaid the money 
by January 31, 1991, using part of his retirement allowance as 
Kumamoto governor. 
  Hosokawa served two four-year terms as governor from 1983 
until February 1991. The LDP and other critics suspect that 
Hosokawa received the 100 million yen from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin 
to help finance his gubernatorial election campaign.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 19 KYODO -- The head of the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP), one of the seven parties in the ruling 
coalition, voiced reluctance Saturday [19 March] to a proposed 
establishment of a joint parliamentary group among the seven. 
  DSP leader Keigo Ouchi, speaking to reporters at a news 
conference in the central Japan city of Tsu near Nagoya, said 
the proposal "needs careful study." He said, "The foundation of 
the Hosokawa cabinet may see a major crack if it is pushed ahead 
in a hasty manner." 
  Ouchi, who is the health and welfare minister in the cabinet 
of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said, "Nothing has been 
decided as far as the DSP is concerned." 
  Ouchi's remark differs from the party's No. 2 man, Takashi 
Yonezawa, who met Thursday with coalition strategist Ichiro 
Ozawa, secretary general of the key coalition party Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] and agreed to promote efforts toward the 
establishment of a new party in preparation for a next general 
election for the House of Representatives. 
  Under the political reform package enacted in late January, 
the next general election is almost certain to pick 300 lower 
house members in single-seat constituencies plus 200 seats 
chosen through proportional representation. There are 
differences of opinion among the seven parties on how to cope 
with the single-seat districts in rivalry to the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) and Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal 
Party) headed by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata have pushed ahead 
with a plan to unite the seven coalition parties as part of 
efforts to prepare for the next general election. 
  However, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the biggest 
group 
in the coalition, and new party Sakigake [Harbinger] led by 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura have indicated 
opposition to the idea. 
  Earlier this month, Hosokawa said the coalition would be at 
a 
disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcame 
internal rivalry and agreed to file a joint candidate in each of 
the single-seat constituencies. 
  It is not known when the next general election will be 
called. The four-year term of the incumbent lower house is to 
last through July 1997. But many politicians say there will be 
a snap general election before that time because of the major 
change in the election system under the political reform package.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hata is now on a visit to Moscow. 
Speaking to reporters accompanying him today, he reiterated that 
it was necessary to form a completely new party through 
unification of the ruling to establish a two-party system under 
which changes of power become possible. 
  Foreign Minister Hata said: There are moves toward forming a 
new party or political alliance in the Diet. But while seeking 
appropriate ways to deal with elections to be held under the new 
electoral system, it is necessary to form a new political group 
to compete with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. 
  His comments indicate he believes it is necessary to unify 
the ruling parties to establish a two-party system. 
  He was asked what he thought of the view, held by members of 
different parties within the government, that Prime Minister 
Hosokawa should lead any such new party. 
  He said: I have no objection to this idea because the prime 
minister is in charge of the government now. 
  As the deadlock in Diet interpellations is becoming 
prolonged, support is growing for the possibility of dissolving. 
Commenting on this, Hata said: Our task is to establish a 
political system which reflects people's opinions through the 
new electoral system. We are not in the position of needing to 
dissolve the Diet in the face of a host of domestic and foreign 
relations problems. 
  His comment showed he did not want the Diet dissolved under 
the current electoral system.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 19 KYODO -- The continued stalemate in 
the Diet may delay implementation of planned tax reductions and 
further prolong Japan's recession, government officials said 
Saturday [19 March]. 
  The government plans a total of 5.85 trillion yen worth of 
cuts in income, residential and other taxes this year as 
envisaged by the latest economic stimulative package unveiled in 
early February. 
  For such reductions to be implemented on schedule as 
originally planned, the Diet would need to pass the bills by the 
end of March, according to the officials. 
  Chances are increasing, however, that some of those bills 
cannot become law on time due to a boycott of Diet business by 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  The LDP has refused to start deliberations on the fiscal 
1994 
budget, already two months behind schedule, over its demand that 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa clear up questions surrounding 
a 100 million yen loan he received from scandal-ridden trucking 
firm Sagawa Kyubin. 
  The LDP also maintains that the tax cuts are an important 
matter that cannot be discussed in haste. Some LDP members also 
oppose a government plan to limit the tax plan to one year. 
  The LDP stance is causing worries at the Finance Ministry. 
  Ministry officials said it takes at least two months before 
tax plans are put into practice after Diet approval because of 
the need to publicize them to companies and work out procedural 
matters. 
  If passage of the bills is delayed to mid-April, they said, 
income tax returns may not come in time for employees at 
companies which pay summer bonuses in early June.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- An influential business 
leader criticized Friday [18 March] a delay in Diet 
deliberations of the 1994 fiscal budget due to a debt problem 
involving Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), told a news conference it is 
strange that the Diet proceeding has been held up because of an 
affair that took place 10 years ago. 
  He referred to an opposition demand that Hosokawa submit a 
detailed report on 100 million yen which he said was borrowed 
from Sagawa Kyubin trucking company. 
  Hayami's remark reflected worries in the business community 
that the stalled debate on the budget proposal may affect the 
domestic economy, which has shown signs of recovery.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- A Japanese business leader 
Thursday [17 March] called for income tax reduction as a 
permanent measure based on "correction of the imbalance between 
direct and indirect taxation." 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, made the remark at an annual general meeting of the 
chamber attended by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Referring to the current economic situation, Inaba said 
there 
is a slight sign of recovery in Japanese corporate sentiment 
concerning the prolonged economic slowdown. 
  On strained trade relations between Japan and the United 
States, Inaba said, "we are in a severe situation." 
  Japan should present some concrete measures to the U.S. to 
improve the bilateral trade in place of the numerical targets 
which Washington has been demanding, he said. 
  But the prime minister was right to disagree with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton at their February summit in Washington on 
setting such objective criteria as part of the economic 
framework talks between the two nations, Inaba said. 
  In a speech at the meeting, Hosokawa said, "The three 
working 
groups of the headquarters promoting administrative reform are 
expected to come up with effective measures. A bill is also 
going to be presented to the Diet to set up an independent body 
equipped with strong surveillance." 
  He added that he hoped these combined efforts would also 
bring about positive results for the relationship between Japan 
and the United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry said 
Thursday [17 March] it will raise the base interest rate on 
loans from its fund management bureau to government institutions 
by 0.65 percentage point to 4.30 percent per annum. 
  Following the move, the government-backed Housing Loan Corp. 
is expected to raise its base housing loan rate from the record 
low 3.6 percent per annum to around 4.0 percent, probably 
effective late April. 
  The Fund Management Bureau, which invests public funds from 
postal savings and other sources, offers the loans to the 
Housing Loan Corp., Japan Road Corp. and other government-backed 
organizations. 
  The base housing loan rate applies to loans for houses with 
a 
floor space of up to 125 square meters.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 20 KYODO -- A growing number of 
Japanese disheartened by the stubborn recession and last year's 
rice harvest shortfall are pessimistic about the future of 
Japan, a survey released Sunday [20 March] by the Prime 
Minister's Office said. 
  The 45.4 percent of the survey respondents who are uneasy 
about the future of Japan is the highest ever recorded in the 24 
years of the survey and the percentage of those still optimistic 
about Japan stood at 29.6 percent, slipping below the 30 percent 
mark for only the third time. 
  The only other times the belief Japan is "heading in a good 
direction" dipped below 30 percent was in the 1974 survey and 
again in 1982. 
  The poll, conducted last December, surveyed 10,000 Japanese 
men and women aged 20 or older, with a response rate of about 71 
percent. 
  The number of people thinking "Japan is headed in a bad 
direction" has shown an increase each year since 1989 with 49 
percent of the pessimists saying they were concerned about 
employment and labor conditions and another 33 percent worried 
about food stores. 
  The decrease in the number of people optimistic about Japan 
reflected a slide in the respondents who believe in Japan's 
economic power, about 24 percent, and the nation's food 
supplies, about 10 percent. Both figures are the lowest ever 
recorded. 
  Following last year's unprecedented high of 70 percent of 
the 
respondents saying the government did not reflect the will of 
the people, this year's figure decreased to around 62 percent. 
  This year's survey indicates an increase of 7 percentage 
points to 30 percent in the number of people thinking that 
government reflects the will of the people. 
  For the first time since 1984, the survey also asked about 
the government's dialogue with citizens regarding social affairs 
and political matters with 65 percent of the respondents saying 
the government should talk with the people. 
  Asked about social conditions in Japan, 73 percent of the 
respondents agreed that Japan has peace but only 24 percent said 
things are stable, a decrease of 3 percentage points. 
  Only 9 percent said they are living comfortably, another 
decrease of 3 percentage points, while 12 percent said they did 
not feel any vitality in their lives -- about double the number 
of the year before.

  The additional 400,000 tons will consist of medium- and 
short- grain rice produced in Australia, the United States and 
China, officials of the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Imported rice may be used 
for school lunches for primary and junior-high school children 
because of a shortage of domestic rice, Japan's farm minister 
said Thursday [17 March]. 
  Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and 
fisheries, 
said that though the policy of the ministry's Food Agency is to 
use only Japanese rice for school meals, schools will be 
supplied with foreign rice if the principals agree to it. 
  He made the remark to the committee on agriculture, forestry 
an fisheries of the House of Councillors. 
  The Food Agency has announced that only domestic rice should 
be used for school meals, but some educators have proposed that 
use of imported rice would be of educational as well as 
nutritional value to school children by giving them a direct 
experience related to the current rice controversy.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Despite the recent fuss 
over a rice shortage, data shows that the trend among the 
Japanese is to consume less rice than before, the Food Agency 
said Friday [18 March]. 
  According to the agency, rice consumption in the October- 
December period in 1993 fell 0.9 percent from the same period 
the previous year to 5,458 grams per person in an ordinary 
household. 
  Households involved in rice growing were excluded. 
  In the preceding July-September period, consumption rose 0.4 
percent, going to the plus side for the first time in eight 
years. 
  "The return to the minus side is evidence that rice 
consumption is on the decline," an official at the Food Agency 
said. 
  Rice eaten at home fell 1.9 percent to 4,391 grams per 
person, while rice consumed outside of the home grew 3.3 percent 
to 1,068 grams.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 20 KYODO -- The Food Agency plans to 
pay incentives to farmers to facilitate the gathering of early 
rice which will be in season from around late July, agency 
officials said Sunday [20 March]. 
  The agency plans the move to prevent domestically produced 
rice from flowing to dealers on unauthorized markets to secure a 
smooth rice supply until the 1994 rice crop appears on the 
market full scale, the officials said. 
  The agency has decided to supply 100,000 tons of early rice 
by the end of October. 
  The amount of incentives has yet to be decided, they said. 
The agency plans to pay the incentives out of a 50 billion yen 
budget in fiscal 1993 for balanced rice supply-demand for the 
three coming years. 
  On the other hand, the National Federation of Agricultural 
Cooperative Associations is also considering paying about 15,000 
yen per 60 kilograms of rice to farmers in advance to facilitate 
collection of rice for unauthorized markets. 
  On the recent rice shortage due to last year's poor domestic 
crop, Farm Minister Eijiro Hata said Sunday [20 March] the rice 
supply will be sufficient, denying a future shortage. 
  Hata said in a lecture in Omiya, Saitama Prefecture, that 
20,000 to 40,000 tons of imported rice are being unloaded daily 
at Japanese ports against Japan's rice consumption of 500,000 
tons a month. 
  If half of the consumption is supplied by imports, a daily 
import of 10,000 tons of rice is sufficient for supply, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- A government panel 
Thursday [17 March] started studying the government guaranteed 
prices for milk as material of dairy products and minimum 
producers' prices of beef and pork for fiscal 1994, starting 
April 1, Farm Ministry officials said. 
  The Livestock Industry Promotion Council, an advisory panel 
for the farm minister, is also expected to feed supply plans for 
the year. 
  The panel will study the problems at sections specializing 
in 
each field, and is expected to compile recommendations by the 
end of the month, the officials added. 
  As for the government-guaranteed price of milk for 
processing, now at 76.75 yen per kilogram, the Agricultural, 
Forestry and Fisheries Ministry says it can be cut, noting 
production costs have been falling in real terms. 
  But producers' organizations demand an increase, asserting 
that a further reduction will force farmers to change jobs. 
  In fiscal 1993, strong opposition from the Liberal 
Democratic 
Party, then ruling party, helped the price remain unchanged from 
the preceding year, despite the ministry's intention to lower it. 
  Japan decides minimum prices of milk for processing and such 
meat as beef and pork every year. When those prices fall on the 
market, the government buys up those products to prevent further 
declines.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 19 KYODO -- Labor and management at 
Japan's major steelmakers agreed Saturday [19 March] night to a 
1.56 percent, or 4,500 yen, rise in monthly wages for the new 
business year starting in April, industry sources said. 
  The hike is the lowest since a 1.55 percent increase 
implemented in 1987, when the Japanese economy was hit by a 
recession induced by a strong yen. 
  Major electric machinery makers also decided on a 3.1 
percent 
wage increase, down 0.5 percentage point from the previous year 
and their lowest ever. 
  The sources said management at the firms originally tried to 
curb fiscal 1994 wage hikes as much as possible but finally 
became more concessionary. 
  They said steelmakers softened their stance because of 
planned large-scale restructuring involving labor cuts. Nippon 
Steel Corp., Japan's top steelmaker, for instance, plans a cut 
of 7,000 employees. 
  Managers of electric machinery firms, meanwhile, have taken 
into account a firm business showing in recent months, 
especially for microchips and heavy electric machinery, the 
sources said. 
  Unions with electric machinery firms and steelmakers both 
belong to the Japan Council of Metal Workers' Unions. The car, 
shipbuilding and heavy electric machinery industries, also 
council members, are still in the middle of negotiations on the 
monthly wage hikes. 
  Shipbuilding and heavy electric machinery firms originally 
demanded a 3.41 percent, or 10,000 yen, rise in the monthly 
wages, citing a relatively healthy performance of the industry, 
but management has maintained that a high wage increase would 
undermine the industry's international competitiveness.

  [Text] The Commission for External Relations of the 
Vietnamese Communist Party Central Committee has announced that 
party leader Do Muoi will soon visit Malaysia. This is the 
first visit to Malaysia by the Vietnamese highest leader. 
Following is our radio opinion on the visit and relations 
between Vietnam and Malaysia. 
  Last year, Party Leader Do Muoi visited Singapore and 
Thailand. This year, he is preparing to visit Malaysia. 
Vietnamese State President Le Duc Anh will visit Indonesia 
early next month. 
  In the last two years, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited 
most countries in the region. Vietnam does respect its 
relations with other regional countries, especially with the 
ASEAN member countries. Furthermore, all countries in Southeast 
Asia have acknowledged the cooperation for mutual benefit with 
Vietnam. The British Broadcasting Corporation radio on March 17 
quoted Mr. Chew Tai Soo, the Singaporean ambassador to the 
United Nations, as saying that Vietnam was on the threshold of 
ASEAN. Vietnam should join ASEAN and the visit to Malaysia by 
party leader Do Muoi will contribute to promoting this process. 
  The visit will also strengthen relations between Vietnam and 
Malaysia, which have achieved progress after the visit to 
Malaysia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in 1992. Two-way trade 
turnover has reached $100 million. Malaysia has invested in 16 
projects in Vietnam worth $95 million. Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamed himself has a deep sentiment towards Vietnam 
and respects bilateral relations between Vietnam and Malaysia. 
  The visit to Malaysia by our party leader will contribute to 
implementing the desire of leaders and peoples of the two 
countries to consolidate and develop friendship and cooperation.

<F P=106> [From the "Talk of The Week" feature] </F>
  [Text] Recently a number of Vietnamese living in exile in 
foreign countries have tried to distort and slander the 
situation concerning Buddhism in Vietnam. They have made use of 
the public disorder in the old imperial city of Hue to arouse 
hostile forces in foreign countries to act against the 
Vietnamese state. Under the label of protecting human rights, 
they have claimed that the Vietnamese state does not respect the 
freedom of belief, suppressing religions, and intervening in the 
internal affairs of Buddhism. They have sent petitions to and 
[word indistinct] talks to the World Conference on Human Rights 
held in Vienna, Austria; sent petitions to governments of some 
countries during the visits to these countries by Vietnamese 
state leaders to protest and cause political pressure. 
  They have distributed many documents and literature with 
reactionary contents, slandering reality. Culprits of the 
public disorder occurred on 25 April 1993 in Hue city were put 
to public trial on 15 November 1993 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, 
meeting the people's requirements. The results of the trial 
were supported by people. Many Buddhist superiors, bonzes and 
nuns, and Catholic priests have maintained that the Hue public 
disorder not only caused economic losses, but also caused bad 
impression in and outside the country. However, the Vietnamese 
state has given them leniency. The culprits themselves also saw 
their guiltiness. 
  Meanwhile, those people living in exile have distorted and 
made a ballyhoo that the Vietnamese state accused the innocent 
people. Of these people, Nguyen Xuan Chau, head of the Van Hanh 
Monastery in Australia, is the most madly (?violent). So what 
kind of people Nguyen Xuan Chau is? [sentence as heard] And 
what are his purposes? 
  Nguyen Xuan Chau, whose Buddhist name is Thich Quang Ba, was 
born 15 April 1949 in Nhon An Commune, An Nhon District, Binh 
Dinh Province in southern Vietnam. In 1962 he entered monkhood 
at Hong Long Pagoda, Nhon An Commune. Passing through Buddhism 
classes, in 1973 he entered the Nha Trang College of Buddhism, 
and in 1976 he graduated from that college. In 1976 he was 
[words indistinct] the reactionary plot, making use of Buddhism 
in the Vietnam Buddhist Church, formerly Vietnamese Unified 
Buddhism, to contact and transfer reactionary documents and 
literature from the Vietnam Buddhist Church to Nghia Binh [Now 
Binh Dinh] Province. By disseminating these documents and 
literature, they aroused opposition and non-cooperation with the 
revolutionary administration, slandering the state policy and 
the political system, gathering a number of young men who dodged 
military service to Phu Bon area in the central highland 
Province of Gia Lai-Kontum to carry out illegal activities. 
  In 1983, he fled the country to Malaysia, then to Australia. 
Now he is in Van Hanh Monastery in Australia. What is his 
(?opinion) concerning the above mentioned accusation? What are 
his current acts of sabotage in foreign countries? And what are 
the purposes of these acts? We will deal with these issues next 
Friday during our "Talk of the Week."

  [Text] Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held a working session on 
the morning of 20 March with officials from the Ministry of 
Energy and the management committee of the 500-kilovolt [kv] 
north-south powerline to discuss the tasks remaining before the 
powerline can start operation at the end of April or in early 
May. 
  Attending the meeting were the comrade ministers and deputy 
ministers of science, technology, and environment; finance; and 
construction as well as representatives of the National Defense 
Ministry. 
  By 20 March, units working on the 500-kv powerline had 
completed the construction of 3,436 bases and pylons and put up 
a total of 1,487 km of electrical and anti-rust wire. All of 
the transformer and switching stations are up to 90 percent of 
their capacity. 
  Comrade Energy Minister Thai Phung Ne assured Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet that all construction work on the project will be 
completed by 30 March, and operations will begin on an 
experimental basis on 10 April. 
  The prime minister expressed his concern regarding measures 
to deal with the remaining work at the last transformer station 
in Phu Lam. He ordered the Ministry of Energy to concentrate on 
completing the remaining work to ensure the timely operation and 
technological requirements of the project. The prime minister 
said that because the planned deadline to complete the project 
has not yet expired, we need to work with a sense of urgency, 
but not in haste or on the precondition that the project must be 
officially commissioned on a national holiday. Rushing could 
produce regrettable results. 
  The prime minister reminded the Ministry of Energy that 
while 
attempting to complete the project, we must also prepare for the 
production phase, especially the task of training cadres, 
technical staff, and workers. We also have to study the 
experiences of foreign specialists in management and operation.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] held 
a special meeting of its Board of Governors at 1900 Korean time 
[1000 GMT 21 March] this evening, and concluded that North 
Korea's noncompliance with the nuclear accord is very serious 
[maeu simgakhada]. The IAEA adopted a resolution calling on the 
UN Security Council to work out means for applying sanctions 
against North Korea. 
  Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: 
  [Begin Cha recording] This is the second resolution 
referring 
the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, 
following one in April last year. The resolution calls for 
working out measures for applying sanctions regarding the North 
Korean nuclear issue, which is still pending in the UN Security 
Council. 
  The key point in the resolution adopted at today's special 
meeting of the Board of Governors on North Korea clearly 
expressed the restricted position [hangyejogin ipchang] of the 
IAEA that it cannot verify North Korea's diversion of nuclear 
materials and stressed it is urgent that the Security Council 
work out countermeasures. This resolution, however, keeps the 
door open for dialogue by urging North Korea to allow additional 
full-scale inspections. 
  The report on the results of the inspection submitted to the 
Board of Governors special meeting before the resolution was 
adopted revealed that the inspection team inspected nuclear fuel 
rods which were (?used) in the five-megawatt nuclear reactor. 
Thus, experts observed that North Korea might have replaced some 
nuclear fuel rods in the nuclear reactor during the past one 
year. 
  In addition, the report listed in detail the six 
radiochemical laboratory facilities that North Korea refused to 
allow inspections, thus leading to the conclusion that internal 
construction work in the reprocessing facility had advanced more 
than the already-known 40 percent. 
  The report also pointed out that the continuity of the 
recent 
inspection can be maintained only if another inspection of the 
nuclear reactor is conducted within one month and 15 days. Thus, 
the period of one month and 15 days will be the time limit for 
the Security Council to discuss practical sanctions against 
North Korea. [end recording]

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korean businesses' 
plans for economic cooperation with the North were frustrated by 
the rupture of inter-Korean contacts on Saturday, sources said 
Monday. 
  The business community, after closely watching the 
inter-Korean contacts on exchanging special envoys in the 
expectation that they might pave the way for cross-border 
establishment of economic offices or trade representatives, was 
deeply disappointed at the rupture. 
  Large enterprises including Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo and 
Sunkyung as well as many small- and medium-sized businesses have 
already formed task forces to prepare for economic links with 
Pyongyang and have worked for more than a year to realize 
actural cooperation including joint investment in the North. 
  However, their efforts are unlikely to bear fruit for now 
after northern delegates unexpectedly walked out of the 
inter-Korean contact and in light of the South's quick shift to 
a hard-line policy. 
  One source said, "the large enterprises are expected to 
continue their processing-on-commission trade with the North for 
the time being through third countries, including China and Hong 
Kong." 
  Processing-on-commission trade involves South Korean 
businesses providing raw materials or half-finished goods to the 
North and later importing finished goods through third 
countries. But even this kind of trade may decrease with the 
deterioration of inter-Korean relations, the sources expected.

  [Text] The Japanese Government firmed up its policy on 16 
March to launch effective measures to ease "those regulations 
that do not exist in other industrialized countries." The 
government did this to promote market liberalization through 
deregulation plans which should be drawn up by the end of March. 
Specifically, the government wants to ease regulations which 
are stricter than those of other Group of Seven (G-7) member 
nations to the level of the G-7 by introducing a "ceiling 
method" to make uniform reductions, at a time when budget drafts 
are being compiled. To accomplish this, the government will 
study the possibility of easing safety regulations, which are 
considered a sacred area, and review various inspections -- 
including quality inspections on foreign cars and electric 
appliances, customs safety inspections on imported food and 
cosmetics, standards for construction work, and building codes 
for the floor space of buildings in relation to the size of the 
lots on which they stand. The government plans to specify the 
measures in the second stage of market liberalization to be 
announced in late June. 
  The "ceiling method" will be introduced to break the 
deadlocked current situation in which deregulation is not being 
promoted due to resistance from ministries and agencies which 
have the right to issue licenses and permits. 
  First, all regulations will be divided into government 
regulations, public and nonprofit foundations' regulations, and 
private sector regulations. Then they will be further 
classified into regulations which do not exist in other 
developed countries but only in Japan, regulations which exist 
in the United States and the European Union, and regulations 
which exist in all other developed countries. After that, all 
ministries and agencies will be asked to ease those regulations 
which are peculiar only to Japan and over which they were 
originally given the right to issue licenses and permits. 
Fundamentally, the government plans to take measures designed 
to ease the regulations which exist only in Japan to the level 
of regulations in Europe and the United States, or otherwise 
remove them completely. 
  The government will review its regulations in different ways 
depending on their importance and the intensity of demands from 
Europe and the United States. However, the reviews will be made 
from the following viewpoints: 1) regulations, which exist only 
in Japan, will be removed or otherwise the government will 
clarify their contents if it is impossible to remove them; 2) 
the government will try to match the building codes and 
standards with those of other countries; and 3) data of 
inspections made in other countries will be used in lieu of 
customs inspections conducted by Japan when foreign goods are 
imported. 
  In the case of European cars imported to Japan, for example, 
inspections during the manufacturing process and inspections 
upon completion are needed because the European Union requires 
inspections during the manufacturing stage, and Japan requires 
inspections on completed cars. Japan will now remove its 
mandatory requirements for inspections on completed cars. 
Moreover, Japan will accept North American construction 
material standards without any change in an attempt to expand 
imports of construction materials produced on the basis of North 
American standards. 
  Japan restricts construction of special structure 
two-storied 
homes, saying the Building Standards Act is "not pertinent for 
such technical inspections." However, the government will study 
the possibility of easing or abolishing the regulations to make 
its systems match the current situations in Europe and the 
United States. Because of this, the government expects that 
housing constructions will gather momentum.

  [Text] At a news conference following a cabinet meeting 
held on the morning of 18 March, Hiroshi Kumagai, international 
trade and industry minister, commented on U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor's request to the Japanese 
Government to guarantee the realization of Japanese automakers' 
voluntary plans to import foreign-made auto parts and said: 
"The government is not in the position of being able to 
guarantee anything concerning private companies' business 
activities. We cannot accept it." He then pointed out: 
"Independent efforts by the private companies are necessary. 
Even if we decide not to accept it, the United States will 
accept our decision in its own way." As for the fact that 
Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, criticized the stand of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], which demands that 
private industry draw up independent plans, the minister of 
international trade and industry said, "The government is not 
in the position of giving compulsory guidance to private 
industry."

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 19 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Cuban 
Foreign Minister Alberto Robaina Gonzales said Saturday his 
country agreed to become a member of the South Investment, Trade 
and Technology Data Exchange Centre (SITTDEC). 
  His government decided to join SITTDEC a few months ago 
after 
following SITTDEC's development since its inception about two 
years ago. 
  We were briefed about SITTDEC and its development today and 
I 
think that Cuba will benefit if it joins, he told reporters 
through an interpreter after visiting the SITTDEC office at the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry here. 
  SITTDEC, an agency of the group of 15 developing countries 
(G-15), set up through Malaysia's initiative, was adopted at the 
grouping's second summit in Caracas, Venezuela, in November 1991. 
  SITTDEC would help relay business information to member 
countries to reduce economic dependence on the developed 
countries. 
  Gonzales, who is leading a seven-member delegation, was 
earlier briefed by SITTDEC executive director Mohamed Salleh 
Masduki. 
  Cuba would be the 15th country to join SITTDEC. 
  Gonzales and his delegation arrived Saturday for a three-day 
official visit. 
  Meanwhile, Mohamed Salleh said Indonesia, India, Argentina, 
Chile, Jamaica, Senegal, Zimbabwe and Algeria were among 
countries that had joined SITTDEC.

  [Text] The eighth contact of working-level delegates for 
the exchange of North-South top-level special envoys took place 
today in the South side's area of Panmunjom amid great 
expectations and the attention of people at home and abroad. 
  The head of our side's delegation delivered the following 
keynote speech at the contact: 
  Almost 10 months have passed since our side proposed the 
North-South exchange of top-level special envoys last year, a 
significant event in national history, out of a patriotic 
position to achieve the cause of the country's reunification, 
the nation's greatest earnest desire, at an early date. The 
contact of the two sides' working-level delegates for the 
exchange of special envoys, which started here in Panmunjom amid 
the attention of people at home and abroad, has taken place on 
as many as eight occasions. 
  I would be correct to say that the entire course of the long 
discussions and contacts of working-level delegates of the two 
sides was a course in which one can distinguish between unity 
and confrontation, between national independence and dependence 
on outside forces, and between patriotism and treachery, which 
are incompatible with each other. 
  As all facts show clearly, our side, as the side which 
proposed the exchange of special envoys, has made every sincere 
effort to ensure that special envoys be exchanged satisfactorily 
in a favorable atmosphere. 
  Despite our sincere efforts and bold and magnanimous 
attitudes, no decisive phase could open to comply with the 
fellow countrymen's earnest desire and the expectations of 
people at home and abroad. And, rather, it is now difficult to 
predict prospects for the exchange of special envoys. We cannot 
help but express deep regret over this. 
  The contact for the exchange of special envoys, which 
started 
and has proceeded along arduous courses with differing views, 
has not been able to reap fruits and faces a grave obstacle 
today. This is totally caused by the South side's attitude 
toward this contact of working-level delegates and the exchange 
of special envoys. 
  The South opposed the exchange of special envoys from the 
very beginning. Even when, pressed by the public opinion at 
home and abroad, it attended the working-level delegates 
contacts, it pretended to be interested in the exchange of 
special envoys and made every effort in and out of the room of 
the talks to prevent progress in the contacts for the exchange 
of special envoys. This antidialogue act by the South side has 
indefinitely delayed the exchange of special envoys, which could 
have taken place in one or two rounds of contacts. 
  These days when, even amid twists and turns, step by step 
progress has been made at the contacts of working-level 
delegates, thanks to our side's magnanimity and sincerity, the 
South side has more openly committed acts to block the exchange 
of special envoys, instead of feeling responsible for this as a 
matter of course and rectifying its incorrect attitude. This 
has threatened the future of the exchange of special envoys. 
  We could not but express a deep worry over this and would 
like to express our side's position on today's contact of 
working-level delegates. 
  First, our side considers the four-point demand we have made 
in connection with the prevailing situation to be entirely just 
and has no choice but to insist on the four-point demand again. 
  After suddenly changing its attitude, the South side is now 
crying for a tough reaction [kanggyongdaeung] against its 
dialogue partner and openly babbling that the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise must be resumed, that the plan to introduce 
Patriot missiles must be reexamined, and that international 
sanctions must be imposed on someone else. 
  This is, indeed, an act that destroys [pagoe] the contact of 
working-level delegates for the exchange of special envoys and 
brings our country's situation to a very dangerous touch-and-go 
phase. 
  These acts the South side has committed against its dialogue 
partner graphically show that the South side's remarks at the 
previous contact with us that the issue of discontinuing all 
large- scale nuclear war exercises and abandoning an 
international alliance [kukche kongjo cheje] can be discussed 
during the exchange of special envoys were false. These acts 
also graphically show that its remarks that the situation has 
changed from the time it said that it could not shake hands with 
a partner that has nuclear weapons and its remarks that it has 
decided to withhold the plan to introduce Patriot missiles were 
all deceptive. 
  It would be correct to say that without changing from the 
past, the South side is committing a grave crime by again trying 
to stage nuclear war exercises against its fellow countrymen 
with outside forces, pursuing an international alliance to harm 
its fellow countrymen, entering into confrontation with us, and 
trying to frustrate the exchange of special envoys from the 
preparatory stage. 
  Viewed from this perspective, the fact that in the previous 
rounds of contacts our side asked the South side to express a 
clear attitude toward the four-point demand was very just, and 
we have no choice but to insist on it again. 
  We strongly demand that the South side bear responsibility 
for building artificial obstacles to the contact of 
working-level delegates and make clear its attitude toward our 
side's just four- point demand at today's contact. 
  Second, we cannot but take a serious look at the fact that 
the South side has tried to use the exchange of special envoys 
for other political purposes, taking a dishonest attitude toward 
the working-level delegates contacts. 
  The South side has never come out to the working-level 
delegates contacts with a position of actually realizing the 
envoy exchange. Even most recently, despite of the fact that our 
side took an epochal and magnanimous step on our own initiative 
to advance the working-delegate contacts for the envoy exchange, 
the South side did not answer our magnanimity and goodwill with 
understanding and sincerity. Worse still, the South side 
stubbornly opposed to and disapproved our constructive proposal 
on announcing a joint communique in which the two sides would 
have reaffirmed the will for the envoy exchange and agreed to 
exchange special envoys at the earliest possible date. 
  This is an act lacking common sense that a person with a 
sound mind cannot possibly do and it is an unjust act of 
opposing only for the sake of opposition which only the 
South--used to sticking to its unreasonable insistence--can 
commit. As regards to the duties of special envoys, the South 
knows that the issues on firmly protecting the nation's 
self-independence and promoting the whole nation's great unity 
are keys to promoting North-South relations and realizing the 
country's reunification cause. This notwithstanding, the South 
opposed to fixing these as special envoys' duties. It went so 
far as to aggravate the air surrounding the contact by 
committing an act of finding faults with its dialogue partner. 
  All these clearly tell that the South side attempts to delay 
the working-delegate contacts and abort the envoy exchange by 
playing an insincere show [moyang gachugi] of dialogues. The 
South side with outside forces, under this pretext, intends to 
put a brake on the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  South Korea's insincere attitude toward the envoy exchange 
can only be said to be an anti-national, flunkeyist act of 
giving profits to the outside forces by trampling on the 
interest of fellow countrymen. 
  The South side is now facing the situation under which it 
can 
no longer hide or deny its intention before the people of the 
world that it used the working-delegate contact for envoy 
exchange as a means to deliberately rupture the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
We strongly urge the South side to apologize to the nation, 
frankly admitting that it has abused the working-level contact 
to hinder the DPRK-U.S. talks, fully revealing its dark 
intention. 
  Third, we cannot but take a serious look of the fact that 
the 
South side is bringing the North-South relations to the phase of 
an unpredictable confrontation by trying to hinder the DPRK-U.S. 
talks and abort the exchange of special envoys. 
  The South side, behind the curtain of dialogue, tries to 
stage a large-scale nuclear war exercise against its fellow 
countrymen in collaboration with outside forces. In addition, 
the South side continues to perpetrate acts of antagonizing its 
dialogue partner. 
  The South side is wielding the National Security Law, which 
even the United States is calling for its abolishment, and 
openly brands its dialogue partner as an anti-state group even 
in the courts. It went so far as to block the opposition party 
figures, who wish to meet with us for the country's 
reunification, from paying righteous visits to the North, thus 
agitating confrontation. 
  Confrontation and dialogue can never go together. It is a 
matter of course that confrontation will lead to a collision and 
a collision will escalate to a war [taegyorun chungdorul 
kajyoogimaryonimyo chungdorun chonjaenguro ponjyojigimaryonida]. 
  It is not very difficult to foresee how the situation will 
develop if the South side, in collision with the outside forces, 
attempts to stage the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise; brings 
in modern weapons, including Patriot missiles; and, furthermore, 
joins in the so-called international cooperative system. 
  We will never sit back and watch anybody trying to touch 
off a war on the Korean peninsula. As we have already declared, 
we are fully prepared to answer dialogue with dialogue, and war 
with war. We want to make clear to the South side that we do 
not like empty words and will take all necessary 
countermeasures. All prevailing situations show that realizing 
the envoy exchange totally depends on the South's attitude. We 
think it is high time for the South side to clearly express its 
stance on whether it will accept our justified demands 
concerning the envoy exchange or give it up. We do not have 
much time left and all the fellow countrymen will no longer 
tolerate if the South side further attempts to drag on the envoy 
exchange. We stress for the last time that the South side 
should manifest its stance at today's contact whether it wishes 
to part from us. 
  After the keynote speech, our side called on the South side 
to express a clear attitude at today's contact toward the 
problems that our side has raised without failure. 
  However, the South side repeated inappropriate excuses, 
instead of showing a positive attitude toward our justified 
demands and assertions. Our side repeatedly urged the South 
side not to utter unnecessary words but to give an answer to our 
side's position and clarify whether it would accept our side's 
proposal on the envoy exchange or refuse it. Our side sternly 
said that the South side was free to part with the North, if it 
wished. 
  Our side noted the fact that the South side had held a 
so-called high-level strategic meeting the day before yesterday. 
At the meeting, our side maintained, the South side had adopted 
a so-called policy of tough reaction toward us, and raved that 
it would resume the Team Spirit exercises, push for the plan to 
introduce Patriot missiles, and join in sanctions against us. 
As regards to this, our side pressed the South side hard for an 
answer to whether this is a declaration of refusal of the 
exchange of special envoys, a declaration of all-out 
confrontation and war with the North [tuksagyohwan pogisonon 
uriwaui chonmyondaegyolsonon chonjaengsonon]. 
  Upset by this, the South side said it would present what was 
called an emergency proposal. In the proposal, in connection 
with the fact that no progress has been made at the contact of 
working- level delegates, it urged our side to change its 
attitude and express a sincere attitude toward the following 
points: It urged our side to stop slandering its chief 
executive [choegodanggukcha], refrain from inciting South Korean 
people into antigovernment struggles, and agree to exchange 
special envoys primarily for the resolution of the nuclear issue. 
  In connection with such an attitude of the South side, our 
side pointed out that the working-level contact was not a place 
for making such remarks and asked it to go back and inquire of 
South Korean people about that idea. In this way, our side 
flatly rejected the South side's idea. 
  After that, the head of our side's delegation again urged 
the 
South side to express a clear attitude toward our demand, 
instead of referring to any other issues. He also said that if 
the South intends to part [kyolbyol] with us, it should say so 
clearly. Then, the South side said that the exchange of special 
envoys may be broken up [kkaejiji] if the two sides part with 
each other. 
  Our side said that the South had already broken up the 
exchange of special envoys. It clearly said that the so-called 
high-level strategic meeting, which took place yesterday or the 
day before yesterday, was a meeting to break up the exchange of 
special envoys. 
  Our side said: So, the South side must be held wholly 
responsible for leading the exchange of special envoys to a 
crisis. 
  Very much upset, the South side said that if the exchange of 
special envoys were broken up and if this contact was 
discontinued [kkunojimyon], the danger to be entailed by it is 
unpredictable [oddon wihomi ogedoegennunji alsuopta]. 
  The head of our side's delegation sternly warned the South 
side: Never mind. Do you know what the South side is? If our 
North side suffers damage, do you think South Korea will be safe 
[uri pukchchogi pihaerul tanghamyon namjosonun musahalchul 
annunga]? We are prepared for anything [urinun tajunbidoeo 
itta]. We are prepared both for dialogue and war [urinun 
taehwaedo chonjaengedo tajunbidoeo itta]. If any forces try to 
impose sanctions [cheje] on us and provoke us, we will promptly 
take a resolute self- defensive measure [tanhohan chawijok 
chochi]. We mean what we say. 
  The South side did not utter a word in answer. 
  Since the South side could not answer our proposal, our side 
said today's contact should be closed. 
  Our side concluded the contact, after saying that it would 
come to the next contact if the South side notified it of the 
date when it is willing to accept our proposal.
